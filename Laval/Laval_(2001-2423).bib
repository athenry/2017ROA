Abstract = {{Manganese oxide (MnO) nanoparticles have been suggested as a promising
   ``positive{''} MRI contrast agent for cellular and molecular studies.
   Mn-based contrast agents could enable T-1-weighted quantitative cell
   tracking procedures in vivo based on signal enhancement. In this study,
   ultrasmall MnO particles were synthesized and coated with thiolated
   molecules (DMSA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to allow enhanced cell
   labeling properties and colloidal stability. This coating allowed the
   fabrication of individual ultrasmall nanoparticles of MnO (USPMnO) as
   well as of nanoaggregates of the same material (SPMnO). Particle size
   was measured by TEM and DLS. Physico-chemical properties were
   characterized by XPS and FTIR. The relaxometric properties of these
   aqueous suspensions were measured at various magnetic fields. The
   suspensions provided strong positive contrast enhancement in
   T-1-weighted imaging due to high longitudinal relaxivities (r(1)) and
   low r(2)/r(1) ratios (USPMnO: r(1) = 3.4 +/- 0.1 mM(-1)s(-1), r(2)/r(1)
   = 3.2; SPMnO: r(1) = 17.0 +/- 0.5 mM(-1)s(-1), r(2)/r(1) = 4.0, at
   1.41T). HT-1080 cancer cells incubated with the contrast agents were
   clearly visualized in MRI for Mn contents >1.1 pg Mn/cell. The viability
   of cells was not affected, contrarily to cells labeled with an
   equivalent concentration of Mn2+ ions. A higher signal per cell was
   found for SPMnO-labeled compared with USPMnO-labeled cells, due to the
   higher relaxometric properties of the agglomerates. As a result, the
   ``positive{''} signal enhancement effect is not significantly affected
   upon agglomeration of MnO particles in endosomes. This is a major
   requirement in the development of reliable cell tracking procedures
   using T1-weighted imaging sequences. This study confirms the potential
   of SPMnO and USPMnO to establish more quantitative cell tracking
   procedures with MRI.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to generalize and extend the mathematical
   formalism used with plastic scintillation detectors (PSDs). By doing so,
   we show the feasibility of multi-point PSD. The new formalism is based
   on the sole hypothesis that a PSD optical signal is a linear
   superposition of spectra. Two calibration scenarios were developed. Both
   involve solving a linear equation of the form Y = XB, but the process
   and input data depend on the information available on the detector
   system. Simulations were carried out to validate both scenarios and
   demonstrate the advantages of the new formalism. In this paper, we prove
   the following results. (1) Multi-point PSDs are feasible. Simulations
   have shown that six different spectra could be resolved accurately even
   in the presence of up to 10\% Gaussian noise. (2) The new formalism
   leads to more precise PSD measurements. (3) By using the condition
   number of the measurement matrix, the ideal sets of calibration
   measurements can be identified. (4) By using principal component
   analysis it was possible to identify the best set of wavelength filters.
   We have shown through numerical simulations that multi-point detectors
   are feasible. This has potential for applications such as in vivo dose
   verification. Furthermore, our new formalism can be used to improve the
   robustness and ease of use of PSDs.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to develop a novel multi-point plastic
   scintillation detector (mPSD) capable of measuring the dose accurately
   at multiple positions simultaneously using a single optical transmission
   line. A 2-point mPSD used a band-pass approach that included splitters,
   color filters and an EMCCD camera. The 3-point mPSD was based on a new
   full-spectrum approach, in which a spectrograph was coupled to a CCD
   camera. Irradiations of the mPSDs and of an ion chamber were performed
   with a 6 MV photon beam at various depths and lateral positions in a
   water tank. For the 2-point mPSD, the average relative differences
   between mPSD and ion chamber measurements for the depth-dose were 2.4
   +/- 1.6\% and 1.3 +/- 0.8\% for BCF-60 and BCF-12, respectively. For the
   3-point mPSD, the average relative differences over all conditions were
   2.3 +/- 1.1\%, 1.6 +/- 0.4\% and 0.32 +/- 0.19\% for BCF-60, BCF-12 and
   BCF-10, respectively. This study demonstrates the practical feasibility
   of mPSDs. This type of detector could be very useful for pre-treatment
   quality assurance applications as well as an accurate tool for real-time
   in vivo dosimetry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel way of determining the angular velocity of a
   rigid body from accelerometer measurements. This method finds
   application in crashworthiness and motion analysis in sports, for
   example, where impacts forbid the use of mechanical gyroscopes. Based on
   previous work, the time-integration (TI) and polynomial-roots (PR)
   estimates of the angular velocity are first computed. The TI and PR
   estimates are then linearly combined through a weighted sum whose
   weighting factor is chosen so as to minimize the `variance of the
   resulting estimate. The proposed method is illustrated in an experiment,
   where the twelve accelerometer array (OCTA) is moved manually. A
   comparison of the angular-velocity estimates obtained from the proposed
   method and those obtained from a magnetic displacement sensor shows that
   the resulting estimates are robust and do not suffer from the drift
   problems that hinder the TI method. Moreover, comparison with a
   previously reported method indicates that the method proposed here is
   less sensitive to measurement errors, especially at low angular
   velocities. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006364]}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to investigate the potential of diminishing

   heating, cooling and lighting by using smart windows. The windows
   considered consisted of a double pane glazing unit in which a
   controllable absorbing layer is added on the interior surface of the
   exterior glass pane. This absorbing layer allows to change the optical
   properties of the window, resulting in a direct potential of control of
   the incident solar heat flux entering the building through the windows.
   A corresponding numerical model is developed showing that optimizing the
   solar heat flux absorption rate of the absorbing layer in regard of the
   necessary heating, cooling and lighting needs helps reducing
   significantly the total yearly energy consumption, and cooling peak
   loads. The simulations were done considering a building located in

Abstract = {{The biobaler is a novel approach to cut woody crops up to 150-mm basal
   diameter and compress the biomass into round bales. It can be used to
   harvest short-rotation woody crop plantations such as willow or hybrid
   poplar It can also be used to clear wild brush, forest understory, and
   encroaching small trees to improve land management. A commercial version
   of the biobaler was evaluated for the latter purpose, i.e., to harvest
   natural shrubs in various environments in central Canada (at three sites
   in Quebec and two sites in Ontario) and in mid-western United States (at
   seven sites in Minnesota). More than 250 bales were harvested and
   monitored on natural stands in 2009 and 2010 to gain information on
   machinery management under wide-ranging conditions of crop species,
   density, and soil conditions. The harvest rate ranged from 2 to 26
   bales/h (average of 14 bales/h). Bale mass averaged 477 kg at 46\%
   moisture content {[}260 kg dry mass (DM)/bale at a density of 166 kg
   DM/m(3)]. Diesel fuel consumption averaged 8.5 L/t DM Harvesting cost
   with the biobaler was estimated at \$33/t DM in high yield with rapid
   harvest (20 bale/h) and \$64/t DM at low capacity (10 bales/h) which can
   be caused by lower yield or poor traction. The information will be
   helpful to evaluate the cost of environmental management of natural
   stands covered with brush and the potential biomass that may be
   recovered}},

   Estimating carbon inputs to soil in forage-based crop rotations and

   field experiment. Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 821-833. There is a need to
   improve the understanding of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics for
   forage-based rotations. A key requisite is accurate estimates of the
   below-ground (BG) C inputs to soil. We used the Introductory Carbon
   Balance Model (ICBM) to investigate the effects of C input assumptions
   on C balances with data from a 52-yr field experiment in northern
   Sweden. The main objective was to validate an approach for estimating
   annual crop residue C inputs to soil using the data from a continuous
   forage-based rotation (A). A rotation with only annual crops and more
   frequent tillage events (D) was used to obtain a rough estimate of the
   effect of tillage on SOC dynamics. The methodology used to estimate
   annual crop residue C inputs to soil gave a good fit to data from four
   out of the six large plots for rotation A. The approximate effects of
   more frequent tillage in rotation D increased SOC decomposition rate by
   about 20\%. These results allow us to have more confidence in predicting
   SOC balances for forage-based crop rotations. Root biomass measurements
   used for calculating BG C inputs were also reviewed, and we show that
   they have not changed significantly during the past 150 yr.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a rapid, inexpensive,
   and accurate analysis technique for a wide variety of materials, and it
   is increasingly used in soil science. The objectives of our study were
   to examine the potential of NIRS to predict (i) soil P extracted by two
   methods {[}Mehlich 3 (M3P) and water (Cp)1, soil total P (TP), annual
   crop P-uptake, and annual P-budget, and (ii) other soil chemical
   properties {[}total C (TC), total N (TN), pH, and K, Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn,
   Cu, and Zn extracted by Mehlich 3]. Soil samples (n = 448) were taken
   over a 7-yr period from an experimental site in Levis (Quebec, Canada)
   where timothy (Phleum pratense L.) was grown under four combinations of
   P and N fertilizer. The NIRS equations were developed using 80\% of the
   samples for calibration and 20\% for validation. The predictive ability
   of NIRS was evaluated using the coefficient of determination of
   validation (12,2) and the ratio of standard error of prediction to
   standard deviation (RPD). Results show that M3P, Cp, crop annual
   P-uptake, and annual P-budget were not accurately predicted by NIRS
   (R-v(2) < 0.70 and RPD < 1.75). Similar results were found for K and Cu.
   However, NIRS predictions were moderately useful for TP, TN, Fe, and Zn
   (0.70 <= R-v(2) < 0.80 and 1.75 <= RPD < 2.25), moderately successful
   for TC and Al (0.80 <= R-v(2) < 0.90 and 2.25 <= RPD < 3.00), successful
   for pH and Mg (0.90 <= R-v(2) <=. 0.95 and 3.00 <= RPD <= 4.00), and
   excellent for Ca and Mn (R-v(2) > 0.95 and RPD > 4.00). The NIRS
   predictive ability of several soil properties appears to be related to
   their relationship with soil organic C. Although NIRS can predict
   several soil properties, prediction of total P was the only soil
   P-related property, correlated to soil C, that was moderately useful.}},

Title = {{Discrepancies between the {[}OIII] and {[}SIII] temperatures in HII

Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{547}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context. Analysis of published {[}OIII] and {[}SIII] temperatures
   measurements of emission line objects consisting of HII galaxies, giant
   extragalactic HII regions, Galactic HII regions, and HII regions from
   the Magellanic Clouds reveal that the {[}OIII] temperatures are higher
   than the corresponding values from {[}SIII] in most objects with gas
   metallicities in excess of 0.2 solar. For the coolest nebulae (the
   highest metallicities), the {[}OIII] temperature excess can reach
   similar to 3000K.
   Aims. We look for an explanation for these temperature differences and
   explore the parameter space of models with the aim of reproducing the
   observed trend of T-OIII > T-S III in HII regions with temperatures
   below 14 000 K.
   Methods. Using standard photoionization models, we varied the ionization
   parameter, the hardness of the ionizing continuum, and the gas
   metallicities in order to characterize how models behave with respect to
   the observations. We introduced temperature inhomogeneities and varied
   their mean squared amplitude t(2). We explored the possibility of
   inhomogeneities in abundances by combining two models of widely
   different metallicity. We calculated models that consider the
   possibility of a non-Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution (a
   kappa-distribution) for the electron energies. We also considered shock
   heating within the photoionized nebula.
   Results. Simple photoionization calculations yield nearly equal {[}OIII]
   and {[}SIII] temperatures in the domain of interest. Hence these models
   fail to reproduce the {[}OIII] temperature excess. Models that consider
   temperature inhomogeneities, as measured by the mean squared amplitude
   t(2), also fail in the regime where T-OIII < 14 000 K. Three options
   remain that can reproduce the observed excess in T-OIII temperatures:
   (1) large metallicity inhomogeneities in the nebula; a (2)
   kappa-distribution for the electron energies; and (3) shock waves that
   propagate in the photoionized plasma at velocities similar to 60 km
   s(-1).
   Conclusions. The observed nebular temperatures are not reproduced by
   varying the input parameters in the pure photoionization case nor by
   assuming local temperature inhomogeneities. We find that (1) metallicity
   inhomogeneities of the nebular gas; (2) shock waves of velocities less
   than or similar to 60 km s(-1) propagating in a photoionized plasma; and
   (3) an electron energy distribution given by a kappa-distribution are
   successful in reproducing the observed excess in the {[}OIII]
   temperatures. However, shock models require proper 3D hydrodynamical
   simulations to become a fully developed alternative while models with
   metallicity inhomogeneities appear to fail in metal-poor nebulae, since
   they result in T-rec(O++) greater than or similar to T-OIII.}},

Abstract = {{OCDMA is a promising candidate for next generation passive optical
   networks (NG-PON). OCDMA-PON can potentially provide all customers with
   a Gb/s-class BW upstream with inherent flexibility. Unfortunately OCDMA
   suffers from multiple access interference (MAI) and various detection
   noises. To mitigate MAI, we propose a novel parallel interference
   cancellation technique for incoherent DS-OCDMA that better exploits the
   non-negativity of the solution. The proposed PIC scheme incorporates
   this additional information into its structure. The proposed PIC
   detector is shown to outperform the conventional correlator detector,
   the decorrelator detector, the linear parallel interference Cancellation
   (LPIC) detector and even the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
   detector.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To characterize the interfractional variability in lung tumor
   volume, position, and tumor boundaries.
   Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were acquired weekly
   during the course of treatment for 34 lung cancer patients (1-20 scans)
   with large tumors. Spatial registration based on bones was performed
   between contoured planning CT and CBCT. Gross tumor volume (GTV) on each
   CBCT was then contoured. Tumor volume, centroid, and boundaries
   variability were quantified. A commercial deformable registration
   software was tested and results were compared to manual contours.
   Results: Mean volume reduction was 41 +/- 32\% (p < 0.001) after an
   average time of 51 days. Tumor centroid drifts were 0.03, 0.14, and
   -0.13 cm in right-left (RL), anterior-posterior (AP), and
   superior-inferior (SI) directions with standard deviations of 0.55,
   0.50, and 0.51 cm. GTV boundaries displacements were -0.27, -0.14, and
   -0.16 cm with standard deviations of 0.64, 0.57, and 0.59 cm in RL, AP,
   and SI directions. Relative error between deformed and manual contours
   with the commercial deformable registration software rose up
   exponentially with the GTV decrease.
   Conclusions: GTV size changes for large lung tumors are similar to those
   for standard tumors. Magnitude absolute values of displacement vector
   for centroid and boundaries shifts show that there is not a preferred
   direction for the drifts but shrinkage. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{None of the replacements proposed in the literature for small-calibre
   blood vessels (SCBV) fully satisfies the stringent requirements that

   SCBV graft with physiologically relevant compliance and burst pressure
   and optimal cytocompatibility. The hybridization of the two polymers
   results in the formation of a nanofibrillar hydrated matrix, where the
   collagen gel enhances the mechanical properties of the SF tubular
   construct and improves the early response of the material to in vitro
   cell adhesion and proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Policy-making in public health has great socio-economical consequences
   and must be done using the best available knowledge on the possible
   options. These processes are often too complex to be evaluated through
   analytical methods, such that computer simulations are often the best
   way to produce quantitative evaluations of their performances. For that
   purpose, we are proposing a complete software infrastructure for the
   simulation of public health processes. This software stack includes a
   generic population-based simulator called SynCHroNous Agent-and
   Population-based Simulator, which has a modern object-oriented software
   architecture, and is completely configured through eXtensible Markup
   Language files. These configuration files can themselves be produced by
   a graphical user interface that allows modeling of public health
   simulation by nonprogrammers. This software infrastructure has been
   illustrated with the real-life case study of osteoporosis prevention in
   adult women populations. This example, which is of great interest for
   Quebec health decision makers, provides insightful results for comparing
   several prevention strategies on a realistic population.}},

Abstract = {{The baked anode quality control strategy currently used by most carbon
   plants based on testing anode core samples in the laboratory is
   inadequate for facing increased raw material variability. The low core
   sampling rate limited by lab capacity and the common practice of
   reporting averaged properties based on some anode population mask a
   significant amount of individual anode variability. In addition, lab
   results are typically available a few weeks after production and the
   anodes are often already set in the reduction cells preventing early
   remedial actions when necessary. A database approach is proposed in this
   work to develop a soft-sensor for predicting individual baked anode
   properties at the end of baking cycle. A large historical database
   including raw material properties, process operating parameters and
   anode core data was collected from a modern Alcoa plant. A multivariate
   latent variable PLS regression method was used for analyzing the large
   database and building the soft-sensor model. It is shown that the
   general low frequency trends in most anode physical and mechanical
   properties driven by raw material changes are very well captured by the
   model. Improvements in the data infrastructure (instrumentation,
   sampling frequency and location) will be necessary for predicting higher
   frequency variations in individual baked anode properties. This paper
   also demonstrates how multivariate latent variable models can be
   interpreted against process knowledge and used for real-time process
   monitoring of carbon plants, and detection of faults and abnormal
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present project was the purification of brown
   flaxseed meal from coloring pigments in order to improve its potential
   use as ingredient in food formulations. Thus, this work was aimed to
   study the bleaching of non-defatted brown flaxseed meal in dilute
   hydrogen peroxide solutions. Bleaching was evaluated according to the
   Hunter L, (a), and (b) color scale as function of the hydrogen peroxide
   concentration (1\%, 2\%, and 3\% v/v), the meal concentration (2.5\%,
   5\%, and 10\% w/w), the bleaching time (10, 20, and 30 min), and the pH
   (3, 7, and 9). Effect of all the independent variables was significant.
   The L value was the most significantly affected parameter and increased
   as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased, but decreased as
   the concentration of flaxseed meal increased. The L value was observed
   to be higher at pH 9 than at pH 3 and 7. The b value, which represents
   the yellowness, was significantly increased from 18.70 +/- 0.01 (control
   sample) to 35.45 +/- 0.04 after the meal was treated with a 3\% hydrogen
   peroxide solution at pH 9. Total phenolics content significantly
   decreased when the meal was treated with 3\% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide
   solution. This concentration yielded the higher L color value (highly
   bleached meal).}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of distributed execution of computationally intensive
   applications (jobs) largely depends on the quality of the applied
   scheduling approach. However, most of the existing non-trivial
   scheduling algorithms rely on prior knowledge or on prediction of
   application parameters, such as execution time, size of input and
   output, dependencies, etc., to assign applications to the available
   computational resources. A major issue is that these parameters are hard
   to determine in advance, especially if the end user does not possess an
   extensive history of previous application runs.
   In this work we propose an online method for execution time prediction
   of applications, for which execution progress can be collected at
   run-time. Using dynamic progress information, the total job execution
   time can be predicted using extrapolation. However, the predictions
   achieved by extrapolation are far from precise and often vary over time
   as a result of changing application dynamics and varying resource load.
   Therefore, to compute the actual job execution time we match a number of
   predefined prediction evolution models against the consecutive
   extrapolations, by adopting nonlinear curve-fitting. The ``best-fit{''}
   coefficients allow for more accurate execution time prediction.
   The predictions made are used to enhance a dynamic scheduling algorithm
   for workflows introduced in our earlier work. The scheduling algorithm
   is run with and without curve-fitting, showing a performance improvement
   of up to 15\% in the former case.}},

Abstract = {{New tools are being developed to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). There is a trend to move from
   empirical factors to simple comprehensive and more complex process-based
   models. Thus, the main objective of this study is to demonstrate the
   importance of using process-based dynamic models to better evaluate GHG
   emissions. This is tackled by defining a virtual case study based on the
   whole plant Benchmark Simulation Model Platform No. 2 (BSM2) and
   estimating GHG emissions using two approaches: (1) a combination of
   simple comprehensive models based on empirical assumptions and (2) a
   more sophisticated approach, which describes the mechanistic production
   of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the biological reactor (ASMN) and the
   generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the Anaerobic
   Digestion Model 1 (ADM1). Models already presented in literature are
   used, but modifications compared to the previously published ASMN model
   have been made. Also model interfaces between the ASMN and the ADM1
   models have been developed. The results show that the use of the
   different approaches leads to significant differences in the N2O
   emissions (a factor of 3) but not in the CH4 emissions (about 4\%).
   Estimations of GHG emissions are also compared for steady-state and
   dynamic simulations. Averaged values for GHG emissions obtained with
   steady-state and dynamic simulations are rather similar. However, when
   looking at the dynamics of N2O emissions, large variability
   (36?ton?CO2e?day-1) is observed due to changes in the influent
   wastewater C/N ratio and temperature which would not be captured by a
   steady-state analysis (4.4?ton?CO2e?day-1). Finally, this study also
   shows the effect of changing the anaerobic digestion volume on the total
   GHG emissions. Decreasing the anaerobic digester volume resulted in a
   slight reduction in CH4 emissions (about 5\%), but significantly
   decreased N2O emissions in the water line (by 14\%). Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Abstract = {{The organization of different nano objects with tunable sizes,
   morphologies, and functions into integrated nanostructures is critical
   to the development of novel nanosystems that display high performances
   in sensing, catalysis, and so on. Herein, using acetylacetone as a
   chelating agent, phenolic resol as a carbon source, metal nitrates as
   metal sources, and amphiphilic copolymers as a template, we demonstrate
   a chelate-assisted multicomponent coassembly method to synthesize
   ordered mesoporous carbon with uniform metal-containing nanoparticles.
   The obtained nano-composites have a 2-D hexagonally arranged pore
   structure, uniform pore size (similar to 4.0 nm), high surface area
   (similar to 500 m(3)/g), moderate pore volume (similar to 0.30 cm(3)/g),
   uniform and highly dispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles, and constant Fe2O3
   contents around 10 wt \%. By adjusting acetylacetone amount, the size of
   Fe2O3 nanoparticles is readily tunable from 8.3 to 22.1 nm. More
   importantly, it is found that the metal-containing nanoparticles are
   partially embedded in the carbon framework with the remaining part
   exposed in the mesopore channels. This unique semiexposure structure not
   only provides an excellent confinement effect and exposed surface for
   catalysis but also helps to tightly trap the nanoparticles and prevent
   aggregating during catalysis. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis results show
   that as the size of iron nanoparticles decreases, the mesoporous
   Fe-carbon nanocomposites exhibit significantly improved catalytic
   performances with C5+ selectivity up to 68\%, much better than any
   reported promoter-free Fe-based catalysts due to the unique semiexposure
   morphology of metal-containing nanoparticles confined in the mesoporous
   carbon matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Corrugated walls were installed in narrow gas-solid bubbling fluidized
   bed (CWBFB) enclosures to reduce bubble sizes, improve gas distribution
   and offer stable operation. Thorough analyses of bed expansion in flat-
   (FWBFB) and corrugated-wall bubbling fluidized beds were performed for a
   variety of wall declinations and operating conditions covering a range
   of corrugation angles, inter-wall clearances (C), initial rest bed
   heights (H-i) and ratios of gas superficial velocity to minimum bubbling
   velocity, U-g/U-mb. Bed expansion was discriminated in terms of
   expansion bed height ratio (H-f/H-i) and transport disengagement height
   (TDH). A digital image analysis technique was employed to compare the
   behaviors of time-averaged H-f/H-i and TDH in FWBFB and CWBFB. For a
   given U-g/U-mb, the former was barely affected by wall patterning
   whereas the latter underwent appreciable reduction in CWBFB compared to
   FWBFB. Regardless of wall shape, both H-f/H-i and TDH increased with
   increasing U-g/U-mb and C and with decreasing H-i. Full 3-D transient
   Euler-Euler CFD simulations with kinetic theory of granular flow
   employed to simulate the solids volume fraction and granular temperature
   in FWBFB and CWBFB reached qualitative agreements with experimental

Abstract = {{One of the major drawbacks of aqueous alkanolamine based CO2 capture
   processes is the requirement of significantly higher energy of
   regeneration. This weakness can be overcome by separating the
   CO2-captured product to regenerate the corresponding amine, thus
   avoiding the consumption of redundant energy. Replacing aqueous phase
   with more stable and practically nonvolatile imidazolium based
   room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) provided a viable approach for
   carbamate to crystallize out as supernatant solid. In the present study,
   regeneration capabilities of solid carbamates have been investigated.
   Diethanolamine (DEA) carbamate as well as 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol
   (AMP) carbarnate were obtained in crystalline form by bubbling CO2 in
   alkanolamine-RTIL mixtures. Hydrophobic RTIL,
   1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   ({[}hmim]{[}Tf2N]), was used as aqueous phase substituent. Thermal
   behavior of the carbamates was observed by differential scanning
   calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, while the possible
   regeneration mechanism has been proposed through C-13 NMR and FTIR
   analyses. The results showed that decomposition of DEA-carbamate
   commenced at lower temperature (similar to 55 degrees C), compared to
   that of AMP-carbamate (similar to 75 degrees C); thus promising easy
   regeneration. The separation of carbamate as solid phase can offer
   two-way advantage by letting less volume to regenerate as well as by
   narrowing the gap between CO2 capture and amine regeneration
   temperatures.}},

Title = {{Layered mass geometry: a novel technique to overlay seeds and
   applicators onto patient geometry in Geant4 brachytherapy simulations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{19}},

Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{A problem faced by all Monte Carlo (MC) particle transport codes is how
   to handle overlapping geometries. The Geant4 MC toolkit allows the user
   to create parallel geometries within a single application. In Geant4 the
   standard mass-containing geometry is defined in a simulation volume
   called the World Volume. Separate parallel geometries can be defined in
   parallel worlds, that is, alternate three dimensional simulation volumes
   that share the same coordinate system with the World Volume for
   geometrical event biasing, scoring of radiation interactions, and/or the
   creation of hits in detailed readout structures. Until recently, only
   one of those worlds could contain mass so these parallel worlds provided
   no solution to simplify a complex geometric overlay issue in
   brachytherapy, namely the overlap of radiation sources and applicators
   with a CT based patient geometry. The standard method to handle seed and
   applicator overlay in MC requires removing CT voxels whose boundaries
   would intersect sources, placing the sources into the resulting void and
   then backfilling the remaining space of the void with a relevant
   material. The backfilling process may degrade the accuracy of patient
   representation, and the geometrical complexity of the technique
   precludes using fast and memory-efficient coding techniques that have
   been developed for regular voxel geometries. The patient must be
   represented by the less memory and CPU-efficient Geant4 voxel placement
   technique, G4PVPlacement, rather than the more efficient
   G4NestedParameterization (G4NestedParam). We introduce for the first
   time a Geant4 feature developed to solve this issue: Layered Mass
   Geometry (LMG) whereby both the standard (CT based patient geometry) and
   the parallel world (seeds and applicators) may now have mass. For any
   area where mass is present in the parallel world, the parallel mass is
   used. Elsewhere, the mass of the standard world is used. With LMG the
   user no longer needs to remove patient CT voxels that would include for
   example seeds. The patient representation can be a regular voxel grid,
   conducive to G4NestedParam, and the patient CT derived materials remain
   exact, avoiding the inaccuracy of the backfilling technique.
   Post-implant dosimetry for one patient with I-125 permanent seed implant
   was performed using Geant4 version 9.5.p01 using three different
   geometrical techniques. The first technique was the standard described
   above (G4PVPlacement). The second technique placed patient voxels as
   before, but placed seeds with LMG(G4PVPlacement+LMG). The third
   technique placed patient voxels through G4NestedParam and seeds through
   LMG (G4NestedParam+LMG). All the scenarios were calculated with 3
   different image compression factors to manipulate the number of voxels.
   Additionally, the dosimetric impact of the backfilling technique was
   investigated for the case of calcifications in close proximity of
   sources. LMG eliminated the need for backfilling and simplified geometry
   description. Of the two LMG techniques, G4PVPlacement+LMG had no benefit
   to calculation time or memory use, actually increasing calculation time,
   but G4NestedParam+LMG reduced both calculation time and memory. The
   benefits of G4NestedParam+LMG over standard G4PVPlacement increased with
   increasing voxel numbers. For the case of calcifications in close
   proximity to sources, LMG not only increased efficiency but also yielded
   more accurate dose calculation than G4PVPlacement. G4NestedParam in
   combination with LMGpresent a new, efficient approach to simulate
   radiation sources that overlap patient geometry.
   Cases with brachytherapy applicators would constitute a direct extension
   of the method.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, studies have shown that 3D list-mode
   ordered-subset expectation-maximization (LM-OSEM) algorithms for
   positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction could be effectively
   computed and considerably accelerated by graphics processing unit (GPU)
   devices. However, most of these studies rely on pre-calculated
   sensitivity matrices. In many cases, the time required to compute this
   matrix can be longer than the reconstruction time itself. In fact, the
   relatively long time required for the calculation of the
   patient-specific sensitivity matrix is considered as one of the main
   obstacle in introducing a list-mode PET reconstruction algorithm for
   routine clinical use. The objective of this work is to accelerate a
   fully 3D LM-OSEM algorithm, including the calculation of the sensitivity
   matrix that accounts for the patient-specific attenuation and
   normalization corrections. For this purpose, sensitivity matrix
   calculations and list-mode OSEM reconstructions were implemented on
   GPUs, using the geometry of a commercial PET system. The system matrices
   were built on-the-fly by using an approach with multiple rays per
   detector pair. The reconstructions were performed for a volume of
   188x188x57 voxels of 2x2x3.15 mm(3) and for another volume of 144x144x57
   voxels of 4x4x3.15 mm(3). The time to compute the sensitivity matrix for
   the 188x188x57 array was 9 s while the LM-OSEM algorithm performed at a
   rate of 1.1 millions of events per second. For the 144x144x57 array, the
   respective numbers are 8 s for the sensitivity matrix and 0.8 million of
   events per second for the LM-OSEM step. This work lets envision fast
   reconstructions for advanced PET applications such as real time dynamic
   studies and parametric image reconstructions.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of the degradation of the optical and electrical
   properties of high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) used for general
   lighting applications. The study was conducted by submitting the LEDs to
   different current and temperature stress conditions. Those conditions
   are based on typical operating conditions that can be encountered on
   LED-based luminaires for general lighting. LEDs were stressed under four
   different operating currents, and two of those were stressed at two
   junction temperatures, controlled with a thermoelectric cooler. Results
   described in this paper indicate that the lumen droop due to an increase
   in nonradiative recombination is correlated with the stress conditions
   in accordance with the literature. However, the LED samples showed a
   forward-voltage droop which seems to be independent of the stresses. For
   all the stress conditions, the LED forward voltages decreased by about
   1\% after 1000 h of stress time. A link between forward voltage and
   lumen output was made through LED efficiency. Also, the yellow peak/blue
   peak ratio was measured and showed an increase after 1000 to 1200 h.
   This is attributed to LED chip degradation. These observations suggest
   the use of both current and voltage control to optimize the use of LEDs
   in general lighting. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Title = {{Lactulose synthesis by electro-isomerization of lactose: Effect of
   lactose concentration and electric current density}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE \& EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, electro-isomerization of lactose into lactulose has
   been studied. Effect of lactose concentration (5 and 10\%) and applied
   DC-electric field (100 and 200 mA) on the electro-isomerization of
   lactose into lactulose and on process efficiency was investigated. Total
   cathode area of 21.5 cm(2) was used; giving electric current density of
   4.65 mA/cm(2) and 930 mA/cm(2), respectively. Milk whey permeate (4.7
   +/- 0.15\% lactose) obtained by ultrafiltration was also used as feed
   solution in the electro-activation reactor. Effect of the processing
   time on lactose electro-isomerization rate (lactulose formation yield),
   by-product (glucose, galactose, epilactose and fructose) formation and
   global electric resistance of the electro-activation reactor has been
   investigated. The process was run during 60 min and samples were taken
   every 10 min. The obtained results showed the high effectiveness of the
   developed electro-activation technology to convert lactose into
   lactulose. After 60 min electro-activation at ambient temperature (23
   +/- 1 degrees C), 25\% electro-isomerisation yield was obtained. By
   excluding lactose, the end product purity was 96.28 +/- 0.18\%, which is
   similar to the pharmakopoeia requirements for lactulose powder.
   Moreover, no epilactose was formed. Not systematically, galactose was
   detected in some samples (<1.5\%) and only some traces of fructose were
   detected (<0.31\%). The global electric resistance of the
   electro-activation reactor decreased as the electro-activation time was
   increased indicating the high energetic effectiveness of this new
   electro-isomerization technology.
   Industrial Relevance: From industrial application, electro-activation
   can be successfully used as reagentless technology to self-generate high
   alkalinity of the reaction medium for lactose isomerization into
   lactulose. By this way, important energetic savings can be made. (C)

Abstract = {{The goal of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a
   plastic scintillation detector (PSD) incorporated into a prostate
   immobilization device to verify doses in vivo delivered during
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric
   modulated-arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer. The treatment plans
   for both modalities had been developed for a patient undergoing prostate
   radiation therapy. First, a study was performed to test the dependence,
   if any, of PSD accuracy on the number and type of calibration
   conditions. This study included PSD measurements of each treatment plan
   being delivered under quality assurance (QA) conditions using a rigid QA
   phantom. PSD results obtained under these conditions were compared to
   ionization chamber measurements. After an optimal set of calibration
   factors had been found, the PSD was combined with a commercial
   endorectal balloon used for rectal distension and prostate
   immobilization during external beam radiotherapy. This PSD-enhanced
   endorectal balloon was placed inside of a deformable anthropomorphic
   phantom designed to simulate male pelvic anatomy. PSD results obtained
   under these so-called ``simulated treatment conditions{''} were compared
   to doses calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). With the PSD
   still inserted in the pelvic phantom, each plan was delivered once again
   after applying a shift of 1 cm anterior to the original isocenter to
   simulate a treatment setup error.
   The mean total accumulated dose measured using the PSD differed the
   TPS-calculated doses by less than 1\% for both treatment modalities
   simulated treatment conditions using the pelvic phantom. When the
   isocenter was shifted, the PSD results differed from the TPS
   calculations of mean dose by 1.2\% (for IMRT) and 10.1\% (for VMAT); in
   both cases, the doses were within the dose range calculated over the
   detector volume for these regions of steep dose gradient. Our results
   suggest that the system could benefit prostate cancer patient treatment
   by providing accurate in vivo dose reports during treatment and verify
   in real-time whether treatments are being delivered according to the
   prescribed plan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transport phenomena in multiphase reactors are poorly understood and
   first-principles modeling approaches have hitherto met with limited
   success. Industry continues thus far to depend heavily on engineering
   correlations for variables like pressure drop, transport coefficients
   and wetting efficiencies. While immensely useful, engineering
   correlations typically have wide variations in their predictive
   capability when venturing outside their instructed domain, and hence
   universally applicable correlations are rare. In this contribution, we
   present a machine learning approach for modeling such multiphase
   systems, specifically using the Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   algorithm. An application of trickle bed reactors is considered wherein
   key design variables for which numerous correlations exist in the
   literature (with a large variation in their predictions), are all
   correlated using the SVR approach with remarkable accuracy of prediction
   for all the different literature data sets with wide-ranging databanks.

Abstract = {{This paper describes an optical setup built to record Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) absorption spectra in an atmospheric pressure plasma
   with a spatial resolution of 2 mm. The overall system consisted of three
   basic parts: (1) optical components located within the FTIR sample
   compartment, making it possible to define the size of the infrared beam
   (2 mm x 2 mm over a path length of 50 mm) imaged at the site of the
   plasma by (2) an optical interface positioned between the spectrometer
   and the plasma reactor. Once through the plasma region, (3) a
   retro-reflector module, located behind the plasma reactor, redirected
   the infrared beam coincident to the incident path up to a 45.
   beamsplitter to reflect the beam toward a narrow-band
   mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. The antireflective plasma-coating
   experiments performed with ammonia and silane demonstrated that it was
   possible to quantify 42 and 2 ppm of these species in argon,
   respectively. In the case of ammonia, this was approximately three times
   less than this gas concentration typically used in plasma coating
   experiments while the silane limit of quantification was 35 times lower.
   Moreover, 70\% of the incoming infrared radiation was focused within a 2
   mm width at the site of the plasma, in reasonable agreement with the
   expected spatial resolution. The possibility of reaching this spatial
   resolution thus enabled us to measure the gaseous precursor consumption
   as a function of their residence time in the plasma. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{The Corvet Est gold deposit is hosted by Archean rocks of the Superior
   Province in the James Bay region, northern Quebec, Canada. The Marco
   zone is hosted by amphibolite-grade, strongly foliated volcanic rocks
   and consists of disseminated gold, with an apparent thickness ranging
   from 1.8 to 39.5 m and gold grades up to 23 g.t(-1) over 1 m, that is
   continuous along strike for similar to 1.3 km. The lithotectonic
   sequence comprises footwall basaltic andesite amphibolite overlain by a
   lenticular unit of metadacite and then by hanging-wall basaltic andesite
   amphibolite, all intruded by quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes. Dacite,
   basaltic andesite amphibolite, and quartz-feldspar porphyry show a
   calc-alkaline to transitional affinity and plot in the plate margin arc
   basalt field, with typical volcanic arc trace element patterns.
   Mineralization consists of pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite,
   chalcopyrite, and gold, disseminated in deformed dacite, in andesite
   amphibolite, and in quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes. Dacite and andesite
   display weak alteration characterized by silicification. Native gold
   forms inclusions in metamorphic quartz, garnet, feldspar, arsenopyrite,
   and pyrite or free grains interstitial to quartz, feldspar, pyrite,
   chalcopyrite, and arsenopyrite. Free gold in late quartz veins cut the
   sericitized metamorphic fabric. Inclusion and interstitial native gold
   within minerals annealed during metamorphism shows that gold
   mineralization is pre- to syn-metamorphic, with some gold remobilized in
   later veins. Rhenium-osmium dating of arsenopyrite yields an isochron
   age of 2663 +/- 13 Ma for mineralization and a weighted average model
   age of 2632 +/- 7 Ma for arsenopyrite formed during peak metamorphism.
   The similar to 2663 Ma arsenopyrite has a low initial Os-187/Os-188 of
   0.19 +/- 0.10, suggesting a juvenile crust or a mantle Os source. The
   sulfur isotope composition of Marco zone pyrite and arsenopyrite shows
   that sulfur could have been leached from its volcanic host rocks or from
   reduction of Archean seawater. The Corvet Est deposit is interpreted to
   be an orogenic gold deposit (2663 Ma) deformed and recrystallized during
   amphibolite-grade metamorphism (2632 Ma).}},

Abstract = {{A multiphase CFD code was investigated to promote the design and
   optimization of existent environmental technologies on the
   decontamination of aqueous streams. First, our case study encompassed
   the development of the CFD framework to be examined systematically on
   the prediction of the dynamic behaviour of a pilot trickle-bed reactor
   (TBR). As long as trickle-bed reactors are determined by the flow
   environment coupled with chemical kinetics, following the optimization
   of prominent numerical solution parameters, the theoretical model was
   validated with experimental data taken from a TBR specifically designed
   for the catalytic wet oxidation of phenolic wastewaters. Second, several
   computational runs were carried out at unsteady-state operation to
   evaluate the dynamic performance addressing the total organic carbon
   concentration and temperature profiles. CFD computations of total
   organic carbon conversion were found to agree better with experimental
   data at lower temperatures. Additionally, the inhomogeneous distribution
   of gas-liquid was identified through the computational mappings
   representative of interstitial multiphase flow. The heterogeneous
   behaviour of liquid phase spatial distribution may be attributed to the
   local effects near the catalyst particle surface. Finally, gas-liquid
   channels were associated with different local liquid-catalyst contacting
   profiles, which indeed affected the organic matter decontamination rates
   and temperature mappings within the trickle-bed reactor. (C) 2012 The

Title = {{Improving vertical GPS precision with a GPS-over-fiber architecture and
   real-time relative delay calibration}},
Journal = {{GPS SOLUTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{449-462}},

Abstract = {{A limitation of GPS positioning is that the vertical component is
   generally two to three times less precise than the horizontal
   components. In a previous work by R. Santerre of Laval University and G.
   Beutler of University of Bern, it was shown in simulations that it is
   possible to improve the GPS vertical positioning precision by using a
   multi-antenna GPS receiver and a precise calibration technique of the
   relative hardware delay between the antennas and the receiver. However,
   no actual implementation of the system was done to prove the concept
   until now. A new multi-antenna, GPS-over-fiber architecture with
   real-time delay monitoring, designed and implemented to improve the
   vertical precision is presented. The improvement in vertical precision
   arises from the elimination of the relative receiver clock error in
   single difference, between antennas, and the precision real-time
   calibration of the relative hardware delay. Experiments were conducted
   with a zero baseline and a short baseline configuration. The results
   show, as expected by the theory and the simulations, a two to three
   times improvement in the precision of the vertical component such that
   it reached the same level of performance as the horizontal components.
   These promising results will enable the use of this type of
   configuration in several applications where the same precision in all 3D
   components is essential and could not be achieved before with standard
   GPS positioning techniques.}},

Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a ring-like cluster complex in the starburst
   galaxy NGC?2146. The Ruby Ring, so named due to its appearance, shows a
   clear ring-like distribution of star clusters around a central object.
   It is located in one of the tidal streams that surround the galaxy.
   NGC?2146 is part of the Snapshot Hubble U-band Cluster Survey (SHUCS).
   The WFC3/F336W data have added critical information to the available
   archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging set of NGC?2146, allowing us to
   determine ages, masses and extinctions of the clusters in the Ruby Ring.
   These properties have then been used to investigate the formation of
   this extraordinary system. We find evidence of a spatial and temporal
   correlation between the central cluster and the clusters in the ring.
   The latter are about 4?Myr younger than the central cluster, which has
   an age of 7?Myr. This result is supported by the Ha emission which is
   strongly coincident with the ring, and weaker at the position of the
   central cluster. From the derived total Ha luminosity of the system, we
   constrain the star formation rate density to be quite high (SSFR =
   0.47?M??yr-1?kpc-2). The Ruby Ring is the product of an intense and
   localized burst of star formation, similar to the extended cluster
   complexes observed in M?51 and the Antennae, but more impressive because
   it is quite isolated. The central cluster contains only 5 per cent of
   the total stellar mass in the clusters that are determined within the
   complex. The ring-like morphology, the age spread and the mass ratio
   support a triggering formation scenario for this complex. We discuss the
   formation of the Ruby Ring in a collect and collapse framework. The
   predictions made by this model agree quite well with the estimated
   bubble radius and expansion velocity produced by the feedback from the
   central cluster, making the Ruby Ring an interesting case of triggered
   star formation.}},

Abstract = {{The dairy industry uses the mesophilic, Gram-positive, lactic acid
   bacterium (LAB) Lactococcus lactis to produce an array of fermented milk
   products. Milk fermentation processes are susceptible to contamination
   by virulent phages, but a plethora of phage control strategies are
   available. One of the most efficient is to use LAB strains carrying
   phage resistance systems such as abortive infection (Abi) mechanisms.
   Yet, the mode of action of most Abi systems remains poorly documented.
   Here, we shed further light on the antiviral activity of the lactococcal
   AbiT system. Twenty-eight AbiT-resistant phage mutants derived from the
   wildtype AbiT-sensitive lactococcal phages p2, bIL170, and P008 were
   isolated and characterized. Comparative genomic analyses identified
   three different genes that were mutated in these virulent
   AbiT-insensitive phage derivatives: e14 (bIL170 {[}e14(bIL170)]), orf41
   (P008 {[}orf41(P008)]), and orf6 (p2 {[}orf6(p2)] and P008
   {[}orf6(P008)]). The genes e14(bIL170) and orf41(P008) are part of the
   early-expressed genomic region, but bioinformatic analyses did not
   identify their putative function. orf6 is found in the phage
   morphogenesis module. Antibodies were raised against purified
   recombinant ORF6, and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that it is the
   major capsid protein (MCP). Coexpression in L. lactis of ORF6(p2) and
   ORF5(p2), a protease, led to the formation of procapsids. To our
   knowledge, AbiT is the first Abi system involving distinct phage genes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to quantify the evapotranspiration (ET) of a
   rainfed potato crop using micrometeorological instrumentation and the
   eddy covariance techniques (ECV). The ET measurement allowed deriving
   crop coefficients that vary among the growth season along with
   indicators that characterize the water use, and it was also used as
   input to resolve the water balance equation. ET was measured using
   high-sampling instruments (CSAT3, Campbell SCI Inc.; Li7500, LiCor
   Inc.), during the growth season of 2007 (20 May-19 September). The
   cumulative ET was 331.5 mm, with a daily maximum of 6.5 mm at full
   coverage; precipitation was 350.6 mm which is rather small compared with
   the historical mean (563.3 mm); yield was within the average for this
   site: 4.02 kg m(-2); resolving the water balance equation the deep
   drainage was estimated at 24.7 mm. Actual crop coefficients (K-co\_act)
   were determined using the ratio of the actual ET (ETa) and the
   standardized reference ET (ETo) equation of the American Society of
   Civil Engineers. K-co\_act varied as ETa among the different growing
   stages, from a mean of 0.63 at vegetative growth to 0.91 at tuber
   initiation. The productivity of water under rainfall and of water use
   were respectively 22.1 and 12.1 kg m(-3). (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A method for characterizing cross-sections of vortices in turbulent
   flows}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{177-188}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method for characterizing cross-sections of
   vortices in turbulent flows that is simple, robust, not selective, and
   above all, much less contaminated by shear than the existing methods. By
   relying on the approach of Kolar (Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 28, 2007) for
   separating swirling motions of vortices from pure shearing motions, the
   method computes a rigid-body-rotation vorticity that is not
   significantly contaminated by shear and that serves as the local measure
   of vortex-related vorticity. The effective radius and circulation of all
   detected vortices are determined by using this rigid-body-rotation
   vorticity in conjunction with the Gaussian vorticity distribution common
   to both the Oseen vortex and the Burgers vortex as a vortex template.
   Even if a template is necessary, no vortices are rejected because of
   their shape or their vorticity distribution. The errors in radius and
   circulation caused by the use of a vortex template in the method are
   analyzed with a quasi-elliptical vortex model. The advantages and
   limitations of this vortex characterization method are presented in
   detail. A wall-bounded turbulent flow is studied and it is shown that
   vortices are frequently in zones of strong instantaneous shear. Based on
   this result, we demonstrate that, contrary to rigid-body-rotation
   vorticity, the two commonly used measures of the local swirling rate of
   a vortex, vorticity and the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues of
   the velocity gradient tensor lambda(ci), are strongly contaminated by
   shear. Hence, circulation or any vortex strength parameter directly
   derived from vorticity or lambda(ci) is not accurate. The main interest
   of the present vortex characterization method is that it overcomes this
   problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A production system containing a set of machines (also called
   components) arranged according to a series-parallel configuration is
   addressed. A set of products must be produced in lots on this production
   system during a specified finite planning horizon. This paper presents a
   method for integrating load distribution decisions, and tactical
   production planning considering the costs of capacity change and the
   costs of unused capacity. The objective is to minimize the sum of
   capacity change costs, unused capacity costs, setup costs, holding
   costs, backorder costs, and production costs. The main constraints
   consist in satisfying the demand for all products over the entire
   horizon, and in not exceeding available repair resource. The production
   series-parallel system is modeled as a multi-state system with
   binary-state components. The proposed model takes into account the
   dependence of machines' failure rates on their load. Universal
   generating function technique can be used in the optimization algorithm
   for evaluating the expected system production rate in each period. We
   show how the formulated problem can be solved by comparing the results
   of several multi-product lot-sizing problems with capacity associated
   costs. The importance of integrating load distribution decisions and
   production planning is illustrated through numerical examples. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We extend the macroscopic nonequilibrium thermomechanical multiphase
   flow theory proposed by Hassanizadeh and Gray for porous media to
   analyze a set of drainage and imbibition experiments in trickle beds.
   The nonequilibrium model rests on inclusion of mass and momentum
   conservations for the gas-liquid interface, nonequilibrium capillary
   pressure, Helmholtz free energy gradients in the body supply of momentum
   for fluid bulk phases and gas-liquid interface, and mass exchange rates
   between interface and fluid bulks accounting for production and
   destruction of gas-liquid interfacial area. To solve the nonequilibrium
   model, entropy-consistent constitutive relationships are derived and
   calibrated using liquid holdup and bed pressure drop measurements in
   drainage and imbibition. The model captures very well the decay
   (drainage), and breakthrough (imbibition) curvatures of liquid holdup
   and pressure drop kinetics, while model closer inspection allows
   assessing the role of nonequilibrium capillary pressure and of dynamic
   interfacial mass exchanges for the production/destruction of interfacial

Abstract = {{In order to further investigate activated sludge system for better
   carbon metabolism and nitrogen removal with less energy consumption, a
   new kinetic model was established. The detailed description of the
   proposed model was introduced for understanding the mechanisms involved
   in the activated sludge system, especially simultaneous substrate
   storage and biomass growth (SSSG) processes and soluble microbial
   product generation. The evaluation of the proposed model was
   demonstrated by a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated with
   three different sets, i.e., aeration/non-aeration (set 1),
   non-aeration/aeration/non-aeration (set 2), and alternating
   aeration/non-aeration (set 3) processes. The purpose was to investigate
   carbon metabolism under multiple aerobic/anoxic conditions. The
   calibrated results showed quite an acceptable model fit to the on-line
   measured dissolved oxygen (DO) data for the three SBR sets. Predictions
   of the calibrated model were successfully confirmed using off-line
   analyses of soluble chemical oxygen demands (COD) and nitrogen dynamic
   variations, respectively. The simulated results showed that more SMP was
   generated under aerobic condition than that under anoxic condition, and
   more nitrate (S (NO)) consumption resulted in less SMP generation, i.e.,
   approximately 7\% and 57\% less extra carbon source in sets 2 and 3 were
   required to remove 8\% and 58\% of S (NO), respectively, compared with
   set 1. And the kinetics of SSSG process in the proposed model was
   indirectly validated by comparisons between experimental DO profiles and
   simulations. Therefore, the new model provides an effective technique
   for better optimizing the effluent COD and nitrogen with low energy cost
   in biological wastewater treatment plants.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this article is to present the results gathered
   during the commissioning of a new ice-free cup anemometer developed at
   Universite Laval. These tests took place at the Wind Energy Institute of
   Canada (WEICan) between January 2011 and April 2011, whereby icing
   events occurred and through the observations in this paper will show the
   need for ice-free anemometers in the wind industry in cold climates.
   Unbiased wind measurements cannot be obtained without ice-free
   anemometers. At such sites, the use of unheated wind speed sensors
   during the resource assessment phase leads to higher uncertainty of the
   wind speed. The use of properly heated anemometers can reduce wind speed
   measurement uncertainty, thus reducing financial uncertainty. A crude
   estimation of the financial losses based on the number of icing hours
   and the number of installed MW is also proposed. Caution should be
   exerted when choosing and installing ice-free instruments. Under
   specific conditions, improperly heated anemometers can lead to less
   accurate wind measurements than unheated anemometers. Wind turbines safe
   operation could be jeopardized with the use of improperly heated

   10(14) M-circle dot) with values of f(ICL) ranging from 1\% to 58\% at z
   = 0. There is a weak trend of f(ICL) to increase with cluster mass. The
   bulk of the ICL (similar to 60\%) is provided by intermediate galaxies
   of total masses 10(11)-10(12) M-circle dot and stellar masses 6 x 10(8)
   M-circle dot to 3 x 10(10) M-circle dot that were tidally destroyed by
   even more massive galaxies. The contribution of low-mass galaxies to the
   ICL is small and the contribution of dwarf galaxies is negligible, even
   though, by numbers, most galaxies that are tidally destroyed are dwarfs.
   Tracking clusters back in time, we find that their values of f(ICL) tend
   to increase over time, but can experience sudden changes that are
   sometimes non-monotonic. These changes occur during major mergers
   involving clusters of comparable masses but very different intracluster
   luminosities. Most of the tidal destruction events take place in the
   central regions of clusters. As a result, the ICL is more centrally
   concentrated than the galactic light. Our results support tidal
   destruction of intermediate-mass galaxies as a plausible scenario for
   the origin of the ICL.}},

Abstract = {{Dust and gas energetics are incorporated into a cluster-scale simulation
   of star formation in order to study the effect of heating and cooling on
   the star formation process. We build on our previous work by calculating
   separately the dust and gas temperatures. The dust temperature is set by
   radiative equilibrium between heating by embedded stars and radiation
   from dust. The gas temperature is determined using an energy-rate
   balance algorithm which includes molecular cooling, dust-gas collisional
   energy transfer, and cosmic-ray ionization. The fragmentation proceeds
   roughly similarly to simulations in which the gas temperature is set to
   the dust temperature, but there are differences. The structure of
   regions around sink particles has properties similar to those of Class 0
   objects, but the infall speeds and mass accretion rates are, on average,
   higher than those seen for regions forming only low-mass stars. The gas
   and dust temperature have complex distributions not well modeled by
   approximations that ignore the detailed thermal physics. There is no
   simple relationship between density and kinetic temperature. In
   particular, high-density regions have a large range of temperatures,
   determined by their location relative to heating sources. The total
   luminosity underestimates the star formation rate at these early stages,
   before ionizing sources are included, by an order of magnitude. As
   predicted in our previous work, a larger number of intermediate-mass
   objects form when improved thermal physics is included, but the
   resulting initial mass function (IMF) still has too few low-mass stars.
   However, if we consider recent evidence on core-to-star efficiencies,
   the match to the IMF is improved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital image analysis was implemented to monitor bubbling dynamics in
   corrugated-wall bubbling fluidized beds (CWBFB) loaded with Geldart D
   particles. Various geometrical configurations were investigated in terms
   of corrugation angle, interwall clearance, and rest bed height and gas
   superficial velocity. Implementation of wall corrugation led to improved
   gas-solid fluidization quality with respect to flat-wall bubbling
   fluidized beds (FWBFB) as measured in terms of retreat of the onset of
   bubbling as a function of gas flow rate, of reduction of bubble sizes
   and rise velocities, and of increase of bubble frequency. Two artificial
   neural network correlations valid both for FWBFB and CWBFB were
   recommended for estimation of bubble frequency and size using a common
   set of independent variables, that is, gas superficial-minimum bubbling
   velocity ratio, bed rest height, corrugation angle, average clearance,
   and vertical location. The bubble frequency explicit correlation
   accounted additionally for interwall minimum clearance and distance
   between side wall and either neck or hip of front plate, at a given
   elevation, whereas bubble size correlation needed bubble frequency as a
   supplementary input variable.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the preparation, characterization and CO2/CH4 gas
   separation properties of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) made from five
   different as-synthesised metal organic frameworks (MOFs): UiO-66
   (Zr-BDC), NH2-UiO-66 (Zr-ABDC), UiO-67 (Zr-BPDC), MOF-199 (Cu-BTC), and
   NH2-MOF-199 (containing 25\% ABDC and 75\% BTC mixed-linker) fillers and
   as-synthesized 6FDA-ODA polyimide as the polymeric matrix in order to
   investigate the ligand functionalization effect (-NH2) on MOF's
   adsorption properties and on the CO2/CH4 gas separation performance of
   the MMMs.
   The as-synthesized MOFs were carefully characterized by XRD, SEM,
   ATR-FTIR, and N-2 adsorption at 77 K. MMMs were also characterized using
   ATR-FTIR, and SEM and CO2/CH4 pure and mixed gas separation measurements
   were carried out. Incorporation of the fillers in the MMMs resulted in
   an increase in perm-selectivity except for the UiO-67 filler. The
   presence of amine-functional groups in as-synthesized MOFs increased
   both the ideal selectivity and CO2 permeability. On the other hand, MMM
   made with UiO-66 increased significantly the CO2 permeability compared
   to the neat 6FDA-ODA membrane without any loss in ideal selectivity.
   Using mixed-linker NH2-MOF-199 enhanced the perm-selectivity of the MMM
   maybe because of the presence of some whisker-like roughness on their
   crystal surface as observed in SEM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A new boratabenzene-phosphine ligand,
   di-tert-butylphosphidoboratabenzene, {[}DTBB](-), has successfully been
   synthesized by reduction of the corresponding
   di-tert-butylchlorophosphidoborabenzene compound (2). The species was
   structurally characterized with both K+ (3) and 18-crown-6.K+ (4) as
   counterions. Reactions of two equivalents of
   di-tert-butylphosphidoboratabenzene with NiBr2(PPh3)(2), PtCl2, and
   PtCl2(COD) were undertaken and were successful in yielding three new
   organometallic boratabenzene species,
   (mu-kappa-eta(6)-C5H5BP(tBu)(2))(2)Ni-2 (5),
   (eta(3)-(C,B,P)-C5H5BP(tBu)(2))(2)Pt (6), and
   (eta(3)-(C,B,P)-C5H5BP(tBu)(2))(kappa-C8H12(P(tBu)(2)BC5H5)Pt (7),
   respectively. The di-tert-butylphosphidoboratabenzene species displays a
   remarkable tendency to coordinate to transition metal species in two
   distinct modes closely associated with other reported boratabenzene and
   allyl-like interactions. Also of interest is the ability for
   di-tert-butylphosphidoboratabenzene to be able to coordinate within
   monomeric as well as dimeric transition metal compounds. The synthesis
   and characterization will be discussed in detail along with DFT
   calculations in order to validate these research findings.}},

Title = {{Superconformal field theory and Jack superpolynomials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We uncover a deep connection between the N = 1 superconformal field
   theory in 2D and eigenfunctions of the supersymmetric Sutherland model
   known as Jack superpolynomials (sJacks). Specifically, the singular
   vector at level rs/2 of the Kac module labeled by the two integers r and
   s are given explicitly as a sum of sJacks whose indexing diagrams are
   contained in a rectangle with r columns and s rows. As a second
   compelling evidence for the distinguished status of the sJack-basis in
   SCFT, we find that the degenerate Whittaker vectors (Gaiotto states) can
   be expressed as a remarkably simple linear combination of sJacks. As a
   consequence, we are able to reformulate the supersymmetric version of
   the (degenerate) AGT conjecture in terms of the combinatorics of sJacks.
   The closed-form formulas for the singular vectors and the degenerate
   Whittaker vectors, although only conjectured in general, have been
   heavily tested (in some cases, up to level 33/2). Both the Neveu-Schwarz
   and Ramond sectors are treated.}},

Title = {{Stabilization of basic oxygen furnace slag by hot-stage carbonation
   treatment}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{203}},
Pages = {{239-250}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Treatment and disposal of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) slag, a residue of
   the steel production process characterized by high basicity and
   propensity for heavy metal leaching, is a costly burden on metallurgical
   plants; a sustainable valorization route is desired. The stabilization
   of BOF slag utilizing hot-stage carbonation treatment was investigated;
   this approach envisions carbonation during the hot-to-cold pathway
   followed by the material after the molten slag is poured and solidified.
   Three experimental methodologies were employed: (i) in situ
   thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) carbonation was used to assess
   carbonation reaction kinetics and thermodynamic equilibrium at high
   temperatures; (ii) pressurized basket reactor carbonation was used to
   assess the effects of pressurization, steam addition and slag particle
   size: and (iii) atmospheric furnace carbonation was used to assess the
   effect of carbonation on the mineralogy, basicity and heavy metal
   leaching properties of the slag. Free lime was found to be the primary
   mineral participating in direct carbonation of BOF slag. Initial
   carbonation kinetics were comparable at temperatures ranging from 500 to
   800 degrees C, but higher temperatures aided in solid state diffusion of
   CO2 into the unreacted particle core, thus increasing overall CO2
   uptake. The optimum carbonation temperature of both BOF slag and pure
   lime lies just below the transition temperature between carbonation
   stability and carbonate decomposition: 830-850 degrees C and 750-770
   degrees C at 1 atm and 0.2 atm CO2 partial pressures, respectively.
   Pressurization and steam addition contribute marginally to CO2 uptake.
   CO2 uptake progressively decreases with increasing particle size, but
   basicity reduction is similar independent of particle size. The
   solubility of some heavy metals reduced after carbonation (barium,
   cobalt and nickel), but vanadium and chromium leaching increased. (C)

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) suspended in liquids lend themselves to
   manipulation at distance using suitable external magnetic fields to
   shuttle anchored catalysts, enzymes or drugs. Despite their widespread
   use in (bio)catalysis/separation or drug delivery - applications where
   nanoscale mixing can be a substantive issue-, the use of MNPs to promote
   nanomixing has not yet been explored. We report a new
   magnetically-induced nanoconvection mechanism that will enhance
   transport beyond the limits of molecular diffusion. This mechanism is
   demonstrated using a Taylor dispersion capillary flow cell where MNPs
   are excited using low-frequency transverse rotating magnetic fields.
   Forcing MNP spin direction to align parallel to flow in opposition to
   fluid vorticity is shown to intensify lateral mixing far more rapidly
   than molecular diffusion. This nanomixing mechanism could find
   applications in (bio)chemical engineering, medical and pharmaceutical
   areas where transport intensification is crucial. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Photon dosimetry in the kilovolt (kV) energy range represents a
   major challenge for diagnostic and interventional radiology and
   superficial therapy. Plastic scintillation detectors (PSDs) are
   potentially good candidates for this task. This study proposes a simple
   way to obtain accurate correction factors to compensate for the response
   of PSDs to photon energies between 80 and 150 kVp. The performance of
   PSDs is also investigated to determine their potential usefulness in the
   diagnostic energy range.
   Methods: A 1-mm-diameter, 10-mm-long PSD was irradiated by a Therapax
   SXT 150 unit using five different beam qualities made of tube potentials
   ranging from 80 to 150 kVp and filtration thickness ranging from 0.8 to
   0.2 mmAl + 1.0 mmCu. The light emitted by the detector was collected
   using an 8-m-long optical fiber and a polychromatic photodiode, which
   converted the scintillation photons to an electrical current. The PSD
   response was compared with the reference free air dose rate measured
   with a calibrated Farmer NE2571 ionization chamber. PSD measurements
   were corrected using spectra-weighted corrections, accounting for mass
   energy-absorption coefficient differences between the sensitive volumes
   of the ionization chamber and the PSD, as suggested by large cavity
   theory (LCT). Beam spectra were obtained from x-ray simulation software
   and validated experimentally using a CdTe spectrometer. Correction
   factors were also obtained using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Percent
   depth dose (PDD) measurements were compensated for beam hardening using
   the LCT correction method. These PDD measurements were compared with
   uncorrected PSD data, PDD measurements obtained using Gafchromic films,
   Monte Carlo simulations, and previous data.
   Results: For each beam quality used, the authors observed an increase of
   the energy response with effective energy when no correction was applied
   to the PSD response. Using the LCT correction, the PSD response was
   almost energy independent, with a residual 2.1\% coefficient of
   variation (COV) over the 80-150-kVp energy range. Monte Carlo
   corrections reduced the COV to 1.4\% over this energy range. All PDD
   measurements were in good agreement with one another except for the
   uncorrected PSD data, in which an over-response was observed with depth
   (13\% at 10 cm with a 100 kVp beam), showing that beam hardening had a
   non-negligible effect on the PSD response. A correction based on LCT
   compensated very well for this effect, reducing the over-response to
   3\%.
   Conclusion: In the diagnostic energy range, PSDs show high-energy
   dependence, which can be corrected using spectra-weighted mass
   energy-absorption coefficients, showing no considerable sign of
   quenching between these energies. Correction factors obtained by Monte
   Carlo simulations confirm that the approximations made by LCT
   corrections are valid. Thus, PSDs could be useful for real-time
   dosimetry in radiology applications. (c) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{The Mesoproterozoic Purcell Basin in Canada contains three different
   types of veins: (1) type 1 Pb-Zn-Ag veins are composed of Fe-rich
   sphalerite, pyrrhotite, galena, freibergite, and pyrite with minor
   quartz gangue; (2) type 2 Pb-Ag-Cu-Au veins are characterized by galena,
   pyrite, freibergite, and gold in a quartz gangue; and (3) type 3
   Ag-Pb-Zn vein and replacement deposits contain Fe-poor sphalerite,
   galena, pyrite, and freibergite in a quartz-dolomite gangue that locally
   replaces host dolostone. The sulfur isotope composition of type 1, 2,
   and 3 vein and replacement deposits closely reflects their respective
   stratigraphic positions. Type 1 and 2 veins hosted in lower Purcell
   sedimentary rocks have light sulfur isotope compositions (-4.8 to +2.5
   parts per thousand) similar to diagenic pyrite disseminated in elastic
   sedimental), host rocks. Type 3 veins and the replacement deposits
   hosted in upper Purcell Supergroup rocks have heavy sulfur isotope
   compositions (8.3-17.2 parts per thousand) indicative of thermochemical
   reduction of marine sulfate in carbonate host rocks. Quartz from type 1
   Ph-Zn-Ag veins has delta O-18(SMOW) values ranging from 7 to 17 parts
   per thousand, whereas type 2 and 3 vein and replacement deposits have
   delta O-18 values ranging from 9 to 20 parts per thousand. The range of
   delta O-18 values for type 1, 2, and 3 veins is the result of mixing of
   metamorphic fluids with a delta O-18 value higher than 1.1.5 parts per
   thousand and an upper crustal fluid with a delta O-18 lower than 1.2
   parts per thousand, in equilibrium with the host rocks during
   Proterozoic (type 1) and Mesozoic-Cenozoic (type 2 and 3) hydrothermal
   events. Galena and freibergite lead isotope compositions plot in two
   groups, consistent with previous studies. Type 1 Pb-Zn-Ag veins have a
   nonradiogenic lead signature (Pb-206/Pb-204: 16.322-16.435) and are
   considered Proterozoic in age. Type 2 Pb-Ag-Au-Cu veins and type 3
   Ag-Ph-Zn vein and replacement deposits have a radiogenic lead signature
   (Pb-206/Pb-204: 17.842-19.347) and are interpreted to be
   Mesozoic-Cenozoic in age. Hydrothermal sericite from the type 3
   Ptarmigan replacement deposit yields a Ar-40/Ar-39 age of 133.1 +/- 0.7
   Ma, indicating a Cretaceous age for type 3 deposits. Type 1 veins are
   interpreted to be the result of hydrothermal fluids generated during the
   Proterozoic East Kootenay Orogeny, whereas type 2 and 3 veins and
   replacement deposits are interpreted to be the result of Late
   Cretaceous-Paleocene tectonism.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this first synthesis is to summarize findings on the
   Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ) ophiolites and discuss still remaining
   problems. The YZSZ studied for almost 30 years and is the youngest of
   the sutures recognized on Tibet Plateau. It is now acknowledged that the
   YZSZ is a complex assemblage of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous
   rocks created during and shortly after the collision between India and
   Eurasia. The ages of the various lithologies span a time interval from
   the Jurassic to the Middle Miocene, with some Permian and Devonian
   exotic blocks from melange zone. The YZSZ is characterized by ophiolitic
   complexes and ophiolitic melange. The ophiolites are of two types: non
   dismembered and dismembered sections. The non disturbed sections,
   although tectonically reworked, are observed along the segment from
   Dazhuqu to Jiding in Xigaze area and Spontang ophiolite. The dismembered
   sequences are found in various locations such as Nidar, Kiogar, Jungbwa,
   Saga, Sangsang, Xigugabu, and Luobusa. The incomplete stratigraphic log
   could be connected to intraoceanic or orogenetic origins. The ophiolites
   are distributed into two groups of ages: the Luobusa. Zedang and Kiogar
   sequences being Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous whereas all other sequences
   are of Lower Cretaceous age. Compilation of geochronological data
   suggest that some ophiolite sequences might have evolved for over more
   than 70 My from their initial genesis to obduction which occurred around
   70-90 My ago. Ophiolites differ in terms of petrological and geochemical
   aspects however, they were all generated in suprasubduction zone and
   more specifically in arc (few fore-arc) and back-arc settings. Synthesis
   of more than 700 geochemical analyses show variable mixing of components
   from N-MORB-type to IAT-CAB and to OIB end-members. The Jurassic
   ophiolites show the maximum of arc component while the Lower Cretaceous
   ones show little to strong mixing. In addition, most ophiolites were
   created in short lived (30 My) basins and generated close to the
   Eurasiatic continental margin. We propose that Ladakh-Tibet ophiolites
   were generated in a suprasubduction context similar to Mariana arc,
   inter-arc and back-arc or Tonga-Lau system. The variable arc signature
   of these ophiolites is directly related to their initial position within
   the suprasubduction system. (c) 2011 International Association for

Abstract = {{Blocks of strongly foliated garnet- and clinopyroxene-bearing
   amphibolites have recently been discovered in the Saga ophiolitic
   melange, South Tibet. The Saga ophiolitic melange is a sheared
   serpentinite matrix melange that crops out along the Yarlung Zangbo
   Suture Zone (YZSZ), South Tibet. The YZSZ is the youngest and the
   southernmost of all sutures stretching across the Tibetan Plateau and
   contains the remnants of the Neo-Tethys ocean that once separated India
   from the Lhasa block. The garnet- and clinopyroxene-bearing amphibolite
   blocks are interpreted as parts of a dismembered sub-ophiolitic
   metamorphic sole. They are made mainly of hornblende, diopside and
   garnet and were strongly metasomatized during retrogression.
   Thermobarometry and Ar-40/Ar-39 dating on hornblende indicate that they
   were metamorphosed to peak conditions in excess of 12 kbar and 850
   degrees C between 132 and 127 Ma. Major and trace element geochemistry
   suggest an N- to E-MORB-type protolith, although a back- or inter-arc
   basin setting cannot be ruled out. This data supports a model in which
   the back-arc YZSZ ophiolites (central segment) were trapped in a
   fore-arc setting by the inception of a subduction at the back-/inter-arc
   ridge. The cause of this important Early Cretaceous tectonic event might
   be the presence of an oceanic plateau or hot-spot tracks in the
   Neo-Tethys, the collision of the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks in the North
   and/or the onset of northward movement of the Indian continent in the
   South. The proposed conceptual model provides an explanation for the
   absence (or rarity) of Late Cretaceous ophiolites along the YZSZ which
   are mostly of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Ultrasmall paramagnetic Gd2O3 nanoparticles have been developed as
   contrast agents for molecular and cellular preclinical MRI procedures.
   These small particles (mean diameter <5 nm) have the highest Gd density
   of all paramagnetic contrast agents. They generate strong positive
   contrast enhancement in T-1-weighted MM. Signal enhancement is modulated
   by the interactions of water molecules with Gd, and very small particles
   provide the optimal surface-to-volume ratios necessary to reach high
   relaxivities. Conventional Gd2O3 nanocrystal synthesis techniques, and
   subsequent polyethylene glycol (PEG) grafting procedures are usually
   time-consuming and recovery losses are also limitative. The present
   study reports on a new, fast, and efficient one-pot Gd2O3 synthesis
   technique that provides PEGylated nanoparticles of very small size (mean
   diameter = 1.3 nm). Readily coated with PEG, the particles are
   colloidally stable in aqueous media and provide high longitudial
   relaxivities and small r(2)/r(1) ratios (r(1) = 14.2 mM(-1) s(-1) at 60
   MHz; r(2)/r(1) = 1.20), ideal for T-1-weighted MRI. In this study, F98
   brain cancer cells (glioblastoma multiforme) were labeled with the
   contrast agent and implanted in vivo (mice brains). The labeled cells
   appeared positively contrasted at least 48 h after implantation. Each
   one of the implanted animals developed a brain tumor. The performance of
   PEG-Gd2O3 was also compared with that of commercially available iron
   oxide nanoparticles. This study demonstrated that ultrasmall PEG-Gd2O3
   nanoparticles provide strong positive contrast enhancement in
   T-1-weighted imaging, and allow the visualization of labeled cells
   implanted in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Visual inspection of the amount of external marbling (intramuscular fat)
   on the meat surface is the official method used to assign the quality
   grading level of meat. However, this method is based exclusively on the
   analysis of the meat surface without any information about the internal
   content of the meat sample. In this paper, a new method using visible
   (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light transmission is used to evaluate the
   quality of beef meat based on the marbling detection. It is demonstrated
   that using NIR light in transmission mode, it is possible to detect the
   fat not only on the surface, as in traditional methods, but also under
   the surface. Moreover, in combining the analysis of the two sides of the
   meat simple, it is possible to estimate the volumetric marbling which is
   not accessible by visual methods commonly proposed in computer vision.
   To the best of our knowledge, no similar work or method has been
   published or developed. The experimental results confirm the expected
   properties of the proposed method and illustrate the quality of the
   results obtained. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{All-optical wavelength converters play a key role for next-generation
   high-bit-rate optical networks. A high-speed, simple, and compact
   wavelength converter can resolve contention, reduce wavelength blocking,
   and enable a multitude of new wavelength routing approaches. We propose
   the combination of a quantum-dash mode-locked laser (QD-MLL) with a
   frequency-selective filter to provide (two) tunable wavelength pumps for
   wavelength conversion of optical channels in a dual-pump
   four-wave-mixing (FWM) scheme. Such a converter is simple, practical,
   and offers a wide conversion range, modulation format transparency, and
   the potential for photonic integration. We examine the performance of
   the proposed scheme experimentally with a QD-MLL and manually tunable
   optical filters. Wavelength conversion is achieved via an extremely
   non-linear semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), a commercial SOA with
   very high FWM efficiency. We achieved near -3 dB conversion efficiency
   across a 9.6 nm tuning range with a signal input power of -3 dBm and a
   pump input power of 2 dBm. We performed bit error rate (BER) measurement
   on a 5.6 nm conversion range and obtained error-free transmission (BER
   <10(-9)) with less than 2 dB power penalty.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{433}},
Pages = {{530-537}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Five sensitivity analysis methods based on derivatives, screening,
   regression, variance decomposition and entropy are introduced, applied
   and compared for a model predicting micropollutant degradation in
   drinking water treatment. The sensitivity analysis objectives considered
   are factors prioritisation (detecting important factors), factors fixing
   (detecting non-influential factors) and factors mapping (detecting which
   factors are responsible for causing pollutant limit exceedances). It is
   shown how the applicability of methods changes in view of increasing
   interactions between model factors and increasing non-linearity between
   the model output and the model factors. A high correlation is observed
   between the indices obtained for the objectives factors prioritisation
   and factors mapping due to the positive skewness of the probability
   distributions of the predicted residual pollutant concentrations. The
   entropy-based method which uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence is found
   to be particularly suited when assessing pollutant limit exceedances.

Abstract = {{The development of a proper processing method for the fabrication
   TiB2-based wettable cathodes for aluminum electrolysis has been
   challenging for more than half a century. In this work, TiB2-based
   ceramics were consolidated via pressureless sintering using Ti, Fe, and
   TiFe additives. The microstructure, physical and mechanical properties
   as well as the interaction and the stability of the material in liquid
   aluminum were investigated. It was shown that specimens sintered with a
   TiFe additive have excellent stability in liquid aluminum as the solid
   TiB2 skeleton maintained its integrity and strength after 5 days of
   exposure in liquid aluminum at 960?degrees C. Transmission electron
   microscopy analysis revealed that the formation of inter-particle
   bridges of pure TiB2 is responsible for the good resistance of the
   material in molten aluminum. A sintering mechanism was proposed for the
   consolidation of TiB2 with a TiFe additive. TiB2-based ceramic sintered
   with a TiFe alloy is suggested as a potentially reliable material for
   application as wettable cathode for aluminum electrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{In order to better understand the impact of the bar on the evolution of
   spiral galaxies, we measure the properties of giant H?ii regions and the
   bar in the SB(s)b galaxy NGC?5430. We use two complementary data sets,
   both obtained at the Observatoire du Mont-Megantic: a hyperspectral data
   cube from the imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SpIOMM
   (Spectrometre-Imageur a transformee de Fourier de l-Observatoire du
   Mont-Megantic) and high-resolution spectra across the bar from a
   long-slit spectrograph. We flux-calibrate SpIOMM spectra for the first
   time, and produce Ha and {[}N?ii]?6584?angstrom intensity maps from
   which we identify 51 giant H?ii regions in the spiral arms and bar. We
   evaluate the type of activity, the oxygen abundance and the age of the
   young populations contained in these giant H?ii regions and in the bar.
   Thus, we confirm that NGC?5430 does not harbour a strong active galactic
   nucleus, and that its WolfRayet knot shows a pure H?ii region nature. We
   find no variation in abundance or age between the bar and spiral arms,
   nor as a function of galactocentric radius. These results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that a chemical mixing mechanism is at work in the
   galaxy's disc to flatten the oxygen abundance gradient. Using the
   starburst99 model, we estimate the ages of the young populations, and
   again find no variations in age between the bar and the arms or as a
   function of radius. Instead, we find evidence for two galaxy-wide waves
   of star formation, about 7.1 and 10.5?Myr ago. While the bar in NGC?5430
   is an obvious candidate to trigger these two episodes, it is not clear
   how the bar could induce widespread star formation on such a short
   time-scale.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic copolymers based on the copolymerization of hydrophilic and

   applications. Here, a new biocompatible copolymer of
   dextran-graft-polybutylmethacrylate is synthesized for the coating of

   reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, contact angle
   measurement, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
   before and after deformation corresponding to stent deployment by a
   balloon catheter. In the conditions described here, the resulting
   coating is smooth and uniform with neither cracks nor detachment after
   stent expansion. Interestingly, surfaces coated with the copolymer
   greatly improve in vitro adhesion and growth of endothelial cells. This
   copolymer provides new opportunities for implanted biomaterials. (C)

Abstract = {{The interactions between the surface of synthetic scaffolds and cells
   play an important role in tissue engineering applications. To improve
   these interactions, two strategies are generally followed: surface
   coating with large proteins and surface grafting with small peptides.
   The proteins and peptides more often used and derived from the
   extracellular matrix, are fibronectin, laminin, and their active
   peptides, RGD and SIKVAV, respectively. The aim of this work was to
   compare the effects of coating and grafting of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA)
   films on MRC5 fibroblast cells. Grafting reactions were verified by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cell adhesion and proliferation on
   coated and grafted PLLA surfaces were measured by cell counting.
   Vinculin localization and distribution were performed on cell cultured
   on PLLA samples using a fluorescence microscopy technique. Finally,
   western blot was performed to compare signals of cell adhesion proteins,
   such as vinculin, Rac1, and RhoA, as well as cell proliferation, such as
   PCNA. These tests showed similar results for fibronectin and laminin
   coated PLLA, while RGD grafting is more effective compared with SIKVAV
   grafting. Considering the overall view of these results, although
   coating and grafting can both be regarded as effective methods for
   surface modification to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation on a
   biomaterial, RGD grafted PLLA show better cell adhesion and
   proliferation than coated PLLA, while SIKVAV grafted PLLA show similar
   adhesion but worse proliferation. These data verified different
   biological effects depending on the surface modification method used.

Abstract = {{The threshold of human perception in the detection of tastes and odors

   chlorine can be detected at the ppm level and geosmin can be perceived
   at the ppt level. In this paper, sensory tests (using a human panel),
   physicochemical analyses (total and free residual chlorine, temperature,
   metals, geosmin, and 2-methylisoborneol (2MIB)) and microbiological
   analyses (algae, Actinomycetes and heterotrophic plate count) were
   performed for water samples collected during a seventeen-month period at
   ten different locations of a municipal distribution network of Quebec
   City (Canada). The results showed that different flavors(1) assessed by
   a panel and aggregated into global flavor intensity (GFI) vary
   considerably spatially and seasonally. Multiple regression analysis
   showed that the factors best explaining the variability of GFI are (in
   order) the season, the location, the concentration of total residual
   chlorine and the presence of cyanobacteria. Results also demonstrate
   that chlorine has a masking effect on other T\&O. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The gradual deterioration in the morphological and chemical stability of
   membranes in membrane contactors can extensively influence the membrane
   wettability, leading to reduction of CO2 absorption efficiency. In the
   present work, morphological, chemical and thermal stability of
   microporous low density polyethylene (LDPE) hollow fiber membranes,
   intended to be used in membrane contactors, was studied in contact with
   primary amine (monoethanolamine, MEA) and sterically hindered amine
   (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol, AHPD) solutions. The effect on
   membrane stabilization of a diamine (piperazine, PZ) having the
   operational advantages of fast CO2 absorption rate and capacity was also
   investigated.
   The surface properties of neat (before contact) and used (after contact
   with amine solutions) membranes were analyzed using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and contact angle measurements. For
   membranes immersed in amine solutions of commonly used concentrations
   (30 wt.\% MEA and 11 wt.\% AHPD), the results show morphological
   degradation of membranes, caused by the intrusion of the solution into
   the pores, as well as chemical degradation caused by the LDPE
   auto-oxidation. However, a less significant effect was found by the
   addition of PZ. A two-step mechanism was proposed to explain the
   stabilizing effect of PZ. PZ containing amine solutions are suggested as
   strong candidates for CO2 absorption in membrane contactors due to their
   efficient dual-function properties (high CO2 absorption efficiency and
   polyolefin membrane stabilization). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component
   of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models,
   recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult
   to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring
   baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic
   catchment's response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated
   surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with
   differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is
   considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics.
   Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic
   catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow
   separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal
   obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control
   experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the
   method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated
   baseflow by as much as 28\%, or overestimates it by up to 74\%, during
   rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to
   the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with
   different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall
   events. The differences between the various approaches clearly
   demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not
   universally applicable. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the activated sludge model no.3 (ASM3), a new kinetic
   expression describing substrate removal and biomass growth mechanism
   occurring in activated sludge system under aerobic condition was
   established. The new model proposed that under feast condition, one part
   of substrate was utilized directly for biomass growth and the other part
   was stored as internal storage products and simultaneously the storage
   products were used for biomass growth. The model was successfully
   calibrated on oxygen uptake rate (OUR) data and off-line soluble
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) dynamic variations obtained from batch
   experiments with biomass from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP). OUR predictions with the calibrated model could reasonably
   describe the OUR profile after pulse addition of acetate, i.e., the OUR
   transiently reached a very high level, and then increased gradually to a
   maximum level until the initial substrate was taken up for storage and
   biomass growth. This new model also, for the first time, highlighted the
   significant effect of the biomass storage products concentration before
   pulse addition of acetate on OUR profile. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{CFD simulations of gas-liquid-solid fluidized beds have been performed
   in a full three-dimensional, unsteady multiple-Euler framework by means
   of the commercial software FLUENT. The simulation results were compared
   with experimental data obtained from laboratory scale three-phase

   schemes, as well as the choice of available k-epsilon turbulence models
   (standard, RNG, realizable), solid wall boundary conditions and granular
   temperature models were investigated. The results indicate that in order
   to minimize numerical diffusion artifacts and to enable valid
   discussions on the choice of physical models, third-order numerical
   schemes need to be implemented. The realizable turbulence formulation
   was unable to produce the expected solids gulf-stream pattern (i.e.,
   rising solid particles in the core and descending solid particles near
   the wall) in three-phase fluidized beds whereas the RNG and standard
   k-epsilon models were able to better capture depictions of flow
   patterns. The best prediction of flow characteristics was obtained with
   a laminar model formulation accounting for the solid phase viscosity and
   the molecular viscosities of the two fluids. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The Effects of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta in Serotonin Neurons}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a constitutively active protein
   kinase in brain. Increasing evidence has shown that GSK3 acts as a
   modulator in the serotonin neurotransmission system, including direct
   interaction with serotonin 1B (5-HT1B) receptors in a highly selective
   manner and prominent modulating effect on 5-HT1B receptor activity. In
   this study, we utilized the serotonin neuron-selective GSK3 beta
   knockout (snGSK3 beta-KO) mice to test if GSK3 beta in serotonin neurons
   selectively modulates 5-HT1B autoreceptor activity and function. The
   snGSK3 beta-KO mice were generated by crossbreeding GSK3 beta-floxed
   mice and ePet1-Cre mice. These mice had normal growth and physiological
   characteristics, similar numbers of tryptophan hydroxylase-2
   (TpH2)-expressing serotonin neurons, and the same brain serotonin
   content as in littermate wild type mice. However, the expression of GSK3
   beta in snGSK3 beta-KO mice was diminished in TpH2-expressing serotonin
   neurons. Compared to littermate wild type mice, snGSK3 beta-KO mice had
   a reduced response to the 5-HT1B receptor agonist anpirtoline in the
   regulation of serotonergic neuron firing, cAMP production, and serotonin
   release, whereas these animals displayed a normal response to the 5-HT1A
   receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. The effect of anpirtoline on the horizontal,
   center, and vertical activities in the open field test was
   differentially affected by GSK3 beta depletion in serotonin neurons,
   wherein vertical activity, but not horizontal activity, was
   significantly altered in snGSK3 beta-KO mice. In addition, there was an
   enhanced anti-immobility response to anpirtoline in the tail suspension
   test in snGSK3 beta-KO mice. Therefore, results of this study
   demonstrated a serotonin neuron-targeting function of GSK3 beta by
   regulating 5-HT1B autoreceptors, which impacts serotonergic neuron
   firing, serotonin release, and serotonin-regulated behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce impacts of measurement errors on plant variables, data
   reconciliation is widely applied in process industries. Reconciled
   measurements are used in applications such as performance monitoring,
   process control, or real-time optimization. However, precise estimation
   generally relies on accurate and detailed process models which could be
   difficult to build in practice. The trade-off between estimate precision
   and model complexity is a relevant challenge motivating the development
   of effective observers with limited modeling efforts. This paper
   proposes a data reconciliation method based on a simple mass and/or
   energy conservation sub-model that also considers the autocovariance
   function of plant node imbalances. The observer is applied to simulated
   benchmark plants and its performance is evaluated in terms of variance
   reduction and robustness against modeling errors. Results show a
   superior performance in comparison with classical sub-model based
   methods and reveal less performance degradation than the Kalman filter
   in presence of model uncertainties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A high-temperature regenerable CO2 absorbent, Zr-stabilized CaO, was
   prepared using the surfactant template-ultrasound synthesis method in
   this work. During 15 absorption/desorption cycles, it was found that
   Zr-stabilized CaO with a Zr/Ca molar ratio of 0.303 kept the most
   favorable stability and CO2 uptake capacity among the proposed
   Zr-stabilized samples. During multiple carbonation/decarbonation cycles,
   the incorporation of zirconium inhibited the agglomeration and sintering
   of CaO particles, thereby improving the absorbent durability. The
   effects of carbonation temperature (600-700 degrees C) and surfactant
   amount used in the preparation method on the performance of the proposed
   absorbent were investigated. The results showed that an excess of
   surfactant negatively affects the absorbent structural stability.
   Multicycle CO2 capture tests carried out between 600 and 700 degrees C
   showed that an increase in carbonation temperature improved the
   absorption capacity and durability of the proposed Zr-stabilized CaO
   absorbent. In summary, the results showed a superior prolonged stability

Abstract = {{Infrared (IR) emission spectroscopy was performed on N-2 + H-2 microwave
   discharges at pressures ranging between 300 and 3000 mTorr. The relative
   atomic density of N and H was measured by optical actinometry in the IR
   region at various total gas pressures. The effect of relative hydrogen
   partial pressure (between 10 and 90\% in the discharge) on N and H
   relative density was also investigated. Although rarely studied, optical
   actinometry in the IR region has nevertheless provided numerous
   advantages over traditional techniques performed in the UV-visible
   (UV-VIS) spectral region. Results show that despite the decrease in the
   radiative state of the N and H atoms as a function of pressure, their
   ground state density increased. With increased relative hydrogen
   concentration under constant pressure, both the ground and the radiative
   state density of the H atoms increased similarly to that recorded by
   actinometry, whereas those of the N atoms decreased as expected. In
   comparing the results of the H-atom density measured in the
   well-documented UV-visible region and the IR region, optical actinometry
   confirms the accuracy of the IR method.}},

Abstract = {{The wrench-closure workspace (WCW) of parallel cable-driven mechanisms
   is the set of poses for which any wrench can be produced at the
   end-effector by a set of positive cable tensions. In this paper, we
   tackle the dimensional synthesis problem, namely, that of finding a
   geometry for a planar parallel cable-driven mechanism (PPCDM) whose WCW
   contains a prescribed workspace. To this end, we first recall a linear
   program to determine whether a given pose is inside or outside the WCW
   of a given PPCDM. The relaxation of this linear program over a box leads
   to a nonlinear feasibility problem that can only be satisfied when this
   box is completely inside the WCW. We extend this feasibility problem to
   find a PPCDM geometry whose WCW includes a given set of boxes. These
   boxes represent the prescribed workspace or an estimate thereof, which
   may be obtained through interval analysis. Finally, we introduce a
   nonlinear program through which the PPCDM geometry is changed while
   maximizing the scaling factor of the prescribed set of boxes. When the
   optimum scaling factor is greater or equal to one, the WCW of the
   resulting PPCDM contains the set of boxes. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006952]}},

   Mechanisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic balance is an important feature of high speed mechanisms and
   robotics that need to minimize vibrations of the base. The main
   disadvantage of dynamic balancing, however, is that it is accompanied
   with a considerable increase in mass and inertia. Aiming at low-mass and
   low-inertia dynamic balancing, in this article the relative importance
   of the balance parameters of common balancing principles is analyzed and
   the balancing principles are compared. To do this, the evaluation of a
   balanced rotatable link is found to be representative for a large group
   of balanced mechanisms. Therefore, a rotatable link is balanced with
   duplicate mechanisms (DM), with a countermass (CM) and a separate
   counter-rotation (SCR), and with a counter-rotary countermass (CRCM).
   The equations for the total mass and the inertia are derived and
   compared analytically while the balancing principles are compared
   numerically. The results show that the DM-balanced link is the best
   compromise for low mass and low inertia but requires a considerable
   space. For the CRCM-balanced link and the SCR-balanced link that are
   more compact, there is a trade-off between mass and inertia for which
   the CRCM-balanced link is the better of the two. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Deformable mirrors are increasingly used in astronomy. However, they
   still are limited in stroke for active correction of high-amplitude
   optical aberrations. Magnetic liquid deformable mirrors (MLDMs) are a
   new technology that has the advantages of high-amplitude deformations
   and low costs. In this paper, we demonstrate extremely high strokes and
   interactuator strokes achievable by MLDMs which can be used in
   astronomical instrumentation. In particular, we consider the use of such
   a mirror to suggest an interesting application for the next generation
   of large telescopes. We present a prototype 91 actuator deformable
   mirror made of a magnetic liquid (ferrofluid). This mirror uses a
   technique that linearizes the response of such mirrors by superimposing
   a large and uniform magnetic field on the magnetic field produced by an
   array of small coils. We discuss experimental results that illustrate
   the performance of MLDMs. A most interesting application of MLDMs comes
   from the fact they could be used to correct the aberrations of large and
   lower optical quality primary mirrors held by simple support systems. We
   estimate basic parameters of the needed MLDMs, obtaining reasonable
   values.}},

Title = {{High resolution 2D dose measurement device based on a few long
   scintillating fibers and tomographic reconstruction}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Patient-specific QA of highly conformal radiotherapy treatments
   are usually conducted using 2D or 3D dosimetry of the incident dose
   distribution in a water-equivalent phantom. However, dosimeters
   typically used for this task usually lack in either spatial resolution
   or dose accuracy. The purpose of this work is to develop and validate a
   novel type of high resolution 2D dosimeter based on the tomographic
   reconstruction of the dose projections obtained using long scintillating
   fibers for the quality assurance of modem radiotherapy techniques such
   as IMRT.
   Methods: Fifty parallel scintillating fibers were aligned in a 30 cm
   diameter cylindrical masonite phantom with a 95 cm source-to-surface
   distance and a 100 cm source-to-fibers distance. The fibers were
   disposed so that the effective detection area of the scintillating
   fibers was a 20 cm diameter disk. Both ends of each scintillating fiber
   were coupled to clear optical fibers to enable light collection by a
   single CCD camera. Seven IMRT segments and two square fields were
   acquired using 18 projections over a 170 degrees rotation of the device.
   Computation of the dose integrals was made for each scintillating fiber
   using the irradiation of known rectangular reference fields. Dose
   reconstructions were conducted using a total-variation minimization
   iterative reconstruction algorithm. Eight monitor units were programmed
   for each projection and the reconstructed dose grid pixel resolution was
   set to 1 x 1 mm(2).
   Results: 3\%/3 mm gamma tests conducted between the reconstructed IMRT
   dose distributions and the dose calculated with the treatment planning
   system Pinnacle(3) were on average successful for 99.6\% of the dose
   pixels with a predicted dose of at least 10\% of the maximum dose. The
   dose profiles for both square fields and IMRT segments agreed within 2\%
   to the dose calculated with Pinnacle3 except in high dose gradient
   regions, and were comparable to the dose measured using an ionization
   chamber array (IBA MatriXX) and radiographic films (Kodak XV2).
   Conclusions: Using tomographic reconstruction on the projections
   acquired with rotating scintillating fibers, we were able to perform
   water-equivalent 2D dosimetry of square fields and IMRT segments with
   acceptable accuracy and high spatial resolution. The underlying concept
   of tomographic dosimetry and the small number of fibers needed to
   reconstruct a given 2D dose distribution offer new dosimetric
   possibilities, both applicable to 2D and 3D dosimetry. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Ongoing research on organic growing media for greenhouse tomato
   production is driven by the constant changes in the quality, stability,
   and form of the organic byproducts used in the manufacturing of these
   media. This study was undertaken to determine appropriate irrigation set
   points for a sawdust peat mix (SP) under development given that the
   performance of this substrate appeared to be strongly dependent on
   appropriate irrigation management. A greenhouse tomato experiment was
   conducted to compare different irrigation management approaches for a SP
   substrate in the spring and summer. Using preliminary measurements from
   an initial experiment (Expt. 1), different irrigation strategies for the
   SP substrate were compared in a second experiment (Expt. 2): 1) a
   variable irrigation regime using a timer control (with frequency
   adjusted as a function of irradiance); 2) tensiometer control at 1.5
   kPa; and 3) two constant substrate water potential devices: -1.1 kPa and
   -0.9 kPa. An irrigation timer/controller using solar radiation input was
   used with a rockwool control (RC) substrate. Measurements of plant
   activity {[}photosynthesis rate and stomata! conductance (g(s))],
   substrate physical and chemical properties, biomass, and yield were
   obtained. For all irrigation strategies, results indicated that 10\% to
   20\% higher photosynthesis rates and g(s) values were obtained with the
   SP substrate compared with RC. Data indicated that moderate drying
   conditions (matric potential ranging from -2.2 kPa to 1.5 kPa in Expt. 1
   and Expt. 2, respectively) relative to container capacity (-0.6 kPa)
   were beneficial for improving plant photosynthetic activity and allowed
   the highest yields for the SP substrate. Variable irrigation management
   showed higher levels of plant activity than constant watering and
   increased the oxygen concentration in the substrate by approximate to
   2\% in absolute value relative to the constant water potential device.
   Lower CO2 and N2O levels were also observed with the variable irrigation
   strategy. On the other hand, maximum nutrient solution savings were
   achieved with the constant matric potential devices (8\% to 31\%
   relative to the RC). This study showed high productivity potential for
   the SP substrate with suitable irrigation management. Replacing
   conventional growing media with organic waste-based products using an
   appropriate irrigation strategy may help to increase the sustainability
   of the greenhouse industry.}},

   Soil Sci. 92: 711-721. Information on the forms and bioavailability of P
   from composts applied to horticultural crops under organic production
   are required to promote soil quality and plant growth while protecting
   the environment. Seven composts were selected and characterized for
   their chemical composition. The composts were mostly mature and the
   total P contained 73 to 96\% as inorganic P (Pi), although the total P
   concentration and P fractions varied amongst the materials selected for
   this study. These composts along with an inorganic P (KH2PO4) alone were
   added to three soils with contrasting chemical properties at a rate
   equivalent to 65 kg P ha(-1) and incubated in the dark at 25 degrees C.
   An unfertilized control was included to estimate soil P contribution.
   The amount and relative solubility of P from these compost-soil mixtures
   were evaluated by a modified Hedley fractionation after 2 and 16 wk of
   incubation. Results indicated that P added with composts was
   preferentially found in the Pi portion of soil labile pools after 2 and
   16 wk. Except for the dairy cattle manure compost, all composts resulted
   in the same amounts of labile P (51-58\%) and total Pi(61-98\%) in
   soils, which were significantly lower than the labile P (82\%) and close
   to the total Pi(108\%) from inorganic KH2PO4 alone. Unlike the other
   composts, the potato residue compost produced a significant increase in
   the organic P fraction (Po) extractable with NaHCO3. This study
   indicated that Pi was the most important form of P in these composts and
   in the compost-amended soils. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to
   predict the availability of compost P following its application to soil.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient smelters currently consume roughly 13 MWh of electricity per
   ton of aluminum, while roughly half of that energy is lost as thermal
   waste. Although waste heat is abundant, current thermal integration in
   primary aluminum facilities remains limited. This is due to both the low
   quality of waste heat available and the shortage of potential uses
   within reasonable distance of identified waste heat sources. In this
   article, we present a mapping of both heat dissipation processes and
   heat demands around a sample facility (Alcoa Deschambault Quebec
   smelter). Our primary aim is to report opportunities for heat recovery
   and integration in the primary aluminum industry. We consider potential
   heat-to-sink pairings individually and assess their thermodynamic
   potential for producing energy savings.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{Our previous studies demonstrated that poly(lactic acid) (PLA) air spun
   nanofiber mesh coatings could be advantageously used to promote
   monolayer endothelial cell growth on poly(ethylene terephtalate)
   vascular prostheses. PIA is one of the best candidate for this
   application because it slowly degrades, and could be thereafter
   gradually replaced by the extracellular matrix components. Thus, the key
   parameters for a successful replacement are both the mechanism and the
   rate of the poly(lactic acid) hydrolysis. Therefore in this study, the
   PLA degradation process was investigated using H-1-NMR spectroscopy.
   Contrary to classical analyses which are based on the crystallinity
   change (DSC, XRD) or on the molecular weight loss (GPC), NMR
   spectroscopy allows assessing the polymer degradation at a molecular
   level. Indeed, the analysis of H-1-NMR peak assigned to PLA end-chain
   unit can be used to measure the polymer average molecular weight and
   consequently, follow the degradation. Moreover, by using homonuclear
   decoupled H-1 NMR spectroscopy, stereosequences of the main poly(lactic
   acid) linear chain can be identified and isotactic and stereoblock
   ratios can be evaluated. Accordingly, this study investigated the
   degradation process of two different commercial poly(lactic acid)s in
   air, water and physiological serum environments during 90 days. The
   influence of the PLA initial chemical structure (stereosequences) on the
   degradation process was clearly evidenced and the time dependence of the
   relative amount of L-lactic, D-lactic, and meso-lactic units within the
   PLA structure was estimated. This NMR approach provides a better
   understanding of the polymer degradation mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A methodology is proposed to improve the groundwater budget model by
   determining the past, present, and future recharge and discharge rates.
   The model is applied to an increasingly urbanized and industrialized
   region with drying tendencies: the Toluca Valley, Mexico. This study
   includes spatially variable recharge determined from the historical
   climate data, the climate change predictions, and the multiple
   parameters used in the Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance
   (HELP3) model. Using HELP3 a spatial discretization for the average
   recharge is obtained and estimated at 376 million cubic meters per year
   (Mm(3)/year). When considering climate change predictions, by 2050 the
   average scenario projects recharge to decrease by 15 Mm(3)/year (from
   376 to 361 Mm(3)/year), and in a worst case scenario up to a maximum
   decrease of 88 Mm(3)/year (from 376 to 288 Mm(3)/year). Groundwater
   pumping has increased steadily since 1970 and is estimated at 495
   Mm(3)/year for 2010. The current average deficit estimated for 2010 is
   172 Mm(3)/year with average projections increasing to over 292
   Mm(3)/year by 2050. This study of two of the most important components
   of the water cycle (recharge and discharge) clearly shows that the
   decreasing water availability in the Toluca basin is due mainly to
   groundwater pumping and that the current pumping rates are not
   sustainable. The current deficit can be considered problematic and
   projections based on expected water consumption and climate change
   reinforce the need for management of the water resources to be
   addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental coal cores were collected from a coalbed of Sihe colliery
   and Zhaozhuang colliery, Qinshui Basin, China. Their gas effective
   permeability was studied under effects of water content and effective
   stress. The experiments were mainly carried out on a self-made
   ``Triaxial Stress Thermal-hydrological-mechanical Coal Gas
   Permeameter.{''} The results showed that when the temperatures of gas
   and coal were constant, a negative effect of either water content or
   effective stress was reported on the gas transportation, i.e., the gas
   effective permeability decreased with the increasing of water content
   under constant effective stress and it also decreased as the effective
   stress increased when the water content was constant. Under experimental
   conditions as in this study, the effects of water content and effective
   stress on the gas effective permeability was described by a
   linear-exponential equation, which presented that the gas effective
   permeability had a linear relationship with the water content and an
   exponential relationship with the effective stress. The permeation pores
   were defined as the primary places of transporting the coalbed gas. They
   were affected by water content and effective stress in different ways.
   The water content occupied the space of permeation pores, while the
   effective stress changed the shape of permeation pores. Consequently,
   the gas effective permeability was also affected by the two aspects.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with the synthesis of highly dispersed semiconducting
   nanocrystals (NCs) of cadmium sulphide (CdS), zinc sulphide (ZnS) and
   lead sulphide (PbS) through a simple and generalized process using oleic
   acid (OA) as surfactant. To synthesize these NCs, metal-oleate (M-O)
   complexes were obtained from the reaction at 140 degrees C between metal
   acetates and OA in hexanes media. Subsequently, M-O complexes were
   sulphurized using thioacetamide at the same temperature. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations
   show that the synthesized products are of nanoscale-size with highly
   crystalline cubic phase. The optical absorption of OA-capped metal
   sulphide NCs confirms that their size quantization induced a large shift
   towards visible region. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of CdS NCs shows
   a broad band-edge emission with shallow and deep-trap emissions, while
   PL spectrum of ZnS NCs reveals a broad emission due to defects states on
   the surface. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicate that fatty acid monolayers were
   bound strongly on the nanocrystal surface as a carboxylate and the two
   oxygen atoms of the carboxylate were coordinated symmetrically to the
   surface of the NCs. The strong binding between the fatty acid and the
   NCs surface enhances the stability of NCs colloids. In general, this
   generalized route has a great potential in developing nanoscale metal
   sulphides for opto-electronic devices. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This article presents the methodology and results of a hybrid numerical
   optimization study of a heating ceiling and wall hydronic radiant panel
   system in a typical residential building located in Quebec City, Canada.
   The comfort and energy consumption of the system are the two figures of
   merit that are considered in the multiobjective optimization analysis.
   The main design variables are the position and dimension of the panels,
   and the fluid inlet temperature. The hybrid numerical method features a
   20 CFD model of a typical empty room, coupled with a semi-analytic
   radiant panel model specially developed for coupling with CFD. This
   strategy allows considering the real room geometry, while providing at
   the same time accurate temperature profiles of the radiant panels and
   detailed temperature and comfort data field in the room. The results
   show that there is no unique optimal solution but rather a family of
   optimal designs (Pareto fronts) for which the solutions are trade-offs
   between the two objectives. When adjusting correctly the fluid inlet
   temperature, it is also possible to achieve nearly Pareto optimal
   solutions, even when reducing the total panel surface by 66\%. This
   means that the temperature control of the fluid is the most important
   parameter for maximizing comfort and minimizing energy consumption of
   hydronic heating radiant panels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{An extension of the capillary and thin film flow model for predicting
   the hydraulic conductivity of air-free frozen porous media}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity of frozen air-free porous media is a rather
   elusive property that remains largely undefined in much of the
   literature. According to modern science, water transport in frozen
   porous media occurs mostly in ice-free capillaries at temperatures close
   to the freezing point of pure water and through a thin liquid
   interlayer, between solid particle and ice, at lower temperatures. In
   accordance with this understanding, this paper extends the capabilities
   of an existing capillary and thin film flow model to include the
   prediction of hydraulic conductivity in frozen air-free porous media. As
   such, hydraulic conductivity of the frozen porous media is predicted
   with a simple capillary bundle model as well as with a new hydrodynamic
   model of thin interlayer flow in which film thickness is controlled by
   both London-van der Waals and ionic-electrostatic forces. As with other
   predictive models of hydraulic conductivity, most model parameters are
   derived from more easily measured water content data in either ice-free
   (water retention function) or air-free (water freezing function) porous
   media. Model results showed very good agreement with observed values of
   hydraulic conductivity taken at thermal equilibrium, and illustrated the
   importance of thin interlayer flow at lower temperatures.}},

   System}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Streptococcus thermophilus, similar to other Bacteria and Archaea, has
   developed defense mechanisms to protect cells against invasion by
   foreign nucleic acids, such as virus infections and plasmid
   transformations. One defense system recently described in these
   organisms is the CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced
   Short Palindromic Repeats loci coupled to CRISPR-associated genes). Two
   S. thermophilus CRISPR-Cas systems, CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR3-Cas, have
   been shown to actively block phage infection. The CRISPR1-Cas system
   interferes by cleaving foreign dsDNA entering the cell in a
   length-specific and orientation-dependant manner. Here, we show that the
   S. thermophilus CRISPR3-Cas system acts by cleaving phage dsDNA genomes
   at the same specific position inside the targeted protospacer as
   observed with the CRISPR1-Cas system. Only one cleavage site was
   observed in all tested strains. Moreover, we observed that the
   CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR3-Cas systems are compatible and, when both
   systems are present within the same cell, provide increased resistance
   against phage infection by both cleaving the invading dsDNA. We also
   determined that overall phage resistance efficiency is correlated to the
   total number of newly acquired spacers in both CRISPR loci.}},

Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{133}},

Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{The benefits of no till (NT) management in the short to medium terms
   need to be examined over decades of continuous cropping. Our objectives
   were to (i) assess the long term effects of tillage practices (no-till
   (NT) and mouldboard plough {[}MP]) and biennial P x N fertilizer rates
   applied to the maize phase of a two-year maize-soybean rotation on grain
   yield, Mehlich-3 P (P-M3), and Olsen P (P-Ol), and (ii) determine
   whether NT practice affects the relationships between P-M3, P-Ol and P
   budgets. The study site was established in 1992 on a clay loam soil of
   the St-Blaise series (Dark Grey Gleysol). The experimental design is a
   split plot with NT and MP assigned to main plots and nine combinations
   of 3 P (0, 17.5, and 35 kg P ha(-1)) and 3 N (0, 80, and 160 kg N
   ha(-1)) additions assigned to subplots. Maize and soybean grain yield
   response to P additions was obtained only twice between 1992 and 2010.
   On average, grain yields were reduced by 10-25\% in NT compared to MP
   treatments in 11 years. The dynamics over years of P-M3 and P-Ol (0-15
   cm) in unfertilized P treatment was similar in NT and MP. In contrast, P
   fertilized NT maintained greater P-M3 and P-Ol than MP. This difference
   in soil tests P was due to greater P accumulation in the 0-5 cm and 5-10
   cm soil layers of NT. Under MP, soil tests P and P budgets over the P
   treatments were linearly related and for this specific MP treatment, we
   calculated that a P budget of +/- 100 kg P ha(-1) would change P-M3 by
   12 kg ha(-1) and P-Ol by 7 kg ha(-1). Under NT, a cubic model fitted
   closely to the experimental data due principally to a more than
   proportional change in soil tests P relative to P budgets in fertilized
   P treatments. We conclude that additions of P fertilizer in NT systems
   changes the dynamics of P in the rooting zone, suggesting the importance
   of approaches to monitor P dynamics specifically tailored for NT systems
   that integrates the variability caused by the absence of mixing the
   fertilizer, residues, and soil. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Among dsDNA tailed bacteriophages (Caudovirales), members of the
   Myoviridae family have the most sophisticated virion design that
   includes a complex contractile tail structure. The Myoviridae generally
   have larger genomes than the other phage families. Relatively few
   ``dwarf'' myoviruses, those with a genome size of less than 50 kb such
   as those of the Mu group, have been analyzed in extenso. Here we report
   on the genome sequencing and morphological characterization of a new
   group of such phages that infect a diverse range of Proteobacteria,
   namely Aeromonas salmonicida phage 56, Vibrio cholerae phages 138 and
   CP-T1, Bdellovibrio phage phi 1422, and Pectobacterium carotovorum phage
   ZF40. This group of dwarf myoviruses shares an identical virion
   morphology, characterized by usually short contractile tails, and have
   genome sizes of approximately 45 kb. Although their genome sequences are
   variable in their lysogeny, replication, and host adaption modules,
   presumably reflecting differing lifestyles and hosts, their structural
   and morphogenesis modules have been evolutionarily constrained by their
   virion morphology. Comparative genomic analysis reveals that these
   phages, along with related prophage genomes, form a new coherent group
   within the Myoviridae. The results presented in this communication
   support the hypothesis that the diversity of phages may be more
   structured than generally believed and that the innumerable phages in
   the biosphere all belong to discrete lineages or families.}},

Abstract = {{To address the drawbacks of aqueous alkanolamine based state-of-the-art
   technology for industrial scale carbon dioxide capture, among a number
   of options, alkanolamine/room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) systems
   are also being tested as a likely replacement. These new schemes seem to
   be a better alternative to hamper corrosion occurrence. Omission of the
   aqueous phase marks abolition of probable oxidizing species mainly
   responsible for corrosion in water-based chemical absorption processes.
   In the present study, the corrosion phenomenon in amine/room-temperature
   ionic liquid blends comprised of alkanolamine/s (monoethanolamine,
   2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, diethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine) and
   hydrophilic room-temperature ionic liquid ({[}BMIM]{[}BF4],
   {[}EMIM]{[}BF4], and {[}EMIM]{[}Otf]) has been investigated by
   systematically probing the effect of amine/RTIL type, process
   temperature, CO2 loading, presence/absence of oxygen in flue gas, as
   well as the influence of water content. The analytical techniques
   exercised in this regard include linear polarization resistance (LPR),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDX).}},

Abstract = {{Factors affecting carbon dioxide fixation in chrysotile mining residues
   (CMR) under environmental conditions were studied by reproducing mineral
   dissolution and carbonation in laboratory columns packed with CMR
   particles. Carbonation is very sensitive to water saturation and
   watering frequency of the CMR porous media. CO2 uptake by dry residues
   subjected to dry CO2 flow for several days at ambient temperature was
   below 0.02\%. However, an increase by a factor of 20 in CO2 uptake was
   achieved by periodic addition of small amounts of water with respect to
   a moistened CO2 stream over dry CMR samples. The highest MgCO3
   conversion resulted in nearly 22 mg of CO2 captured per gram of residue,
   revealing that up to 93\% of Mg remained noncarbonated because of
   surface obstructing processes. Magnesium leaching from CMR was hindered
   by two concomitant passivation phenomena limiting the residue's CO2
   storage capacity. A unique cyclic voltammetry technique using oxic and
   anoxic aqueous solutions contacted with CMR fixed beds was implemented
   to assess the relative importance from CMR-borne iron electrochemical
   passivation and silica-deposit nonelectrochemical passivation.
   Passivation around the dissolving CMR particles by iron hydroxide
   precipitation was found to develop very rapidly in comparison to silica
   gel polymerization.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional hydrodynamic losses are assessed in this investigation
   for a foil oscillating sinusoidally in a combined heave and pitch motion

   Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (URANS) solver on an oscillating foil in
   a power-extraction mode; thus acting as a hydrokinetic turbine at high
   Reynolds number. Foils of various aspect ratios (span to chord length
   ratio) are considered, both with and without endplates for one
   representative operation point. Hydrodynamic forces and extracted power
   are compared with results from the equivalent two-dimensional (2D)

   (cycle-averaged power extracted) due to 3D hydrodynamic losses can be
   limited to 10\% of the 2D prediction when endplates are used on a foil
   of aspect ratio greater than ten. The practical consideration of an
   oscillating-foil hydrokinetic turbine operating in an
   imperfectly-aligned upstream water flow is also addressed with

   DIAGENESIS IN A MIDDLE JURASSIC STROMATACTIS CARBONATE MUD MOUND,
   SAINTE-BAUME MASSIF, SE FRANCE}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the processes and conditions of chertification in
   carbonates is a challenging problem to assess the marine silica cycle.
   This contribution highlights parameters of internal silica recycling
   processes from their biogenic source to quartz cementation by describing
   a unique case of carbonate silica diagenesis in a Mesozoic mud mound.
   Stromatactis carbonate mud mounds exposed in the Sainte-Baume Massif
   (Basse Provence, France) developed in an outer-shelf environment during
   the late Aalenian concavum ammonite Zone (Middle Jurassic). They form
   part of a cherty succession punctuated by hardgrounds and
   stratigraphically condensed intervals, interpreted to record deepening
   episodes. These mud mounds, rich in siliceous sponge spicules and
   stromatactis, are similar to their widespread Paleozoic counterparts but
   are particular in being extensively silicified.
   Carbonate silica paragenesis forms a polymud fabric including four
   microcrystalline carbonates (M1 to M4; all low-Mg calcite, LMC), five
   spar cements (C1 to C5; C1 with high-Mg calcite, HMC, precursor
   mineralogy), and four silica phases (S1 to S4; S1 to S3 replacive
   chalcedony after opal-CT, S4 euhedral quartz cement). M1, assumedly
   related to the degradative calcification of siliceous sponges, forms a
   labyrinthine network into which M2 to M4 were infiltrated. Spar cements
   C1 to C3 include a successive decrease of delta O-18 at fairly
   invariable delta C-13, interpreted to represent marine to shallow burial
   conditions, suggesting burial and successive transformation of marine
   bottom waters. Temperature estimation, based on the average delta O-18
   value of C4 (delta O-18 approximate to 7.9 parts per thousand),
   indicates a temperature of around 50 degrees C at a maximum burial depth
   of about 1000 meters. Replacive chalcedony (S1 to S3) occurs between
   calcite cementation C3 and C4 in combination with traces of corrosion on
   C3. Mg-calcite was preferably replaced, particularly the precursor of
   cement C1 that surrounds peloids of M2, and preserved some ghost
   structures. Corrosion and substrate selectivity suggest that
   acidification, Mg-hydroxyl complexes, and surface area are the triggers
   for flocculation of a silica gel. Because dissolution of opaline sponge
   spicules started almost contemporaneously with C1, the dissolved silica
   was retained in a connate fluid as phases C1 to C3 were precipitated,
   and stagnant conditions prevailed for around 1 Ma. Bulk delta O-18/delta
   D values (S1- S3) below the marine chert line, together with the range
   of S1-S3 delta O-18 (delta O-18 SMOW = 28.3 parts per thousand +/- 1.0)
   suggest silica flocculation in a shallow burial environment at
   temperatures of 25-30 degrees C. The establishment of acidic conditions
   might have been favored by sulfide-oxidizing micro-organisms.
   Numerical simulation of early diagenetic silica flux in such marine
   sediments is consistent with the interpretation that small grain-size
   changes and fluid barriers (that create diffusion-controlled
   conditions), such as those induced by stratigraphic condensation, are
   key parameters to retain pore-water dissolved silica over geologic time.
   Inversely, Paleozoic stromatactis carbonate mud mounds typically form
   part of large-scale coarsening- and shallowing-upward successions that
   correspond to rapid burial. These conditions support convergent
   pore-water flux and drainage of pore-water dissolved silica in the
   shallow burial realm. Hence, spicule-rich mounds should tend to silicify
   if they form part of a condensed section.}},

   Monitors}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEM SECURITY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Runtime monitoring is an increasingly popular method to ensure the safe
   execution of untrusted codes. Monitors observe and transform the
   execution of these codes, responding when needed to correct or prevent a
   violation of a user-defined security policy. Prior research has shown
   that the set of properties monitors can enforce correlates with the
   latitude they are given to transform and alter the target execution. But
   for enforcement to be meaningful this capacity must be constrained,
   otherwise the monitor can enforce any property, but not necessarily in a
   manner that is useful or desirable. However, such constraints have not
   been significantly addressed in prior work. In this article, we develop
   a new paradigm of security policy enforcement in which the behavior of
   the enforcement mechanism is restricted to ensure that valid aspects
   present in the execution are preserved notwithstanding any
   transformation it may perform. These restrictions capture the desired
   behavior of valid executions of the program, and are stated by way of a
   preorder over sequences. The resulting model is closer than previous
   ones to what would be expected of a real-life monitor, from which we
   demand a minimal footprint on both valid and invalid executions. We
   illustrate this framework with examples of real-life security
   properties. Since several different enforcement alternatives of the same
   property are made possible by the flexibility of this type of
   enforcement, our study also provides metrics that allow the user to
   compare monitors objectively and choose the best enforcement paradigm
   for a given situation.}},

Abstract = {{Todays' networks are becoming increasingly complex. They must provide a
   growing variety of services to a wide range of devices. In order to do
   so, they must make efficient use of modern technologies including MIMO,
   macrodiversity, power control, channel allocation, beamforming, and so
   on.
   In this context, the centralized management of radio resources on a
   large scale is rapidly becoming intractable. Distributed intelligence
   constitutes an increasingly attractive solution to provide network-wide
   self-configuration and adaptation capabilities. This article presents
   the design of a swarming system for autonomous power control which
   adapts naturally to the changing conditions of mobile networks where
   interference patterns are in constant flux. Empirical methods proposed
   by Parunak {[}1997] to develop MultiAgent Systems with Swarming (MASS)
   are applied to the current context while emphasizing the key concepts
   that lead to swarming (emergent behavior). A simulation-based study
   reveals how the system can be fine-tuned to obtain various solutions,
   balancing resources differently to achieve different trade-off points.
   Finally, it is shown that the distributed approach based on swarming is
   not only feasible but leads to higher global QoS levels than comparable
   centralized approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the dielectric nature of polypropylene and the

   final structure of the cellular films were investigated. Three grades of
   calcium carbonate (CaCO3) filler having an average particle size of 0.7,
   3 and 12 mu m were used. An optimized cellular film was developed by
   biaxial stretching and inflating a film made from three hot-pressed
   polypropylene sheets filled with 20 wt\% of calcium carbonate particles
   with an average size of 12 mu m. The cells have an average length of 35
   mu m and height of 4 mu m with a density ratio of 0.8. Its particle size
   distribution compares favorably with those available in open literature.}},

Abstract = {{The falling weight deflectometer is a pavement analysis tool that is now
   widely used in the pavement engineering field. Using the backcalculation
   process and the measured deflection basin, the layers moduli can be
   determined and a mechanistic analysis of the pavement can be made. A new
   approach is proposed to bypass the necessity of the backcalculation by
   allowing a direct estimation of the tensile strain at the bottom of
   asphalt concrete using the deflection basin. A model based on a finite
   element theoretical pavement analysis is proposed for this purpose.
   Complementary models have been developed to use the proposed models
   without having to determine the layers moduli. The proposed model to
   estimate the tensile strain at the bottom of the asphalt concrete layers
   is validated and calibrated using data obtained on an instrumented
   experimental site.}},

Abstract = {{The present review highlights the state-of-the-art electro-activation as
   a science and the applications of electro-activated aqueous solutions in
   biotechnology and the food industry. The science behind
   electro-activation remains unknown. Hence, this review focuses on
   understanding the mechanisms governing the process of obtaining
   electro-activated aqueous solutions. Several applications in
   biotechnology and the food industry are discussed. Among the potential
   applications of this technology, reagentless chemical catalysis and food
   safety seem to be the most promising.
   Industrial relevance: Electro-activated solution can be successfully
   used in the food industry and biotechnology for:
   Selective protein and fiber extraction from different meal residues.
   Self-generation of acidic and alkaline conditions for different
   catalytic applications.
   Electro-activated solutions can be used as sanitizing agents for work
   area cleaning in food processing industries.
   Electro-activated solutions can be used for prevention of bio-films

Abstract = {{Reconstituted collagen gels are widely used as scaffolds even though
   their low strength and poor elasticity limit their applications in VTE.
   Here, two approaches are adopted to modify their mechanical behavior: in
   the first, gels prepared under physiologic conditions are remodeled by
   cell-mediated contraction; in the second, gels prepared in
   non-physiologic conditions are chemically crosslinked. Samples are
   tested under cyclic loading and their viscoelastic behavior is assessed.
   The results show that both approaches result in lattices with adequate
   strength, and crosslinking significantly reduces hysteresis and
   permanent deformation. SEM shows that SMCs are capable of contracting
   and remodeling all the lattices, confirming that these are suitable
   supports for tissue regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Preferential flow refers to a flow transport pattern where water and
   solute flows around the soil matrix, contributing to accelerating
   velocity of movement in the soil; soil recharge occurs over the whole
   inlet boundary. Preferential flow is produced by a large number of
   macropores and fractures in the soil, such as root or worm holes, and is
   very important to groundwater recharge owing to its rapid movement.
   Using the reaction of iodine turning blue on contact with starch,
   outdoor tracer experiments of heterogeneous flow in clay loam for
   different scales and boundary conditions are designed, so that the
   heterogeneous flow patterns can be studied. Using experimental image
   analysis, the soil is divided into a matrix and a preferential channel
   network, formed by the spatial structure of the flow channels. An
   irregular flow network is established through random generation of
   angles, lengths, aperture and location coordinates of flow channels, in
   order to achieve an accurate description of preferential flow channels.
   According to the soil moisture of each layer obtained by tracer
   experiments, soil water retention curve and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, soil moisture variation was simulated. The distribution of
   the channel network and models of water movement in the soil are used to
   undertake a quantitative analysis of the influence of preferential flow
   on soil water migration.}},

Abstract = {{Lactococcus lactis phage infections are costly for the dairy industry
   because they can slow down the fermentation process and adversely impact
   product safety and quality. Although many strategies have been developed
   to better control phage populations, new virulent phages continue to
   emerge. Thus, it is beneficial to develop an efficient method for the
   routine identification of new phages within a dairy plant to rapidly
   adapt antiphage tactics. Here, we present a multilocus sequence typing
   (MIST) scheme for the characterization of the 936-like phages, the most
   prevalent phage group infecting L laths strains worldwide. The proposed
   MIST system targets the internal portion of five highly conserved
   genomic sequences belonging to the packaging, morphogenesis, and lysis
   modules. Our MIST scheme was used to analyze 100 phages with different
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns isolated from
   11 different countries between 1971 and 2010. PCR products were obtained
   for all the phages analyzed, and sequence analysis highlighted the high
   discriminatory power of the MIST system, detecting 93 different sequence
   types. A conserved locus within the lys gene (coding for endolysin) was
   the most discriminative, with 65 distinct alleles. The locus within the
   mcp gene (major capsid protein) was the most conserved (54 distinct
   alleles). Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated sequences exhibited
   a strong concordance of the clusters with the phage host range,
   indicating the clonal evolution of these phages. A public database has
   been set up for the proposed MIST system, and it can be accessed at
   http://pubmlst.org/bacteriophages/.}},

Abstract = {{Odours from animal facilities can negatively affect the quality of life
   of nearby residents leading to conflicts between neighbours. Ammonia
   (NH3) is considered as the main odour-causing compound. With the recent
   shift in Quebec's egg production systems from deep-pit manure storage to
   manure belt removal systems, the change in odour and NH3 emissions horn
   these systems is of interest. The objective was to compare odour
   emissions, hedonic tones and NH3 emissions from three cage layer housing
   systems: a deep liquid manure pit and a manure belt with natural or
   forced air drying. The former system consists of ``A{''} frame layer
   cagi!s located over a closed pit containing the hens' droppings into
   which water is added to facilitate removal by pumping. Manure belt
   techniques imply that manure drops on a belt beneath each row of battery
   cages where it is either dried naturally or by forced air until it is
   removed. The experiment was replicated with 360 hens reared in twelve
   independent bench-scale rooms during eight weeks (19-27 weeks of age).
   The manure belt systems reduced between 37 and 42\%10.164 and 0.178 OU
   s(-1) hen(-1), respectively) odour emissions, between 43 and 44\% (-1.19
   and -1.17, respectively) hedonic tones and between 92 and 94\% (32.0 and
   24.2 g yr(-1) hen(-1), respectively) NH3 emissions with regard to the
   deep-pit system (389 g NH3 yr(-1) hen(-1), -2.06 and 0.283 ou s(-1)
   hen(-1)). It appears that the use of manure belt systems should be
   encouraged since they significantly decrease odour emissions, hedonic
   tones and NH3 emissions. (C) 2012 lAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We introduce a conjectural construction for an extension to superspace
   of the Macdonald polynomials. The construction, which depends on certain
   orthogonality and triangularity relations, is tested for high degrees.
   We conjecture a simple form for the norm of the Macdonald polynomials in
   superspace and a rather non-trivial expression for their evaluation. We
   study the limiting cases q = 0 and q = a, which lead to two families of
   Hall-Littlewood polynomials in superspace. We also find that the
   Macdonald polynomials in superspace evaluated at q = t = 0 or q = t = a
   seem to generalize naturally the Schur functions. In particular, their
   expansion coefficients in the corresponding Hall-Littlewood bases appear
   to be polynomials in t with nonnegative integer coefficients. More
   strikingly, we formulate a generalization of the Macdonald positivity
   conjecture to superspace: the expansion coefficients of the Macdonald
   superpolynomials expanded into a modified version of the Schur
   superpolynomial basis (the q = t = 0 family) are polynomials in q and t
   with nonnegative integer coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a joint redundancy and imperfect preventive
   maintenance planning optimization model for series-parallel multi-state
   degraded systems. Non identical multi-state components can be used in
   parallel to improve the system availability by providing redundancy in
   subsystems. Multiple component choices are available in the market for
   each subsystem. The status of each component is considered to degrade
   with use. The objective is to determine jointly the maximal-availability
   series-parallel system structure and the appropriate preventive
   maintenance actions, subject to a budget constraint. System availability
   is defined as the ability to satisfy consumer demand that is represented
   as a piecewise cumulative load curve. A procedure is used, based on
   Markov processes and universal moment generating function, to evaluate
   the multi-state system availability and the cost function. A heuristic
   approach is also proposed to solve the formulated problem. This
   heuristic is based on a combination of space partitioning, genetic
   algorithms (GA) and tabu search (TS). After dividing the search space
   into a set of disjoint subsets, this approach uses GA to select the
   subspaces, and applies TS to each selected sub-space. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new concept to harness bubble dynamics in bubbling fluidization of
   Geldart D particles was proposed. Various geometrical declinations of a
   cold-prototype corrugated-wall bubbling fluidized bed were compared at
   different flow rates (Ug) to conventional flat-wall fluidized bed using
   high-speed digital image analysis. Hydrodynamic studies were carried out
   to appraise the effect of triangular-shaped wall corrugation on
   incipient fluidization, bubble coalescence (size and frequency), bubble
   rise velocity, and pressure drop. Bubble size and rise velocity in
   corrugated-wall beds were appreciably lower, at given Ug/Umb, than in
   flat-wall beds with equal flow cross-sectional areas and initial bed
   heights. The decrease (increase) in size (frequency) of bubbles during
   their rise was sustained by their periodic breakups while protruding
   through the necks between corrugated plates. Euler-Euler transient full
   three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulations helped shape
   an understanding of the impact of corrugation geometry on lowering the
   minimum bubbling fluidization and improving gas distribution. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Laser ablation ICP-MS analysis has been applied to many accessory
   minerals in order to understand better the process by which the rock
   formed and for provenance discrimination. We have determined trace
   element concentrations of Fe-oxides in massive sulfides that form
   Ni-Cu-PGE deposits at the base of the Sudbury Igneous Complex in Canada.
   The samples represent the crystallization products of fractionating
   sulfide liquids and consist of early-forming Fe-rich monosulfide
   solution (MSS) cumulates and residual Cu-rich intermediate solid
   solution (ISS). This study shows that Fe-oxide geochemistry is a
   sensitive petrogenetic indicator for the degree of fractionation of the
   sulfide liquid and provides an insight into the partitioning of elements
   between sulfide and Fe-oxide phases. In addition, it is useful in
   determining the provenance of detrital Fe-oxide.
   In a sulfide melt, all lithophile elements (Cr, Ti, V, Al, Mn, Sc, Nb,
   Ga, Ge, Ta, Hf, W and Zr) are compatible into Fe-oxide. The
   concentrations of these elements are highest in the early-forming
   Fe-oxide (titanomagnetite) which crystallized with Fe-rich MSS. Upon the
   continual crystallization of Fe-oxide from the sulfide liquid, the
   lithophile elements gradually decrease so that late-forming Fe-oxide
   (magnetite), which crystallized from the residual Cu-rich liquid, is
   depleted in these elements. This behavior is in contrast with Fe-oxides
   that crystallized from a fractionating silicate melt, whereby the
   concentration of incompatible elements, such as Ti, increases rather
   than decreases. The behavior of the chalcophile elements in magnetite is
   largely controlled by the crystallization of the sulfide minerals with
   only Ni, Co, Zn, Mo, Sn and Pb present above detection limit in
   magnetite. Nickel, Mo and Co are compatible in Fe-rich MSS and thus the
   co-crystallizing Fe-oxide is depleted in these elements. In contrast,
   magnetite that crystallized later from the fractionated liquid with
   Cu-rich ISS is enriched in Ni, Mo and Co because Fe-rich MSS is absent.
   The concentrations of Sn and Pb, which are incompatible with Fe-rich
   MSS, are highest in magnetite that formed from the fractionated Cu-rich
   liquid. At subsolidus temperatures, ilmenite exsolved from
   titanomagnetite whereas Al-spinel exsolved from the cores of some
   magnetite, locally redistributing the trace elements. However, during
   laser ablation ICP-MS analysis of these Fe-oxides both the magnetite and
   its exsolution products are ablated so that the analysis represents the
   original magmatic composition of the Fe-oxide that crystallized from the
   sulfide melt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a prospect of identifying cheap and abundant mineral sources for
   biomass catalytic steam gasification, the catalytic steam reforming
   activity of two naturally-occurring iron-bearing mineral silicate ores
   containing chrysotile and lizardite, was probed using benzene model-tar
   compound co-mixed with simulated syngas at varying H-2, CO, CO2, CH4 and
   steam compositions. Abundant intra-/extra-framework iron entwined within
   these silicates revealed remarkable steam cracking catalytic properties.
   The activity of the silicate ores was benchmarked against that of a
   common tar-cracking olivine catalyst at identical temperature, iron
   loading and particle size. Benzene conversion of chrysotile and
   chrysotile/lizardite ores exhibited up to a fourfold increase compared
   to olivine. Activity toward benzene and methane conversions, and coke
   formation were very sensitive to the ratio of reductive (H-2 and CO) to
   oxidative (H2O and CO2) gases in syngas whereas benzene conversion of
   chrysotile and chrysotile/lizardite ores exhibited up to a fourfold
   increase compared to olivine. The reaction studies were interpreted in
   light of iron oxidation state and coordination, and reducibility and
   particle size of iron oxides as determined using Mossbauer spectroscopy,
   temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{The relatively small binding energy in nuclei suggests that they may be
   well represented by near-BPS Skyrmions since their mass is roughly
   proportional to the baryon number A. For that purpose, we propose a
   generalization of the Skyrme model with terms up to order six in
   derivatives of the pion fields and treat the nonlinear sigma and Skyrme
   terms as small perturbations. For our special choice of mass term (or
   potential) V, we obtain well-behaved analytical BPS-type solutions with
   nonshell configurations for the baryon density, as opposed to the more
   complex shell-like configurations found in most extensions of the Skyrme
   model. Along with static and (iso)rotational energies, we add to the
   mass of the nuclei the often neglected Coulomb energy and isospin
   breaking term. Fitting the four model parameters, we find a remarkable
   agreement for the binding energy per nucleon B/A with respect to
   experimental data. These results support the idea that nuclei could be
   near-BPS Skyrmions.}},

Abstract = {{Reported are the results of a coherence bandwidth experimental
   investigation of broadband propagation measurements for future
   millimetre-wave WLANs. Based on a sweeping-frequency sounding technique
   (59.6-60.6 GHz), the channel coherence bandwidth (B-c) is estimated in
   two typical indoor environments: (a) a 20 m, non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
   T-shaped corridors intersection, with and without the presence of a
   transmission route deflecting obstacle (DO), and (b) a line-of-sight
   (LOS) empty conference room. Results demonstrate thats millimetre-wave
   communications are very sensitive to the propagation environment. Thus,
   precise information of phases and amplitudes across the band of interest
   are essential for accurate estimation of the channel B-c. Results also
   indicate that the NLOS millimetre-wave environments are very hostile and
   the presence of DOs might enhance significantly the millimetre-wave
   propagation characteristics including the channel B-c.}},

   Gaussian monocycle}},
Journal = {{IET COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1068-1074}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{UWB impulse radio transmissions are power limited as they must respect a
   frequency mask with low total permitted power and severe isolation
   requirements for the GPS band. Shaping of the short UWB impulse
   maximizes transmit power subject to these constraints. We have
   previously published results for intricate pulse shaping in the optical
   domain that achieves record levels of power transmission. The most
   successful pulse shaping techniques in the electrical domain have been
   achieved with derivatives of the Gaussian pulse shape. The Gaussian
   monocycle is a low performance choice in terms of transmit power, but
   nonetheless the subject of intense research activity. In this paper we
   compare and contrast these UWB pulses, and quantitatively compare their
   performance in realistic systems (specific RF and antenna hardware).
   There is the perception that failings in the pulse shape (especially for
   the monocycle) can be compensated by simple highpass filter and the
   bandpass nature of the UWB antenna. We fabricate and characterize two
   UWB antenna designs available in the literature, as well as one
   commercial antenna. We use our optical pulse shaping device to
   experimentally investigate the three different pulse shapes and measure
   their transmitted power spectral density with each of the UWB antennas.
   We find that the monocycle is significantly less powerful than the
   others. The fine pulse shaping available in optical processing provides
   1.7 to 2.9 dB gain over the electrical processing methods, depending on
   the antenna used.}},

Title = {{POSSIBLE DISINTEGRATING SHORT-PERIOD SUPER-MERCURY ORBITING KIC 12557548}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{752}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{We report on the discovery of stellar occultations, observed with
   Kepler, which recur periodically at 15.685 hr intervals, but which vary
   in depth from a maximum of 1.3\% to a minimum that can be less than
   0.2\%. The star that is apparently being occulted is KIC 12557548, a V =
   16 mag K dwarf with T-eff,T-s similar or equal to 4400 K. The
   out-of-occultation behavior shows no evidence for ellipsoidal light
   variations, indicating that the mass of the orbiting object is less than
   similar to 3 M-J (for an orbital period of 15.7 hr). Because the eclipse
   depths are highly variable, they cannot be due solely to transits of a
   single planet with a fixed size. We discuss but dismiss a scenario
   involving a binary giant planet whose mutual orbit plane precesses,
   bringing one of the planets into and out of a grazing transit. This
   scenario seems ruled out by the dynamical instability that would result
   from such a configuration. We also briefly consider an eclipsing binary,
   possibly containing an accretion disk, that either orbits KIC 12557548
   in a hierarchical triple configuration or is nearby on the sky, but we
   find such a scenario inadequate to reproduce the observations. The much
   more likely explanation-but one which still requires more quantitative
   development-involves macroscopic particles escaping the atmosphere of a
   slowly disintegrating planet not much larger than Mercury in size. The
   particles could take the form of micron-sized pyroxene or aluminum oxide
   dust grains. The planetary surface is hot enough to sublimate and create
   a high-Z atmosphere; this atmosphere may be loaded with dust via cloud
   condensation or explosive volcanism. Atmospheric gas escapes the planet
   via a Parker-type thermal wind, dragging dust grains with it. We infer a
   mass-loss rate from the observations of order 1 M-circle plus Gyr(-1),
   with a dust-to-gas ratio possibly of order unity. For our fiducial 0.1
   M-circle plus planet (twice the mass of Mercury), the evaporation
   timescale may be similar to 0.2 Gyr. Smaller mass planets are disfavored
   because they evaporate still more quickly, as are larger mass planets
   because they have surface gravities too strong to sustain outflows with
   the requisite mass-loss rates. The occultation profile evinces an
   ingress-egress asymmetry that could reflect a comet-like dust tail
   trailing the planet; we present simulations of such a tail.}},

Abstract = {{Task group 43 (TG43)-based dosimetry algorithms are efficient for
   brachytherapy dose calculation in water. However, human tissues have
   chemical compositions and densities different than water. Moreover, the
   mutual shielding effect of seeds on each other (interseed attenuation)
   is neglected in the TG43-based dosimetry platforms. The scientific
   community has expressed the need for an accurate dosimetry platform in
   brachytherapy. The purpose of this paper is to present ALGEBRA, a Monte
   Carlo platform for dosimetry in brachytherapy which is sufficiently fast
   and accurate for clinical and research purposes. ALGEBRA is based on the
   GEANT4 Monte Carlo code and is capable of handling the DICOM RT standard
   to recreate a virtual model of the treated site. Here, the performance
   of ALGEBRA is presented for the special case of LDR brachytherapy in
   permanent prostate and breast seed implants. However, the algorithm is
   also capable of handling other treatments such as HDR brachytherapy.}},

Abstract = {{A model for liquid-gas flow (MLGF), considering the free movement of

   gas distribution in a full-scale Caroussel oxidation ditch with surface
   aeration. It was calibrated and validated by field measurement data, and
   the calibrated parameters and sections were selected based on both model
   analysis and numerical computation. The simulated velocities of MLGF
   were compared to that of a model for wastewater-sludge flow (MWSF). The
   results show that the free liquid surface considered in MLGF improves
   the simulated velocity results of upper layer and surface. Moreover,
   distribution of gas volume fraction (GVF) simulated by MLGF was compared
   to dissolved oxygen (DO) measured in the oxidation ditch. It is shown
   that DO distribution is affected by many factors besides GVF
   distribution.}},

   Significant dip phenomenon was observed in velocity profiles under

   intensities illustrated convex distribution for both accelerating and

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to study the characterization and CO2
   sorption behavior of sodium zirconate (Na2ZrO3) nanoparticle prepared
   using surfactant template/ultrasound assisted method. The behavior of
   prepared Na2ZrO3 adsorbents was also compared with that of Na2ZrO3
   prepared by (i) simple surfactant template method (without sonication)
   and (ii) conventional precursor liquid-state mixing. Samples prepared by
   surfactant template technique were found to be instable during the very
   high temperature operation, resulting in the loss of material porosity
   and creation of sintered particles. Therefore, less activity of Na2ZrO3
   samples fabricated by surfactant template (with or without sonication)
   was obtained during cyclic CO2 sorption operation. For example, the
   conventional Na2ZrO3 sample (NaZr-5) fabricated by simple liquid-mixing
   method was characterized by about 10\% CO2 uptake capacity reduction at
   the end of the fourth adsorption cycle conducted under pure CO2, while
   the sample NaZr-1 (the most efficient sample among all adsorbents
   prepared by the surfactant template/sonication technique) resulted in
   about 23\% capacity reduction. The sorption behavior at different CO2
   partial pressures confirmed an adequate performance of all prepared
   samples even at CO2 partial pressure as low as 0.3 bar. However, the
   further decrease to 0.1 bar resulted in considerable reduction in CO2
   uptake capacity and kinetics. The adsorption results for sample NaZr-5
   were modeled using the double exponential equation representing both CO2
   chemisorption and ion diffusion processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) is a powerful technique
   that could serve to rapidly characterize cell culture protein expression
   profile and be used as a process monitoring and control tool. However,
   this application is often hampered by both the sample proteome and the
   LCMS signal complexities as well as the variability of this signal. To
   alleviate this problem, culture samples are usually extensively
   fractionated and pretreated before being analyzed by top-end
   instruments. Such an approach precludes LCMS usage for routine on-line
   or at-line application. In this work, by applying multivariate analysis
   (MA) directly on raw LCMS signals, we were able to extract relevant
   information from cell culture samples that were simply lyzed. By using
   the recombinant adenovirus production process as a model, we were able
   to follow the accumulation of the three major proteins produced,
   identified their accumulation dynamics, and draw useful conclusions from
   these results. The combination of LCMS and MA provides a simple, rapid,
   and precise means to monitor cell culture.}},

Abstract = {{Intense browsing by abundant large herbivores can threaten the
   ecological integrity of ecosystems by inducing modifications in the
   structure and composition of vegetation that trigger trophic cascades
   affecting plant and animal communities. We investigated the
   relationships between density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)), forest succession after clear-cut, and
   songbird communities on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. We
   hypothesized that lower deer densities would alter the trajectory of
   forest succession after clear-cutting and lead to a rapid recovery of
   habitat attributes favorable to songbirds associated with a dense
   complex shrub layer. Six years after establishing a controlled browsing
   experiment (0, 7.5, 15, and > 27 deer.km(-2)) in recent clearcuts,
   reducing deer densities <= 7.5 deer.km(-2) initiated the restoration of
   balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) forests and increased the
   regeneration of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall). Increasing
   birch ground cover from 10\% to 20\% increased songbird total abundance,
   species richness, and diversity by 17\%, 39\%, and 31\%, respectively.
   Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum Brewster, 1895) was only present at
   <= 7.5 deer.km(-2) and strongly associated with birch regeneration. The
   regeneration of browse-resistant plants such as white spruce (Picea
   glauca (Moench) Voss) in some areas at high deer density favored the
   maintenance of many shrub-dependent songbirds but also species usually
   associated with forest canopy. Active management of deer populations in
   Canadian harvested boreal forests will mitigate losses in vegetation and
   songbirds caused by over-browsing.}},

Volume = {{423}},

Abstract = {{The galaxy NGC 1313 has attracted the attention of various studies due
   to the peculiar morphology observed in optical bands, although it is
   classified as a barred, late-type galaxy with no apparent close-by
   companions. However, the velocity field suggests an interaction with a
   satellite companion. Using resolved stellar populations, we study
   different parts of the galaxy to understand further its morphology.
   Based on Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS)
   images, we estimated star formation histories by means of the synthetic
   colourmagnitude diagram method in different areas in the galaxy.
   Incompleteness limits our analysis to ages younger than similar to 100
   Myr. Stars in the red and blue He-burning phases are used to trace the
   distribution of recent star formation. Star formation histories suggest
   a burst in the south-western region. We support the idea that NGC 1313
   is experiencing an interaction with a satellite companion, observed as a
   tidally disrupted satellite galaxy in the south-west of NGC 1313.
   However, we do not observe any indication of a perturbation due to the
   interaction with the satellite galaxy at other locations across the
   galaxy, suggesting that only a modest-sized companion that did not
   trigger a global starburst was involved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Manure is the main waste of raising livestock, when
   spreading in soils can cause surface and ground water pollution. The
   management of manure is associated with emissions of greenhouse gases
   and odours. Dry manure contains at least 45\% of carbon. This is an
   attractive characteristic for energetic valorisation. To use manure in
   the production of energy, it must be previously dried. RESULTS: Wet
   solids from swine manure containing 30\% of dry matter were dried in
   laboratory scale biodryers. Four levels of aeration rate from 0.4 to 4 L
   min(-1) kg(DM)(-1) and five levels of temperature from 25 to 65 degrees
   C were tested. The highest emissions of CO2, NH3 and N2O occurred at the
   highest air flow rate of 4 L min-1 kg(DM)(-1). For all operating
   conditions, the high calorific power had a mean value of 15 +/- 0.4 MJ
   kg(DM)(-1) The dried biomass obtained had an energetic potential to
   valorise by combustion. CONCLUSION: The bed temperature and aeration
   rate have an effect on carbon and nitrogen bio-cycles. These operating
   parameters can also control the release quantity and gaseous form of
   nitrogen. Several problems related to swine manure management can be
   solved by using biodrying, an economic and environmental friendly
   technology. Copyright (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Co-culture of Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) CD34+ cells with irradiated
   Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) without contact increase the expansion of
   Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC). Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and
   insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) are two factors
   whose expressions were significantly elevated in conditioned media
   derived from irradiated MSCs. To determine whether these factors are
   partly responsible for the growth promoting potential of MSCs, we
   investigated their impact on the growth and differentiation of UCB-CD34+
   cells. Addition of either factor alone had little impact on cell growth,
   however both factors synergized together to increase the expansion of
   total nucleated cells, erythroids, megakaryocytes (Mk) and CD34+ cells.
   However, in contrast to MSCs they failed to significantly improve the
   expansion of hematopoietic progenitors. Consistent with the impact of
   these factors on hematopoietic cells, both synergized to activate ERK1/2
   and AKT in primary human UCB cells. In conclusion, the study
   demonstrates for the first time that a neurotrophin factor can synergize
   with IGFBP-2 to promote hematopoietic cell expansion. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{ANGIOGENESIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{During wound healing, angiogenesis plays a crucial role in inducing
   adequate perfusion of the new tissue, thereby allowing its survival.
   This angiogenic process contributes to the formation of granulation
   tissue, alongside myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are cells specialized
   in wound contraction and synthesis of new extracellular matrix.
   Fibroblasts, considered by some to be at the origin of myofibroblasts,
   have already been shown to promote neovascularization. Thus, we
   hypothesized that myofibroblasts play a key role during angiogenic
   development in wound healing. We isolated myofibroblasts from normal
   human skin wounds and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC)
   and fibroblasts from skin. Using an in vitro fibrin-based model, we
   compared the proangiogenic activity of wound myofibroblasts to that of
   fibroblasts in the presence of HDMVEC. By immunostaining with collagen
   IV antibodies, we observed the formation of a capillary network
   significantly more developed when HDMVEC were cultured with
   myofibroblasts compared to the network formed in the presence of
   fibroblasts. The differences between these cell types did not result
   from a differential secretion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor or
   basic Fibroblast Growth Factor. However, in the presence of
   myofibroblasts, a significant decrease in matrix metalloproteinase
   activity was observed. This finding was correlated with a significant
   increase in Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-3.
   Furthermore, inhibition of TIMP-1 secretion using shRNA significantly
   decreased myofibroblasts induced angiogenesis. These results led to the
   hypothesis that normal wound myofibroblasts contribute to the vascular
   network development during wound healing. Our data emphasize the
   critical role of wound myofibroblasts during healing.}},

Title = {{Compositional analysis for an unbiased measure of soil aggregation}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{123-131}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soil aggregation is an index of soil structure measured by mean weight
   diameter (MWD) or scaling factors often interpreted as fragmentation
   fractal dimensions (D-f). However, the MWD provides a biased estimate of
   soil aggregation due to spurious correlations among aggregate-size
   fractions and scale-dependency. The scale-invariant D-f is based on weak
   assumptions to allow particle counts and sensitive to the selection of
   the fractal domain, and may frequently exceed a value of 3, implying
   that D-f is a biased estimate of aggregation. Aggregation indices based
   on mass may be computed without bias using compositional analysis
   techniques. Our objective was to elaborate compositional indices of soil
   aggregation and to compare them to MWD and D-f using a published dataset
   describing the effect of 7 cropping systems on aggregation. Six
   aggregate-size fractions were arranged into a sequence of D-1 balances
   of building blocks that portray the process of soil aggregation.
   Isometric log-ratios (ilrs) are scale-invariant and orthogonal log
   contrasts or balances that possess the Euclidean geometry necessary to
   compute a distance between any two aggregation states, known as the
   Aitchison distance (A(x,y)). Close correlations (r>0.98) were observed
   between MWD, D-f, and the ilr when contrasting large and small aggregate
   sizes. Several unbiased embedded ilrs can characterize the heterogeneous
   nature of soil aggregates and be related to soil properties or
   functions. Soil bulk density and penetrater resistance were closely
   related to A(x,y) with reference to bare fallow. The A(x,y) is easy to
   implement as unbiased index of soil aggregation using standard sieving
   methods and may allow comparisons between studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One of the major hurdles in optical burst-switched (OBS) networks is the
   contention problem. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a
   new contention resolution technique based on control packet buffering.
   In particular, a rigorous mathematical model is developed to analyze the
   performance of an OBS network core node employing this technique along
   with just-in-time one-way reservation protocol. The key idea that makes
   this proposal novel is that this buffering is implemented in the
   electronic domain, thus avoiding the complexity that exist in the
   optical domain solutions. A detailed evaluation of the system
   performance using both the burst loss probability and the steady-state
   throughput is presented. Our results reveal that a considerable
   improvement in the performance is achieved when adopting the proposed
   technique.}},

Volume = {{425}},

Abstract = {{Gold supported on mesoporous SBA-15 and SBA-15-CeO2 with Ce/Si molar
   ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 were synthesized via wet chemical
   process using a gold cationic complex precursor {[}Au(en)(2)](3+)
   (en=ethylenediamine), and investigated as catalysts for the partial
   oxidation of lactose to selectively synthesize lactobionic acid (LBA)
   for therapeutic, pharmaceutical and food grad applications.
   These catalysts were characterized by N-2 physisorption, XRD, FT-IR, TEM
   and XPS. N-2 physisorption and XRD analysis revealed that SBA-15-CeO2
   with the investigated Ce/Si molar ratios support possess ordered
   hexagonal mesoporous structure, characterized with a high surface area
   and large pore volume, similar to SBA-15, whereas BET surface area and
   pore volume of catalyst were significantly decreased upon impregnation.
   XPS analysis revealed the coexistence of metallic and oxidized gold
   species (Au-0, Au+ and Au3+) in all prepared catalysts and the presence
   of both Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states for gold supported on mesoporous
   SBA-15-CeO2 catalysts.
   The influence of the pH value on lactose conversion was also
   investigated. After 60 min of reaction, the 0.7\%Au/SBA-15-CeO2 (Ce/Si =
   0.1 and 0.2) catalysts showed high catalytic activity (100\% lactose
   conversion) and a 100\% selectivity towards LBA, when they were used at
   a catalyst/lactose ratio of 0.2, under alkaline (pH 9.0) and mild
   reaction temperature (65 degrees C). At the optimized conditions, 0.7\%
   Au/SBA-15-CeO2 catalysts with Ce/Si of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 were more active
   than 0.7\% Au/SBA-15 catalyst. A maximum of activity is reached at Ce/Si
   of 0.2. The experimental catalytic tests and characterizations show
   clearly the role of Ce in the enhancement in the catalyst activity was
   the coordination and agglomeration states of Ce atoms could have an
   important effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new and innovative process of modification of
   wetting of open micro-channels involving a method to seal the
   microfluidic devices. Allylamine was polymerized on
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour
   deposition (PECVD) to modify the wetting properties of open
   micro-channels. The sealing of the devices was done by thermal pressing.
   All the steps of the process were characterized by different analysis
   techniques to understand the mechanisms of the process and to assess the
   performance of the technique. Physicochemical analysis of the
   polymerized allylamine coatings (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   static water contact angle) showed that the coatings were resistant to
   the thermal pressing and were stable in ambient air and underwater up to
   14 days of ageing, even if the water contact angle decreased during the
   underwater ageing. Parallel tests were undergone in microfluidic devices
   and the stability of ageing was tested by the production of the simple
   oil-in-water emulsions. All the experiments showed that this new
   PECVD/thermal press process is an effective way to modify the wetting
   properties of an open microfluidic device and includes a technique to
   seal effectively the system afterwards. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Monolith three-phase reactors are candidate reactors for implementing
   the catalytic process of sulfur removal from gasoil because of the good
   mass transfer characteristics, low pressure drop, high geometric surface
   area and low axial dispersion and backmixing. An integrated approach
   which links momentum, mass and enthalpy transport processes in a
   monolith three-phase reactor under high-pressure gasoil sulfur removal
   conditions was proposed in this work. The two-scale, non-isothermal,
   unsteady-state model developed was used to analyze the effects of the
   catalyst loading, pressure, temperature, superficial liquid and gas
   velocity, reactants/products concentration on the performance of the
   monolith three-phase reactor. The value of the simulated behavior of the
   monolith reactor was discussed in the light of a sensitivity analysis of
   the model outputs with regard to the mass transfer parameters. The
   sulfur removal performance of the upflow configuration of the monolith
   three-phase reactor was compared with the performance of a usual trickle
   bed reactor operated at the same liquid space velocity based on the mass
   of catalyst. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Co-culturing human skin keratinocytes along with a feeder layer has
   proven to considerably improve their proliferative properties by
   delaying massive induction of terminal differentiation. Through a yet
   unclear mechanism, we recently reported that irradiated 3T3 (i3T3)
   fibroblasts used as a feeder layer increase the nuclear content of Sp1,
   a positive transcription factor (TF) that plays a critical role in many
   cellular functions including cell proliferation, into both adult skin
   keratinocytes and newborn skin keratinocytes. In this study, we examined
   the influence of i3T3 on the expression and DNA binding of NFI, another
   TF important for cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and
   attempted to decipher the mechanism by which the feeder layer
   contributes at maintaining higher levels of these TFs in skin
   keratinocytes. Our results indicate that co-culturing both adult skin
   keratinocytes and newborn skin keratinocytes along with a feeder layer
   dramatically increases glycosylation of NFI and may prevent it from
   being degraded by the proteasome. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aggregates formed in low gravity are generally fractals. The fractal
   dimensions and the site growth probability measures of the resulting
   fractal structures strongly depend on the properties of the forces that
   cause the aggregation. Using some approximations, we solved the equation
   of motion and obtained the relation giving the particles separation as a
   function of time. The electric force between two charged particles and
   the magnetic force between two particles with a magnetic moment were
   considered. The two relations are different and it is shown that one can
   identify and separate these two interactions by analysing the recording
   of the aggregation. The apparatus used to record the aggregation has a
   resolution in the order of one micrometer per pixel and has the
   possibility of recording simultaneously two views at right angles. From
   a three dimensional recording of an aggregation, it will be possible to
   obtain the product of the two charges or magnetic moments causing the
   aggregation. (C) 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Optical transport of ultra-wideband (UWB) signals extends the reach of
   these power-limited signals to several kilometers. We propose and
   experimentally demonstrate a simple and low-cost optical method to
   generate UWB pulses. We use few optical components
   (source/modulator/photodetector), in contrast to most other optical
   generation techniques. UWB pulses complying with the U.S. Federal
   Communications Commission spectral mask are generated by modulating the
   intensity of a continuous-wave laser with a combined signal consisting
   of the data signal and a sinusoidal signal. For impulse radio UWB,
   binary phase-shift-keying is accomplished simply by adjusting the
   amplitudes of the data and the sinusoidal signal. Wireless propagation
   of the UWB impulses is investigated experimentally at a very high bit
   rate. The receiver is implemented using a realtime oscilloscope to
   capture the received waveforms followed by offline signal processing. In
   particular, we consider a minimum-mean-square error equalizer to counter
   the multipath-induced intersymbol interference encountered at 1.75 Gb/s.
   Equalization brings the bit-error-rate within the forward-error
   correction limit of 10(-3) after 2.5 m of wireless propagation at 1.75

Abstract = {{Catalytic hydration of CO2 using immobilized human carbon anhydrase II
   was assessed in Robinson-Mahoney and packed-bed scrubbers. To analyze
   the impact of enzyme on CO2 abatement, the mass transfer, non-enzymic
   film and bulk, and enzymic surface reaction steps were deconstructed
   using a multistage model and an ordered Bi Bi Iso Ping Pong kinetic
   model for the enzyme-mediated hydration kinetics of CO2. Absorption in
   the Robinson-Mahoney reactor revealed the enzyme was passive while model
   analysis exposed gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfers as severely
   obstructing enzymic hydration. The packed bed achieved improvements in
   CO2 abatement with enzyme-immobilized packings but was found to exhibit
   low mass transfer to fully exploit the enzyme's high turnover.
   Leveraging strategies to lower bicarbonate were thus researched to
   enhance net CO2 hydration kinetics by reducing backward dehydration. The
   most remarkable increase in CO2 removal was obtained by integrating
   immobilized-enzyme absorption with microparticle ion-exchange resin to
   remove in-situ bicarbonate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dimensionless reaction rate density of a

   intersected to predict the optimal aspect ratio and maximum reaction
   rate. Numerical simulations were performed and the results corroborated
   very well with the scale analysis. The results showed that the optimal
   design of microreactors depends on the Schmidt number (Sc), the Bejan
   number (Be) and the Catalyst number (Ct). Correlations based on those

Abstract = {{Air-water co-current (horizontal) flow experiments were carried out to
   measure pressure drop and liquid holdup in a 1 mm (ID) diameter glass
   tube packed with 55 mu m nearly monodisperse glass spheres. The
   measurements allowed calibration of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model
   based on the volume-averaged mass and momentum balance equations to
   describe the cocurrent two-phase flow in packed bed microreactors. The
   heterogeneous nature of the packed bed was taken into account via
   incorporation of radial non-uniformities of the bed. The liquid and gas
   velocity fields are characterized by a significant non-uniformity with
   major variation occurring in the region extending up to a distance of
   two particle diameters from the wall bounding surface and with a maximum
   located in the high porosity zone. The model shows considerable
   sensitivity of two-phase flow with respect to capillary pressure, which
   has the tendency to spread radially the liquid flow to approach radial
   uniformity. The capillary pressure causes liquid phase displacement from
   the high-porosity to the low-porosity region resulting in smaller/higher
   fraction of the liquid/gas flowing through the microreactor
   cross-section leading to channeling and thus to an increase/decrease of
   liquid/gas flow through the core area. In packed bed microreactors,
   two-phase pressure drop is very large and is considerably influenced by
   the capillary forces, especially at higher reactor-to-particle diameter
   ratios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The wrench-closure workspace of parallel cable-driven mechanisms is the
   set of poses for which any wrench can be produced at the end-effector by
   a set of non-negative cable tensions. It is already known that the

   sections. However, the relationship between the geometry of the
   mechanism and the types of these conic sections is unknown. This

   of these conic sections from the mechanism geometry. It is also shown
   that the proposed method can be applied to find the constant-orientation
   singularities of a 3-R (P) under barR planar parallel robot, since these
   conic sections correspond to the boundary segment of the analogous

Title = {{Performance Indices for Collaborative Serial Robots With Optimally

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Safety is the first priority when designing robots that are intended to
   physically interact with humans. New robotics standards state as a
   condition for collaboration that the robot should be designed so that it
   cannot exert forces larger than 150 N at its tool center point. An
   effective and reliable way of guaranteeing that this force cannot be
   exceeded is to place a torque limiter in series with each actuator, thus
   forming series clutch actuators (SCAs). Since the relationship between
   the joint limit torques and the achievable end-effector forces is
   configuration dependent, it is preferable to use adjustable torque
   limiters. This paper presents a method to optimally control the limit
   torques of a serial manipulator equipped with adjustable series clutch
   actuators. It also introduces two performance indices to evaluate the
   quality of the relationship between the joint limit torques and the
   achievable end-effector forces. The first one is the ratio of the
   minimum and maximum force thresholds. Even if it has a strong physical
   meaning, it is not differentiable everywhere in the workspace and is
   thus difficult to use in an optimization process based on its gradient.
   A second index, smooth, and expressed in a closed-form, is therefore
   introduced which is the determinant of the normalized Jacobian matrix
   postmultiplied by its transposed. Examples of redundant manipulator
   motion optimization and of collaborative robot architecture optimization
   using the second index are shown. The limitations of the proposed
   approach are that it is based on a static model-which is nevertheless
   valid under the current safety standards-and that gravity is neglected.

Abstract = {{Two novel architectures of planar spring-loaded cable-loop-driven
   parallel mechanisms that do not require actuation redundancy are
   introduced in this paper. In order to avoid redundancy in the
   cable-driven parallel mechanisms and require only N actuators to control
   N-DOF motion, a new spring-loaded cable-loop-driven mechanism is
   proposed. By attaching springs to the cable loops, two degrees of
   freedom can be controlled using only two actuators and spools are
   eliminated in this mechanism. Therefore, the control method can be
   simplified compared with conventional cable-driven mechanisms making use
   of spools and actuation redundancy. The mechanisms can be actuated using
   either linear sliders or rotary actuators driving the motion of a cable
   or belt loop. Kinematic and static analyses are presented for the new
   architectures. It is verified that the cables and springs can be kept in
   tension within a certain workspace. Results of numerical simulations are
   also given in order to provide insight into the design issues. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering aims to produce tissues using cells and materials.
   The action of designing tissues involves observing the process of growth
   to understand its underlying mechanisms. It requires manipulation of the
   critical parameters for cell growth and remodeling to produce structured
   tissues and functional organs. Tissue engineers face the challenge of
   orchestrating the signals in a cell's microenvironment to efficiently
   grow an anisotropic and hierarchical tissue. It can be performed in vivo
   through the design of bioactive scaffolds and manipulation of biological
   signals using growth factors. It can also be performed in vitro in a
   controlled environment called the bioreactor. This article addresses the
   matter of finding the optimal dynamic sequence of culture conditions in
   a bioreactor for the maturation of tissues. Artificial intelligence and
   optimal control are accelerating technologies towards an understanding
   of tissue regeneration. The particular example of the functional
   engineering of small-diameter blood vessels has been chosen to
   illustrate this idea.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report for the first time the optical testing of modern 1.3, 5,
   and 8 megapixel panoramic lenses available on the market for security
   and surveillance applications. Our first test focused on the measurement
   of the image mapping and more particularly on the inverse of the
   instantaneous field of view expressed in pixels/degree (IFOV-1). This
   kind of measurement provides a valuable comparison parameter for the
   user community. The second test was a measurement of a modulation
   transfer function (MTF) system. All tested lenses were coupled with the
   same camera in order to measure the MTF system using the edge response.
   While this measurement is not a measurement of the MTF of the lens, it
   provides a basis for comparison between the different lenses. Our
   measurement shows that the IFOV is more robust than the MTF to
   manufacturing and assembly errors. This provides robustness to the
   unwrapping image post-processing. The MTF measurements show that all the
   tested lenses have an on-axis MTF of 35\% at Nyquist frequency over 2
   (N-y/2) for a 2.2 mu m pixel pitch. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

   LaMn0.7Fe0.3O3.15@mSiO(2) as oxygen carriers for chemical looping

   shell materials were prepared by coating a layer of mesostructured
   silica around the agglomerated perovskite particles. The oxygen carriers
   were characterized using different methods, such as X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), N-2 sorption, hydrogen temperature-programmed
   reduction (H-2-TPR), and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen
   (TPD-O-2). The reactivity and stability of the carrier materials were
   tested in a special reactor, allowing for short contact time between the
   fluidized carrier and the reactive gas {[}Chemical Reactor Engineering
   Centre (CREC) fluidized riser simulator]. Multiple reduction oxidation
   cycles were performed. TEM images of the carriers showed that a perfect
   mesoporous silica layer was formed around samples with 4, 32, and 55 nm
   in thickness. The oxygen carriers having a core shell structure showed
   higher reactivity and stability during 10 repeated redox cycles compared
   to the LaMn0.7Fe0.3O3.15 core. This could be due to a protective role of
   the silica shell against sintering of the particles during repeated
   cycles under CLC conditions. The agglomeration of the particles, which
   occurred at high temperatures during CLC cycles, is more controllable in
   the core shell-structured carriers, as confirmed by SEM images. XRD
   patterns confirmed that the crystal structure of all perovskites
   remained unchanged after multiple redox cycles. Methane conversion and
   partial conversion to CO, were observed to increase with the contact
   time between methane and the carrier. Indeed, more oxygen from the
   carrier surface, grain boundaries, and even from the bulk lattice was
   released to react with methane. Upon rising the contact time, less CO
   was formed, which is desirable for CLC application. Increasing the
   reaction temperature and methane partial pressure lead to enhanced
   conversions of CH4 under CLC conditions.}},

Title = {{Exploring Co-57 as a new isotope for brachytherapy applications}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2342-2345}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The characteristics of the radionuclide Co-57 make it
   interesting for use as a brachytherapy source. Co-57 combines a possible
   high specific activity with the emission of relatively low-energy
   photons and a half-life (272 days) suitable for regular source exchanges
   in an afterloader. Co-57 decays by electron capture to the stable Fe-57
   with emission of 136 and 122 keV photons.
   Methods: A hypothetical Co-57 source based on the Flexisource
   brachytherapy encapsulation with the active core set as a pure cobalt
   cylinder (length 3.5 mm and diameter 0.6 mm) covered with a cylindrical
   stainless-steel capsule (length 5 mm and thickness 0.125 mm) was
   simulated using Geant4 Monte Carlo (MC) code version 9.4. The radial
   dose function, g(r), and anisotropy function F(r,theta), for the line
   source approximation were calculated following the TG-43U1 formalism.
   The results were compared to well-known Ir-192 and 1(25)I radionuclides,
   representing the higher and the lower energy end of brachytherapy,
   respectively.
   Results: The mean energy of photons in water, after passing through the
   core and the encapsulation material was 123 keV. This hypothetical Co-57
   source has an increasing g(r) due to multiple scatter of low-energy
   photons, which results in a more uniform dose distribution than Ir-192.
   Conclusions: Co-57 has many advantages compared to Ir-192 due to its
   low-energy gamma emissions without any electron contamination. Co-57 has
   an increasing g(r) that results in a more uniform dose distribution than
   Ir-192 due to its multiple scattered photons. The anisotropy of the
   Co-57 source is comparable to that of Ir-192. Furthermore, Co-57 has
   lower shielding requirements than Ir-192. (C) 2012 American Association

Abstract = {{Increasing phosphorus (P) content and decreasing water quality of
   Saint-Augustin Lake, Quebec City, Canada, has led to implementation of
   an Integrated Watershed Management Plan to restore the lake. As a part
   of the plan, the effects of different restoration techniques on lake
   water quality and biological community (i.e., biological compatibility)
   were assessed during an isolated water enclosure study and laboratory
   microcosm assay, respectively. The restoration techniques include: (i)
   coagulation of P by alum only (20 mg L-1), (ii) active capping of
   sediments using a calcite layer of 10 cm, and (iii) a complete method
   involving both alum coagulation and calcite capping. The results showed
   that the total P (TP) was greatly decreased (76-95 \%) by alum +
   calcite, followed by calcite only (59-84 \%). Secchi depth was 106 \%
   greater and chlorophyll a concentrations were declined by 19-78 \% in
   the enclosure which received both alum and calcite. Results of the
   biological compatibility test showed that total phytoplankton biomass
   declined by 31 \% in microcosms composed of alum + calcite. No
   significant (P > 0.05) toxic effect was found on the survival of Daphnia
   magna and Hyalella azteca in both alum only and alum + calcite
   microcosms. Although the alum + calcite technique impaired the survival
   of Chironomus riparius, the midge emergence was much higher compared to
   alum only and control. Overall, the alum + calcite application was
   effective in controlling P release from sediment and lowering water
   column P concentrations, and thus improving the water quality and
   aquatic life of Saint-Augustin Lake. However, the TP concentrations are
   still higher than the critical limit (20 mu g L-1) for aquatic life and
   the water column remained in the eutrophic state even after treatment.
   Increased TP concentrations, to higher than ambient levels of the lake,
   in the water column of all four enclosures, due to bioturbation artefact
   triggered by the platform installation, likely cause insufficient
   dosages of alum and/or calcite applied and reduced their effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The morpho-physiological quality of seedlings is negatively affected by
   the wide scale use of forest soils as substrates in developing
   countries. With the objective of finding long-term sustainable supply of
   growing media, compost was produced from shredded branches of three fast
   growing species (Acacia cyanophylla (AA), Acacia cyclops (AS) and
   Eucalyptus gomphocephala (EG). The composting process covered three
   different periods over the course of a year. Pile temperatures were
   monitored daily and the composts were routinely sampled and analyzed for
   19 chemical variables. Although composting is feasible year-round in
   arid climates, compost produced in the humid cool conditions of autumn,
   winter and early spring reaches the maturation phase more quickly than
   compost produced under hot, dry summer conditions. It also requires less
   turning and water. The evolution of the composting process and quality
   of the final product can be assessed using three chemical variables
   (C/N, pH, EC). Seed germination rates in the three types of compost were
   similar to that in a peat:vermiculite substrate and vigorous high
   quality seedlings were produced in the two acacia composts. However,
   compost-grown seedlings had significantly smaller shoots and root
   systems than those produced in peat substrate. Principal components
   analyses showed that the quality of a compost-based substrate is
   reproducible and that its final chemical composition can be predicted
   from its raw organic materials. The EG composts had higher pH than the
   acacia composts, whereas the AA and EG composts were higher in mineral
   salts than the AS.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater management scenarios for the Toluca Valley, Mexico, are
   examined with a three dimensional groundwater flow model coupled to a
   one dimensional compaction module. The objective of this study is to
   establish a management policy for the sustainable development and
   management of the Toluca aquifer system for minimizing land subsidence.
   Several scenarios are tested by varying 4 main parameters: recharge,
   exports to other basins, local consumption, and relocating pumping
   centers. It is apparent that continuing at current rates of water
   consumption will lead to subsidence of more than 1.6 m over a 40 year
   period (2010-2050). Completely stopping exports to Mexico City is not
   the most important factor in controlling subsidence because the pumping
   system is mostly located in regions with low clay content, where
   subsidence is lower. However, decreasing exports by half and relocating
   the pumping centres to low-clay-content areas does have a positive
   effect on the overall water budget and subsidence. Based on simulation
   results, it appears that much of the land subsidence could have been
   avoided had water policies been applied to restrict pumping in regions
   with compressible materials. The approach taken in this study could be
   applied to other locations with similar problems in order to determine
   the most viable option for water supply.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the etiology of exposure-related diseases and to establish
   standards for reducing the risks associated with working in contaminated
   environments, the exact nature of the bioaerosol components must be
   defined. Molecular biology tools were used to evaluate airborne
   bacterial and, for the first time, archaeal content of dairy barns.
   Three air samplers were tested in each of the 13 barns sampled. Up to
   106 archaeal and 108 bacterial 16S rRNA genes per m(3) of air were
   detected. Archaeal methanogens, mainly Methanobrevibacter species, were
   represented. Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, the causative agent of
   farmer's lung, was quantified to up to 107 16S rRNA genes per m(3) of
   air. In addition, a wide variety of bacterial agents were present in our
   air samples within the high airborne bioaerosol concentration range.
   Despite recommendations regarding hay preservation and baling
   conditions, farmers still develop an S. rectivirgula-specific humoral
   immune response, suggesting intense and continuous exposure. Our results
   demonstrate the complexity of bioaerosol components in dairy barns which
   could play a role in occupational respiratory diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulation of insulin-producing cells in alginate beads could improve
   the treatment of type 1 diabetes by reducing or eliminating the need for
   immunosuppression. We have recently adapted an emulsion and internal
   gelation process to beta-cell encapsulation. This process has the
   advantages of being well suited for m3/h production rates and allowing
   the use of increased alginate concentrations. Compared with 1.5\%
   alginate beads generated by a standard extrusion process, 5\% alginate
   emulsion-generated beads demonstrated greater in vitro stability and
   greater volumetric exclusion of antibody-sized pullulan. When beta TC3
   cells were transplanted into streptozotocin-induced allogeneic diabetic
   mice, a significant decrease in the blood glucose levels was seen within
   2 days with the 5\% emulsion-generated beads but not until >16 days with
   the 1.5\% extrusion-generated beads. This was correlated with higher
   cell survival and lower graft-specific plasma immunoglobulin levels.
   These results suggest that higher-concentration alginate beads generated
   by emulsion and internal gelation have improved graft immunoprotection.
   The emulsion process is a promising and scalable technology for cellular
   therapies requiring immune isolation. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{In this work, we present for the first time a simple synthetic route to

   solvothermal synthesis technique using an environment friendly
   aminocaproic acid (ACA) mixed methanolic Pb-TU complex precursor at 170
   degrees C for 20 h. The mechanism leading to these star-shaped PbS
   crystals was discussed. The as-synthesized PbS crystals were
   characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR). The obtained results show that the
   synthesized star-shaped PbS crystals were exempt of impurities and were
   crystalline with cubic phase. Finally, the FTIR study indicates that
   molecules were bounded on the surface of PbS crystal via nitrogen lone
   pair of the amino head groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of integrating preventive maintenance
   and tactical production planning, for a production system composed of a
   set of parallel components, in the presence of economic dependence and
   common cause failures. Economic dependence means that performing
   maintenance on several components jointly costs less money and time than
   on each component separately. Common cause failures correspond to events
   that lead to simultaneous failure of multiple components due to a common
   cause. We use the beta-factor model to represent common cause failures.
   This means that we assume two possible causes for system failure: the
   independent failure of single components, and the simultaneous common
   cause failure of all components. The suggested preventive maintenance is
   a T-age group maintenance policy in which components are cyclically
   renewed all together. Furthermore, between the periodic group
   replacements, minimal repairs are performed on failed components. We are
   given a set of products that must be produced by this parallel system in
   lots during a specified finite planning horizon. The objective is to
   determine an integrated lot-sizing and preventive maintenance strategy
   of the system that will minimize the sum of preventive and corrective
   maintenance costs, setup costs, holding costs, backorder costs and
   production costs, while satisfying the demand for all products over the
   entire horizon. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed
   approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertrophic scars are a pathological process characterized by an
   excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components. Using a
   tissue-engineered reconstructed human skin (RHS) method, we previously
   reported that pathological keratinocytes induce formation of a fibrotic
   dermal matrix. We further investigated keratinocyte action using
   conditioned media. Results showed that conditioned media induce a
   similar action on dermal thickness similar to when an epidermis is
   present. Using a two-dimensional electrophoresis technique, we then
   compared conditioned media from normal or hypertrophic scar
   keratinocytes and determined that TIMP-1 was increased in conditioned
   media from hypertrophic scar keratinocytes. This differential profile
   was confirmed using ELISA, assaying TIMP-1 presence on media from
   monolayer cultured keratinocytes and from RHS. The dermal matrix of
   these RHS was recreated using mesenchymal cells from three different
   origins (skin, wound and hypertrophic scar). The effect of increased
   TIMP-1 levels on dermal fibrosis was also validated independently from
   the mesenchymal cell origin. Immunodetection of TIMP-1 showed that this
   protein was increased in the epidermis of hypertrophic scar biopsies.
   The findings of this study represent an important advance in
   understanding the role of keratinocytes as a direct potent modulator for
   matrix degradation and scar tissue remodeling, possibly through
   inactivation of MMPs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, high density polyethylene (HDPE) was compounded with
   chemically treated coir fiber using a heated two roll mill. Three
   chemical treatments denoted silane, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dodecane
   bromide (C12) were selected to improve the interface adhesion between
   fibers and polyethylene matrix. The mechanical properties of these
   composites were evaluated and compared against those of neat polymer and
   untreated fibers composites. A fixed fiber loading of 20 wt.\% was used
   in all composites. A chemical analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to see the extent of chemical
   modification of the fibers. Results have shown that tensile and
   torsional modulus exhibited a significant increase when compared to the
   neat HDPE. A notable increase in the Young's modulus was observed when
   C12 and silane were used, corresponding to 120\% and 70\%, respectively.
   The composites' ductility was also evaluated by the plastic stored
   energy and showed a noted increase when C12 and silane were used, an
   increase of 55\% with C12 treatment and 23\% when silane treatment was
   used. Such results promise many applications for composite materials.

Abstract = {{Primary aluminium production is a high-energy consumption process, and
   improving the energy efficiency of smelters could be economically
   viable. An issue in the Hall-Heroult prebake anode technology is the
   voltage drop in the anode connector caused by the
   thermo-electro-mechanical interface contact between steel stub, carbon
   anode, and cast iron thimble. Steel stubs are exposed to an extremely
   aggressive environment throughout their service life, involving
   thermomechanical stresses and chemical attacks that cause shape changes.
   To estimate voltage drop due to change in stub shape, a 3D finite
   element model (FEM) of a whole anode was developed and solved with the
   in-house code FESh(++). Steel stub diameter variations were compared
   with a new stub configuration. Results show a voltage increase of about
   10 mV between new and damaged configuration simulations. This holds
   promising potential for improving energy efficiency. An experimental
   factorial design was used to determine the main factor in steel stub
   diameter variation affecting voltage drop in the anode connector
   assembly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Threshold length for maximal reaction rate in catalytic microchannels}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{188}},
Pages = {{86-97}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of maximizing the
   reaction rate of a channel reactor with catalyst on its boundaries by
   varying its aspect ratio L/H. The volume, pressure drop, amount of
   catalyst and catalyst surface density of the channels were constrained.
   The expression of the reaction rate in the limits of small, moderate and
   large L/H values were obtained by scale analysis. A distinct behaviour
   appeared for each of these three geometrical limits: a kinetic
   controlled regime, an external diffusion controlled regime, and a regime
   limited by fluid flow rates. From this scale analysis, we predicted
   analytically that the length can be varied so as to increase the rate of
   reaction of a catalytic channel, up to a threshold value from which
   further change of the geometry does not alter significantly the reaction
   rate. Intersections of the three reaction rate expressions provided
   estimates for the maximal reaction rate and for the threshold lengths,
   as a function of the Bejan number, the Schmidt number and a catalyst
   number. Finally, CFD simulations of the channel reactors were performed,
   and numerical parametric studies agreed well with the estimated
   equations for the threshold L/H values. Correlations based on the
   numerical data are proposed for the design of catalytic channel
   reactors. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Particle-particle interactions in natural clays can be evaluated by
   their rheological behavior, but the results are often affected by the
   physicochemical properties of the clays. The behaviors of two
   fundamentally different types of clays (low-activity and high-activity)
   differ with respect to salinity and a time factor (duration of shearing
   at a given shear rate): illite-rich Jonquiere clay (low-activity clay,
   Canada) and montmorillonite-rich Wyoming bentonite (high-activity clay,
   USA). The purpose of the present study was to investigate these
   different behaviors. Most natural clays exhibit shear-thinning and
   thixotropic behavior with respect to salinity and the volumetric
   concentration of the solids. Natural clays also exhibit time-dependent
   non-Newtonian behavior. In terms of index value and shear strength,
   low-activity and high-activity clays are known to exhibit contrasting
   responses to salinity. The geotechnical and rheological characteristics
   as a function of salinity and the shearing time for the given materials
   are compared here. The clay minerals were compared to estimate the
   inherent shear strengths, such as remolded shear strength (which is
   similar to the yield strength). Low-activity clay exhibits thixotropic
   behavior in a time-dependent manner. High-activity clay is also
   thixotropic for a short period of shearing, although rare cases of
   rheopectic behavior have been measured for long periods of shearing at
   high shear rates. The change from thixotropic to rheopectic behavior by
   bentonite clay has little effect at low shearing speeds, but appears to
   have a significant effect at higher speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Safety and dependability are of the utmost importance for physical
   human-robot interaction due to the potential risks that a relatively
   powerful robot poses to human beings. From the control standpoint, it is
   possible to improve safety by guaranteeing that the robot will never
   exhibit any unstable behavior. However, stability is not the only
   concern in the design of a controller for such a robot. During
   human-robot interaction, the resulting cooperative motion should be
   truly intuitive and should not restrict in any way the human
   performance. For this purpose, we have designed a new variable
   admittance control law that guarantees the stability of the robot during
   constrained motion and also provides a very intuitive human interaction.
   The former characteristic is provided by the design of a stability
   observer while the latter is based on a variable admittance control
   scheme that uses the time derivative of the contact force to assess
   human intentions. The stability observer is based on a previously
   published stability investigation of cooperative motion which implies
   the knowledge of the interaction stiffness. A method to accurately
   estimate this stiffness online using the data coming from the encoder
   and from a multiaxis force sensor at the end effector is also provided.
   The stability and intuitivity of the control law are verified in a user
   study involving a cooperative drawing task with a 3 degree-of-freedom
   (dof) parallel robot as well as in experiments performed with a
   prototype of an industrial Intelligent Assist Device.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{200-209}},

Abstract = {{Several fundamental questions regarding cell growth and development can
   be answered by recording and analyzing the history of cells and their
   progeny. Herein, long- term and large-field live cell imaging was used
   to study the process of megakaryopoiesis at the single cell level (n
   9300) from human CD34(+)cord blood (CB) in the presence of
   thrombopoietin (TPO) or the cytokine cocktail BS1 with or without
   nicotinamide (NIC). Comparative analyses revealed that the cocktail BS1
   increased the mitotic and proplatelet rate of diploid and polyploid
   cells, respectively. Conversely, only NIC treatment increased the
   endomitotic rate of megakaryocytes (MKs) leading to the formation of
   CB-MKs with ploidy level frequently observed with BM-MKs. However, NIC
   failed to enhance platelet production. Rather, a7-and 31-fold reduction
   in proplatelet formation was observed in tetraploid and octaploid
   CB-MKs, respectively, and ex vivo platelet production output was reduced
   by half due to a reduction in MK output in NIC cultures. Unexpectedly, a
   significant fraction of di- andpolyploid CB-MKs were seen to undergo
   complete proplatelet regression. Though rare (<0.6\%), proplatelet
   reversal led to the formation of regular round cells that could at times
   resume normal development. The cell tracking data was then used to
   investigate the impact of ``developmental fate'' and ploidy on cell
   cycling time, and to identify potential developmental patterns. These
   analyses revealed that cell fate and ploidy level have major impacts on
   the cell cycling time of the cells, and that four recurrent cell lineage
   patterns could be identified for CD34(+) cells undergoing MK
   differentiation. (C) 2012 International Society of Differentiation.

Abstract = {{Dimethyl ether (DME) production from glycerol via an integrated process
   involving aqueous-phase glycerol reforming to biosyngas combined with
   DME synthesis into an allothermal dual-bed membrane reactor was analyzed
   numerically. The system combines two separate enclosures, a fixed-bed
   water perm-selective membrane DME synthesis unit and a gas-liquid-solid
   fixed-bed aqueous-phase glycerol reforming unit. Exothermic DME
   synthesis provides heat to endothermic aqueous-phase glycerol reforming
   which in return produces biosyngas for DME synthesis. The two-scale,
   non-isothermal, unsteady-state model developed for the integrated system
   accounts for a detailed gas/gas-liquid dynamics whereupon DME
   synthesis/aqueous-phase glycerol reforming kinetics, thermodynamics,
   thermal effects and variable gas flow rate due to chemical/physical
   contractions were accounted for. The integrated process is intended to
   minimize abundant glycerol by-product streams via an energy efficient
   alternative for producing DME. It presents an opportunity to improve the
   economics of green DME synthesis by cost reduction of biosyngas
   production while improving thermal efficiency of DME synthesis. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Bioreactors are a promising enabling technology for vascular tissue
   engineering. Beyond their value for the scale-up and manufacturing of
   tissue-engineered blood vessels, bioreactors represent a potential path
   toward the understanding of the regeneration process of tissues in
   vitro, toward the development of mathematical models for growth and
   remodeling in tissue engineering, and toward the study of pathological
   conditions. To achieve these promises, bioreactors must overcome the
   paradigm of a black box for the growth of tissues and become a tool for
   the study of growth in tissue engineering. An advanced control strategy
   was developed to study and maximize growth in bioreactors. The aim of
   this paper is to validate experimentally the ability of this controller
   to build knowledge during the culture of a tissue-engineered blood
   vessel. During the experiments, the controller proposed linear
   regression models, therefore making hypotheses on the parameters that
   influence growth; then, it chose experiments to refine these models,
   therefore verifying these hypotheses. These results show that tissue
   maturation in bioreactors can become more efficient by acquiring
   information about the process, and by dynamically adapting culture
   conditions according to this information input.}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed to simulate a cross-flow heat exchanger, including
   fins, in the wall of which thermoelectric generators are sandwiched.
   Such a system could be used for waste heat recovery. The model is used
   to optimize the device based on several objective functions: total
   volume, total number of thermoelectric modules, power output, and
   pumping power. The design variables are the local distribution of
   modules and of current, the shape of the fins, and the division of the
   heat exchanger in sub-channels. Pareto fronts are achieved with a
   multi-objective genetic algorithm, and are presented here. The results
   show that the number of sub-channels in the heat exchanger has a larger
   impact on the overall performance than the fin geometry for this
   particular problem. Also, the net power output is mostly correlated to
   the number of thermoelectric modules, and less to the heat exchanger
   volume. Various relations between the different competing objectives are
   shown and analyzed. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular tissue engineering aims to regenerate blood vessels to replace
   diseased arteries for cardiovascular patients. With the scaffold-based
   approach, cells are seeded on a scaffold showing specific properties and
   are expected to proliferate and self-organize into a functional vascular
   tissue. Bioreactors can significantly contribute to this objective by
   providing a suitable environment for the maturation of the tissue
   engineered blood vessel. It is recognized from the mechanotransduction
   principles that mechanical stimuli can influence the protein synthesis
   of the extra-cellular matrix thus leading to maturation and organization
   of the tissues. Up to date, no bioreactor is especially conceived to
   take advantage of the mechanobiology and optimize the construct
   maturation through an advanced control strategy. In this review,
   experimental strategies in the field of vascular tissue engineering are
   detailed, and a new approach inspired by fetal development,
   mechanobiology and optimal control paradigms is proposed. In this new
   approach, the culture conditions (i.e. flow, circumferential strain,
   pressure frequency, and others) are supposed to dynamically evolve to
   match the maturity of vascular constructs and maximize the efficiency of
   the regeneration process. Moreover, this approach allows the
   investigation of the mechanisms of growth, remodeling and
   mechanotransduction during the culture. (C) 2011 IPEM. Published by

Abstract = {{This article describes a robust methodology using the combination of
   instrumental design (high matrix interface-HMI), sample dilution and
   internal standardization for the quantification of beryllium (Be) in
   various digested autopsy tissues using inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry. The applicability of rhodium as a proper internal standard
   for Be was demonstrated in three types of biological matrices (i.e.,
   femur, hair, lung tissues). Using HMI, it was possible to achieve
   instrumental detection limits and sensitivity of 0.6 ng L-1 and 157 cps
   L ng(-1), respectively. Resilience to high salt matrices of the HMI
   setup was also highlighted using bone mimicking solution ({[}Ca2+] = 26
   to 1,400 mg L-1), providing a 14-fold increase in tolerance and a
   2.7-fold decrease in method detection limit compared to optimized
   experimental conditions obtained without the HMI configuration.
   Precision of the methodology to detect low levels of Be in autopsy
   samples was demonstrated using hair and blood certified reference
   materials. Be concentration ranging from 0.015 to 255 mu g kg(-1) in
   autopsy samples obtained from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium
   Registries were measured using the methodology presented.}},

Abstract = {{There has recently been an increasing interest in seafood products due
   to the growing awareness of their nutraceutical value. However,
   marine-based products are highly susceptible to deterioration, mainly
   because of their high contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
   their high water activity, abundant free amino acids, neutral pH, and
   the presence of autolytic enzymes. In recent decades, various
   alternative methods have been developed to address this issue. Among the
   proposed solutions, chitosan has been highlighted as one of the most
   promising solutions. Chitosan, a deacetylated derivative of chitin, has
   attracted high consideration for its nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and
   biodegradability. Moreover, it is a polymer with versatile functional
   properties. For this reason, chitosan, which is commercially produced
   mostly from marine sources (e.g., crustacean shells), has been used to
   stabilize seafood-based products. In this review, chitosan is
   highlighted with respect to the various potential applications
   exploiting its many features, such as antibacterial and antioxidant
   properties, edible film- and coating-forming ability, the treatment of
   seafood industry effluent, enhanced gelling properties, micro- and
   nanocarrier abilities for bioactive compounds, functional foods, and
   drug compounds from aquaculture and seafood.}},

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of integrating noncyclical preventive
   maintenance and tactical production planning for a single machine. We
   are given a set of products that must be produced in lots during a
   specified finite planning horizon. The maintenance policy suggests
   possible preventive replacements at the beginning of each production
   planning period, and minimal repair at machine failure. The proposed
   model determines simultaneously the optimal production plan and the
   instants of preventive maintenance actions. The objective is to minimize
   the sum of preventive and corrective maintenance costs, setup costs,
   holding costs, backorder costs and production costs, while satisfying
   the demand for all products over the entire horizon. The problem is
   solved by comparing the results of several multi-product capacitated
   lot-sizing problems. The value of the integration and that of using
   noncyclical preventive maintenance when the demand varies from one
   period to another are illustrated through a numerical example and
   validated by a design of experiment. The later has shown that the
   integration of maintenance and production planning can reduce the total
   maintenance and production cost and the removal of periodicity
   constraint is directly affected by the demand fluctuation and can also
   reduce the total maintenance and production cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The most important decisions that should be made by emergency vehicle
   managers are related to the allocation and the covering problems. The
   allocation (or dispatching) problem consists of deciding which vehicle
   must be assigned to assist an emergency in the best times. The covering
   problem aims at keeping the region under surveillance well-covered by
   relocating available vehicles. As components are geographically
   distributed, decentralized solution approaches may present several
   advantages. This paper develops a decentralized distributed solution
   approach based on multi-agent systems (MAS) to manage the emergency
   vehicles. The proposed system integrates the dispatching of vehicles to
   calls with zone coverage issues. This integration means that allocation
   and covering decisions are considered jointly. The idea of MAS has been
   applied in many others real-world contexts, and has been proven to
   provide more flexibility, reliability, adaptability and
   reconfigurability. To our knowledge, there is no existing work that uses
   MAS for real-time emergency vehicle allocation problem while accounting
   for the coverage requirements for future demands. We propose a
   multi-agent architecture that fit the real emergency systems, and that
   aims at keeping good performance compared to the centralized solution.
   The objective is to coordinate agents to reach good quality solutions in
   a distributed way. For this purpose two approaches are examined. The
   first one is used to show the impact of distributing data and control on
   the solution quality, since the dispatching decisions are based only on
   local evaluations of the fitness. The second approach is based on
   implicit agents' coordination using a more refined and efficient auction
   mechanism. The performance of each approach is compared to the
   centralized solution obtained by solving the proposed model with ILOG
   CPLEX solver. The obtained results show the importance of the
   coordination method to keep a good quality of service while distributing
   data and decision making, and prove the performance of the second
   approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{M102AD is the new designation for a Streptococcus mutans phage described
   in 1993 as phage M102. This change was necessitated by the genome
   analysis of another S. mutans phage named M102, which revealed
   differences from the genome sequence reported here. Additional host
   range analyses confirmed that S. mutans phage M102AD infects only a few
   serotype c strains. Phage M102AD adsorbed very slowly to its host, and
   it cannot adsorb to serotype e and f strains of S. mutans. M102AD
   adsorption was blocked by c-specific antiserum. Phage M102AD also
   adsorbed equally well to heat-treated and trypsin-treated cells,
   suggesting carbohydrate receptors. Saliva and polysaccharide production
   did not inhibit plaque formation. The genome of this siphophage
   consisted of a linear, double-stranded, 30,664-bp DNA molecule, with a
   GC content of 39.6\%. Analysis of the genome extremities indicated the
   presence of a 3 `-overhang cos site that was 11 nucleotides long.
   Bioinformatic analyses identified 40 open reading frames, all in the
   same orientation. No lysogeny-related genes were found, indicating that
   phage M102AD is strictly virulent. No obvious virulence factor gene
   candidates were found. Twelve proteins were identified in the virion
   structure by mass spectrometry. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a
   close relationship between S. mutans phages M102AD and M102 as well as
   with Streptococcus thermophilus phages. This study also highlights the
   importance of conducting research with biological materials obtained
   from recognized microbial collections.}},

Title = {{Erosion and channel change as factors of landslides and valley formation
   in Champlain Sea Clays: The Chacoura River, Quebec, Canada}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{12-18}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The Champlain Sea clays of Eastern Canada are incised by numerous
   rivers. Their slopes have been modified by landslides: on the Chacoura
   River near Trois-Rivieres (Quebec), several large landslide scars, more
   or less recent, are visible. The role of erosion (channel incision,
   lateral channel migration and erosion of slopes due to agricultural
   drainage) as a trigger of these landslides is important. The aim of this
   study is to understand how erosion and landslides are related to valley
   development. From a detailed analysis of aerial photographs and DEMs, a
   map of the phenomena has been drawn by identifying various elements such
   as landslides, limits of the slope, position of the channel, and the
   area covered by forest. It is shown that channel change and erosion are
   strongly linked to landslides by the fact that they change the bank
   morphology in an unstable way. A slide in itself is a natural way for
   the slope to achieve stability. But when it occurs in a stream, it
   creates a disturbance to the stream flow enhancing local erosion which
   may change the river path and generate more erosion downstream or
   upstream resulting in more slides. Cross-valley sections and a
   longitudinal profile show that landslides are a major factor of valley
   formation. It appears that the upper part of the Chacoura River valley
   is still unaffected by landslides and has V-shaped sections. The lower
   part has been subject to intense erosion and many landslide scars can be
   seen. This shows that the valley morphology is transient, and that
   future activity is more likely to occur in the upper part of the river.
   Therefore the identification of areas prone to erosion will help
   determine the possible location of future large landslides just like the
   ones that occurred in the lower part. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The fatigue performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with
   externally post-tensioned carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons
   was examined in an experimental and analytical study. Five
   unstrengthened and 13 strengthened reinforced concrete beams were tested
   under various fatigue load ranges until failure. The strengthened beams
   were post-tensioned with two external CFRP tendons on a double-harped
   profile. The results demonstrated that external post-tensioning
   significantly decreased the stresses in the internal reinforcement at
   all stages of loading, and hence extended the fatigue life of the
   strengthened beams. All beams failed due to the fatigue fracture of the
   internal steel reinforcing bars. The CFRP tendons demonstrated excellent
   fatigue performance, with no indication of distress at the deviated
   points or at the anchors. A fatigue model based on a strain-life
   approach was proposed to predict the fatigue life of the strengthened
   beams. The model allows the effect of strengthening on the fatigue life
   of the beams to be explicitly evaluated during the strengthening design
   process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   salmonicida Causes the Loss of the Type Three Secretion System}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Aeromonas salmonicida, a bacterial fish pathogen, possesses a functional
   Type Three Secretion System (TTSS), which is essential for its
   virulence. The genes for this system are mainly located in a single
   region of the large pAsa5 plasmid. Bacteria lose the TTSS region from
   this plasmid through rearrangements when grown in stressful growth
   conditions. The A. salmonicida genome is rich in insertion sequences
   (ISs), which are mobile DNA elements that can cause DNA rearrangements
   in other bacterial species. pAsa5 possesses numerous ISs. Three IS11s
   from the IS256 family encircle the rearranged regions. To confirm that
   these IS11s are involved in pAsa5 rearrangements, 26 strains derived
   from strain A449 and two Canadian isolates (01-B526 and 01-B516) with a
   pAsa5 rearrangement were tested using a PCR approach to determine
   whether the rearrangements were the result of an IS11-dependent process.
   Nine out of the 26 strains had a positive PCR result, suggesting that
   the rearrangement in these strains were IS-dependent. The PCR analysis
   showed that all the rearrangements in the A449-derived strains were
   IS11-dependent process while the rearrangements in 01-B526 and 01-B516
   could only be partially coupled to the action of IS11. Unidentified
   elements that affect IS-dependent rearrangements may be present in
   01-B526 and 01-B516. Our results suggested that pAsa5 rearrangements
   involve IS11. This is the first study showing that ISs are involved in
   plasmid instability in A. salmonicida.}},

Title = {{Active training and driving-specific feedback improve older drivers'
   visual search prior to lane changes}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Driving retraining classes may offer an opportunity to
   attenuate some effects of aging that may alter driving skills.
   Unfortunately, there is evidence that classroom programs (driving
   refresher courses) do not improve the driving performance of older
   drivers. The aim of the current study was to evaluate if simulator
   training sessions with video based feedback can modify visual search
   behaviors of older drivers while changing lanes in urban driving.
   Methods: In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the video based
   feedback training, 10 older drivers who received a driving refresher
   course and feedback about their driving performance were tested with an
   on-road standardized evaluation before and after participating to a
   simulator training program (Feedback group). Their results were compared
   to a Control group (12 older drivers) who received the same refresher
   course and in-simulator active practice as the Feedback group without
   receiving driving specific feedback.
   Results: After attending the training program, the Control group showed
   no increase in the frequency of the visual inspection of three regions
   of interests (rear view and left side mirrors, and blind spot). In
   contrast, for the Feedback group, combining active training and driving-
   specific feedbacks increased the frequency of blind spot inspection by
   100\% (32.3 to 64.9\% of verification before changing lanes).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that simulator training combined with
   driving- specific feedbacks helped older drivers to improve their visual
   inspection strategies, and that in-simulator training transferred
   positively to on-road driving. In order to be effective, it is claimed
   that driving programs should include active practice sessions with
   driving- specific feedbacks. Simulators offer a unique environment for
   developing such programs adapted to older drivers' needs.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{396}},
Pages = {{10-16}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{Truncated hemoglobin HbO from Mycobacterium tuberculosis displays very
   slow exchange of diatomic ligands with its environment. Using
   femtosecond spectroscopy, we show that upon photoexcitation, ligands
   rebind with unusual speed and efficiency. Only similar to 1\% O-2 can
   escape from the heme pocket and less than 1\% NO. Most remarkably, CO
   rebinding occurs for 95\%, predominantly in 1.2 ns. The general CO
   rebinding properties are unexpectedly robust against changes in the
   interactions with close by aromatic residues Trp88 (G8) and Tyr36 (CD1).
   Molecular dynamics simulations of the CO complex suggest that
   interactions of the ligand with structural water molecules as well as
   its rotational freedom play a role in the high reactivity of the ligand
   and the heme. The slow exchange of ligands between heme and environment
   may result from a combination of hindered ligand access to the heme
   pocket by the network of distal aromatic residues, and low escape
   probability from the pocket. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a model to self-consistently describe the joint evolution of
   starburst galaxies and the galactic wind resulting from this evolution.
   This model will eventually be used to provide a subgrid treatment of
   galactic outflows in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and
   the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We combine the
   population synthesis code STARBURST99 with a semi-analytical model of
   galactic outflows and a model for the distribution and abundances of
   chemical elements inside the outflows. Starting with a galaxy mass,
   formation redshift and adopting a particular form for the star formation
   rate, we describe the evolution of the stellar populations in the
   galaxy, the evolution of the metallicity and chemical composition of the
   interstellar medium (ISM), the propagation of the galactic wind and the
   metal-enrichment of the IGM. The model takes into account the full
   energetics of the supernovae and stellar winds and their impact on the
   propagation of the galactic wind, the depletion of the ISM by the
   galactic wind and its impact on the subsequent evolution of the galaxy,
   as well as the evolving distributions and abundances of metals in the
   galactic wind. In this paper, we study the properties of the model by
   varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate and the
   efficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1)
   for a given star formation efficiency f({*}), a more extended period of
   active star formation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a
   larger extent. If f({*}) is sufficiently large, the energy deposited by
   the stars completely expels the ISM. Eventually, the ISM is being
   replenished by mass loss from supernovae and stellar winds. (2) For
   galaxies with masses above 10(11)M(circle dot), the material ejected in
   the IGM always falls back on to the galaxy. Hence lower mass galaxies
   are the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a
   minor role in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because
   their energy input is small compared to supernovae. However, they
   contribute significantly to the chemical composition of the galactic
   wind. We conclude that the history of the ISM enrichment plays a
   determinant role in the chemical composition and extent of the galactic
   wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM.}},

Title = {{Optimal Tandem Configuration for Oscillating-Foils Hydrokinetic Turbine}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A numerical investigation based on 2D URANS simulations is performed in
   order to seek an optimal spatial configuration for two oscillating foils
   within a hydrokinetic turbine. The objective of the study is to maximize
   the power extraction efficiency of the turbine. Tandem spatial
   configurations are considered because in such arrangement both
   hydrofoils are sharing the same flow window, which allows the turbine to
   reach higher efficiencies. The relative positioning of the downstream
   foil oscillating in the wake shed by the upstream hydrofoil is seen to
   be critical. Indeed, favorable interactions between the downstream foil
   and the wake vortices may lead to unexpectedly high power-extraction
   efficiencies (up to 64\%), while unfavorable interactions may cause the
   downstream foil to contribute negatively to the total power extracted. A
   global phase shift parameter is introduced to characterize the tandem
   configuration. This parameter combines the inter-foil spacing and motion
   phase-shift into a single term. It is found useful to predict additional
   favorable configurations based on known results for cases with similar
   upstream-foil wake behavior. A comparison with experimental data is
   provided. Numerical predictions are seen to overpredict the power
   extraction performance in some cases. This is likely due to the broken
   2D coherence of vortices in the 3D reality which affects the
   vortex-induced velocities and the subsequent foil-wake interactions.

Abstract = {{By using the nanocasting method, a series of mixed metal perovskite
   oxides with general formula LaBO3 (B=Mn, Co, Fe) were synthesized with
   use of ordered mesoporous KIT-6 silica as a hard template. Even though
   the resulting materials were not found to be the exact replica of the
   template, extremely high values of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific
   surface areas (110-155 m(2)g(-1)) were obtained for the materials. The
   redox properties of nanocast mesoporous perovskites were determined by
   performing temperature-programmed reduction and temperature-programmed
   desorption of oxygen. Catalytic activity was monitored by using methanol
   oxidation as a model reaction over mesoporous LaMnO3, and the first
   kinetic model was developed for the same. Nanocast mesoporous LaMnO3
   catalysts were found to show the highest conversion efficiency for
   methanol under steady-state conditions as compared with both LaCoO3 and
   LaFeO3 nanocasts and with LaMnO3 samples prepared by using other
   methods. This result is clearly associated with the higher specific
   surface area of this nanocast perovskite. Furthermore, these materials
   were found to be stable under conditions prevailing in the reactor.
   Reaction rates obtained from the experimental conversions at various
   space velocities (19 500-78 200 h(-1)) for nanocast LaMnO3 were found to
   follow a rate equation that depends on the partial pressure of methanol.
   Using the rate constants obtained, the value of activation energy and
   pre-exponential factor were determined from the Arrhenius plot. The
   calculated values of conversions from the rates modified with surface
   areas were found to agree with the experimental conversions, which in
   turn reflect the proportionality of rates to the specific surface area.}},

Abstract = {{The streaming potential is that electrical potential which,develops when
   an ionic fluid flows through the pores of a rock. It is an old concept
   that is recently being applied in many fields from monitoring water
   fronts in oil reservoirs to understanding the mechanisms behind
   synthetic earthquakes. We have carried out fundamental theoretical
   modeling of the streaming-potential coefficient as a function of pore
   fluid salinity, pH, and temperature by modifying the HS equation for use
   with porous rocks and using input parameters from established
   fundamental theory (the Debye screening length, the Stern-plane
   potential, the zeta potential, and the surface conductance). The model
   also requires the density, electrical conductivity, relative electric
   permittivity and dynamic viscosity of the bulk fluid, for which
   empirical models are used so that the temperature of the model may be
   varied. These parameters are then combined with parameters that describe
   the rock microstructure. The resulting theoretical values have been
   compared with a compilation of data for siliceous materials comprising
   290 streaming-potential coefficient measurements and 269 zeta-potential
   measurements obtained experimentally for 17 matrix-fluid combinations
   (e.g., sandstone saturated with KCI), using data from 29 publications.
   The theoretical model was found to ably describe the main features of
   the data, whether taken together or on a sample by sample basis. The
   low-salinity regime was found lobe controlled by surface conduction and
   rock microstructure, and was sensitive to changes in porosity,
   cementation exponent, formation factor, grain size, pore size and pore
   throat size as well as specific surface conductivity. The high-salinity
   regime was found to be subject to a zeta-potential offset that allows
   the streaming-potential coefficient to remain significant even as the
   saturation limit is approached.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a code division multiple access (CDMA) enabled dynamic
   bandwidth allocation (CDBA) algorithm is proposed for the upstream
   access scheme for Ethernet passive optical networks. The CDBA algorithm
   is based on two major components. The first is the parallel transmission
   capacity offered by CDMA according to the quality-of-service
   requirement, and the second is the scheduling algorithm, which uses the
   round robin technique. The CDBA algorithm is presented and its cycle
   time is derived. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied,
   assuming that the traffic load is symmetric and that the packet arrivals
   are Poisson distributed. Extensive simulations have been performed in
   order to compare the proposed CDBA algorithm with existing dynamic
   bandwidth allocation algorithms that achieve good bandwidth utilization
   by use of polling schemes. It is shown that the CDBA algorithm can
   significantly improve the network performance in terms of packet delay,
   throughput, and queue size management as compared with the well-known
   interleaved polling with adaptive cycle time algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The dosimetric impact of gold fiducial markers ( FM) implanted
   prior to external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer on low dose rate
   (LDR) brachytherapy seed implants performed in the context of combined
   therapy was investigated.
   Methods: A virtual water phantom was designed containing a single FM.
   Single and multi source scenarios were investigated by performing Monte
   Carlo dose calculations, along with the influence of varying orientation
   and distance of the FM with respect to the sources. Three prostate
   cancer patients treated with LDR brachytherapy for a recurrence
   following external beam radiotherapy with implanted FM were studied as
   surrogate cases to combined therapy. FM and brachytherapy seeds were
   identified on post implant CT scans and Monte Carlo dose calculations
   were performed with and without FM. The dosimetric impact of the FM was
   evaluated by quantifying the amplitude of dose shadows and the volume of
   cold spots. D-90 was reported based on the post implant CT prostate
   contour.
   Results: Large shadows are observed in the single source-FM scenarios.
   As expected from geometric considerations, the shadows are dependent on
   source-FM distance and orientation. Large dose reductions are observed
   at the distal side of FM, while at the proximal side a dose enhancement
   is observed. In multisource scenarios, the importance of shadows appears
   mitigated, although FM at the periphery of the seed distribution caused
   underdosage (< prescription dose). In clinical cases, the FM reduced the
   dose to some voxels by up to 50\% and generated shadows with extents of
   the order of 4 mm. Within the prostate contour, cold spots (< 95\%
   prescription dose) of the order of 20mm(3) were observed. D90 proved
   insensitive to the presence of FM for the cases selected.
   Conclusions: There is a major local impact of FM present in LDR
   brachytherapy seed implant dose distributions. Therefore, reduced tumor
   control could be expected from FM implanted in tumors, although our
   results are too limited to draw conclusions regarding clinical
   significance. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Title = {{Optimization of plant coverage in relation to water balance in the Loess
   Plateau of China}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Abstract = {{A series of revegetation practices have been implemented to improve the
   environmental quality and to reduce water and soil losses in the wind
   and water erosion transitional belt of China's Loess Plateau. An
   incompatibility exists between the limited water availability and the
   extensive plant coverage needed to protect the soil from accelerated
   erosion. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship
   between plant coverage and soil water to determine the optimal plant
   coverage for the two dominant shrubs (Caragana korshinkii Kom and Salix
   psammophila) in this area. Experiments were performed with four coverage
   treatments (T0, T1, T2, and T3) for each shrub during the growing
   seasons of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Soil water content was measured with a
   neutron probe. The Simultaneous Heat and Water Transfer (SHAW) model was
   used to simulate soil water content variations for a critical climatic
   year, i.e. the one-in-ten dry year. The soil and plant parameters of the
   SHAW model were calibrated using the measured soil water content in the
   0-200 cm soil layer of the T2 coverage for each species. The calibrated
   model was verified using measurements for T0, T1, and T3 plant
   coverages. The results indicated that soil water storage in the 0-200 cm
   soil layer decreased with increasing plant coverage. Soil desiccation
   occurred at various depths in the 0-200 cm soil layer for the different
   plant coverages. The degree of soil desiccation was greater for the two
   shrubs when plant coverage was more extensive. The SHAW model,
   calibrated for soil and plant parameters, accurately simulated soil
   water variations in the 0-200 cm profile under different plant
   coverages. During the verification phase, the root mean square error
   (RMSE) between the measured and simulated soil water contents ranged
   from 0.022 to 0.033 cm(3) cm(-3) and the relative root mean square error
   (RRMSE) ranged from 14.4\% to 24.6\%. Based on the observed and modeled
   interactions of soil water depletion and plant growth, the optimal plant
   coverage corresponds to a maximum LAI of 1.27 for C. korshinkii and 0.70
   for S. psammophila. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The gas absorption process for CO2 separation from gas streams is of
   high interest in various applications in chemical, oil, and gas

   potential and facility. The application of sterically hindered amines in
   gas-treating technology offers absorption capacity, absorption rate, and
   degradation resistance advantages over conventional amines for CO2
   removal from gases. The aim of this review is to bring an update of
   different aspects concerning several binary and multicomponent systems
   of CO2-sterically hindered amine-based absorbents essential for the
   design and operation of absorption equipment (physical properties like
   density, viscosity, vapor pressure, heat capacity and heat of

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bacterial contamination is a concern in the pulp and paper
   industry. Not only is the machinery contaminated but also can be the
   end-paper products. Bacterial transmission from unused paper towels to
   hands and surfaces is not well documented.
   Methods: The culturable bacterial community of 6 different unused paper
   towel brands was determined by culture methods and by sequencing the 16S
   ribosomal DNA of bacterial contaminants. Next, we investigated the
   possible airborne and direct contact transmissions of these bacterial
   contaminants during hand drying after washing.
   Results: Between 10(2) and 10(5) colony-forming units per gram of unused
   paper towels were isolated from the different paper towel brands.
   Bacteria belonging to the Bacillus genus were by far the most abundant
   microorganisms found (83.0\%), followed by Paenibacillus (15.6\%),
   Exiguobacterium (1.6\%), and Clostridium (0.01\%). Paper towels made
   from recycled fibers harbored between 100- to 1,000-fold more bacteria
   than the virgin wood pulp brand. Bacteria were easily transferred to
   disposable nitrile gloves when drying hands with paper towels. However,
   no evidence of bacterial airborne transmission was observed during paper
   towel dispensing.
   Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated that a large community of
   culturable bacteria, including toxin producers, can be isolated from
   unused paper towels and that they may be transferred to individuals
   after handwashing. This may have implications in some industrial and
   clinical settings as well as in immunocompromised individuals. Copyright

Abstract = {{We have prepared fluorescent analogs of known ion-channel-forming
   synthetic peptide nanostructures. These analogs were designed as probes
   to gain insight about the mechanism by which self-assembling amphiphilic
   peptides interact with lipid membranes. Conformational studies
   demonstrated that the labeled analogs retain their propensity to adopt a
   strong helical conformation in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and lipid
   bilayers. Attenuated total reflectance results indicated that the
   fluorescent peptide nanostructures are under an incorporation
   equilibrium between two forms, adsorbed at the surface or incorporated
   within the bilayer, similar to their unlabeled counterparts. However,
   when using a HeLa mimicking membrane, the proportion of peptide
   nanostructures in the transmembrane orientation decreases significantly.
   Finally, we were able to show by confocal microscopy studies that
   fluorescent analogs internalized into HeLa cells and localized into both
   the membranes of inner organelles and the cell membrane. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{We have discovered diffuse warm air vents at the surface of a chrysotile
   milling waste heap at the Black Lake mine, Thetford Mines, Quebec,
   Canada. The venting areas are inconspicuous, except in winter when the
   vents form snow-free areas of unfrozen ground, each with a surface area
   of 1-15 m(2). The temperature and chemical composition of the warm air
   vents have been monitored from March 2009 to July 2010. The temperature
   of the warm air and ground surface at the venting sites ranged from 6.6
   to 20.0 degrees C, whereas that of the ambient air ranged from -13.2 to
   20.0 degrees C. The difference between atmospheric and vent air
   temperatures is greater in cold-weather months. The warm air has low CO2
   content, but has otherwise normal atmospheric gas composition. Warm air
   volumetric flow varies from 2.1 to 19.9 L/m(2)/s in winter, when it
   contains between <10 and 18 ppm CO2. In summer, the venting areas are
   more diffuse, with volumetric flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 1.5
   L/m(2)/s, and are less depleted in CO2 (260-370 ppm). Frozen ground is
   likely focusing airflow in winter compared to summer. We present a
   conceptual model in which air enters the steep flanks of the chrysotile
   milling waste heap, into which CO2 reacts with Mg-rich minerals,
   stripping CO2 from air by exothermic mineral carbonation reactions.
   Considering the surface area of summer and winter venting areas, flow
   rates, and concentration of CO2 in warm air vents, we estimate that the
   Black Lake mine heap passively captures at least 0.6 kt CO2 per year.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical, rheological, and morphological properties of polystyrene

   morphological analysis was carried out by scanning electron microscopy
   to determine the state of dispersion and the interfacial adhesion

   flexural and torsion moduli both increased, while the tensile properties
   decreased with increasing lignin content. Nevertheless, compatibilizer
   addition was found to improve the tensile properties of the lignin/PS
   blend. The shear rheological behavior of the lignin/PS blends was also
   studied in this work where viscosity, dynamic moduli, and activation

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},

Pages = {{127-135}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present an analytical solution to describe mean groundwater age in a
   conceptualized 2D system involving parallel fractures in a porous
   matrix. The solution is obtained by a perturbative approach and takes
   into account advection and longitudinal mechanical dispersion in the
   fracture, molecular diffusion in both media and constraints at the water
   inflow boundary. Far from the inflow boundary, the solution for the age
   of water in the porous matrix is one-dimensional, and depends on the
   distance between the fractures and the diffusion coefficient. In the
   fractures and far from the inflow boundary, the contribution of the
   porous medium to the age of water depends only on the ratio of fluid
   volume in the respective regions, a result consistent with known
   behavior in ideal aquitard-aquifer systems. The analytical solution
   developed in this paper is also suitable for evaluating the accuracy of

Abstract = {{Large H ii regions, with angular dimensions exceeding 10 pc, usually
   enclose numerous massive O-stars. Stellar winds from such stars are
   expected to play a sizeable role in the dynamical, morphological and
   chemical evolution of the targeted nebula. Kinematically, stellar winds
   remain hardly observable, i.e. the typical expansion velocities of
   wind-blown bubbles being often confused with other dynamical processes
   also regularly found H ii regions. However, supersonic shock waves,
   developed by stellar winds, should favour shock excitation and leave a
   well-defined spectral signature in the ionized nebular content. In this
   work, the presence of stellar winds, observed through shock excitation,
   is investigated in the brightest portions of the Galactic IC 1805
   nebula, a giant H ii region encompassing at least 10 O-stars from
   main-sequence O9 to giant and supergiant O4. The use of the imaging
   Fourier transform spectrometer SpIOMM enabled the simultaneous
   acquisition of the spectral information associated with the Ha 6563
   angstrom, {[}N ii] 6548, 6584 angstrom, and {[}S ii] 6716, 6731 angstrom
   ionic lines. Diagnostic diagrams, first introduced by Sabbadin and
   collaborators, were used to circumscribe portions of the nebula likely
   subject to shock excitation from other areas dominated by
   photoionization. The gas compression, expected from supersonic shocks,
   is investigated by comparing the pre- and post-shocked materials
   densities computed from the line ratio. The typical line ratio slightly
   exceeds the theoretical value of 3 expected in low-density regimes. To
   explain such behaviour, a scenario based on collisional de-excitations
   affecting the {[}N ii] 6548 angstrom line is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of robotics research is to develop techniques that allow
   non-experts to teach robots dexterous skills. In this paper, we report
   our progress on the development of a framework which exploits human
   sensorimotor learning capability to address this aim. The idea is to
   place the human operator in the robot control loop where he/she can
   intuitively control the robot, and by practice, learn to perform the
   target task with the robot. Subsequently, by analyzing the robot control
   obtained by the human, it is possible to design a controller that allows
   the robot to autonomously perform the task. First, we introduce this
   framework with the ball-swapping task where a robot hand has to swap the
   position of the balls without dropping them, and present new analyses
   investigating the intrinsic dimension of the ball-swapping skill
   obtained through this framework. Then, we present new experiments toward
   obtaining an autonomous grasp controller on an anthropomorphic robot. In
   the experiments, the operator directly controls the (simulated) robot
   using visual feedback to achieve robust grasping with the robot. The
   data collected is then analyzed for inferring the grasping strategy
   discovered by the human operator. Finally, a method to generalize
   grasping actions using the collected data is presented, which allows the
   robot to autonomously generate grasping actions for different
   orientations of the target object. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{New alternating copolymers derived from thieno{[}3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione
   (TPD) and 2,7-carbazole moieties have been synthesized by Suzuki
   cross-coupling reaction and characterized. These polymers combine
   interesting properties such as good solubility and excellent thermal and
   air stability. The present studies indicate that the combination of TPD
   and 2,7-carbazole building blocks can be-a very effective way to lower
   the HOMO energy level and ultimately to enhance the V-oc of polymer
   solar cells. The V-oc reported here (up to 1.07 V) is one of the highest
   observed for polymer:{[}60]PCBM bulk heterojunction devices, and
   preliminary results on the photovoltaic devices (power conversion
   efficiencies up to 1.8\%) indicate that performance could probably be
   improved by increasing the molecular weights and by fine-tuning the
   electronic properties and the morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Ex vivo applications of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) for its
   potential in CO2 capture technologies are emerging owing to the
   formidably large hydration turnover number Nature endowed this enzyme
   with to catalyze aqueous hydration of CO2 near diffusion limits. An
   innovative scrubbing concept is proposed and simulated with a multiscale
   (channel-washcoat-resin bead) model to analyze the performances of a new
   gas-liquid-solid monolith slurry reactor for CO2 catalytic hydration
   with immobilized (washcoat) HCA II and in-situ bicarbonate removal by
   ion exchange beads (slurry). The function of in-situ ion-exchange for
   HCO3- removal is to reduce product inhibition and to enhance CO2
   hydration rate. Simulation of CO2 scrubbing for monolith three-phase
   slurry enzymatic reactor in postcombustion capture enabled assessing the
   role of enzyme loading, channel washcoat thickness, resin concentration,
   buffer acid-base constant and concentration, fluid fluxes, gas
   composition and channel length. By enabling resin exchange-removal of
   inhibitor, reactor performances are improved with increasing enzyme
   loading, and buffer concentration and acid-base constant. (C) 2011

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{221-233}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Homo-polyimides and co-polyimides (PI) were synthesized from dianhydride
   of 6FDA (4,4'-(Hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphthalic anhydride) and
   diamine of ODA (4,4'-Oxydianiline) or with ODA and TeMPD
   (2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine) by chemical imidization in a
   two-step procedure. In this work, APTMDS
   (bis(3-aminopropyl)-tetramethyldisiloxane) is a diamino organosilicone
   proposed as a new cross-linking agent to produce polyimides membranes
   for CO2/CH4 separation. Two approaches were studied: direct mixing of
   APTMDS in the polyimide solution or immersing a PI membrane in a
   APTMDS/methanol solution. The modified and original polyimides were then
   fully characterized. The gas transport properties of CO2, CH4 and their
   blends were investigated at 35 degrees C and 150 psi. For neat gases,
   CO2 and CH4 permeability decreased and ideal selectivity increased with
   increasing immersion time and APTMDS concentration. The performance of
   APTMDS modified 6FDA-ODA membrane are above the Robeson {[}7] upper
   bound curve. For gas mixtures, the permeabilities and separation factors
   were studied as a function of CO2 molar fraction (35 degrees C, 150 psi)
   and feed pressure (50/50 CO2/CH4 at 35 degrees C). It was found that CO2
   and CH4 permeabilities decreased while separation factors increased with
   immersion time and concentration. The modified membranes can support
   pressures as high as 600 psi (45 atm) giving them a wider range of
   operation conditions. Finally, the plasticization of polyimides can be
   practically eliminated by APSMDS cross-linking with either membrane
   immersion in methanol solution or initial mixing in the polyimide at the
   reaction step. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, lead sulphide (PbS) particles were synthesized from
   methanolic lead acetate-thiourea (PbAc-TU) complex via various
   precipitation techniques based on the decomposition of methanolic
   PbAc-TU complex. The influence of these techniques on the morphology,
   size and physical properties of PbS particles was studied in details. In
   general, scanning electron microscopy of the PbS particles produced by
   conventional chemical bath deposition, sonochemical bath deposition and
   microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition revealed that they were
   nanostructured with different size and shape. X-ray diffraction
   confirmed their high purity, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) showed that they were partially oxidized due to their high surface
   energy. Optical absorption, transmission electron microscopy, selective
   area electron diffraction and XPS of capped nanoparticles (NPs) produced
   via capping assisted chemical bath deposition using
   poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP) and oleic acid (OA) indicated that narrow
   size distributed PbS NPs absorbed strongly in the visible region with
   cubic crystalline phase without any evidence of surface oxidation.
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of PVP-capped PbS NPs showed
   strong interaction between PbS NPs and polymer matrix, while for
   OA-capped PbS NPs, OA was chemically absorbed on the surface of PbS NPs.

Abstract = {{The longitudinal distribution of the laser peak intensity inside a half
   meter long femtosecond laser filament in air is studied by measuring the
   signal ratio of two nitrogen fluorescence lines, 391 nm and 337 nm. The
   experimental results reveal that laser peak intensity initially remains
   almost constant (similar to 4.3 x 10(13) W/cm(2)) inside the filament.
   However, before the end of the filament, surprisingly the laser
   intensity undergoes dramatic increase. A maximum intensity as high as
   2.8x10(14) W/cm(2) could be reached. The experimental result is
   unexpected by the conventional intensity clamping scenario, according to
   which the laser peak intensity would feature low variation along a
   filament. The experimental result is then interpreted as being due to
   the generation of a short pulse at trailing stage of the filamentation
   with reduced diameter. This phenomenon might be of great interest owing
   to its potential application in high-order-harmonic generation and
   producing isolated single attosecond laser pulse through simple
   experimental approach. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

   facilitate the modeling of real systems, mainly complex networks, using

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy is associated with highly heterogeneous spatial dose
   distributions. This heterogeneity is usually ignored when estimating the
   biological effective dose (BED). In addition, the heterogeneities of the
   medium including the tissue heterogeneity (TH) and the interseed
   attenuation (ISA) are also contributing to the heterogeneity of the dose
   distribution, but they are both ignored in Task Group 43 (TG43)-based
   protocols. This study investigates the effect of dose heterogeneity, TH
   and ISA on metrics that are commonly used to quantify biological
   efficiency in brachytherapy. The special case of 29 breast cancer
   patients treated with permanent Pd-103 seed implant is considered here.
   BED is compared to equivalent uniform BED (EUBED) capable of considering
   the spatial heterogeneity of the dose distribution. The effects of TH
   and ISA on biological efficiency of treatments are taken into account by
   comparing TG43 with Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations for each patient.
   The effect of clonogenic repopulation is also considered. The analysis
   is performed for different sets of (alpha/beta,alpha) ratios of (2,
   0.3), (4, 0.27) and (10, 0.3) {[}Gy, Gy(-1)] covering the whole range of
   reported alpha/beta values in the literature. BED is sometimes larger
   and sometimes smaller than EUBED(TG43) indicating that the effect of the
   dose heterogeneity is not similar among patients. The effect of the dose
   heterogeneity can be characterized by using the D-99 dose metric. For
   each set of the radiobiological parameters considered, a D-99 threshold
   is found over which dose heterogeneity will cause an overestimation of
   the biological efficiencies while the inverse happens for smaller D-99
   values. EUBED(MC) is always larger than EUBED(TG43) indicating that by
   neglecting TH and ISA in TG43-based dosimetry algorithms, the biological
   efficiencies may be underestimated by about 10 Gy. Overall, by going
   from BED to the more accurate EUBED(MC) there is a gain of about 9.6 to
   13 Gy on the biological efficiency. The efficiency gain is about 10.8 to
   14 Gy when the repopulation is considered. Dose heterogeneity does not
   have a constant impact on the biological efficiencies and may under- or
   overestimate the efficacy in different patients. However, the combined
   effect of neglecting dose heterogeneity, TH and ISA results in
   underestimation of the biological efficiencies in permanent breast seed

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to map a state-space continuous-time
   model into an equivalent discrete state-space model. It is shown that
   the discrete model can approximate the continuous one to an arbitrary
   high-order which can be set by the user. In addition, it is demonstrated
   that the constructed discrete model is guaranteed stable, where it can
   be run in an A-stable or L-stable mode, depending on the application or
   user's preference. The proposed mapping method is based on the
   single-step Obreshkov integration formulas that were proposed to solve
   ordinary differential equations. Preliminary performance experiments
   show superior accuracy compared to traditional discretization methods
   such as the Tustin method. Application of the proposed method to the
   discretization of analog filters demonstrates a significant accuracy in
   matching both of the magnitude and phase of the frequency response of
   the continuous system.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) forming
   process on radiofrequency ammonia plasma surface-treated PET flat films
   and fibres obtained by melt blowing. Ammonia plasma treatment allowed
   for the incorporation of amino functionalities on both the film and
   fibre surfaces, with higher values observed at very short treatment
   times. This plasma treatment also induced polymer chain scissions which
   were observed as the formation of hydrophilic nodules that coalesced
   together and were loosely bound to the underlying polymeric materials.
   These plasma-induced surface damages were notably more important on the
   melt-blown PET fibres. Consequently, maximisation of the surface amino
   groups with minimal polymer chain breaking was achieved using very short
   plasma treatment times (typically 1 s). We also demonstrated that the
   polymer forming process must be taken into account when plasma
   modifications are to be performed on PET, as it may already lead to
   polymer chain breakings subsequently added to those induced in the
   plasma environment.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo imaging of cellular dynamics can be dramatically enabling to
   understand the pathophysiology of nervous system diseases. To fully
   exploit the power of this approach, the main challenges have been to
   minimize invasiveness and maximize the number of concurrent optical
   signals that can be combined to probe the interplay between multiple
   cellular processes. Label-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering
   (CARS) microscopy, for example, can be used to follow demyelination in
   neurodegenerative diseases or after trauma, but myelin imaging alone is
   not sufficient to understand the complex sequence of events that leads
   to the appearance of lesions in the white matter. A commercially
   available microendoscope is used here to achieve minimally invasive,
   video-rate multimodal nonlinear imaging of cellular processes in live
   mouse spinal cord. The system allows for simultaneous CARS imaging of
   myelin sheaths and two-photon excitation fluorescence microendoscopy of
   microglial cells and axons. Morphometric data extraction at high spatial
   resolution is also described, with a technique for reducing
   motion-related imaging artifacts. Despite its small diameter, the
   microendoscope enables high speed multimodal imaging over wide areas of
   tissue, yet at resolution sufficient to quantify subtle differences in
   myelin thickness and microglial motility. (C) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{The performance of a new concept of hydrokinetic turbine using
   oscillating hydrofoils to extract energy from water currents (tidal or
   gravitational) is investigated using URANS numerical simulations. The
   numerical predictions are compared with experimental data from a 2 kW
   prototype, composed of two rectangular oscillating hydrofoils of aspect
   ratio 7 in a tandem spatial configuration. 3D computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) predictions are found to compare favorably with
   experimental data especially for the case of a single-hydrofoil turbine.
   The validity of approximating the actual arc-circle trajectory of each
   hydrofoil by an idealized vertical plunging motion is also addressed by
   numerical simulations. Furthermore, a sensitivity study of the turbine's
   performance in relation to fluctuating operating conditions is performed
   by feeding the simulations with the actual time-varying experimentally
   recorded conditions. It is found that cycle-averaged values, as the
   power-extraction efficiency, are little sensitive to perturbations in
   the foil kinematics and upstream velocity. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005841]}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the singularity analysis of parallel manipulators
   with identical limb structures performing Schonflies motions, namely,
   three independent translations and one rotation about an axis of fixed
   direction (3T1R). Eleven architectures obtained from a recent type
   synthesis of such manipulators are analyzed. The constraint analysis
   shows that these architectures are all overconstrained and share some
   common properties between the actuation and the constraint wrenches. The
   singularities of such manipulators are examined through the singularity
   analysis of the 4-RUU parallel manipulator. A wrench graph representing
   the constraint wrenches and the actuation forces of the manipulator is
   introduced to formulate its superbracket. Grassmann-Cayley Algebra is
   used to obtain geometric singularity conditions. Based on the concept of
   wrench graph, Grassmann geometry is used to show the rank deficiency of
   the Jacobian matrix for the singularity conditions. Finally, this paper
   shows the general aspect of the obtained singularity conditions and
   their validity for 3T1R parallel manipulators with identical limb
   structures. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005336]}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of multiple antennas and space-time codes in
   multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems
   significantly improves the transmission channel capacity without using
   additional bandwidth and power. The improvement is achieved by
   decomposing the spatial structure of transmission channels and
   performing appropriate temporal and spatial multiplexing. In this paper,
   we propose a novel theoretical framework for MIMO channel modeling and
   characterization in order to facilitate the MIMO system design and
   performance evaluation. The channels are represented in space, time,
   wave vector, and frequency domains while the space-time and wave
   vector-frequency interdependences are considered. A realization of the
   theoretical framework, in a form of a practical framework, is also
   proposed to address the channel modeling and characterization at both
   transmitter and receiver sides. The utilization of the practical
   framework in MIMO communication system design is discussed to illustrate
   its applications in realistic scenarios. The angle of arrival estimation
   based on the proposed practical framework using field test measurement
   data is also presented as illustrative examples.}},

   Beaumont Dam are reported in this paper. We show that the horizontal
   displacements of the ice sheet, which can be as large as 20-30 cm, can
   vary quite differently from one winter season to another one, as a
   function of the temperature and its variation during winter. The
   horizontal displacements also depend on the probe's distance from the
   dam or from the reservoir banks. Vertical displacements of the ice sheet
   follow the reservoir water level fluctuations, especially for the probes
   far from the dam and reservoir banks. Three-dimensional displacements
   are explained by the gradual increase of the ice sheet's thickness, the
   snowpack accumulation, and the local constraints (hinge effects) near
   the reservoir perimeter. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)SU.1943-5428.0000060. (C)

Abstract = {{A multi-layer packed-bed electrochemical reactor (PBER) approach was
   used for studying the leaching behavior of associated and free
   (silica-trapped) gold from a series of synthetic multi-mineral systems
   consisting of pyrite, silica, Au, and successively, X = chalcopyrite,
   sphalerite and chalcocite. The PBER was filled with sieved powders of
   sulfidic minerals (pyrite. X), gold and silica arranged as
   electrically-isolated three-layer parallel to pyrite parallel to X
   parallel to silica parallel to and two-layer parallel to pyrite + X
   parallel to silica parallel to systems. Introduction of gold
   successively in each layer of the three- and two-layer PBER systems
   highlighted the role of Au-pyrite. Au-X and pyrite-X binary, and
   Au-pyrite-X ternary galvanic interactions in the leaching of associated
   and free gold. The highest Au recovery was achieved within the pyrite
   layer while the lowest was within the silica layer. For the parallel to
   pyrite parallel to chalcocite parallel to silica system, depletion of
   free cyanide and surface passivation inhibited strongly gold leaching.
   Cyanidation experiments performed in the mixed parallel to sulfide
   parallel to silica parallel to systems showed that the effect of
   Au-sulfide galvanic interactions largely depend on the mineralogical
   association between phases. The presence of galvanic effects between the
   associated minerals in the PBER was confirmed by a conjunction of
   electrochemical and chemical speciation studies. Increasing the
   pyrite-Au areal ratio increased gold leaching as a result of increased
   cathodic areas for oxygen reduction. However, gold leaching from mixed
   multi-mineral systems where multi-factorial galvanic contacts were
   enabled was controlled mostly by the relative area ratios between the
   associated sulfide minerals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate channel models are extremely important for the design of
   communications systems. Knowledge of the features of the channel
   provides communications system designers with the ability to predict the
   performance of the system for specific modulations, channel coding, and
   signal processing. This paper presents a statistical characterization of
   an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) propagation channel in an underground mine.
   Measurements were carried out in the 2-5 GHz frequency band. Various
   communication links were considered including both line-of-sight (LOS)
   and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The measurement procedure allows us to
   characterize both the large-scale and the small-scale statistics of the
   channel. The aim here is to study in more details the statistical
   characteristics of the UWB propagation channel in an underground mine
   and to provide insight for future statistical channel modeling works.
   Channel characteristics examined include the distance and frequency
   dependency of path loss, shadowing fading statistics, and multipath
   temporal-domain parameter statistics such as the mean excess delay and
   the RMS delay spread. This work has been carried out by the underground
   communications research laboratory LRCS (The LRCS laboratory aims to
   develop research programs related to wireless telecommunications in
   underground mines. Research is conducted at its own facility as well as
   the CANMET experimental mine in Val-d'Or, Quebec, Canada), and the

   Technology) in Val-d' or, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of catalytic reactions to concurrent filtration and
   fines deposition in trickle-bed reactors (TBRs) was assessed by means of
   the catalytic hydrogenation of alpha-methylstyrene from kaolin-kerosene
   suspension flows. A negative correlation between catalytic conversion
   and the specific deposit of the bed resulted from the extra
   mass-transfer step that built up on the collectors in the course of
   filtration. The severity of the evolving extra mass-transfer step was
   sensitive to deposit compaction resulting from higher gas superficial
   velocities. Furthermore, irreversible catalyst activity losses were
   observed after catalyst cleanup and were ascribed to irretrievable
   active sites by catalyst intraparticle fines trapping. Fines
   accumulation in the catalyst bed was notably reduced by means of
   high-porosity solid-foam modules used as guard filters and placed
   upstream of, and adjacent to, the trickle bed. Hydrodynamic studies were
   carried out with alumina and silicon carbide solid foams to assess their
   role on the distribution of suspension and the reduction of specific
   deposit and pressure drop in trickle beds. It was found that the foam
   capture efficiency critically depended on the open connectivity of foam
   cells and the physicochemical nature of foam materials. The numbering up
   of foam modules led to reduced overall specific deposits of the beds and
   pressure drops, foreseeing a prospect for prolonging the hydrotreatment
   TBR lifetime, using solid foam as guard beds.}},

Abstract = {{Results of an experimental study on the bond performance of deformed

   having the same amount of total mortar and coarse aggregate. In this
   method, the properties and volume fractions of natural aggregate and
   residual mortar in RCA are quantitatively included as part of the total
   aggregate and total mortar content of the RCA concrete. Twelve beam-end
   bond specimens were prepared and tested according to ASTM A944-99
   standard. The test variables comprised mix proportioning method, bar
   size, and aggregate type. The results showed that the bond strength
   between the reinforcing steel bars and the RCA concrete proportioned by
   the new method is comparable to their bond strength with regular
   concrete but 18\% to 33\% higher than their strength with RCA concrete
   proportioned by conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{For many types of equipment whose maintenance requires skilled labor or
   whose random failure may have serious consequences, such as aircraft
   engines, medical equipment and others, customers generally prefer to
   entrust maintenance activities to the manufacturer or any of its
   representatives. The latter must, in turn, provide the customer with a
   maintenance program that is economically viable for both parties. In
   this study, the customer and the manufacturer agree on what follows
   regarding a non-self-announcing failure equipment whose state is only
   known through inspection: during the warranty period, the manufacturer
   inspects the equipment according to a specified schedule which he
   establishes taking into account that the costs incurred for inspections
   and replacements are supported by him during the warranty period. After
   the expiration of the warranty, inspections and replacements are
   performed by the manufacturer and billed to the customer. Moreover,
   penalties related to inactivity periods between failures and their
   detection are always supported by the manufacturer. The warranty is
   applicable to any equipment replaced during the validity period of the
   service contract. This type of contract generates a profit for the
   manufacturer. In this paper, an analytical model taking into account the
   commitments of both parties has been developed. The model allows
   generating the instants (x(1), x(2),...,x(n)) at which the inspections
   must be performed and the corresponding expected profit for the
   manufacturer while considering the warranty period offered on the market
   for similar equipment. An algorithm has also been developed to generate
   the inspection instants given the costs structure and the lifetime
   probability distribution of the equipment. In a context where business
   models argue for a greater implication of suppliers towards their
   customers, the proposed decision model may be relevant and very useful.

Abstract = {{Groundwater contamination by nitrate was investigated in an agricultural
   area in southern Quebec. Canada, where a municipal well is the local
   source of drinking water. A network of 38 piezometers was installed
   within the capture zone of the municipal well to monitor water table
   levels and nitrate concentrations in the aquifer. Nitrate concentrations
   were also measured in the municipal well. A Water flow and Nitrate
   transport Global Model (WNGM) was developed to simulate the impact of
   agricultural activities on nitrate concentrations in both the aquifer
   and municipal well. The WNGM first uses the Agriflux model to simulate
   vertical water and nitrate fluxes below the root zone for each of the
   seventy agricultural fields located within the capture zone of the
   municipal well. The WNGM then uses the HydroGeoSphere model to simulate
   three-dimensional variably-saturated groundwater flow and nitrate
   transport in the aquifer using water and nitrate fluxes computed with
   the Agriflux model as the top boundary conditions. The WNGM model was
   calibrated by reproducing water levels measured from 2005 to 2007 in the
   network of piezometers and nitrate concentrations measured in the
   municipal well from 1997 to 2007. The nitrate concentrations measured in
   the network of piezometers, however, showed greater variability than in
   the municipal well and could not be reproduced by the calibrated model.
   After calibration, the model was validated by successfully reproducing
   the decrease of nitrate concentrations observed in the municipal well in
   2006 and 2007. Although it cannot predict nitrate concentrations in
   individual piezometers, the calibrated and validated WNGM can be used to
   assess the impact of changes in agricultural practices on global nitrate
   concentrations in the aquifer and in the municipal well. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A versatile synthetic method which is based on a solvothermal technique
   for the fabrication of highly crystalline TiO2 nanocrystals (NC)
   exhibiting different shapes such as rhombic, truncated rhombic,
   spherical, dog-bone, truncated, and elongated rhombic is reported. The
   dominant features of the present approach are first the use of water
   vapor as hydrolysis agent to accelerate the reaction, and second, the
   use of both oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OM) as two distinct capping
   surfactants having different binding strengths for the control of the
   growth of the TiO2 nanoparticles. It is shown that the presence of an
   appropriate amount of water vapor along with the desired OA/OM molar
   ratio plays a crucial role in controlling size and shape of TiO2 NCs.
   Moreover, it is also established that the thus-obtained TiO2 NCs are
   excellent support for the synthesis of composite metal/TiO2
   photocatalysts in which metal clusters are uniformly deposited on the
   surface of each individual TiO2 NC. (C) 2011 Canadian Society for

   adsorbent loading and the decrease of the initial concentration. The
   adsorption capacity decreased with increasing the temperature. Maximum
   adsorption capacity obtained at 5 degrees C was ca. 19 mg NH4+/g
   adsorbent. The isotherms data were studied using different adsorption

Abstract = {{Adsorption of nitrate and monovalent phosphate anions from aqueous

   silica was investigated. The adsorbents were prepared via a
   post-synthesis grafting method, using either
   3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (N-silane) or
   {[}1-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl]trimethoxysilane (NN-silane) or
   1-{[}3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyl]-diethylenetriamine (NNN-silane),
   followed by acidification in HCl solution to convert the attached
   surface amino groups to positively charged ammonium moieties. The
   nominal loading of amino moieties on the SBA-15 surface was varied from
   5\% to 20\% as organoalkoxysilane/silica molar ratio. The adsorption
   experiments were conducted batchwise at room temperature. Results showed
   that adsorption capacity increased with increasing the concentration of
   monoammonium groups on the SBA-15 adsorbent. Nitrate adsorption capacity
   increased from 0.34 to 0.66 mmol NO3-/g adsorbent while phosphate
   adsorption capacity increased from 0.34 to 0.63 mmol H2PO4-/g adsorbent

   ratio of 10\%, the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of

   phase with viscosity ratios 0.036 and 1.13, below and above but close to
   unity. Three weight concentrations 0.5\%, 2\% and 10\% of the block
   copolymer laying below, close to and above the critical concentration of
   the total drop surface coverage were examined. Single drop deformation
   experiments were carried out in a home-designed Couette quartz cell
   connected to a home-modified Paar Physica Rheometer. The variation in
   the length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) versus shear rate and capillary
   number was measured both in steady and in transient regimes till
   breakup. The results indicated a weaker resistance of copolymer modified
   drops against hydrodynamic stresses at both viscosity ratios as compared

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the melt rheological properties of ethylene vinyl
   acetate containing between 0 and 10 wt.\% of nano-crystalline cellulose
   (NCC). A complete set of rheological tests including frequency sweeps,
   shear transients, and uniaxial elongations was performed. Frequency
   sweeps showed that at low frequencies, a pseudo solid-like behavior was
   obtained for NCC concentrations higher than 5\%. This behavior was
   related to hydrogen bonding between NCC particles and the creation of
   particle networks as the result of particle-particle interactions. For
   transient shear tests, all compositions presented a stress overshoot at
   high shear rates before reaching a steady state. It was found that the
   amplitude of this overshoot depends on both NCC content and shear rate.
   On the other hand, the time to reach the maximum was found to be highly
   shear rate dependent but concentration dependence was rather weak. For
   uniaxial extensional flow, higher extensional viscosity was observed
   with increasing NCC content. On the other hand, strain hardening was
   found to decrease with increasing NCC content.}},

Abstract = {{A multiblock partial least squares (PL) modeling approach is proposed in
   this Article for multivariate analysis and monitoring of aluminum
   reduction smelters and other electrochemical processes. These industries
   commonly operate from hundreds to a thousand of metallurgical reactors
   in parallel, which makes is difficult to build and maintain separate
   models for each unit. To cope with this problem, the proposed approach
   is based on the assumption that reactors sharing the same design (i.e.,
   technology) and fed with the same lots of raw materials should also
   share a similar latent variable space. This allows reducing the number
   of latent variable models to build for process monitoring. The approach
   is illustrated on the basis of data collected from 31 reactors used for
   aluminum reduction. It was shown that well-defined regions in the raw
   material property and process operation spaces were associated with
   higher smelter performance. These could be used to establish joint
   multivariate specification regions for raw materials as well as for
   plant-wide process monitoring.}},

   concentration, we can optimize the active layer morphology for charge
   separation and transport. A smoother morphology is likely the result of
   polymer chain adsorption on cQDs via F(4)TCNQ which increases the steric
   barrier between cQDs. Our most optimized device has a F(4)TCNQ:cQDs
   weight ratio of 0.5\% improving the power conversion efficiency by a

Abstract = {{The problem of model discrimination arises when several models are
   proposed to describe one and the same process, a situation encountered
   in many research fields. To identify the best model from the set of
   rival models, it may be necessary to collect new information about the
   process, and thus additional experiments have to be performed. Several
   approaches have been described in literature to design optimal
   discriminatory experiments. The anticipatory approach is one of them and
   is very appealing from a conceptual point of view because the expected
   information content of the newly designed experiment is considered, even
   before the experiment is performed (anticipatory design). In this paper,
   the performance of this approach is evaluated by comparing it with the
   performance of other, established approaches to optimal experimental
   design for model discrimination. To conduct this comparison four
   performance measures were defined: (1) whether the most appropriate
   model could be identified, (2) the number of additional experiments that
   have to be designed and performed to achieve model discrimination, (3)
   the quality of the parameter estimates of the model that is eventually
   identified as the most appropriate one, and (4) the rate at which the
   inadequate models are identified. The results clearly indicate that the
   anticipatory approach has its benefits and may be the preferred approach
   in many applications in (bio)chemical engineering and in-silico biology.

   nonimmunogenic, and biocompatible polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG). Attached at the surface of nanoparticles, this polymer enhances
   the steric repulsion and therefore the stability of the colloids. In
   this study, phosphate molecules were used as an alternative to silanes
   or carboxylic acids, to graft PEG at the surface of ultrasmall
   gadolinium oxide nanoparticles (US-Gd2O3, 2-3 nm diameter). This
   emerging, high-sensitivity ``positive{''} contrast agent is used for
   signal enhancement in T-1-weighted molecular and cellular MRI.
   Comparative grafting assays were performed on Gd2O3 thin films, which
   demonstrated the strong reaction of phosphate with Gd2O3 compared to
   silane and carboxyl groups. Therefore, PEG-phosphate was preferentially
   used to coat US-Gd2O3 nanoparticles. The grafting of this polymer on the
   particles was confirmed by XPS and FTIR. These analyses also
   demonstrated the strong attachment of PEG-phosphate at the surface of
   Gd2O3, forming a protective layer on the nanoparticles. The stability in
   aqueous solution, the relaxometric properties, and the MRI signal of
   PEG-phosphate-covered Gd2O3 particles were also better than those from
   non-PEGylated nanoparticles. As a result, reacting PEG-phosphate with
   Gd2O3 particles is a promising, rapid, one-step procedure to PEGylate
   US-Gd2O3 nanoparticles, an emerging ``positive{''} contrast agent for
   preclinical molecular and cellular applications.}},

Abstract = {{The production of drinking water from fresh surface water involves
   several processes, energy consumption and chemical dosing, all having

   The objective of the present study was to conduct a comparative life
   cycle assessment of two water treatment plants: one enhanced
   conventional plant and one nanofiltration plant. One existing
   nanofiltration plant was chosen and investigated in great detail,
   including its operation and construction phases. This plant is located
   in the northern part of the Province of Quebec and has been in operation
   for over 10 years. A virtual conventional plant was designed for
   comparative purposes. The comparative life cycle assessment was
   performed using SimaPro software for inventory and impact assessment
   phases. The study revealed very different impacts for the two plants,
   drawing attention to the importance of the choice of water treatment
   chemicals and energy source. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   laser peak intensity inside the filament in air. It is based on the

   nm and 337 nm. Because of distinct excitation mechanisms, the signals of
   the two fluorescence lines increase with the laser intensity at
   different orders of nonlinearity. An empirical formula has been deduced
   according to which laser peak intensity could be simply determined by
   the fluorescence ratio. (C) 2011 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Physical properties of coke particles including particle shape and size
   distribution have direct effects on their packing density. In the
   present work, effects of particle shape and size distribution on
   vibrated bulk density (VBD) of dry coke samples have been investigated.
   Discrete Element Method (DEM) has also been used to simulate the
   vibration process. Results showed that the shape and size distribution
   of particles influence the bulk density of coke and these parameters can
   be used to describe the packing density of coke particles. In general,
   mixed samples provide higher VBD than mono-size samples and as the
   fraction of coarse particles increases vibrated bulk density increases.
   However, existence of 10 wt.\% of fine particles to fill the pores
   between coarse particles is essential. Simulation results were also
   reasonably consistent with experimental data. Finally, it is noteworthy
   that a well-tailored DEM model is capable of predicting the particle
   rearrangement and density evolution during the vibration process.}},

   on 50 mm diameter samples cored in 20 different anodes with the
   advantage of using possibly different raw materials. In addition to the

Abstract = {{Proton therapy offers the advantages of a superior target dose
   conformality and lower integral dose over the conventional photon
   therapy. However, range uncertainties associated with dose calculation
   approximations, tumor motion, setup variations, etc., present a major
   concern in proton therapy. In order to address this issue, we are
   developing a 2 mm resolution scintillating fiber detector with fibers
   arranged such that they form a 2D matrix that allows the determination
   of x- and y-position of the proton. By implementing a scheme consisting
   only of one detector positioned in front of the patient and another
   detector behind the patient, we can potentially realize a real-time
   measurement of proton position, direction, and range/energy
   simultaneously to reconstruct proton radiographs, also eliminating the
   need to use an additional bulky range telescope or calorimeter which is
   not appropriate for in vivo clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{ZnxCd1-xS alloyed shells and Mn2+ ions were studied as a means to
   confine charge carriers away from the surface of nanocrystals. In the
   former case, the electron confinement potential increased with the Zn
   fraction in CdSe/ZnxCd1-xS colloidal quantum dots and their
   photoluminescence blueshifted by similar to 50 nm. However, structural
   defects and polydispersity became important in samples with x >0.7
   likely due to a phase transition and to strain increasing with
   core/shell lattice mismatch reaching 12\% when x = 1. In the latter
   case, the Mn2+ ions diffused within MnyZn1-ySe/ZnSe nanocrystals act as
   localized luminescent centers and their density can be controlled with
   the Mn fraction in the alloyed core. The ions are excited through energy
   transfers from excitons in the ZnSe, and given the long lifetime of the
   Mn2+ first excited state, thermo-activated reverse energy transfer also
   occurred and emission from the ZnSe excitons was observed.}},

Abstract = {{Fertilization of guava relies on soil and tissue testing. The
   interpretation of tissue test is currently conducted by comparing
   nutrient concentrations or dual ratios with critical values or ranges.
   The critical value approach is affected by nutrient interactions.
   Nutrient interactions can be described by dual ratios where two
   nutrients are compressed into a single expression or a ternary diagrams
   where one redundant proportion can be computed by difference between
   100\% and the sum of the other two. There are D(D-1) possible dual
   ratios in a D-parts composition and most of them are thus redundant.
   Nutrients are components of a mixture that convey relative, not absolute
   information on the composition. There are D-1 balances between
   components or ingredients in any mixture. Compositional data are
   intrinsically redundant, scale dependent and non-normally distributed.
   Based on the principles of equilibrium and orthogonality, the nutrient
   balance concept projects D-1 isometric log ratio (ilr) coordinates into
   the Euclidean space. The D-1 balances between groups of nutrients are
   ordered to reflect knowledge in plant physiology, soil fertility and
   crop management. Our objective was to evaluate the ilr approach using
   nutrient data from a guava orchard survey and fertilizer trials across
   the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Cationic balances varied widely between
   orchards. We found that the Redfield N/P ratio of 13 was critical for
   high guava yield. We present guava yield maps in ternary diagrams.
   Although the ratio between nutrients changing in the same direction with
   time is often assumed to be stationary, most guava nutrient balances and
   dual ratios were found to be non-stationary. The ilr model provided an
   unbiased nutrient diagnosis of guava.}},

Abstract = {{Quebec's primary aluminium production industry consumes roughly 39 TWh
   of electricity per year and is accountable for roughly 7 million tons of
   CO2 equivalent. By tapping only a small portion of waste heat and
   integrating it inside the production facility itself, we can
   significantly reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption. Although the
   amount of thermal waste can be adequately estimated by applying an
   energy balance to production processes, this provides very little
   information on the quality of waste heat and its potential for
   integration. A measure of exergy is required. Waste heat streams
   characterized by high exergy content may generally offer valuable
   incentives for recovery and integration. More generally, exergy values
   limit integration possibilities. An exergy analysis is provided for the
   aluminium electrolytic reduction process. This is meant to guide future
   heat recovery initiatives and energy efficiency measures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first phase of an investigation aiming to
   determine the validity of using a CO2 marker in cold rig experiments to
   characterize the thermal performances of turbine rim seals under actual
   engine operating conditions. For comparison purposes, simulations are
   carried out for two sets of operating conditions, namely cold rig (with
   uniform low temperature) and real turbine thermal conditions (high
   temperature gaspath and cold purge flow). Sealing effectiveness based on
   the CO2 diagnostic under cold rig operating conditions is compared to
   sealing effectiveness based on the computed temperature field under real
   engine temperature conditions. Unsteady RANS simulations with different
   purge flow rates are performed. Tested geometries include a 180 degrees
   domain presenting a simplified rim seal geometry with no vanes nor
   blades in the gaspath, and a 24 degrees sector of a complete turbine
   stage including 3 vanes and 4 blades. Three-dimensional flow structures
   known to affect ingestion are found with both geometries but appear to
   be sensitive to the differences in operating conditions. Indeed, their
   circumferential number and strength differ between the two scenarios of
   conditions. Furthermore, it is found that the cold rig predictor tends
   to slightly overestimate the sealing effectiveness, while providing
   nonetheless the right trends and reasonably accurate average values in
   levels of actual sealing. At this stage of the investigation, we
   conclude that it seems adequate to use a passive tracer in cold rig
   experiments to compare performances of rim seal designs.}},

Abstract = {{Wavefront coding is a hybrid technology designed to increase depth of
   field of conventional optics but it can also be used to compensate for
   other aberration and ease tolerancing. The goal of our research is to
   apply this technology to panoramic imager. Panoramic imagers suffer from
   an increase level of aberration due to the large field of view and it is
   also subject to a special tolerance process. They also typically have a
   wide variation of the point spread function (PSF) across the field of
   view and suffer from non-symmetric aberration like coma and astigmatism.
   To obtain the best result using wavefront coding, the PSF should be as
   invariant as possible over the whole field of view. Asymmetric phase
   masks, when used in systems having non-negligible asymmetric
   aberrations, generate variations in the final image quality. For that
   reason, a model that predicts the final image quality of wavefront coded
   system is needed. The possibility of using two surfaces for wavefront
   coding has been studied. The final results were analysed using a
   variance based image quality criterion. From these results, it is
   possible to optimize phase mask for panoramic imager and predict the
   resulting image quality.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed video coding is a new video paradigm that transfers the

   of video transmission involving inexpensive encoders and a powerful
   central decoder would be possible. In a previous work, the authors have
   proposed a novel distributed video coding scheme with progressive
   decoding. The proposed architecture considers a chessboard structure for
   block grouping. A subset of blocks are first sent, decoded and then used
   to update the side information. Then, the remaining blocks are sent and
   decoded using the updated and more accurate side information. This
   progressive technique with two groups of blocks shows an improvement up
   to 1.7 dB over the conventional DVC architecture. In this paper, we
   extend the progressive architecture by splitting the frame into three
   and four groups of blocks rather than only two groups. Further
   improvement up to 0.4 dB over the progressive architecture with only two
   groups is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel topology of transformerless DC-DC step-up
   converter based on the association of several resonant sub-circuits in a
   multilevel configuration. It allows for the interconnection of a generic
   number of conversion modules, rated both for a fraction of the output
   voltage and power, in series at the output side and in parallel at the
   input side. This arrangement is made possible due to the use of coupling
   capacitors in the series branches of the resonant circuits, which block
   the DC voltage components amongst the different modules. Large voltage
   stepping-up ratios are therefore possible, by associating a large number
   of modules (levels), without compromlsmg the performance, the
   dimensioning process and the controls of each individual module. Its
   operating principle is developed and the main dimensioning equations are

Abstract = {{Cooperative localization is one of the fundamental techniques in
   GPS-denied environments, such as underwater, indoor, or on other
   planets, where teams of robots use each other to improve their pose
   estimation. In this paper, we present a novel schema for performing
   cooperative localization using bearing only measurements. These
   measurements correspond to the angles of pairs of landmarks located on
   each robot, extracted from camera images. Thus, the only exteroceptive
   measurements used are the camera images taken by each robot, under the
   condition that both cameras are mutually visible. An analytical solution
   is derived, together with an analysis of uncertainty as a function to
   the relative pose of the robots. A theoretical comparison with a
   standard stereo camera pose reconstruction is also provided. Finally,
   the feasibility and performance of the proposed method were validated,
   through simulations and experiments with a mobile robot setup.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of a reconfigurable
   multiple-input multiple-output (RE-MIMO) system in spatially correlated
   frequency-selective fading channels. In particular, we propose to use a
   RE-MIMO system to overcome the inter symbol interference (ISI) problem
   caused by multipath propagation. In the proposed system, we use a
   3-dimensional coding scheme to obtain the same diversity order as in
   MIMO-OFDM systems over frequency-selective channels, and achieving
   better bit error rate performance by using directive reconfigurable
   antennas. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system, we
   compare the performance of the RE-MIMO with MIMO-OFDM system over
   frequency-selective channels. Simulation results show that the coded
   RE-MIMO system outperforms the coded MIMO-OFDM systems for small angular
   spread. However, for larger angular spread, the performance of the
   RE-MIMO system degrades due to much stronger contribution of undesired
   multipath components.}},

Abstract = {{For pragmatic information fusion system design and analysis, the user,

   conduct actionable intelligence. With the development of complex
   information fusion systems, the user still provides valuable inputs to
   the information fusion system in contextual reasoning and situation
   understanding. In this chapter, we describe the cognitive
   observe-orient-decide-act (C-OODA) model as a method of user and team
   analysis in the context of the Data Fusion Information Group (DFIG)
   information fusion model. From the DFIG model-as an update to the Joint

   refinement in the context of timely decision making. Using control
   theory, we present an example of a user timeliness assessment in an
   information fusion decision making model analysis. We model the
   information input delays in reaching a decision and the action output
   delays in executing the decision. The C-OODA comparisons to the DFIG
   model support systems evaluation and analysis as well as coordinating
   the time interval of interaction between the machine processing (e.g.,

Abstract = {{The design of a distributed Command and Control (C2) system, which
   provides high-level information fusion (HLIF) enabled decision support,
   requires the consideration of multiple interrelated factors and
   constraints which do not lend themselves to simple analyses. Such
   systems are very complex, with challenges concerning numerous aspects of
   the system, including legal, jurisdictional, information sharing and
   exchange, information availability and quality, user roles and
   hierarchy, and application of both hardware and software technologies.
   There are numerous stake holders and no one has an understanding of or
   access to the entire knowledge in order to be able to resolve any of
   these challenges by themselves. There are too many unknowns for a
   traditional top-down design methodology to be feasible to use. Because
   scenarios are task-based and descriptive, it was judged that the
   scenario-based design (SBD) approach needs to be explored for HLIF
   enabled systems where the human is part of the system. By being
   descriptive, the scenarios preserve the human-support requirements.
   Therefore, this chapter proposes an SBD methodology for the design of an
   HLIF enabled decision support. The SBD methodology is illustrated on two
   stressful scenarios detailed in Chapter 12.}},

Abstract = {{Current advances in technology, sensor collection, data storage, and
   data distribution have afforded more complex, distributed, and
   operational information fusion systems (IFSs). IFSs notionally consist
   of low-level information fusion (data collection, registration, and
   association in time and space) and high-level information fusion (user
   coordination, situational awareness, and mission control). Low-level
   IFSs typically rely on standard metrics for evaluation such as
   timeliness, accuracy, and confidence. Given the broader use of IFSs, it
   is also important to look at high-level fusion processes and determine a
   set of metrics to test IFSs, such as workload, throughput, and cost.
   Three types of measures (measures of performance (MOP), measures of
   effectiveness (MOE), and measures of merit (MOM)) are summarized. In
   this chapter, we seek to describe MOEs for high-level information fusion
   (HLIF) based on developments in quality of service (QOS) and information
   quality, or quality of information (QOI), that support the user and the
   machine, respectively. We define a HLIF MOE based on (1) information
   quality, (2) robustness, and (3) information gain. We demonstrate the
   HLIF MOE for a maritime domain situation awareness example.}},

   optical bench, and thermal design for 1 mK thermal stability. The
   thermal budget was calculated using lumped-mass model thermal analysis,

   high throughput, versatile instrument that will enable precision
   spectroscopy for decades to come. The extended wavelength coverage for
   these relatively high spectral resolutions is achieved by use of an
   Echelle grating with VPH cross-dispersers and for the R = 90,000 mode
   utilization of an image slicer. The design incorporates a fast,
   efficient, reliable system for acquiring targets over the7 arcmin field

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is vital for plant growth. However, most added soluble P
   forms insoluble phosphates. Therefore, inorganic P (Pi) accumulates in
   soils. Soil organic P (Po) is another important reserve (20 to 80\% of
   total soil P). To be available for plant Po must first be mineralized by
   soil microorganisms. The variability of the results of inoculation
   trials with P solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) clearly reflects the
   complexity of the interactions occurring in the
   soil-plant-microbes-fauna ecosystem. Important points overlooked in
   previous studies will be presented and perspectives of the use of PSMs
   to allow the plant to benefit from soil reserves in Pi and Po will be
   discussed. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection

Abstract = {{SpIOMM (Spectrometre-Imageur de l'Observatoire du Mont Megantic) is
   still the only operational astronomical Imaging Fourier Transform
   Spectrometer (IFTS) capable of obtaining the visible spectrum of every
   source of light in a field of view of 12 arc-minutes. Even if it has
   been designed to work with both outputs of the Michelson interferometer,
   up to now only one output has been used. Here we present ORBS (Outils de
   Reduction Binoculaire pour SpIOMM/SITELLE), the reduction software we
   designed in order to take advantage of the two output data. ORBS will
   also be used to reduce the data of SITELLE (Spectrometre-Imageur pour
   l'Etude en Long et en Large des raies d'Emissions) - the direct
   successor of SpIOMM, which will be in operation at the
   Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) in early 2013. SITELLE will
   deliver larger data cubes than SpIOMM (up to 2 cubes of 34 Go each). We
   thus have made a strong effort in optimizing its performance efficiency
   in terms of speed and memory usage in order to ensure the best
   compliance with the quality characteristics discussed with the CFHT
   team. As a result ORBS is now capable of reducing 68 Go of data in less
   than 20 hours using only 5 Go of random-access memory (RAM).}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is the control of hydrodynamic variables of a pilot
   flotation column working with a three-phase system (air-water-ore) in an
   industrial environment. Since hydrodynamic variables are closely related
   to metallurgical and economical performances of the unit, the
   implementation of such a control strategy is crucial to optimize its
   operation. The hydrodynamic variables here considered are the gas
   hold-up in the collection zone and the fraction of wash-water underneath
   the interface. They are controlled by manipulating gas flow rate and
   wash-water flow rate respectively. Hydrodynamic variables are controlled
   through a constrained model predictive control (MPC) strategy. This
   choice is dictated by the interdependency of these controlled variables
   and the capability of predictive controllers to handle process
   constraints. Identification tests lead to a representative model of the
   system under nominal operating conditions but indicate variations of
   process behavior with changing operating regimes. Results show good
   control performances, confirming the potential use of MPC to control
   hydrodynamic variables for real-time optimization of full-scale
   flotation columns.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen hydrogels are widely used as three-dimensional scaffolds for
   cells and tissue in culture environments. These materials, which consist
   of crosslinked biopolymer (protein-based) networks in aqueous media, are
   particularly suitable for recreating part of the extra-cellular matrix,
   but their poor mechanical properties represent a major limitation. One
   strategy to enhance the strength of this kind of hydrogels might be to
   incorporate clay nanoscopic particles. In fact, it has been observed
   that the charged surface of clay nanosheets can interact with certain
   functional groups belonging to polymer molecules, yielding stronger
   networks. Moreover, clay particles are recognized to be biocompatible.
   In the present work, the gelation process and the resulting
   morphological and mechanical properties of collagen/laponite clay
   nanocomposite hydrogels were invastigated. Upon gelation, the biopolymer
   molecules assemble into nanoscale fibrils, which bundle into fibers and
   entangle into a three-dimensional network. The network characteristics
   depend on tunable parameters such as pH and clay concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Small caliber vascular replacement (<4 mm) still remains a challenge for
   medical and research teams, as no available vascular substitutes (VS)
   are suitable for small diameter bypass. Vascular engineering proposes
   new models of small diameter VS but rare are those that meet the
   biocompatibility and mechanical criteria. In this study, we developed a
   new scaffold made by the combination of two natural biomacromolecules:
   collagen and silk fibroin. The scaffold was further cellularised with
   porcine smooth muscle cells. First, the behavior of cells in the
   collagen-fibroin constructs was verified in order to evaluate the
   biocompatibility of the scaffold with the cells. Then, gel mass loss and
   cellular attachment, morphology, spreading and viability were analysed.
   The results showed an excellent interaction and biocompatibility between
   collagen, silk fibroin fibers and cells. Thus, the collagen-fibroin
   construct appears to be a very attractive material for vascular tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, porous TiB2 ceramics were consolidated by pressureless
   sintering method using metallic Ti and Fe as additives in order to
   perform sintering at temperatures lower than 1700 degrees C. It was
   shown that processing parameters including milling time of the starting
   mixture had a considerable effect on final properties of sintered
   specimens and their behavior in molten aluminum. Microstructural studies
   were carried out using optical microscope, SEM and EPMA. It was found
   that specimens with uniform and crack-free microstructure could be
   produced using the pre-mixed powders milled for as low as 30 min prior
   to compaction and sintering. Sessile drop test was performed on the
   specimens milled for 30 and 240 minutes. Their interaction with molten
   aluminum was also studied. It was found that 30 min milling time
   resulted in better electrical conductivity, wettability and stability in
   liquid aluminum.}},

Abstract = {{Functionally graded materials (FGM) are characterized by a gradual
   change in the volume fractions of two or more components as a function
   of position along certain dimensions. FGM has been introduced as an
   alternative to laminated composites where a mismatch in properties
   across each layer interface is the origin of stress concentration and a
   source of delamination/failure. In addition, the use of natural wood
   fibres as reinforcement has the advantage of easy manufacturing, low
   cost, biodegradability, negligible health hazards and high specific
   properties. Using short fibres in a controlled manner to produce
   functionally graded composites can provide more balanced properties and
   lead to improved stiffness/strength properties across thickness.
   The aim of this paper is to evaluate the mechanical behavior of
   functionally graded natural fibre composites. To study the effect of
   composite property variation, the functionally graded composite is
   divided into a number of homogeneous layers in order to evaluate the
   mechanical behavior. In particular, the effect wood fibre content
   variation across thickness on the tensile properties of the composites
   is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The automotive industry applies pressure on the PM industry to produce
   components with superior mechanical properties at minimum cost. In this
   regard, sinter-hardenable powders are particularly well suited since
   they allow direct quenching of components at the end of the sintering
   cycle, thus eliminating the extra steps required for heat treating. This
   paper presents the results of the modeling of the influence of admixing
   and/or prealloying on the optimization of compressibility and
   hardenability of sinter-hardenable steel powders. A first design of
   experiments (DOE) was used to optimize the chemical composition and to
   study the interactions between prealloyed elements (Nickel, Chromium,
   Molybdenum and Manganese) and admixed elements (Nickel, Chromium,
   Manganese and Copper) on hardenability and compressibility. A second DOE
   was generated based on the results obtained in the first series. Results
   show that among all of the examined alloying elements, only prealloyed
   nickel, chromium and molybdenum had a significant effect on
   compressibility and hardenability. Moreover, within the range of
   concentrations under study, the optimum sinter-hardenable powder had the
   following (prealloyed) chemistry: 1.5 wt-\% Ni, 0.55 wt-\% Cr and 1.25
   wt-\% Mo.}},

Abstract = {{On-line quality assessment becomes one of the most critical requirements
   for improving the efficiency of automatic resistance spot welding (RSW)
   processes. Accurate and efficient model to perform non-destructive
   quality estimation is an essential part of the assessment. Besides the
   usual welding parameters, various measured variables have been
   considered for quality estimation in RSW. Among these variables, dynamic
   resistance (DR) gives a relative clear picture of the welding nugget
   formation and presents a significant correlation with the RSW quality
   indicators (QI). This paper presents a structured approach developed to
   design an effective DR-based model for on-line quality assessment in
   RSW. The proposed approach examines welding parameters and conditions
   known to have an influence on weld quality, and builds a quality
   assessment model step by step. The modeling procedure begins by
   examining, through a structured experimental design, the relationships
   between welding parameters, typical characteristics of the RD curves and
   multiple welding QI. Using these results and various statistical tools,
   different integrated quality assessment models combining an assortment
   of DR attributes are developed and evaluated. The results demonstrate
   that the proposed approach can lead to a general model able to
   accurately and reliably provide an appropriate assessment of the weld
   quality under variable welding conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A benchmark simulation model, which includes a wastewater treatment
   plant (WWTP)-wide model and a rising main sewer model, is proposed for
   testing mitigation strategies to reduce the system's greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. The sewer model was run to predict methane emissions,
   and its output was used as the WWTP model input. An activated sludge
   model for GHG (ASMG) was used to describe nitrous oxide (N2O) generation
   and release in activated sludge process. N2O production through both
   heterotrophic and autotrophic pathways was included. Other GHG emissions
   were estimated using empirical relationships. Different scenarios were
   evaluated comparing GHG emissions, effluent quality and energy
   consumption. Aeration control played a clear role in N2O emissions,
   through concentrations and distributions of dissolved oxygen (DO) along
   the length of the bioreactor. The average value of N2O emission under
   dynamic influent cannot be simulated by a steady-state model subjected
   to a similar influent quality, stressing the importance of dynamic
   simulation and control. As the GHG models have yet to be validated,
   these results carry a degree of uncertainty; however, they fulfilled the
   objective of this study, i.e. to demonstrate the potential of a dynamic
   system-wide modelling and benchmarking approach for balancing water
   quality, operational costs and GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Two evaluation formulas are derived for the Jack superpolynomials. The
   evaluation formulas are expressed in terms of products of fillings of
   skew diagrams. One of these formulas is nothing but the evaluation
   formula of the Jack polynomials with prescribed symmetry, which thereby
   inherits here a very simple formulation. Among the auxiliary results
   required to establish the evaluation formulas, the determination of the
   conditions ensuring the nonvanishing coefficients in a Pieri-type rule
   for Jack superpolynomials is worth pointing out. An important
   application of the evaluation formulas is a new derivation of the
   combinatorial norm of the Jack superpolynomials. We finally mention that
   the introduction of a simpler version of the dominance ordering on
   superpartitions is fundamental to establishing our results.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that two primary disadvantages of parallel manipulators are
   the complicated forward kinematics and limited workspace. This paper
   mainly addressed the kinematics and workspace analyses of a 3/3-RRRS
   6-DOF parallel manipulator. After a brief introduction of the 3/3 -RRRS
   6-DOF parallel manipulator, a three-dimensional model and its relevant
   structure diagram are constituted, the forward and inverse displacement
   analyses of the 3/3-RRRS parallel manipulator are discussed in detail,
   especially, a novel geometrical method referred as equivalent mechanism
   is proposed for the forward displacement analysis of the manipulator
   under consideration. Based on the displacement analyses of the
   manipulator, a discretization method is proposed for the computation of
   the reachable position/orientation workspace of the 3/3-RRRS parallel
   manipulator, respectively. Examples of a 3/3-RRRS parallel manipulator
   are given to demonstrate these theoretical results.}},

   that the performance of the MUSIC algorithm degrades as the angular
   spread increases. Furthermore, an experimental study is performed in an

   single reconfigurable antenna element known as Composite Right/Left
   Handed (CRLH) Leaky-Wave (LW) antenna that offers a high level of
   directivity with electronically controllable radiation patterns.
   Experimental results show that the DoA estimation technique succeeded in

Abstract = {{A previous study showed how a monitor can be inlined into a potentially
   untrusted program, producing an instrumented version of this program
   which provably respects the desired security policy. That study extended
   previous approaches to the same problem in that it allowed non-safety
   properties to be monitored, and did not incur any runtime overhead.
   However, the algorithm itself runs in time O(2(m.n)), where n is the
   size of the original program and m that of the property being monitored,
   and the resulting instrumented program is increased in the order of O(m
   . n). These algorithmic factors limit the usefulness of the approach in
   practice. In this paper, we suggest several optimizations which reduce
   the algorithm's run time and the size of the resulting instrumented
   code. Using these optimizations, the monitor inlining can run in time
   O(v + e) where v and e are respectively the size and number of
   transitions present in the synchronous product of the original program
   and the property. Furthermore, we show how the size of the instrumented
   program can be minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of nanocrystalline hexaaluminate is reported using an original
   activated reactive synthesis process. Starting from a classical ceramic
   solid, exhibiting low surface area and a micrometric crystal size, a
   two-step grinding process allows reduction of the crystal size down to a
   few nanometers and development of high surface areas. The synthetic
   process was then used to produce transition metal- and noble metal-doped
   structures. The effects of (i) morphological and structural properties
   and (ii) substitution on oxygen transfer properties and catalytic
   properties in CO and CH4 oxidation reactions were studied. Crystal size
   was shown to be a key parameter in controlling the bulk oxygen transfer.
   Study of the catalytic properties in low and high temperature oxidation
   reactions also shows the crucial effect of the morphological parameters.
   Highest activities were achieved over nanocrystalline high surface
   compositions. Finally, even if less active than classical palladium
   supported solids, these new structures exhibited extremely high thermal
   stability.}},

   constraints on the cable tensions. Parametric Cartesian trajectories are
   then defined and substituted into the constraints in order to obtain
   global conditions on the trajectory parameters which ensure that the
   trajectories are feasible. Special frequencies arise from the equations
   that are akin to natural frequencies of pendulum-type systems. An

   trajectories that go beyond the static workspace of the mechanism,

Abstract = {{Particle filter is one of the most widely applied stochastic sampling
   tools for state estimation problems in practice. However, the proposal
   distribution in the traditional particle filter is the transition
   probability based on state equation, which would heavily affect
   estimation performance in that the samples are blindly drawn without
   considering the current observation information. Additionally, the fixed
   particle number in the typical particle filter would lead to wasteful
   computation, especially when the posterior distribution greatly varies
   over time. In this paper, an advanced adaptive nonparametric particle
   filter is proposed by incorporating gaussian process based proposal
   distribution into KLD-Sampling particle filter framework so that the
   high-qualified particles with adaptively KLD based quantity are drawn
   from the learned proposal with observation information at each time step
   to improve the approximation accuracy and efficiency. Our state
   estimation experiments on univariate nonstationary growth model and
   two-link robot arm show that the adaptive nonparametric particle filter
   outperforms the existing approaches with smaller size of particles.}},

Abstract = {{An iterative design method for Orthogonal Frequency Division
   Multiplexing (OFDM) system parameter estimation and synchronization
   under a blind scenario for cognitive radio systems is proposed in this
   paper. A novel envelope spectrum-based arbitrary oversampling ratio
   estimator is presented first, based on which the algorithms are then
   developed to provide the identification of other OFDM parameters (number
   of subcarriers, cyclic prefix (CP) length). Carrier frequency offset
   (CFO) and timing offset are estimated for the purpose of synchronization
   with the help of the identified parameters. An iterative scheme is
   employed to increase the estimation accuracy. To validate the proposed
   design, the performance is evaluated under an experimental propagation
   environment and the results show that the proposed design is capable of
   adapting blind parameter estimation and synchronization for cognitive
   radio with improved performances.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{1-24}},
Abstract = {{Two-point correlations and quadrant two-point correlations (termed and
   introduced by authors) have been employed in order to study low- and
   high-speed large-scale structures in the outer region of a turbulent
   boundary layer subjected to a strong adverse pressure gradient. They are
   computed with particle image velocimetry (PIV) data comprising of large
   sets of streamwise-spanwise instantaneous velocity fields at three
   wall-normal positions (0.2 delta, 0.5 delta, 0.8 delta; delta is the
   boundary layer thickness) at three different streamwise locations in the
   adverse-pressure-gradient zone, from downstream of the strong suction
   peak up to detachment. Two-point correlations of the streamwise velocity
   fluctuation confirm the existence of alternating zones of high- and
   low-speed fluid in the middle (0.5 delta) and lower (0.2 delta) parts of
   the outer region similar to those observed in the log and wake regions
   of zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers. However, the
   negative-positive-negative pattern of these two-point correlations
   disappears in the lower part (0.2 delta) of the large-velocity-defect
   zone, i.e. near detachment. In the latter region, the results support
   the existence of large-scale u-structures, many of which are streamwise
   elongated, that meander more or are less streamwise aligned than the
   u-structures elsewhere. The ratio of streamwise to spanwise length
   scales associated with the two-point correlations reveals that
   u-structures in the zero-pressure-gradient cases are more elongated in
   the streamwise direction than those in the adverse-pressure-gradient
   cases, especially in the lower part of the boundary layer. The quadrant
   two-point analysis allows us to discriminate events with respect to the
   sign of the streamwise velocity fluctuation at the reference and second
   points in the two-point correlation function. By using this technique,
   it is found that in the lower part of the outer region, i.e. 0.2 delta
   (in the upper part of boundary layer, i.e. 0.8 delta), large-scale
   high-speed events (low-speed events) are more intense than low-speed
   (high-speed) ones and also contribute more to the two-point
   correlations. In the middle of the boundary layer where the maximum
   turbulence activity occurs, large-scale low- and high-speed motions have
   comparable intensities and frequencies of occurrence. However, the
   low-speed events are slightly more intense and seem to be spatially more
   coherent.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING RECLAMATION AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{185-198}},
Abstract = {{Underground mining in cold regions of the world requires the heating of
   fresh air intake. On the other hand, exhaust air is usually discharged
   to the atmosphere at much greater temperatures than the ambient air.
   Using a medium such as water or glycol, heat can be extracted from the
   exhaust air and transferred to a desired location for use. In some
   mines, heat recovery could contribute to large energy savings especially
   with the increasing price of fossil fuels and electricity. This paper
   describes a computer software application developed in order to evaluate
   the feasibility of recovering heat from exhaust mine air. The software
   uses input data for a given mine site to obtain the cost benefits of
   installing an exhaust heat recovery system to heat the mine intake air
   during cold periods. There are two main components within the software;
   energy analysis of the system and capital cost estimation of the
   project. Assumptions and calculations performed within the software are
   briefly discussed. Several results of fictitious mine sites are
   presented.}},

   analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{963-980}},
Abstract = {{Agent-based systems have been employed in the Supply Chain Management
   field since the 1990s. In spite of its appealing and extensive use in
   both research and practice, the agent technology and its integration
   with advanced supply chain planning and scheduling tools still represent
   an emergent field with many open research questions. Particularly, the
   literature fails to provide an integrated framework to identify, model
   and conduct simulation experiments covering the whole simulation cycle.
   Indeed, the initial modelling effort performed at the analysis phase is
   especially neglected by the literature concerned. This early phase is
   critical because it considerably influences the whole development
   process as well as the resulting simulation experiments. Thus, this
   article presents a novel methodological framework called FAMASS (FORAC
   Architecture for Modelling Agent-based Simulation for Supply chain
   planning), which provides: (i) a uniform representation of distributed
   advanced supply chain planning and scheduling systems using agent
   technology; and (ii) a methodological approach supporting analysts in
   defining functional requirements of possible simulation experiments. The
   proposed methodological framework was tested through a real-scale
   proof-of-concept case employing data from two industrial partners.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{156-176}},
Abstract = {{A field-scale three-dimensional numerical flow and transport model was
   applied to simulate the fate and transport of benzene, toluene,
   ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) from six source zones of light
   non-aqueous-phase liquids (LNAPLs). A number of scenarios were defined
   to evaluate the effect of natural attenuation and enhanced remediation
   methods on the fate of BTEX. Two strategies were defined for cleaning up
   the site: (1) reduction of BTEX over the entire site down to the maximum
   concentration limit (MCL), and (2) remediation of the site to a level
   that reduces BTEX below MCLs only at the nearest discharge wells. The
   results show that under natural attenuation alone, the remediation time
   for benzene (time needed to decrease concentrations to a specified
   level) is more than 60 years, whereas that of TEX is longer, but only
   benzene will reach the receptors. LNAPL removal and enhanced
   bioremediation techniques could decrease this time to about 30 years for
   benzene. A cost-effective two-stage enhanced remediation operation
   should be applied. In the first stage, the entire dissolved BTEX plume
   should be treated, whereas in the second stage, after the remediation of
   benzene, the operation area should be limited to the remaining TEX plume
   areas. In the second strategy, air injection will be sufficient to
   prevent the BTEX plume from reaching the receptors. Addition of oxygen
   and hydrogen peroxide is likely too expensive.}},

Abstract = {{Techniques based on non-linear acoustics have been proven sensitive to
   micro-defects in heterogeneous materials such as concrete but their
   implementation on-site is very restrictive. Time-shift, a technique
   where a high frequency ultrasonic wave probes the medium while a low
   frequency elastic wave disturbs it to create a ``time delay{''}, is one
   of the few techniques applicable on-site. Because of the large
   dimensions and the geometry of the structures in service, the
   transducers often have to be set on the same side. The scope of this
   project is to study two types of configurations which are the indirect
   transmission where transducers are at a 90 degrees angle with the
   surface of the structure and the semi-direct transmission where they are
   at a 45 degrees angle. Up to now, test results show that time-shift is
   more sensitive when used in an indirect configuration of transmission
   rather than in a semi-direct configuration. Overall, the non-linear
   time-shift technique is much more sensitive to the initiation of
   cracking than the linear UPV technique.}},

Abstract = {{Resilient modulus of granular materials is significantly influenced by
   the degree of saturation. As in northern climates pavement materials may
   reach saturation and as their water content may significantly vary
   through the yearly cycle, this water sensitivity of the unbound layers
   becomes a major factor to quantify. Yet, few models are available to
   quantify the water sensitivity of resilient modulus of typical Canadian
   unbound granular materials used in pavement bases. Therefore, the
   objective of this study is to develop, through resilient modulus
   testing, a generalised model quantifying this water sensitivity. Six
   gradation curves for three aggregate sources were used to measure the
   resilient modulus variations with water content. Data from previous
   studies have also been used to develop the model. A generalised model is
   proposed, which introduces a new parameter describing the water
   sensitivity of resilient modulus, which was found to be a function of
   stress and granular assemblies' volumetric and frictional properties.}},

Abstract = {{The polarization state of light provides valuable information about
   scenes that cannot be obtained directly from intensity or spectral
   images. Polarized light reflected from scenes has been found to be
   useful and can reveal contrasts that do not appear in classical
   intensity images and find many applications in remote sensing,
   biomedical imaging, or industrial control. Cost, size, and technological
   complexity of polarimetric imagers depend on the number of polarimetric
   parameters they measure. In this context, a key issue is to evaluate the
   added value of each measured polarimetric parameter in order to optimize
   the compromise between complexity and efficiency of these systems. In
   target detection applications, the relevant criterion for quantifying
   the performance of an imaging configuration is contrast (or
   discrimination ability). Analysis of the contrast and its optimization
   in polarimetric images have been investigated in the radar and optics
   communities. We investigate in the paper how the polarisation imaging
   can be applied in automotive vision based sensor. This study present
   various type of polarisation sensitive optical system. Detection of
   small and low-contrast objects has been found to be improved with the
   help of this kind of optical system.}},

Abstract = {{Making a lens design working in automotive environment is a real
   challenge. Both optical and mechanical designer must work together to
   prevent problems during operation. The increasing trend to use vision

   demand, many new material and design techniques have been developed
   increasing the lens designer toolbox. This paper reviews the design
   constraints of the automotive and aerospace environment and how modern
   material, tools and approaches can be used to fulfill it. We discussed a

Abstract = {{Multi-state systems (MSS) are systems whose stochastic degradation
   process is characterised by several performance levels varying from
   nominal functioning to complete failure. MSS arise naturally in many
   application areas. MSS reliability evaluation and estimation has
   received much attention from researchers and a wide range of papers
   dealing with MSS have been published. In this paper, an approach based
   on Kronecker algebra combined with stochastic processes is proposed to
   evaluate the reliability of a series-parallel MSS. The main advantage of
   the proposed approach is that the mathematical expressions of the MSS
   reliability indices are derived from data of individual elementary
   components without generating the whole, possibly huge, MSS state space.
   Furthermore, the approach is well formalised and easy to implement
   thanks to Kronecker algebra operators. Examples are given to illustrate
   the proposed approach.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{13, SI}},
Pages = {{3643-3660}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) to the
   integrated production and maintenance planning problem in multi-state
   systems. VNS is one of the most recent meta-heuristics used for problem
   solving in which a systematic change of neighbourhood within a local
   search is carried out. In the studied problem, production and
   maintenance decisions are co-ordinated, so that the total expected cost
   is minimised. We are given a set of products that must be produced in
   lots on a multi-state production system during a specified finite
   planning horizon. Planned preventive maintenance and unplanned
   corrective maintenance can be performed on each component of the
   multi-state system. The maintenance policy suggests cyclical preventive
   replacements of components, and a minimal repair on failed components.
   The objective is to determine an integrated lot-sizing and preventive
   maintenance strategy of the system that will minimise the sum of
   preventive and corrective maintenance costs, setup costs, holding costs,
   backorder costs and production costs, while satisfying the demand for
   all products over the entire horizon. We model the production system as
   a multi-state system with binary-state components. The formulated
   problem can be solved by comparing the results of several multi-product
   capacitated lot-sizing problems. The proposed VNS deals with the
   preventive maintenance selection task. Results on test instances show
   that the VNS method provides a competitive solution quality at
   economically computational expense in comparison with genetic
   algorithms.}},

Journal = {{NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{539-543}},
Abstract = {{Minnow traps are widely used in aquatic ecology for the quantitative
   sampling of small-bodied fish. We used paired sampling stations to
   compare the catch efficiency of minnow traps constructed of galvanized
   steel with that of traps constructed of steel mesh covered with a black
   vinyl coating in field and laboratory conditions. Except for northern
   redbelly dace Phoxinus eos in field sampling, the catch efficiency of
   the galvanized minnow traps was higher than that of the black traps.
   Catches of pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, creek chub Semotilus
   atromaculatus, and white sucker Catostomus commersonii were up to five
   times higher in the galvanized minnow traps than in the black ones. For
   the quantitative estimation of small-bodied fish, we recommend using
   only galvanized minnow traps to maximize catch efficiency. If data are
   intended for quantitative analyses, mixing minnow trap models in a field
   survey could lead to inappropriate catch comparisons.}},

Title = {{Half-lattice Paths and Virasoro Characters}},
Journal = {{FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{57-83}},
Abstract = {{We first briefly review the role of lattice paths in the derivation of
   fermionic expressions for the M(p, p') minimal model characters of the
   Virasoro Lie algebra. We then focus on the recently introduced
   half-lattice paths for the M(p, 2p +/- 1) characters, reformulating them
   in such a way that the two cases may be treated uniformly. That the
   generating functions of these half-lattice paths are indeed M(p, 2p +/-
   1) characters is proved by describing weight preserving bijections
   between them and the corresponding RSOS lattice paths. Here, theM (p, 2p
   - 1) case is derived for the first time. We then apply the methods of
   Bressoud and Warnaar to these half-lattice paths to derive fermionic
   expressions for the Virasoro characters x(1,2)(p,2p +/- 1) that differ
   from those obtained from the RSOS paths.

Abstract = {{In this work, recycled polypropylene (PP) and regenerated styrene
   butadiene rubber (SBR) from used tyres rubber crumbs were combined to
   produce polymeric blends. The compounds were prepared via twin-screw
   extrusion to measure their mechanical behaviour for different SBR
   compositions (0 to 40\%). Also, the addition of birch flour (0 to 40\%)
   and coupling agent (0 to 5 phr) content were studied. The results showed
   that tensile strength and modulus of the blends were substantially
   improved after incorporation of wood flour. The torsion modulus also
   increased with birch content. However, the tensile strain at break of
   PP/birch wood composites decreased with both wood and coupling agent
   contents, showing a decrease in ductility of the composites. Adding the
   elastomer phase did not improve the properties. The results showed that
   adding a coupling agent was found to be effective in improving the wood
   flour-PP interface, while less improvement was observed for the
   rubber-PP surface adhesion. The tensile strength of PP/birch composites
   improved by more than 60\%, while the torsion and tensile moduli of the
   composites improved by only 10\% in some cases.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the low-temperature degradation (LTD) behavior of
   undoped and copper oxide (CuO) doped yttria-tetragonal zirconia
   polycrystals ceramics sintered at 1300 degrees C was investigated. The
   zirconia samples were tested in three different media i.e. superheated
   steam at 180 degrees C/10 bar refluxing conditions in 20\% hydrochloric
   solution at 110 degrees C and in hot air at 180 degrees C to determine
   the effect of hydroxyl content in triggering the tetragonal to
   monoclinic phase transformation. The study found that the additions of
   CuO significantly reduced the rate of LTD phase transformation in all
   media tested. The undoped zirconia exhibited severe LTD when exposed to
   media containing 100\% hydroxyl content. Although the CuO-doped samples
   were generally found to have better LTD characteristics, cross-sections
   of aged specimens (after 200 hours of exposure in superheated steam)
   revealed that very thin measurable monoclinic layers were developed. The
   presence of hydroxyl in the test media was found to have played a
   significant role in controlling the LTD of zirconia ceramics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the temporal transposability of hydrological
   models under contrasted climate conditions and evaluates the added value
   of using an ensemble of model structures for flow simulation. This is
   achieved by applying the Differential Split Sample Test procedure to
   twenty lumped conceptual models on a catchment in the Province of Qu,bec
   (Canada) and another one in the State of Bavaria (Germany). First, a
   calibration/validation procedure was applied on four historical
   non-continuous periods with contrasted climate conditions. Then, model
   efficiency was quantified individually (for each model) and collectively
   (for the model ensemble). The individual analysis evaluated model
   performance and robustness. The ensemble investigation, based on the
   average of simulated discharges, focused on the twenty-member ensemble
   and all possible model subsets. Results showed that using a single model
   may provide hazardous results when the model is to be applied in
   contrasted conditions. Overall, some models turned out as a good
   compromise in terms of performance and robustness, but generally not as
   much as the twenty-model ensemble. Model subsets offered yet improved
   performance over the twenty-model ensemble, but at the expanse of
   spatial transposability (i.e. need of site-specific analysis).}},

Abstract = {{We introduce two Lagrange multiplier algorithms which are hybrid types
   for solving equilibrium problems in reflexive Banach spaces whose
   feasible sets are cone constrained. At each iteration of these
   algorithms, first an approximate solution of an unconstrained
   equilibrium problem is found. Then, using information obtained from this
   approximate solution, the next iterate of our algorithms is computed by
   performing either an extragradient-type step with respect to the metric
   induced by a Bregrarn distance or a Bregrnan projection of the current
   iterate onto a certain hyperplane separating the current iterate from
   the solution set of the problem. One of the important features of our
   schemes is that they allow significant relaxation of tolerance
   requirements imposed on the solution of unconstrained subproblems. Under
   appropriate hypotheses on the problem data, we show that the generated
   sequence by each algorithm weakly and globally converges to a solution
   of the problem.}},

Title = {{Physico-chemical role of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots in the
   photo-polymerization process of acrylate composite materials}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{8208-8216}},
Abstract = {{The work presented in this paper is devoted to the physico-chemical role
   of quantum dots (QDs) in the photopolymerization of composite materials.
   We show first that the photoexcitation of CdSe/ZnS semiconductor quantum
   dots can initiate the polymerization of an acrylate monomer in
   association with a tertiary amine and in the absence of a
   photoinitiator. But by using a holographic technique, among the others,
   the gratings recorded in such composite materials are not stable and
   relax once the light interference pattern is switched off. This
   behaviour is attributed to a very low degree of conversion of monomers,
   which does not prevent the post-exposure diffusion of monomers and
   nanoparticles. The comparison with gratings obtained in the presence of
   a photosensitizer dye (higher hologram quality and stability) highlights
   the key importance of using such dye in the polymerization process. The
   gratings recorded in the complete syrup, containing the dye and QDs
   which differ by their size and UV-visible absorption spectra, exhibit an
   additional refractive index modulation. The latter results from the
   spatial distribution of QDs and the change in the kinetics of
   polymerization. We further focus on understanding the fall of the
   polymerization rate owing to the presence of QDs. This decrease may
   result from the trapping of the tertiary amine (co-initiator) at the
   surface of those QDs, which reduces the rate of decay of the dye and,
   consequently, the polymerization rate. Under such conditions, the
   diffusion of QDs and monomers is favoured and their spatial
   redistribution is enhanced. These features contribute to modify the
   physical properties of the gratings.}},

   treatment systems}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1624-1631}},
Abstract = {{Life cycle assessment (LCA) allows evaluating the potential
   environmental impacts of a product or a service in relation to its
   function and over its life cycle. In past LCAs applied to wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTPs), the system function definition has received
   little attention despite its great importance. This has led to some
   limitations in LCA results interpretation. A new methodology to perform
   LCA on WWTPs is proposed to avoid those limitations. It is based on net
   environmental benefit (NEB) evaluation and requires assessing the
   potential impact of releasing wastewater without and with treatment
   besides assessing the impact of the WWTP's life cycle. The NEB allows
   showing the environmental trade-offs between avoided impact due to
   wastewater treatment and induced impact by the WWTP's life cycle. NEB is
   compared with a standard LCA through the case study of a small municipal
   WWTP consisting of facultative aerated lagoons. The NEB and standard LCA
   show similar results for impact categories solely related to the WWTP's
   life cycle but differ in categories where wastewater treatment
   environmental benefit is accounted for as NEB considers influent
   wastewater quality whereas standard LCA does not.}},

Title = {{Graph-Theoretic Approach for the Dynamic Simulation of Flexible
   Multibody Systems}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides a general description of a variational
   graph-theoretic formulation for simulation of flexible multibody systems
   (FMSs) which includes a brief review of linear graph principles required
   to formulate this algorithm. The system is represented by a linear
   graph, in which nodes represent reference frames on flexible bodies, and
   edges represent components that connect these frames. The method is
   based on a simplistic topological approach which casts the dynamic
   equations of motion into a symmetrical format. To generate the equations
   of motion with elastic deformations, the flexible bodies are discretized
   using two types of finite elements. The first is a 2 node 3D beam
   element based on Mindlin kinematics with quadratic rotation. This
   element is used to discretize unidirectional bodies such as links of
   flexible systems. The second consists of a triangular thin shell element
   based on the discrete Kirchhoff criterion and can be used to discretize
   bidirectional bodies such as high-speed lightweight manipulators, large
   high precision deployable space structures, and
   micro/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMSs). Two flexible systems are
   analyzed to illustrate the performance of this new variational
   graph-theoretic formulation and its ability to generate directly a set
   of motion equations for FMS without additional user input.}},

Abstract = {{Compost teas are fermented watery extracts of composted materials that

   showed that NCT prepared from the five types of compost had the ability
   to greatly reduce mycelial growth of P. ultimum, R. solani, Fusarium
   oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici and Verticillium dahliae in vitro.
   Sterilization of the NCT caused complete or partial loss of their
   inhibitory effect on mycelial growth of the pathogens. Application of
   NCT decreased the percentage of necrotic seedlings in P.
   ultimum-inoculated tomato seeds from 42\% to 100\%, but did not reduce

Abstract = {{The Betsiamites 7,250 cal BP submarine landslide mobilized a volume of
   1.3 km(3) in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Eastern Canada. The failure was
   initiated in shallow water between 10 and 140 mbsl and most likely
   developed in a unit stratified clayey silt deposits following a very
   strong earthquake. Most of the failed mass appears dislocated and
   evacuated the failure source area. This paper concludes that gas
   hydrates dissociation could not have influenced slope stability on the
   shelves of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary in the Early Holocene and that
   despite the high sedimentation rates prior to the failure this condition
   did not act independently as a significant trigger for the Betsiamites
   failure.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple knickpoints have been observed in recent years on the lakefloor
   of Wabush Lake, Labrador, Canada. Two or more sequential high-resolution
   geophysical surveys have revealed that these knickpoints tend to migrate
   updip, i.e. upstream relative to the turbidity currents that overflow
   them. In order to understand the different processes accountable for the
   migration of these knickpoints, laboratory studies have been performed
   to reproduce the sedimentological setting and hydrodynamics of Wabush
   Lake. Knickpoints are topographic depressions, characterized by a steep
   slope and a flatter profile downslope and upslope. In the present case
   they are initiated by morphodynamic interaction between an erodible bed
   and an overriding turbidity current. A set of 22 experiments have been
   performed in a facility able to run continuous turbidity currents.
   Knickpoints created in laboratory are up to I cm deep and migrate
   upstream at variable speed. Experimentation results show that migration
   of the knickpoints is controlled by two factors: erosion by the
   turbidity current and a landsliding process in the knickpoint head
   scarp. Knickpoint migration has also been observed when no turbidity
   current was present. These results show that this phenomenon is governed
   by not only hydraulics, as previously described in the literature, but
   must also be studied from a geotechnical point of view.}},

Abstract = {{The first attempts to apply electrolyzed aqueous solutions for water
   disinfection were performed in Russia in the late XIX century. However,
   the rapid development in the technology of electrolytic water oxidation
   and application of electrolyzed aqueous solutions have commenced in the
   USSR only in 1960s. At present, this technology is being developed in
   numerous countries around the world. It is reflected in an increased
   number of the publications in peer-reviewed journals and other
   informational sources. Moreover, a number of companies were established
   to pursue commercialization of the technology. The possibility of use of
   electrolyzed aqueous solutions as power disinfectants of potable water
   and swimming pools, bactericidal agent for disinfection and
   sterilization of living tissues, materials, medical and food processing
   equipment, etc. have been demonstrated in various trials. Nevertheless,
   the broader application of the technology is hindered by a lack of
   profound theoretical and experimental studies of production of
   electroactivated aqueous solutions and the mechanisms of their activity.
   Particularly, the characteristics of mass transport inside the
   electrolyzer and their relation to the constructional features of the
   apparatus and functional properties of produced solutions are poorly
   understood. We described the transport phenomena inside the permanently
   flowing electrochemical reactor and investigated the current-voltage
   relationships to gain understanding of the nature of the electrode
   reactions.}},

Title = {{Improvement of Hardenability and Static Mechanical Properties of

Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{424-433}},
Abstract = {{Constant demand to optimize production of plastic components puts
   pressure on mold steels manufacturers to supply pre-hardened blocks with
   larger cross-sections. As the size of mold blocks increases, it becomes
   more difficult to maintain the same microstructure throughout their
   volume. Thus, the size of mold steel blocks is limited by the cooling
   rate reachable at their center. This situation has created the need for
   the development of new alloys with improved hardenability. Additions of
   vanadium up to 0.35 wt-\% have been made to P20 + 0.5Ni mold steel. The
   addition of vanadium significantly increased hardenability, allowing the
   production of pre-hardened blocks with a cross section 88\% larger than
   the same alloy without vanadium. Such additions of vanadium also
   increased the impact toughness by 120\%, raised the yield strength by
   17\% and improved hardness after tempering by 24\%. The effect of boron
   on the hardenability of the P20 + 0.5Ni steel was also investigated. It
   resulted in a significant increase in hardenability and, in theory,
   could permit the production of pre-hardened blocks with a cross-section
   400\% larger than the original material. Finally, our results show that
   0.35 wt-\% of Ni can be substituted by 0.15 wt-\% of vanadium in a P20 +
   0.5Ni steel and still maintain the same hardenability.}},

Abstract = {{This work suggests a procedure to correctly calibrate the parameters of
   a one-dimensional MBBR dynamic model in nitrification treatment. The
   study deals with the MBBR configuration with two reactors in series, one
   for carbon treatment and the other for nitrogen treatment. Because of
   the influence of the first reactor on the second one, the approach needs
   a specific calibration strategy. Firstly, a comparison between measured
   values and simulated ones obtained with default parameters has been
   carried out. Simulated values of filtered COD, NH4-N and dissolved
   oxygen are underestimated and nitrates are overestimated compared with
   observed data. Thus, nitrifying rate and oxygen transfer into the
   biofilm are overvalued. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis was carried out
   for parameters and for COD fractionation. It revealed three classes of
   sensitive parameters: physical, diffusional and kinetic. Then a
   calibration protocol of the MBBR dynamic model was proposed. It was
   successfully tested on data recorded at a pilot-scale plant and a
   calibrated set of values was obtained for four parameters: the maximum
   biofilm thickness, the detachment rate, the maximum autotrophic growth
   rate and the oxygen transfer rate.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing gas-solid carbonation of serpentines could prefigure the
   emergence of new dry processes that may compete with aqueous
   carbonation. The hypothesis of pre-combustion CO2 capture to decarbonize
   shifted syngas in integrated gasification combined cycle plants was
   examined in this work from a chemistry standpoint. A systematic
   gas-solid carbonation study of chrysotile was carried out in a basket
   reactor using model (H2O/H-2/CO2) shifted syngas where CO2 uptakes were
   measured after 1 h carbonations between 100 degrees C and 220 degrees C
   at 3.2 MPa total pressures. Partial dehydroxylation and steam mediation
   substantially enhanced meta-chrysotile carbonation achieving uptakes as
   high as 0.7 CO2 moles per Mg mole at 130 degrees C. Also, combined X-ray
   powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectra and CO2 uptake studies
   indicated that the presence of H-2 did not prevent carbonation of
   meta-chrysotile nor derailed Mg availability towards hydrides or
   metallic Mg. Chrysotile pre-dehydroxylation in the conditions of
   gasification was also emulated using catalytic steam reforming of a
   model-tar compound. However, post-carbonation of spent chrysotile,
   before and after coke burn-off, achieved at best ca. 0.02 CO2 uptakes
   suggesting that using the same magnesium silicate batch in gasification
   then in carbonation may be impractical. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{By making use of alkanolamine/room-temperature ionic liquid emulsions,
   it has been found practicable to capture carbon dioxide up to
   stoichiometric maximum (0.5 mole of CO2 per mole of diethanolamine)

   avoiding equilibrium limitations. This enabled easy separation of a
   reasonably smaller (solid carbamate) volume promising cost effective
   regeneration. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical

Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several leveraging strategies were explored to improve gold leaching
   during cyanidation in the presence of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite
   and chalcocite. Galena, used a source of lead, was found to largely
   neutralize the negative effect of sulfide minerals dissolution on gold
   leaching, especially in the cases of pyrite, chalcopyrite and
   sphalerite. Pyrite-galena galvanic interactions improved gold leaching
   while for chalcopyrite, sphalerite and chalcocite active galvanic
   interactions with galena were found to be detrimental to gold leaching.
   Pre-oxidation of metal sulfides prior to cyanidation significantly
   increased gold leaching rate when gold-pyrite galvanic interactions were
   disabled, while their enablement identified pyrite pre-oxidation as
   counter-productive. Pre-oxidation of mixed mineral systems of
   pyrite-chalcopyrite and pyrite-sphalerite showed that enabling galvanic
   interactions between the associated minerals during pre-oxidation
   controlled gold leaching in the subsequent cyanidation process. For
   pyrite, lead nitrate addition during pre-oxidation resulted in a
   significant increase of gold leaching, whereas its addition to
   subsequent cyanidation canceled the positive effects of pre-oxidation on
   gold dissolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{823-832}},
Abstract = {{Stormwater is polluted by various contaminants affecting the quality of
   receiving water bodies. Pathogens are one of these contaminants, which
   have a critical effect on water use in rivers. Increasing the retention
   time of water in stormwater basins can lead to reduced loads of
   pathogens released to the rivers. In this paper a model describing the
   behaviour of pathogens in stormwater basins is presented including
   different fate processes such as decay, adsorption/desorption, settling
   and solar disinfection. By considering the settling velocity
   distribution of particles and a layered approach, this model is able to
   create a light intensity, and particle and pathogen concentration
   profile along the water depth in the basin. A strong effect of solar
   disinfection is discerned. The model has been used to evaluate pathogen
   removal efficiencies in stormwater basins. It includes a population of
   particle classes characterized by a distribution of settling velocities
   in order to be able to reproduce stormwater quality and treatment in a
   realistic way.}},

Abstract = {{Tunable notch filters with multiple transmission lines have been
   proposed and demonstrated by temporarily inducing phase-shifts in
   chirped fiber Bragg gratings through the application of stress or
   thermal perturbations. These filters find application in many fields
   including microwave photonics or optical communications. So far, study
   of this type of filter has been mostly experimental with occasional
   numerical modeling based on coupled-mode theory. This paper presents a
   theoretical analysis using the WKB approximation that highlightens the
   presence of resonators and quantitatively describes both the phase-shift
   accumulated in the propagation region and the reflection strength of the
   surrounding grating regions. The model provides an approximated function
   of the transmission peak amplitude that gives good insight into its
   dependence on the grating parameters and perturbation profile. This
   analysis predicts the filter bandwidth, tuning capability and minimum
   spectral separation between two transmission lines leading to
   straightforward design and optimization of the filter parameters.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{643-652}},
Abstract = {{To obtain greater precision in modelling small agricultural watersheds,
   a shorter simulation time step is beneficial. A daily time step better
   represents the dynamics of pollutants in the river and provides more
   realistic simulation results. However, with a daily evaluation
   performance, good fits are rarely obtained. With the Shuffled Complex
   Evolution (SCE) method embedded in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT), two calibration approaches are available, single-objective or
   multi-objective optimization. The goal of the present study is to
   evaluate which approach can improve the daily performance with SWAT, in
   modelling flow (Q), total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus
   (TP). The influence of weights assigned to the different variables
   included in the objective function has also been tested. The results
   showed that: (i) the model performance depends not only on the choice of
   calibration approach, but essentially on the influential parameters;
   (ii) the multi-objective calibration estimating at once all parameters
   related to all measured variables is the best approach to model Q, TSS
   and TP; (iii) changing weights does not improve model performance; and
   (iv) with a single-objective optimization, an excellent water quality
   modelling performance may hide a loss of performance of predicting flows
   and unbalanced internal model components.}},

Abstract = {{Corrugated walls were used in gas-solid bubbling fluidized beds to
   reduce minimum bubbling velocity and improve gas distribution. A
   thorough stability analysis of flat-wall (FWBFB) and corrugated-wall
   (CWBFB) bubbling fluidized beds was carried out using several
   geometrical bed declinations and operating conditions covering
   corrugation angles, clearances, initial rest bed heights and ratios of
   gas velocity to minimum bubbling velocity. U-g/U-mb. Standard deviations
   of dynamic fluctuations for measured indicators such as bed differential
   pressure, wall-to-bed heat transfer coefficient, bed free surface and
   bed mean gray scale intensity (via digital image analysis), and
   simulated indicators (via 3-D CFD simulations) such as granular
   temperature and pressure, and solids volume fraction were monitored to
   compare the stability behaviors of FWBFB and CWBFB. It was concluded
   that at a given U-g/U-mb, CWBFB offered more stable gas-solid
   fluidization operation than FWBFB. Every system turned more unstable
   with the increase in U-g/-U-mb. rest bed height and corrugation angle,
   but proved relatively insensitive to wall clearance. Full 3-D transient
   Euler-Euler CFD simulations were corroborated with experimental findings
   and further revealed that necks (narrowest clearances) were mainly
   responsible for the growth of instabilities in CWBFB as compared to hips
   (largest clearances). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution seismic profiles along with physical and
   sedimentological properties of sediment cores from the Saguenay (Eastern
   Canada) and Reloncavi (Chile) Fjords allowed the identification of
   several decimeter to meter-thick turbidites. In both fjords, the
   turbidites were associated with large magnitude historic and
   pre-historic earthquakes including the 1663 AD (M > 7) earthquake in the
   Saguenay Fjord, and the 1960 (M 9.5), 1837 (M similar to 8) and 1575 AD
   major Chilean subduction earthquakes in the Reloncavi Fjord. In
   addition, a sand layer with exoscopic characteristics typical of a
   tsunami deposit was observed immediately above the turbidite associated
   with the 1575 AD earthquake in the Reloncavi Fjord and supports both the
   chronology and the large magnitude of that historic earthquake. In the
   Saguenay Fjord, the earthquake-triggered turbidites are sometimes
   underlying a hyperpycnite associated with the rapid breaching and
   draining of a natural dam formed by earthquake-triggered landslides.
   Similar hyperpycnal floods were also recorded in historical and
   continental geological archives for the 1960 and 1575 AD Chilean
   subduction earthquakes, highlighting the risk of such flood events
   several weeks or months after main earthquake. In both fjords, as well
   as in other recently recognized earthquake-triggered turbidites, the
   decimeter-to meter-thick normally-graded turbidites are characterized by
   a homogeneous, but slightly fining upward tail. Finally, this paper also

Abstract = {{Nowadays, poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) textiles, either knitted
   or woven, are largely used as substitutes for replacement of medium and
   large calibre (10-40 mm) arteries. Unfortunately, these substitutes do
   not perform well when they are used to replace small diameter arteries
   due to thrombogenicity and compliance mismatch issues. Surface
   treatments were often used as the first step to solve thrombosenicity
   issues. For example, low pressure ammonia plasma processes can provide
   modification of the top approximate to 10-50 angstrom of polymer surface
   without affecting bulk properties of materials. This work compared
   ammonia plasma surface modifications of PET film (flat surface) and PET
   scaffolds (porous surface). Plasma treatments lead to a higher amount of
   nitrogen as well as amino groups on scaffolds compared to films. N/C
   maximum was reached for PET film and scaffold after plasma treatments of
   5 s and 100 s, respectively. Highest amine concentration on films and
   scaffolds were obtained at short treatment time, specifically 1 s. In
   addition, high resolution spectra of C 1s confirmed that amino groups
   were mainly grafted on aromatic rings. Nodule formation was observed
   after plasma treatment with atomic force microscopy. Their size and
   shape increased with longer treatment time.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing deterioration of panel paintings can be due to the
   physical processes that take place during exhibition or transit, or as a
   result of temperature and humidity fluctuations within a building,
   church or museum. In response to environmental alterations, a panel
   painting can expand or contract and a new equilibrium state is
   eventually reached. These adjustments, though, are usually accompanied
   by a change in shape in order to accommodate the new conditions. In this
   work, a holographic method for detecting detached regions and
   micro-cracks is described. Some of these defects are confirmed by the
   thermo graphic signal reconstruction (TSR) technique. In addition,
   pulsed phase thermography (PPT) and principal component thermography
   (PCT) allow two artificial defects in Mylar to he identified with
   greater contrast, which is crucial to understand the topic of interest:
   the discrimination between defect materials. Finally, traditional
   contact ultrasound applications are widely applied for the evaluation of
   the wood quality in several characterisation procedures. Inspecting the
   specimen from the front side, the natural and artificial defects of the
   specimen are confirmed. Experimental results derived by the application
   of the integrated methods on an Italian panel painting reproduction,
   called The Angel specimen, are presented. The main advantages that these
   techniques can offer to the conservation and restoration of artworks are
   emphasised.}},

Title = {{Culture of human corneal endothelial cells isolated from corneas with

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of initiating
   primary cultures of corneal endothelial cells from patients suffering
   from Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD; MIM\# 1036800). We also
   evaluated which conditions yielded the best results for culture.
   Twenty-nine patients undergoing Descemet stripping automated endothelial
   keratoplasty consented to the use of their excised Descemet's membrane
   for this study. Out of the 29 specimens, 18 successfully initiated a
   culture. Cell morphology varied between endothelial (rounded, slightly
   elongated cells, n = 12) and fibroblastic-like (thin and very elongated
   cells, n = 6). These differences in cell morphology were also observed
   with the normal human corneal endothelial cell cultures. The cultures
   that initially presented an endothelial morphology maintained their
   shape in subcultures. Clusterin expression was similar in FECD and
   normal endothelial cells. Transmission electron microscopy of FECD
   Descemet's membranes showed a high degree of various abnormalities
   generally found in this disease, such as a thickened Descemet's
   membrane, presence of a posterior banded layer, presence of a fibrillar
   layer and striated bodies of various sizes and periodicities. Patient's
   age was predictive of culture success, all younger FECD donors
   generating cultures of endothelial morphology. The absence of a
   fibrillar layer was also a factor associated with greater success.
   Culture success was not dependent on specimen size, specimen
   pigmentation, or patient's preoperative central corneal thickness. In
   conclusion, this paper shows for the first time that central Descemet's
   membranes of patients suffering from FECD possess proliferative
   endothelial cells that can be isolated and cultured without viral
   transduction, opening the way for new in vitro studies of this disease.

Abstract = {{The existing River Water Quality Model No. 1 (RWQM1) was extended with
   processes determining the fate of non-volatile pesticides in the water
   phase and sediments. The exchange of pesticides between the water column
   and the sediment is described by three transport processes: diffusion,
   sedimentation and resuspension. Burial of sediments is also included.
   The modified model was used to simulate the concentrations of diuron and
   chloridazon in the river Nil. A good agreement was found between the
   simulated pesticide concentrations and measured values resulting from a
   four-month intensive monitoring campaign. The simulation results
   indicate that pesticide concentrations in the bulk water are not
   sensitive to the selected biochemical model parameters. it seems that
   these concentrations are mainly determined by the imposed upstream
   concentrations, run-off and direct losses. The high concentrations in
   the bulk water were not observed in the sediment pore water due to a
   limited exchange between the water column and the sediment. According to
   a sensitivity analysis, the observed pesticide concentrations are highly
   sensitive to the diffusion and sorption coefficients. Therefore, model
   users should determine these parameters with accuracy in order to reduce
   the degree of uncertainty in their results.}},

Abstract = {{Organic-rich silty marls and limestones (Pliensbachian to earliest
   Toarcian) exposed at Ait Moussa in Boulemane Province are the only known
   example of an effective petroleum source rock in the Middle Atlas of
   Morocco. In this study, petrological and organic-geochemical analyses
   (vitrinite reflectance measurements, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, GC-MS) were
   carried out in order to evaluate the maturity, quality and quantity of
   the organic matter (OM) and to investigate the depositional environment
   of these source rocks. Results indicate the presence of Type I/II
   kerogen which was deposited under marine conditions with an input of
   predominantly algal-derived organic matter. The presence of woody
   particles indicates minor input of terrestrial material.
   Organic-geochemical and biomarker analyses are consistent with
   deposition of carbonate-rich sediments under oxygen-depleted but not
   anoxic conditions. In terms of thermal maturity, the sediments have
   reached the oil window (0.50.6 \%VRt) but not peak oil generation,
   although petroleum generation and migration are indicated by organic
   geochemical and microscopic evidence.
   Kinetic parameters derived from an investigation of petroleum generation
   characteristics show that the kerogen decomposes within a narrow
   temperature interval due to the fairly homogenous structure of the
   algal-derived organic matter. The kinetic parameters together with
   vitrinite reflectance data were used to construct a 1D model of the
   burial, thermal and maturation history of the Ait Moussa locality. The
   model suggested that deepest burial (approx. 3200 m) for the
   Pliensbachian succession took place in the Eocene (approx. 40 Ma). Two
   phases of hydrocarbon generation occurred, the first in the Late
   Jurassic/Early Cretaceous (approx. 150 Ma), and the second at the time
   of deepest burial (Eocene).}},

Abstract = {{Vascular tissue engineering represents a promising field in the
   replacement of diseased vessels. The biological properties of
   three-dimensional (3D) collagen scaffolds indicate this material as a
   valid choice for vascular tissue engineering. Unfortunately, mechanical
   properties still remain unsatisfactory, due to a low burst pressure
   resistance and a plastic deformation. The use of a bioreactor to apply
   appropriate mechanical stresses have already shown a remodelling effect
   on the extracellular matrix and the behaviour of cells. In this study,
   we have shown the effect of the mechanical stress on elastin synthesis,
   which has a direct effect on the mechanical properties of the
   tissue-engineered vessel. We measured and compared the stressstrain
   curves, the elastic modulus and tenacity of a collagen tubular scaffold
   in the presence of C2C12 murine myoblasts cells, before and after the
   maturation in the bioreactor, applying a shear stress of 5 dynes/cm2 for
   3 days. Interesting evidence concerning the extracellular matrix
   structure, which significantly modify the biomechanical characteristics
   of the cellular scaffold, were observed, underlying the importance of
   focusing more effort in the research field of physiologically-guided 3D
   tissue-engineered substitutes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{In the present study, skim milk was successfully cryoconcentrated up to
   43.72 +/- 0.69\% (w/w) total dry matter after four cryoconcentration

   It was found that the cryoconcentrated skim milk fraction was rich in
   potassium ions. The effect of the cryoconcentration cycle and thawing
   mode on process efficiency was studied. The obtained data showed that
   the cryoconcentration cycle effect was significant (P < 0.001). The
   thawing mode (gravitational and microwave assisted thawing) had no
   effect on process efficiency. However, the microwave assisted thawing
   mode was more efficient regarding to the time needed to obtain the
   desired thawed fraction. To achieve high process efficiency, three
   cryoconcentration cycles were sufficient since the process efficiency
   drastically decreased after this cycle. The concentration of the dry
   mater entrapped in the ice fraction was the highest at the fourth

Abstract = {{Protection and sustainability of water supply wells requires the
   assessment of vulnerability to contamination and the delineation of well
   capture zones. Capture zones, or more generally, time-of-travel zones
   corresponding to specific contaminant travel times, are most commonly
   delineated using advective particle tracking. More recently, the capture
   probability approach has been used in which a probability of capture of
   P = 1 is assigned to the well and the growth of a probability-of-capture
   plume is tracked backward in time using an advective-dispersive
   transport model. This approach accounts for uncertainty due to
   local-scale heterogeneities through the use of macrodispersion. In this
   paper, we develop an alternative approach to capture zone delineation by
   applying the concept of mean life expectancy E (time remaining before
   being captured by the well), and we show how life expectancy E is
   related to capture probability P. Either approach can be used to
   delineate time-of-travel zones corresponding to specific travel times,
   as well as the ultimate capture zone. The related concept of mean
   groundwater age A (time since recharge) can also be applied in the
   Context of defining the vulnerability of a pumped aquifer. In the same
   way as capture probability, mean life expectancy and groundwater age
   account for local-scale uncertainty or unresolved heterogeneities
   through macrodispersion, which standard particle tracking neglects. The
   approach is tested on 2D and 3D idealized systems, as well as on several
   watershed-scale well fields within the Regional Municipality of
   Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Data dissemination is a process where information is transmitted towards
   different destinations. In order to prevent accidents, coordinate rescue
   operations and warn people about critical events, this process imposes
   end-to-end delay constraints. Accordingly, the delay from each source to
   each destination should be monitored. For this purpose, a middleware is
   required between the network and the applications, offering the tracking
   capabilities of disseminated information. In this paper, we propose a
   middleware architecture for disseminating delay-constrained information
   in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to evaluate the feasibility
   of such architecture, a proof of concept of a real scenario is
   implemented. For performance evaluation, the end-to-end delay and the
   percentage of success related to the disseminated information are
   analyzed. Such analysis reveals that the middleware offers a percentage
   of success close to 98\%, which is highly superior to the success of
   individual resources, such as Short Message Services (SMS), emailing and
   twitter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dosimetric performance and array assessment of plastic scintillation
   detectors for stereotactic radiosurgery quality assurance}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{429-436}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the performance of plastic scintillation detectors
   (PSD) for quality assurance (QA) in stereotactic radiosurgery conditions
   to a microion-chamber (IC), Gafchromic EBT2 films, 60 008 shielded
   photon diode (SD) and unshielded diodes (UD), and assess a new 2D
   crosshair array prototype adapted to small field dosimetry.
   Methods: The PSD consists of a 1 mm diameter by 1 mm long scintillating
   fiber (BCF-60, Saint-Gobain, Inc.) coupled to a polymethyl-methacrylate
   optical fiber (Eska premier, Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
   Output factors (S(c,p)) for apertures used in radiosurgery ranging from
   4 to 40 mm in diameter have been measured. The PSD crosshair array
   (PSDCA) is a water equivalent device made up of 49 PSDs contained in a
   1.63 cm radius area. Dose profiles measurements were taken for
   radiosurgery fields using the PSDCA and were compared to other
   dosimeters. Moreover, a typical stereotactic radiosurgery treatment
   using four noncoplanar arcs was delivered on a spherical phantom in
   which UD, IC, or PSD was placed. Using the Xknife planning system
   (Integra Radionics Burlington, MA), 15 Gy was prescribed at the
   isocenter, where each detector was positioned.
   Results: Output Factors measured by the PSD have a mean difference of
   1.3\% with Gafchromic EBT2 when normalized to a 10 x 10 cm(2) field, and
   1.0\% when compared with UD measurements normalized to the 35 mm
   diameter cone. Dose profiles taken with the PSD crosshair array agreed
   with other single detectors dose profiles in spite of the presence of
   the 49 PSDs. Gamma values comparing 1D dose profiles obtained with PSD
   crosshair array with Gafchromic EBT2 and UD measured profiles shows
   98.3\% and 100.0\%, respectively, of detector passing the gamma
   acceptance criteria of 0.3 mm and 2\%. The dose measured by the PSD for
   a complete stereotactic radiosurgery treatment is comparable to the
   planned dose corrected for its SD-based S(c,p) within 1.4\% and 0.7\%
   for 5 and 35 mm diameter cone, respectively. Furthermore, volume
   averaging of the IC can be observed for the 5 mm aperture where it
   differs by as much as 9.1\% compared to the PSD measurement. The angular
   dependency of the UD is also observed, unveiled by an under-response
   around 2.5\% of both 5 and 35 mm apertures.
   Conclusions: Output Factors and dose profiles measurements performed,
   respectively, with the PSD and the PSDCA were in agreement with those
   obtained with the UD and EBT2 films. For stereotactic radiosurgery
   treatment verification, the PSD gives accurate results compared to the
   planning system and the IC once the latter is corrected to compensate
   for the averaging effect of the IC. The PSD provides precise results
   when used as a single detector or in a dense array, resulting in a great
   potential for stereotactic radiosurgery QA measurements. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In feasibility studies and mine planning, accurate and effective tools
   and methods facilitating cost estimation play an important role.
   Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) machines are a key loading and haulage equipment in
   most of the underground metal mines and hard rock tunnels. In this
   paper, a cost estimation model of these vehicles has been presented in
   the form of single and multivariable functions. These functions have
   been provided on the basis of costs types (i.e. capital and operating
   costs) and motor types (diesel and electric). Independent variables, in
   the single regression analysis is bucket capacity and in Multiple Linear
   Regression (MLR) analysis include bucket capacity, overall width,
   overall machine height and horse power (HP). The MLR is conducted in
   three steps. First, with the help of Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
   correlation between independent variables is omitted. Thereafter,
   significant PCs are selected and used as independent variables in the
   MLR functions. Finally, the cost relationships are established as
   functions of initial LHD variables. The mean absolute error rates are
   11.59\% and 6.87\% for the single and multiple linear regression
   functions, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the ability of lime requirement (LR) methods to predict
   the amount of lime required to achieve a selected pH that if optimum for
   crop production is important in the management of acid agricultural and
   horticultural soils. The primarily aim of this study was to evaluate
   three quick buffer methods for measuring LR to target pH values using 28
   acidic coarse-textured soils from Quebec (Canada). The buffer methods
   included the original Shoemaker, McLean and Pratt (SMP) single-buffer
   method (initial buffer pH 7.5) and modified SMP method (initial buffer
   pH of 6.0 and 5.5, and soil: CaCl2 0.01 M: buffer solution ratios of 1:
   1: 2 and 1: 2: 2), the Adams and Evans (AE) method (initial buffer pH
   8.0) and the Mehlich single-buffer method (initial buffer pH 6.6). The
   SMP procedures were compared on the basis of their ability to predict
   the lime requirement to pH(water) values of 5.5, 6.0 or 6.5, and to
   pH(CaCl2) values of 5.0 and 5.5 obtained from soil-CaCO3-moist
   incubation (ILR). LR values estimated from all procedures were
   significantly correlated with each other. Decreasing SMP buffer pH from
   7.5 to 5.5 gave an accurate and precise estimation of the soil LR. In
   general, the best linear relationships between the ILR and soil: water:
   buffer equilibrium pH or soil: CaCl2: buffer equilibrium pH were
   obtained when the initial SMP buffer solution was adjusted to pH 5.5.
   The relationship between ILR and SMP-LR at 1: 1: 2 soil: CaCl2: buffer
   solution is better than that obtained at 1: 2: 2 ratio. Positive
   correlations were obtained between SMP-LR values and total and
   exchangeable acidity, extractable soil Al (Al-CaCl2, Al-KCl, Al-oxalate,
   Al-dithionite and Al-pyrophosphate), and organic matter and clay
   particle content. The results indicate that the LR determination of acid
   coarse-textured soils is affected by soil buffer equilibrations and
   chemical properties that are associated with acidity factors and buffer
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in the recycling of by-products and
   waste materials with low concentration of nutrients, such as the
   separated solid fraction of pig slurry with or without composting (SPS),
   for land application as fertilizers or soil amendments. In Canada, these
   `low-analysis` fertilizers are regulated by The Fertilizers Act and
   Regulations. According to the Canadian Fertilizer Act, \% N + \% P2O5 +
   \% K2O in a mixed fertilizer (low-analysis fertilizer + mineral
   fertilizers) should be not be less than 24\%. In the context of
   sustainable agriculture, it is necessary to develop organo-mineral
   fertilizers (OMF) containing SPS that do not pose a risk of adverse
   effects to the environment. This study aimed to determine the maximum
   amount of SPS that can be added to mineral fertilizers in order to
   obtain an OMF that contain 24\% of N+P2O5+K2O. Two commercial mineral
   fertilizers, monoammonium phosphate {[}MAP (11-52-0)] and diammonium
   phosphate {[}DAP (18-46-0)], and 14 pig slurries were used in this
   study. The concentration of total N in SPS ranged from 0.9 to 4.3\%,
   P2O5 from 2.3 to 14.2\% and K2O from 0.6 to 4.0\%. The amount of
   N+P2O5+K2O varied from 5.2\% in SPS obtained by means of flocculation
   using a polymer + rock dust to 19.1\% in SPS obtained by means of
   flocculation-sedimentation using magnesium by-products. The maximum
   amount of SPS to be used in mineral fertilizers mixture varied from 68
   to 89\% by weight of the OMF, depending of SPS type. There is obviously
   a great deal of research needed to optimize manufacturing starter OMF
   pellets containing more SPS than ammonium phosphate fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{Composted manures are widely used as soil amendments to improve the
   fertility of soils by adding humified organic matter and plant nutrients
   such as nitrogen (N). In order for crop plants to be able to use N,
   added organic N must be converted to available forms such as ammonium
   and nitrate (NO3) through microbial activity. However, some compost made
   of animal manures may contain antibiotics as growth promoters. There is
   little information on the production of NO3 in fine-textured soils
   amended with manure composts containing veterinary antibiotics. An
   incubation experiment was conducted to monitor NO3-N evolution in an
   agricultural silty clay soil amended with two composts receiving
   chlortetracycline (CTC) and sampled at seven occasions (0, 10, 20, 40,
   80, 120, and 160 days) under controlled laboratory conditions. The soil
   had 32.0 g C/kg, 1.8 g N/kg, and a pH (H2O) of 6.9. The two composts
   were made of cattle manures and wood chips (CW) or straw (CS). The soil,
   composts and compost-amended soil received three rates of CTC (0, 450
   and 2250 mu g CTC/kg). The compost treatments were prepared by adding 0,
   15.45 and 30.9 g CS/kg soil or 0, 12.5 and 25.0 g CW/kg soil in order to
   provide 0, 2.75 and 5.50 g total N/kg soil. Results indicated that the
   percentage of NO3-N produced during the incubation period ranged from
   1.8 to 12.4 \% and 0.8\% to 10.9\% of added N in the soil amended with
   the highest rate of CS and CW without CTC, respectively. In general,
   soil amended with CTC-treated CW produced slightly larger amounts of
   NO3-N compared to soil amended with CTC-treated CS. The amount of NO3-N
   produced in soil amended with CTC-treated composts was less than that in
   soil amended with composts without CTC (control). Overall, it can be
   concluded that applying 2250 mu g CTC/kg wet compost did not affect
   markedly nitrification process in silty clay soil amended with cattle
   manure compost.}},

Abstract = {{Starter fertilizers are banded near the seed at planting time. Mineral
   fertilizers commonly used as starter are monoammonium phosphate (MAP)
   and diammonium phosphate (DAP). Recently, organo-mineral fertilizers
   (OMF) made from mixtures of DAP, MAP and separated solid fraction of pig
   slurry with or without composting (SPS) have been developed in Quebec
   (Canada). These OMF are used as starter to increase early plant growth
   and nutrient uptake. The main objective of this laboratory experiment
   was to develop starter mixed fertilizers with target pH between 5.8 and
   7.0. In a first set of experiments, different amounts of MAP were mixed
   with DAP in order to obtain 0 to 60\% MAP in the mineral fertilizer
   mixture matrix. In a second set of experiments, different amounts of
   nine SPS were mixed with two mineral fertilizers (1:1 MAP: DAP, w/w) in
   order to obtain 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100\% SPS in the final fertilizer
   mixture (i.e. OMF). Increasing MAP resulted in decreasing pH of the
   mineral fertilizers mixture (MF) from 8.0 (100\% MAP) to less than 5.5.
   The target pH values of 5.8 and 7.0 were obtained respectively with 50\%
   and 12.6\% MAP in the MF. The pH values of the OMF (SPS + MF) varied
   from 5.8 (MF without SPS) to 6.0-6.9 (80\% SPS + 20\% MF), depending of
   the type of SPS. The results indicated that the pH of OMF samples
   depended on the nature and amount of its components and the buffering
   capacity of the OMF. The addition of organic fertilizer such as SPS
   tends to increase OMF's buffering capacity. SPS could be used in
   increasing proportions (up to 80\%) in the OMF as alternative to
   ammonium phosphate as starter fertilizer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a frequency domain non-linear identification method
   for equivalent model parameters estimation of high voltage pulse
   transformers. Such kinds of transformers are widely used in the pulsed
   power domain. Usually the difficulty in deriving pulsed power converter
   optimal control strategies comes from the lack of knowledge of such high
   voltage transformers parameters. These components require models which
   take into account electric fields energies represented by stray
   capacitance in the equivalent circuit. These capacitive elements must be
   accurately identified, since they greatly influence the general
   converter performances. A non-linear frequency based identification
   method is presented and a sensitivity analysis of the best experimental
   test is carried out. The procedure takes into account magnetic
   saturation and skin effects occurring in the windings during the
   frequency tests. The presented method is validated by experimental
   identification of a 2MW-100kV pulse transformer.}},

Abstract = {{From the perspective of sustainable development, recycling road
   materials is a possible and suitable waste reduction solution. In fact,
   recycling the asphalt concrete layer within the pavement base by Full
   Depth Reclamation (FDR) reduces the use of non-renewable resources and
   the costs associated with waste management. However, there is still some
   reluctance to reuse these materials as a new road base, mainly due to
   poor knowledge or understanding of their mechanical behavior, especially
   regarding permanent deformation. Thus, to address this problem, the
   research project presented in this paper, done in a laboratory, focused
   on the effect of Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) content on the
   mechanical behavior of a recycled material (0, 30, 50, 60 and 70\% RAP).
   Three main parameters were analyzed: the susceptibility to the
   development of permanent deformation, the resilient modulus and the
   effect of moisture on the resilient modulus. A significant effect of the
   content of RAP on the rate of permanent deformation was observed for
   values higher than 50\% RAP, while this effect on the resilient modulus
   is more limited. It was observed that the mechanical behavior of
   recycled material is less sensitive to variations in the degree of
   saturation than are virgin materials.}},

Title = {{Hydroxyapatite bioactivated bacterial cellulose promotes osteoblast

Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of bacterial
   cellulose (BC) scaffold to support osteoblast growth and bone formation.
   BC was produced by culturing Acetobacter xylinum supplemented with
   hydroxyapatite (HA) to form BC membranes (without HA) and BC/HA
   membranes. Membranes were subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) analysis to determine surface element composition. The membranes
   were further used to evaluate osteoblast growth, alkaline phosphatase
   activity and bone nodule formation. BC was free of calcium and
   phosphate. However, XPS analysis revealed the presence of both calcium
   (10\%) and phosphate (10\%) at the surface of the BC/HA membrane.
   Osteoblast culture showed that BC alone was non-toxic and could sustain
   osteoblast adhesion. Furthermore, osteoblast adhesion and growth were
   significantly (p = 0.05) increased on BC/HA membranes as compared to BC
   alone. Both BC and BC/HA membranes improved osteoconductivity, as
   confirmed by the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity that
   increased from 2.5 mM with BC alone to 5.3 mM with BC/HA. BC/HA
   membranes also showed greater nodule formation and mineralization than
   the BC membrane alone. This was confirmed by Alizarin red staining (ARS)
   and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). This work demonstrates
   that both BC and BC/HA may be useful in bone tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic information systems (GIS) are a powerful tool to handle
   spatial information and are widely used to represent, manage and analyse
   spatial data in many disciplines including geosciences, agriculture,
   forestry, metrology and oceanography. In GIS, considerable efforts have
   been carried out for the representation and management of the spatial
   data, based on the object view of the space. However, they are still
   limited when it comes to representation and simulation of spatiotemporal
   processes. Examples of such processes in the geographic domain include
   global warming, inundation, erosion, land cover change, urban growth and
   traffic. GIS have been criticized for not being able to provide the
   necessary functionalities for representation, analyzing and predicting
   effectively the behaviour of those processes. The integration of
   Cellular Automata (CA) and geospatial models represents a potential
   solution for understanding and representing spatiotemporal processes. In
   this paper, we are exploring the potentials of a Voronoi lattice based
   CA as an alternative to improve GIS capabilities to represent surface
   water flow as a spatiotemporal process. In addition, we propose a
   hierarchical perspective of the built lattice that may be essential to
   easy move between scales and then to better understand the complex
   behaviour of the whole system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to compute the maximum
   contact force that can be applied by a manipulator at any point on its
   external surface. The approach consists in the approximation of the
   robot's external surface by simple primitives for which the position and
   normal direction can easily be expressed analytically for any point on
   the surface. This approach is also used to compute analytically the
   boundaries of the zones on the external surface where the achievable
   force exceeds a predetermined threshold. A method is developed for
   determining the limit joint torques which ensure that the achievable
   force cannot exceed a predetermined magnitude for any point on the
   primitives. Specific equations are developed for two types of primitives
   (parallelogram and cylinder) along with generic procedures applicable to
   any shape. An example is presented to illustrate how the proposed
   procedures can be applied for the solution of a typical problem.
   Finally, the applicability and limitations of this approach are
   discussed. A potential application for this work is to provide
   information on a robot's dangerousness to its controller in order to
   improve safety.}},

Abstract = {{The range of possible tasks achievable by robots highly depends on the
   selection of motors and transmissions. For example, variable ratio
   transmissions surpass single ratio transmissions because they can modify
   the torque-speed parameters of the actuator and, therefore, maintain the
   optimal power output state from the motor. Consequently, the use of
   variable ratio transmissions may expand a robot's achievable tasks.
   A robotic joint with continuously variable transmission ratio is
   presented in this paper. This new type of transmission joint may be used
   in serial or parallel robots. The transmission consists of a doubly
   actuated two-degree-of-freedom five-bar parallel mechanism. The main
   actuator is located at the input revolute joint. The variation of the
   ratio is achieved with the adjustment actuator located at a second
   revolute joint.
   Such a transmission, based on a linkage, may have undesired ratio
   variations for a constant adjustement joint position. Therefore, two
   different optimization methods are presented to determine the best
   geometric parameters in order to minimize the undesired ratio variation
   while maximizing the possible transmission ratio range. The performance
   indices are either optimal for the entire range or only for the maximum
   and minimum ratios available.
   A simulation is presented with the best parameters obtained with the
   optimization based on the maximum and minimum ratios. Results show a
   transmission ratio ranging from 0.9:1 to 4.5:1 with a minimal
   amplification of 3.9:1. The transmission ratio may vary continuously
   within the working boundaries. The output range of motion may be adapted
   to a serial robot joint.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the forward kinematic problem of 4-DOF parallel
   mechanisms with revolute actuators and identical limb structures and
   performing a three translations and one rotation motion pattern. The
   general architecture of all the mechanisms under study in this paper
   originates from the type synthesis performed for 4-DOF parallel
   mechanisms with identical limb structures. The mathematical framework
   used in this paper is based on algebraic geometry where the forward
   kinematics and constraint expressions are explored in a
   seven-dimensional kinematic space by means of the so-called Study
   parameters (dual quaternions). In this paper, the algorithm applied for
   obtaining the forward kinematic and constraint expressions is based on a
   recent and novel approach, called linear implicitization algorithm,
   which is based on solving systematically a system of linear equations to
   determine the coefficients of the non-linear constraint equations. This
   paper presents also an example of a 4-DOF parallel mechanism.}},

   The equivalent serial kinematic chain associated with a parallel

   static singularity) analysis of the parallel manipulators is then
   reduced to the singularity (stability) analysis of a single-loop

   configurations of the class of parallel manipulators are obtained with

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the singularity analysis of parallel manipulators
   with identical limb structures performing Schonflies motions, namely,
   three independent translations and one rotation about an axis of fixed

   the 4-(R) under bar UU parallel manipulator. The 6 x 6 Jacobian matrix
   of such manipulators contains two lines at infinity, namely, two
   constraint moments, among its six Plucker lines. The Grassmann-Cayley
   Algebra is used to obtain geometric singularity conditions. However, due
   to the presence of lines at infinity, the rank deficiency of the
   Jacobian matrix for the singularity conditions is not easy to grasp.
   Therefore, a wrench graph representation for some singularity conditions
   emphasizes the linear dependence of the Plucker lines of the Jacobian
   matrix and highlights the correspondence between Grassmann-Cayley
   algebra and Grassmann geometry.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new class of pantographs, i.e., of mechanisms that allow
   the reproduction of the displacements of an input link, the master, with
   an output link, the slave. The application we envision for these devices
   is the telemanipulation of objects from small distances, at low cost,
   where magnetic fields or other design constraints prohibit the use of
   electromechanical systems. Despite the long history of pantographs,
   which were invented in the 17th century, the class of pantographs
   proposed here is new, as it relies on parallel cable-driven mechanisms
   to transmit the motion. This allows the reproduction of rigid-body
   displacements, while previous pantographs were limited to point
   displacements. This important characteristic and others are described in
   the paper. One important challenge in the design of the proposed systems
   is that the cables must remain taut at all time. We address this issue
   by introducing nonlinear springs that passively maintain a minimum
   tension in the cables, while approximating static balancing of the
   mechanism over its workspace. Approximating static balancing allows the
   forces applied at the slave to reflect more accurately at the master,
   and vice versa. As a preliminary validation, a two-degree-of-freedom
   parallel cable-driven pantograph is designed. A prototype of this
   apparatus that does not include approximate static balancing is built,
   which demonstrates the working principle of these mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We compute the lowest stable-equilibrium pose of a rigid body suspended
   in space by an arbitrary number of cables, being given the cable lengths
   and the attachment-point positions on the fixed frame and on the rigid
   body. This fundamental problem of mechanics if of interest in the fields
   of underconstrained cable-driven parallel robots and cooperative towing.
   The approach of the present work is very similar to one that is reported
   in a previous paper by the authors. Indeed, the problem is formulated as
   a potential energy minimization, and is solved using a branch-and-bound
   algorithm. Hence, we report mainly on improvements in the branching and
   bounding parts of the algorithm. In short, the idea is to search for the
   optimum rigid-body pose by partitioning only the rotation subgroup of
   rigid-body displacements. This is done here by dividing the
   four-dimensional space of Euler-Rodrigues parameters with polyhedral
   cones instead of boxes, the latter being normally used for this type of
   problem. The advantage is that cones conform better to the
   four-dimensional unit-sphere of Euler-Rodrigues parameters. The convex
   relaxations of the original optimization problem are then adapted to the
   newly defined conical subsets. Besides resulting in a more elegant
   algorithm, this new conical branch-and-bound method leads to a higher
   efficiency in the case of reported examples.}},

Abstract = {{A novel architecture of spatial spring-loaded cable-loop-driven parallel
   mechanism is introduced in this paper. In this mechanism, cable-spool
   actuating systems and actuation redundancy are avoided. By attaching
   springs to the cable loops, three degrees of freedom for spatial
   displacement can be controlled using only three actuators. This paper
   presents the inverse kinematics, the static equilibrium equations and
   the workspace analysis. Because all these equations are obtained based
   on the cable segment lengths, many square roots appear in the equations.
   The boundary equations for different arrangements, i.e., preload,
   non-zero stiffness and external forces, are obtained separately in order
   to simplify the analysis. The boundary equations of each cable force for
   any situation can be obtained by combining the equations based on the
   matrix superposition principle. It is verified that the mechanism has a
   significantly large workspace within which the cables and the springs
   can be maintained in tension compared to a standard mechanism actuated
   with three motors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents several innovative features that aim at improving
   the mechanical design of underactuated anthropomorphic grippers. Based
   on prototypes previously developed, the characteristics of a
   tendon-driven underactuated finger and a reconfigurable thumb are first
   presented. Their geometry, coverings and attachment principles are
   detailed. Then, a novel approach to mechanically couple the thumb with
   the four fingers is presented. Using a lever, this approach provides the
   ability to mechanically prescribe a desired distribution of the
   forces/velocities during the actuation. A static model is developed to
   visualize the possibilities offered by this principle. Also, a compact
   mechanism that allows underactuation between the four fingers is
   described. This mechanism significantly improves the synchronization of
   the outputs. Additionally, a mechanical selector is introduced that
   makes the gripper mechanically programmable by allowing to selectively
   block one or many outputs. The use of this mechanical selector, combined
   with the reconfigurable thumb and the underactuation between the
   fingers, allows a gripper to produce several grasping modes without the
   need of additional actuation. Finally, a prototype including all these
   features is briefly described.}},

Abstract = {{A novel two-degree-of-freedom cable-loop slider-driven parallel
   mechanism is introduced in this paper. The two degrees of freedom of the
   mechanism are decoupled and only two actuators are needed to control the
   motion. There are two cable loops for each direction of motion: one acts
   as the actuating loop while the other is the constraint loop. Due to the
   simple geometric design, the kinematic and static equations of the
   mechanism are very compact. The stiffness of the mechanism is also
   analyzed in the paper. It can be observed that the mechanism's stiffness
   is much higher than the stiffness of the cables. Finally, the dynamic
   equations of the mechanism, including the compliance and-the damping of
   the cables are obtained. The proposed mechanism's workspace is
   essentially equal to its footprint and there are no singularities. The
   mechanism does not require the use of a rigid-link passive bridge and
   trolley (only cables are connected to the end-effector). Sliders located
   on the edges of the workspace are used and actuation redundancy is
   eliminated while providing force closure everywhere in the workspace.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamic point-to-point trajectory planning of
   cable-suspended robots is investigated. A simple planar
   two-degree-of-freedom (2-dof) robot is used to demonstrate the
   technique. In order to maintain the cables' positive tension, a set of
   algebraic inequalities is derived from the dynamic model of the 2-dof
   robot. The trajectories are defined using parametric polynomials with
   the coefficients determined by the prescribed initial and final states,
   and the variable time duration. With the polynomials substituted into
   the inequality constraints, the planning problem is then converted into
   an algebraic investigation on how the coefficients of the polynomials
   will affect the number of real roots over a given interval. An
   analytical approach based on a polynomial's Discrimination Matrix and
   Discriminant Sequence is proposed to solve the problem. It is shown
   that, by adjusting the time duration within appropriate ranges, it is
   possible to find positive-definite polynomials such that the
   polynomial-based trajectories always satisfy the inequality constraints
   of the dynamic system. Feasible dynamic trajectories that are able to
   travel both beyond and within the static workspace will exploit more
   potential of the cable-suspended robotic platform.}},

   rigid body in the vertical plane from point-acceleration measurements,

   a simple stochastic model of the human-hand motions is used in order to
   distinguish between the two types of acceleration. Two mathematical
   models of the rigid-body motion are formulated as distinct state-space
   systems, each corresponding to a proposed method. In both two cases, the
   output is a nonlinear function of the state, which calls for the
   application of the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed filter is
   shown to work efficiently through two simulated trajectories, which are
   representative of human-hand motions. A comparison of the orientation
   estimates obtained from the proposed method shows that the filter offers
   more accuracy than a tilt sensor under high accelerations, and avoids
   the drift obtained by the time-integration of gyroscope measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Several approaches and models have been proposed to simulate the spread
   of infectious diseases such as West Nile virus (WNV) or Lyme disease.
   However, these models such as mathematical models have some weaknesses
   when trying to simulate the influence of geographic features on the
   disease spread. In this context, we developed a new theoretical model
   called MASTIM to remedy some shortcomings of current methods. Our model
   is used to specify the spatio-temporal interactions of various kinds of
   actors (e.g. mosquitoes, ticks, birds, mammals, etc.) involved in the
   zoonosis propagation. We applied our model to the case of WNV and the
   case of Lyme disease in order to illustrate its genericity. Besides, we
   are currently using our model to develop Zoonosis-MAGS, a generic
   geosimulation tool for zoonoses. This tool aims at helping health policy
   makers to better understand the spread of zoonoses and the consequences
   of their interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed video coding is a video paradigm where most of the
   computational complexity can be transfered from video encoders to the
   decoders. This allows for video sequences transmission involving
   inexpensive encoders and powerful central decoders. Unfortunately, due
   to typically numerous feedback requests and needed decoder run cycles,
   this often leads to unacceptably long decoding latencies. One approach
   to addressing the latency problem consists in estimating an initial
   number of parity bit chunks (INC) that are then sent at once to reduce
   the number of these decoders run cycles. The challenge is to properly
   estimate as accurately as possible the INC without neither
   underestimation nor overestimation. This paper proposes two INC
   estimation techniques based on the temporal correlation between
   successive Wyner-Ziv frames and on the correlation between the different
   bit-planes.}},

Abstract = {{One of the objectives of designing feature selection learning algorithms
   is to obtain classifiers that depend on a small number of attributes and
   have verifiable future performance guarantees. There are few, if any,
   approaches that successfully address the two goals simultaneously. To
   the best of our knowledge, such algorithms that give theoretical bounds
   on the future performance have not been proposed so far in the context
   of the classification of gene expression data. In this work, we
   investigate the premise of learning a conjunction (or disjunction) of
   decision stumps in Occam's Razor, Sample Compression, and PAC-Bayes
   learning settings for identifying a small subset of attributes that can
   be used to perform reliable classification tasks. We apply the proposed
   approaches for gene identification from DNA microarray data and compare
   our results to those of the well-known successful approaches proposed
   for the task. We show that our algorithm not only finds hypotheses with
   a much smaller number of genes while giving competitive classification
   accuracy but also having tight risk guarantees on future performance,
   unlike other approaches. The proposed approaches are general and
   extensible in terms of both designing novel algorithms and application
   to other domains.}},
