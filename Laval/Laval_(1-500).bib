Title = {{Effect of casting flow defects on the crack propagation in UHPFRC thin

Abstract = {{Owing to their outstanding compressive strength and considerable
   cracking resistance, Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete
   (UHPFRC) have been recently successfully applied to thin bidimensional
   elements, e.g., plate and shells. As a critical aspect of UHPFRC
   technology,is work aims at experimentally investigating the effect of
   fibre orientation on the damage behaviour of UHPFRC 2-way thin slabs by
   means of stereovision digital image analysis. To this aim, the fibre
   orientation was perturbed by introducing a simple divider line as a
   temporary barrier to the casting flow of fresh concrete. The casting
   flow defect affected the fibre distribution by creating a weakened plane
   with a strong discontinuity. By varying the line direction and the
   position of the concentrated load position, six different slab
   configurations were fabricated and tested under punching load with
   hyperstatic boundary conditions. Then, the 3-D deformation field was
   measured by means of stereovision-based Digital Image Correlation (DIC).
   The results showed the critical importance of the fibre distribution on
   the microcracking growth and the structural ductility. The casting flow
   defect had a major impact on the observed microcrack pattern and growth
   especially before the peak load. When the defect crossed the loading
   point, the microcracks did not fully develop with an important reduction
   of the load-carrying capacity and the structural ductility. Finally, a
   simplified application of yield line theory allowed estimating the
   effect on the fibre distribution of the casting flow defects. 2016

Abstract = {{Active ingredients of ginsenoside, Rg1 and Re, are able to inhibit the
   proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and promote the growth of
   vascular endothelial cells. These capabilities are of interest for
   developing a novel drug-eluting stent to potentially solve the current
   problem of late-stent thrombosis and poor endotheliazation. Therefore,
   this study was aimed to incorporate ginsenoside into degradable coating
   of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Drug mixture composed of
   ginseng extract and 10\% to 50\% of PLGA (xPLGA/g) was coated on
   electropolished stainless steel 316L substrate by using a dip coating
   technique. The coating was characterized principally by using attenuated
   total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy and contact angle analysis, while the drug release
   profile of ginsenosides Rg1 and Re was determined by using mass
   spectrometry at a one month immersion period. Full and homogenous
   coating coverage with acceptable wettability was found on the 30PLGA/g
   specimen. All specimens underwent initial burst release dependent on
   their composition. The 30PLGA/g and 50PLGA/g specimens demonstrated a
   controlled drug release profile having a combination of diffusion-and
   swelling-controlled mechanisms of PLGA. The study suggests that the
   30PLGA/g coated specimen expresses an optimum composition which is seen
   as practicable for developing a controlled release drug-eluting stent.

Title = {{Resistance of Aerosolized Bacterial Viruses to Four Germicidal Products}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Viral diseases can spread through a variety of routes including
   aerosols. Yet, limited data are available on the efficacy of aerosolized
   chemicals to reduce viral loads in the air. Bacteriophages (phages) are
   often used as surrogates for hazardous viruses in aerosol studies
   because they are inexpensive, easy to handle, and safe for laboratory
   workers. Moreover, several of these bacterial viruses display physical
   characteristics similar to pathogenic human and animal viruses, like
   morphological size, type of nucleic acids, capsid morphology, and the
   presence of an envelope. In this study, the efficacy of four chemicals
   was evaluated on four airborne phages at two different relative humidity
   levels. Non-tailed bacteriophages MS2 (single-stranded RNA), phi 6
   (double-stranded RNA, enveloped), PR772 (double-stranded DNA), and phi
   X174 (single-stranded DNA) were first aerosolized in a 55L rotative
   environmental chamber at 19 degrees C with 25\% and 50\% relative
   humidity. Then, hydrogen peroxide, Eugenol (phenylpropene used in
   commercial perfumes and flavorings), Mist (R) (automobile disinfectant
   containing Triethylene glycol), and Pledge (R) (multisurface
   disinfectant containing Isopropanol, n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium
   Chlorides, and n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride) were
   nebulized with the phages using a separate nebulizer. Aerosols were
   maintained in suspension during 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours. Viral
   aerosols were sampled using an SKC BioSampler and samples were analyzed
   using qPCR and plaque assays. The resistance levels of the four phages
   varied depending on the relative humidity (RH) and germicidal products
   tested. Phage MS2 was the most stable airborne virus under the
   environmental conditions tested while phage PR772 was the least stable.
   Pledge (R) and Eugenol reduced the infectivity of all airborne phages
   tested. At 25\% RH, Pledge (R) and Eugenol were more effective at
   reducing infectivity of RNA phages phi 6 and MS2. At 50\% RH, Pledge (R)
   was the most effective agent against phage MS2. These findings
   illustrate that various airborne viruses should be tested to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of germicidal treatments. This research also provides
   a set of parameters for testing germicidal products in large-scale
   settings to reduce the risk of virus transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The driving performance of individuals with mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI) is suboptimal when compared to healthy older adults. It is
   expected that the driving will worsen with the progression of the
   cognitive decline and thus, whether or not these individuals should
   continue to drive is a matter of debate. The aim of the study was to
   provide support to the claim that individuals with MCI can benefit from
   a training program and improve their overall driving performance in a
   driving simulator. Fifteen older drivers with MCI participated in five
   training sessions in a simulator (over a 21-day period) and in a 6-month
   recall session. During training, they received automated auditory
   feedback on their performance when an error was noted about various
   maneuvers known to be suboptimal in MCI individuals (for instance,
   weaving, omitting to indicate a lane change, to verify a blind spot, or
   to engage in a visual search before crossing an intersection). The
   number of errors was compiled for eight different maneuvers for all
   sessions. For the initial five sessions, a gradual and significant
   decrease in the number of errors was observed, indicating learning and
   safer driving. The level of performance, however, was not maintained at
   the 6-month recall session. Nevertheless, the initial learning observed
   opens up possibilities to undertake more regular interventions to
   maintain driving skills and safe driving in MCI individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2013, hundreds of thousands of refugees have migrated southward to
   Jordan to escape the Syrian civil war that began in mid-2011. Evaluating
   impacts of conflict and migration on land use and transboundary water
   resources in an active war zone remains a challenge. However, spatial
   and statistical analyses of satellite imagery for the recent period of
   Syrian refugee mass migration provide evidence of rapid changes in land
   use, water use, and water management in the Yarmouk-Jordan river
   watershed shared by Syria, Jordan, and Israel. Conflict and consequent
   migration caused similar to 50\% decreases in both irrigated agriculture
   in Syria and retention of winter rainfall in Syrian dams, which gave
   rise to unexpected additional stream flow to downstream Jordan during
   the refugee migration period. Comparing premigration and postmigration
   periods, Syrian abandonment of irrigated agriculture accounts for half
   of the stream flow increase, with the other half attributable to
   recovery from a severe drought. Despite this increase, the Yarmouk River
   flow into Jordan is still substantially below the volume that was
   expected by Jordan under the 1953, 1987, and 2001 bilateral agreements
   with Syria.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate drug consumption more reliably, waste water-based
   epidemiology would benefit from a better understanding of drug residue
   stability during in-sewer transport. We conducted batch experiments with
   real, fresh wastewater and sewer biofilms. Experimental conditions mimic
   small to medium-sized gravity sewers with a relevant ratio of biofilm
   surface area to wastewater volume (33 m(2) m(-3)). The influences of
   biological, chemical, and physical processes on the transformation of 30
   illicit drug and pharmaceutical residues were quantified. Rates varied
   among locations and over time. Three substances were not stable-that is,
   >20\% transformation, mainly due to biological processes-at least for
   one type of tested biofilm for a residence time <= 2 h: amphetamine,
   6-acetylcodeine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine. Cocaine, ecgonine methyl
   ester, norcocaine, cocaethylene, and mephedrone were mainly transformed
   by chemical hydrolysis and, hence, also unstable in sewers. In contrast,
   ketamine, norketamine, O-desmethyltramadol, diclofenac, carbamazepine,
   and methoxetamine were not substantially affected by in-sewer processes
   under all tested conditions and residence times up to 12 h. Our
   transformation rates include careful quantification of uncertainty and
   can be used to identify situations in which specific compounds are not
   stable. This will improve accuracy and uncertainty estimates of drug
   consumption when applied to the back calculation.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are often poorly removed from
   wastewater using conventional treatment technologies and there is
   limited understanding of their fate during treatment. Inappropriate
   sampling strategies lead to inaccuracies in estimating removals of CECs.
   In this study, we used the ``fractionated approach{''} that accounts for
   the residence time distribution (RTD) in treatment units to investigate
   the fate of 26 target CECs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP) that includes primary, secondary and tertiary treatment steps.
   Prior, hydraulic calibration of each treatment unit was performed.
   Wastewater and sludge samples were collected at different locations
   along the treatment train and the concentrations of target CECs were
   measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The most
   substantial aqueous removal occurred during activated sludge treatment
   (up to 99\%). Removals were <50\% in the primary clarifier and tertiary
   rotating biological contactors (RBCs) and up to 70\% by sand filtration.
   Mass balance calculations demonstrated that (bio)degradation accounted
   for up to 50\% of the removal in the primary clarifier and 100\% in
   activated sludge. Removal by sorption to primary and secondary sludge
   was minimal for most CECs. Analysis of the selected metabolites
   demonstrated that negative removals obtained could be explained by
   transformations between the parent compound and their metabolites. This
   study contributes to the growing literature by applying the fractionated
   approach to calculate removal of different types of CECs across each
   wastewater treatment step. An additional level of understanding of the
   fate of CECs was provided by mass balance calculations in primary and
   secondary treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{KNN-based Kalman filter: An efficient and non-stationary method for

Abstract = {{The traditional Gaussian process (GP) regression is often deteriorated
   when the data set is large-scale and/or non-stationary. To address these
   challenging data properties, we propose a K-Nearest-Neighborbased Kalman
   filter for Gaussian process regression (KNN-KFGP). Firstly, we design a
   test-input-driven KNN mechanism to group the training set into a number
   of small collections. Secondly, we use the latent function values of
   these collections as the unknown states and then construct a novel state
   space model with GP prior. Thirdly, we explore Kalman filter on this
   state space model to efficiently filter out the latent function values
   for prediction. As a result, our KNN-KFGP framework can effectively
   alleviate the heavy computation load of GP with recursive Bayesian
   inference, especially when the data set is large-scale. Moreover, our
   KNN mechanism helps each test point to find its strongly-correlated
   local training subset, and thus our KNN-KFGP can model non-stationarity
   in a flexible manner. Finally, we compare our KNN-KFGP to several
   related works and show its superior performance on a number of synthetic
   and real-world data sets. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Two-phase flow dynamics and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance were
   numerically analyzed for vertical, inclined, and oscillating trickle
   beds with a prospect of assessing the potential of implementing HDS
   operations on marine floating platforms. An unsteady-state
   three-dimensional model based on the macroscopic volume-averaged mass,
   momentum, energy and species balance equations coupled with simultaneous
   diffusion and chemical reaction within sulfide CoMo/alumina catalyst was
   developed for the purpose of comparative analyses using
   H-2/dibenzothiophene/n-hexadecane model system. Angular uniform and
   sinusoidal oscillatory motion of the reactor between two angled
   symmetrical positions and between vertical and an inclined position was
   considered. As in the case of cold-flow passive conditions, in chemical
   reaction environment two-phase downflow deviates considerably from axial
   symmetry at higher reactor inclinations with noticeable liquid
   accumulation in the bottommost reactor cross-sectional area on the
   tilting side. Also, externally-induced reactor periodic oscillation
   generates complex reverse secondary flow in radial and circumferential
   directions and oscillatory patterns of flow field with the amplitude and
   propagation frequency affected by the type (uniform or sinusoidal),
   amplitude and period of angular motion of reactor. Inclined, symmetric
   and asymmetric oscillating trickle-bed reactors underperform the
   vertical configuration and the decline of symmetric oscillating
   trickle-bed reactor hydrodesulfurization performance is lower under
   uniform oscillatory motion conditions. Oscillating trickle-bed reactors
   generate an oscillatory hydrodesulfurization performance which is
   affected by the parameters of angular motion of reactor. The inhibiting
   effect induced by H2S on the hydrogenolysis is considerable at higher
   packed bed inclinations and in symmetric oscillating triclde-bed
   reactors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{520}},
Pages = {{941-950}},

Abstract = {{Preparation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) from rigid polymers like
   PIM-1 remains challenging because the contorted and rigid polymer chains
   of PIM-1 severely inhibit self-rearrangement leading to low quality of
   polymer-filler interaction. MMMs prepared by conventional methods,
   therefore, often suffer from defects at the polymer-filler interface. In
   this work, a novel filler having hydroxyl functional groups on the
   surface (Mg-MOF-74) was used as a filler and mixed with PIM-1 in
   solution (chloroform). Under optimized solution conditions (65 degrees C
   and 24 h), chemical crosslinking between the hydroxyl groups and the
   fluoride chain-ends of PIM-1 was facilitated, to completely remove these
   interfacial defects. The crosslinked MMMs were then characterized by
   XRD, FTIR, SEM and mechanical tests, while their separation properties
   were studied for five gases including H-2, CO2, CH4, N-2 and O-2 upon
   increasing Mg-MOF-74 loading (0-20\% wt.). The two main features of
   MOF-74 (also known as CPO-27), especially Mg-MOF-74, greatly
   contributing to the membrane gas separation were 1-D hexagonal channels
   (1.1 nm diameter) and an exceptionally high CO2 adsorption capacity
   under reduced pressures. As the ends of PIM-1 are directly linked with
   the MOF surface, the intrinsic micropores of PIM-1 are connected to the
   inner pores of MOF-74 forming an inter-connected micropore network
   throughout the MMM. Both selectivities and permeabilities of MMM were
   improved for all the gases, particularly CO2 permeability which
   increased by 3.2 times from 6500 Barrer for the neat polymer (PIM-1) to
   21,000 Barrer for PIM-1 with 20\% wt. of MOF-74, meanwhile CO2/CH4
   selectivity was improved from 12.3 to 19.1, respectively. (C) 2016

Journal = {{SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{213}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated if removal of floricane leaves from the inner
   non-fruiting canopy portion would improve the photosynthesis of the
   remaining leaves only through raising their daily light sum, or if it
   would do so also through the ameliorated hydraulic parameters. From the
   beginning to the end of the fruiting season, the integrated daily light
   transmission decreased linearly from 36\% to 23\% vs. 18\% respectively
   for the partially defoliated (42\% floricane leaf removal) vs. control
   treatments. This resulted in an estimated average daily leaf PPFD
   available across the mid-canopy that was 40\% greater in the partially
   defoliated treatment. However, modeled net photosynthetic productivity
   of the partially defoliated floricane canopy around mid-height was
   essentially equivalent to that of the control. Although, in the morning
   measurement period, significant up-regulation of Ksoil-leaf,g(s) and
   A(sat) was observed in partially defoliated plants throughout the
   fruiting period, the overall fruit yield obtained was similar in both
   treatments. We demonstrated that red raspberry plants are capable of
   sustaining substantial up-regulation of their leaf specific
   hydraulic/photosynthetic capacity throughout the fruiting season in
   response to LAI reduction, thereby partially buffering against the
   ensuing reduction of current photosynthate supply. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Effect of particles on bubble size distribution and gas hold-up in
   column flotation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{163-173}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{In flotation systems, it is generally assumed that the bubble size
   presents an inverse correlation with the gas hold-up. However, this
   hypothesis is not systematically true. The focus of this work is to
   study the effect of solid particles on the bubble size distribution and
   gas hold-up, as well as the correlation between the bubble size
   distribution and gas hold-up in column flotation. Experiments were
   conducted in two and three-phase systems using a laboratory flotation
   column (5.6 cm internal diameter, total height of 650 cm), and mixtures
   of quartz (hydrophilic gangue) and talc (naturally hydrophobic mineral),
   classified in four different size fractions. For the studied flotation
   system, experimental results are compared with literature correlations
   and models to reveal that hydrophobic particles affect the gas hold-up
   through three different mechanisms modifying the Sauter mean diameter
   and rise velocity, namely (1) surface interactions, and the joint
   antagonistic effect of (2) bubble loading and (3) coalescence. (C) 2016

Title = {{A double-layer ELM with added feature selection ability using a sparse
   Bayesian approach}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{216}},
Pages = {{371-380}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The Sparse Bayesian Extreme Learning Machine (SBELM) has been recently
   proposed to reduce the number of units activated on the hidden layer. To
   deal with high-dimensional data, a novel sparse Bayesian Double-Layer
   ELM (DL-ELM) is proposed in this paper. The first layer of the proposed
   DL-ELM is based on a set of SBELM subnetworks which are separately
   applied to the features on the input layer. The second layer consists in
   a set of weight parameters to determine the contribution of each feature
   in the output. Adopting a Bayesian approach and using Gaussian priors,
   the proposed method is sparse in both the hidden layer (of SBELM
   subnetworks) and the input layer. Sparseness in the input layer (i.e.
   pruning of irrelevant features) is achieved by decaying weights on the
   second layer to zero, such that the contribution of the corresponding
   input feature is deactivated. The proposed framework then enables
   simultaneous feature selection and classifier design at the training
   time. Experimental comparisons on real benchmark data sets show that the
   proposed method benefits from efficient feature selection ability while
   providing a compact classification model of good accuracy and
   generalization properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{PROBING PAIN PATHWAYS WITH LIGHT}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{338}},
Pages = {{248-271}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{We have witnessed an accelerated growth of photonics technologies in
   recent years to enable not only monitoring the activity of specific
   neurons, while animals are performing certain types of behavior, but
   also testing whether specific cells, circuits, and regions are
   sufficient or necessary for initiating, maintaining, or altering this or
   that behavior. Compared to other sensory systems, however, such as the
   visual or olfactory system, photonics applications in pain research are
   only beginning to emerge. One reason pain studies have lagged behind is
   that many of the techniques originally developed cannot be directly
   implemented to study key relay sites within pain pathways, such as the
   skin, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brain-stem. This is due, in
   part, to difficulties in accessing these structures with light. Here we
   review a number of recent advances in design and delivery of
   light-sensitive molecular probes (sensors and actuators) into pain relay
   circuits to help decipher their structural and functional organization.
   We then discuss several challenges that have hampered hardware access to
   specific structures including light scattering, tissue movement and
   geometries. We review a number of strategies to circumvent these
   challenges, by delivering light into, and collecting it from the
   different key sites to unravel how nociceptive signals are encoded at
   each level of the neuraxis. We conclude with an outlook on novel imaging
   modalities for label-free chemical detection and opportunities for
   multimodal interrogation in vivo. While many challenges remain, these
   advances offer unprecedented opportunities to bridge cellular approaches
   with context-relevant behavioral testing, an essential step toward
   improving translation of basic research findings into clinical
   applications. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {{Introduction: As required by standards organizations, Hema-Quebec Cord
   Blood Bank performs enumeration of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in
   cord blood units (CBUs). This study presents the validation and
   implementation approaches developed to transfer the routine NRBC
   enumeration from the manual blood film method to a flow cytometric
   assay.
   Methods: The flow cytometry method was adapted from Tsuji (Cytometry,
   37, 1999, 291). This assay was validated to assess the specificity,
   detection limit, repeatability, and reproducibility of the method,
   including interoperator and interlaboratory testing. Finally,
   postimplementation follow-up and adjustments were performed for CBU over
   a 7-month period.
   Results: Blood film and flow cytometry NRBC enumerations showed a strong
   correlation (n = 40; Pearson's r correlation = 0.90). Validation was
   successful as exemplified by the correlation in interlaboratory testing
   (n = 30; r = 0.98). During implementation, our routine laboratory
   analyses revealed that CBU with low NRBC content (<= 2\%), representing
   26\% of all CBU tested, resulted in 15\% of repeated reading and/or
   staining and was the principal source of nonconformity. Small
   adjustments in the standard operating procedures (SOPs), including a
   fixed 200-event setting in the NRBC gate for the second reading of the
   replicates, have completely solved this issue.
   Conclusion: Flow cytometric NRBC enumerations, now implemented in
   Hema-Quebec Public Cord Blood Bank, is an improvement in the efficiency
   of our operations by integrating the count for NRBC into our flow
   cytometry platform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of finite element (FE) modeling and
   experimental testing of reinforced concrete beams strengthened in shear
   with fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM). The studied
   parameters included the number of FRCM layers (one and two layers),
   matrix type (mortar and epoxy), and amount of internal stirrups (no
   stirrups and stirrups with spacings of 0.6d and 0.3d, where d is the
   depth of the tensile steel). Test results showed that the shear-strength
   gain after strengthening was in the range of 51-145\%. The
   shear-strength gain decreased with an increase in the amount of internal
   stirrups. Doubling the number of FRCM layers resulted in a
   nonproportional increase in the shear strength. The use of epoxy
   adhesive rather than a cementitious mortar as a matrix insignificantly
   increased the shear-strength gain. The effect of increasing the amount
   of FRCM or varying the matrix type on the shear strength was less
   pronounced for the specimens with internal stirrups. The FE models
   developed in this study were capable of predicting the nonlinear shear
   response of the tested specimens. A comparison between predicted and
   experimental results confirmed the accuracy and validity of the
   developed FE models. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Health care workers are at risk of occupational infections,
   and some procedures are known to increase this risk. The aim of this
   study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during
   bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk.
   Methods: Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies
   were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet
   wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification
   of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic
   analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional
   biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis
   was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of
   influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp.
   Results: A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air.
   All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of
   the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such
   as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some
   opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found.
   Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the
   polymerase chain reaction method during this study.
   Conclusions: Culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora
   are aerosolized during bronchoscopy and could be inhaled by medical
   staff. The potential presence of pathogens in those aerosols could
   represent an occupational infection risk. (C) 2016 Association for

Title = {{Critical analysis of life cycle impact assessment methods addressing
   consequences of freshwater use on ecosystems and recommendations for
   future method development}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Anthropic water uses can affect aquatic and terrestrial
   ecosystems through various pathways. To address these impacts in life
   cycle assessment, an array of impact assessment methods can be applied.
   The currently well-known review of methods carried out by the UNEP/SETAC
   Life Cycle Initiative's WULCAworking group (Kounina et al. Int J Life
   Cycle Assess 18(3):707-721,2013) recommends that practitioners
   Bsimultaneously apply all indicators to evaluate damage on ecosystem
   quality and to cautiously sum up the score into a single metric{''}.
   This call for caution is attributed to the fact that methods reviewed
   cover different ecosystem targets. Their characterisation factors and
   units also vary. However, the review lacks a detailed analysis of
   compatibilities and coherence between methods that identifies
   inconsistencies to be overcome to further method harmonisation. This is
   precisely the aim of this study.
   Methods Existing methods were analysed against a scheme. It consists of
   four issues (1) covered impact pathway, (2) structure of
   characterisation model and factor, (3) fate factor modelling, and (4)
   effect factor modelling, further specified based on ten criteria. Among
   these, one criterion evaluates the legitimacy of using steady-state fate
   factors to model pulse-type water uses based on the theorem presented by
   Heijungs (Environ Sci Pollut Res Int 2: 217-224, 1995). New terminology
   is proposed for a proper description of the criteria. All of the
   criteria evaluate scientific and technical aspects. The analysis
   approach involves a qualitative description of each model.
   Results and discussion Important findings of the analysis include the
   following: (1) for several methods, the environmental intervention
   proposed and its connection to the impact assessment phase are
   debatable; (2) the location of the midpoint stressor (i. e. the
   indicator of change in the environment due to the environmental
   intervention) along the causality chain causes problems of compatibility
   among fate factors of different models; (3) it is appropriate to use the
   steady-state solution to find the new system condition after pulse-type
   water use. None of the models have justified this fundamental choice
   before. Recommendations for future method development respectively,
   involve the following: (1) avoid the use of inventory information in
   characterisation models and jointly develop inventory data and
   characterisation factors to ensure the applicability of impact
   assessment methods; (2) use the more environmentally relevantmidpoint
   stressor (the one along the causality chain closer to ecosystem damage;
   and (3) justify the use of the steady-state solution for fate factor
   modelling.
   Conclusions This study identifies sources of inconsistency in the
   indicator structures analysed and provides recommendations that will
   foster harmonisation. The current mismatch between methods leads us to
   not recommend aggregating indicators into one single metric until a
   common framework underpins existing and future water use impact
   assessment methods for ecosystem quality.}},

Abstract = {{Type I collagen gel is often used as a tubular scaffold because of its
   easy molding properties as well as its biocompatibility, low
   immunogenicity and ability to be remodelled by cells. However, its
   highly hydrated structure contributes to its weak mechanical properties
   and reduces its ability to be handled, which is important in tubular
   tissue engineering. Although cell-driven remodelling of collagen
   matrices is known to reinforce their mechanical properties, this process
   can take weeks. This study introduces a novel, simple, and rapid
   technique using a rotational bioreactor to expel water and densify
   collagen under sterile conditions to generate denser and stronger
   collagen gel scaffolds. This process produces a dense tubular-shaped
   collagen gel which, compared to standard collagen gel scaffolds, shows a
   decreased wall thickness and a four-fold increase in collagen
   concentration. A denser collagen fiber network observed by
   immunofluorescence staining and mechanical characterization shows a
   20-fold increase in the elastic modulus of the dense constructs which
   maintain cell viability inside the scaffold. Moreover, by simply
   modifying the scaffold mold, customized shapes and sizes can be obtained
   to provide a wide range of applications, including complex tubular
   geometries and multi-layered scaffolds for the culture of various cell
   types and tissues.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to develop accurate and efficient modeling approaches

   square support vector machine optimized by coupled simulated annealing
   (CSA-LSSVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system optimized by
   combination of PSO and hybrid methods (CHPSO-ANFIS). An extensive number

   were compared with four literature correlations. Results indicate that
   although all the developed computer-based models were effective and

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic model is presented for predicting the phase stability

   model reliably predicts the hydrate dissociation conditions for methane

   acetone. The van Laar model is used to calculate the activity
   coefficient of water in aqueous solution of water-soluble organic
   promoter. About 30\% of the reported experimental data were used for
   finding the empirical relationships to estimate the enthalpy of hydrate
   dissociation and the remaining 70\% was used to test the accuracy and
   the predictive capability of the correlation. The average absolute error

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to evaluate the fluoride removal from
   contaminated water using a new adsorbent material of high efficiency to
   obtain drinking water. The ZrCl4-graphene supported on vegetal activated
   carbon composite (G-ZrCl4/VAC) was synthesized and characterized using
   transmission and scanning electron microscopy, N-2 physisorption, energy
   dispersive X-ray spectrometry, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy,
   X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the point of
   zero charge was determined. The G-ZrCl4/VAC was evaluated for fluoride
   adsorptive removal from water under several operating conditions in
   batch system. The results indicated that fluoride adsorption by
   G-ZrCl4/VAC is favored at low pH values with the maximum adsorption at
   pH 2, corresponding to 97.22\% removal. Among the conditions of
   temperature and agitation evaluated, the best results were achieved at
   30 degrees C and 130 rpm, with removal percentages equal to 47.78 and
   48.48\%, respectively. The equilibrium of the system was achieved in 5 h
   of operation. The pseudo- first order kinetic model was the one that
   best described the kinetic data, while the equilibrium data were best
   described by the Langmuir isotherm with maximum adsorption capacity
   equal to 3.89 mg g(-1). Therefore, the results obtained show that the
   material synthesized has a great capacity for adsorption and demonstrate
   the viability of use of G-ZrCl4/VAC in the removal of fluoride to obtain
   drinking water.}},

Title = {{Delineating baseflow contribution areas for streams - A model and

Abstract = {{This study addresses the delineation of areas that contribute baseflow
   to a stream reach, also known as stream capture zones. Such areas can be
   delineated using standard well capture zone delineation methods, with
   three important differences: (1) natural gradients are smaller compared
   to those produced by supply wells and are therefore subject to greater
   numerical errors, (2) stream discharge varies seasonally, and (3) stream
   discharge varies spatially. This study focuses on model-related
   uncertainties due to model characteristics, discretization schemes,
   delineation methods, and particle tracking algorithms. The methodology
   is applied to the Alder Creek watershed in southwestern Ontario. Four
   different model codes are compared: HydroGeoSphere, WATFLOW, MODFLOW,
   and FEFLOW. In addition, two delineation methods are compared: reverse
   particle tracking and reverse transport, where the latter considers
   local-scale parameter uncertainty by using a macrodispersion term to
   produce a capture probability plume. The results from this study
   indicate that different models can calibrate acceptably well to the same
   data and produce very similar distributions of hydraulic head, but can
   produce different capture zones. The stream capture zone is found to be
   highly sensitive to the particle tracking algorithm. It was also found
   that particle tracking by itself, if applied to complex systems such as
   the Alder Creek watershed, would require considerable subjective
   judgement in the delineation of stream capture zones. Reverse transport
   is an alternative and more reliable approach that provides probability
   intervals for the baseflow contribution areas, taking uncertainty into
   account. The two approaches can be used together to enhance the
   confidence in the final outcome. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Real-time electromagnetic seed drop detection for permanent implants
   brachytherapy: Technology overview and performance assessment}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe the principles and report on the performance of a
   novel real-time electromagnetic (EM) seed drop detection technology for
   permanent implants brachytherapy procedures.
   Methods: A novel EM hollow needle prototype was recently developed by
   Philips. It possesses standard 3D tracking capability as well as a seed
   drop detection mechanism, both performed from a single custom built EM
   sensor. The detection mechanism is based on the magnetic permeability
   changes in the sensor as the seeds pass through. Drop position estimates
   are generated by the tracking information at the dropping instants.
   Three validation experiments were carried out in this study. First, the
   robustness of the detection mechanism was tested in free air with four
   different seed types. Detection waveforms were measured and commented.
   The accuracy of the seed drop position estimates was then evaluated
   using both 2D and 3D experiments. The procedures consisted of dropping
   seeds in phantoms, recording the drop position estimates, and finally
   registering the resulting spatial distributions on reference ones
   obtained by accurate modalities. Seeds were dropped on a specially
   designed plastic support adapted to brachytherapy template dimensions
   for 2D experiments, and true seed positions (reference distribution)
   were obtained by optical detection. In 3D experiments, seeds were
   dropped in edible gelatin and reference distributions were obtained by
   localizing the implants from CT scans of the phantoms.
   Results: All four seed types were correctly detected by the needle
   prototype. In total, 250 seeds were dropped on the plastic support, and
   96 were dropped in gelatin phantoms. The detection rate was 100\% in
   both cases. The minimum, maximum, and average drop position errors were,
   respectively, 0.1(+1.6/-0.1), 2.9(+1.4/-1.5), and 0.9(+1.4/-0.7) mm for
   2D, and 0.1(+1.0/-0.1), 2.1(+1.1/-0.8), and 0.6(+1.2/-0.5) mm for 3D
   experiments.
   Conclusions: The hollow needle prototype combines both EM tracking and
   automatic seed drop detection in a compact and convenient form. The EM
   detection mechanism is robust, and the seed drop position estimates
   appear sufficiently accurate for potential integration of the technology
   to current brachytherapy treatment planning systems. In that context, it
   would serve as a valuable tool for rapid dosimetry validation in
   real-time treatment delivery. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Title = {{Biochar and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria effects on switchgrass
   (Panicum virgatum cv. Cave-in-Rock) for biomass production in southern
   Quebec depend on soil type and location}},

Abstract = {{Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) is a fast growing native C-4 perennial
   and a lignocellulosic biomass crop for North America. In combination
   with biochar, an active plant growth promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR)
   community can contribute to the long-term sequestration of carbon soil,
   fix nitrogen, and enhance the availability of other nutrients to plants.
   Biochar and PGPR have the potential to improve grass biomass production,
   but they have not been tested together under high-latitude temperate
   zone field conditions. Therefore, the objective of this three-year field
   study was to determine whether there were effects on biomass yield and
   yield components of switchgrass (cv. Cave-in-Rock) due to a
   rhizobacterium that was able to mobilize soil phosphorus (Pseudomonas
   rhodesiae), a bacterial consortium that was able to supply nitrogen
   (Paenibacillus polymyxa, Rahnella sp., and Serrati sp.), and pine wood
   chip biochar applied as a soil amendment at 20 Mg ha(-1). The
   incorporation of biochar, or inoculation with the N-fixing consortium,
   and the combined inoculation of the experimental bacteria had positive
   effects on switchgrass height. At a loam soil site in
   Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, when nitrogen fertilizer was not
   applied, the addition of biochar had a positive effect on stand count
   (tillers m(-1) row). On the sandy soil in Sainte-Anne- -de-Bellevue,
   when biochar was applied with 100 kg N ha(-1), biomass yield increased
   over the control but did not provide additional benefits over plots
   receiving only 50 kg N ha -1. It remains unclear whether or not the
   increased C sequestration of this management system justifies increased
   N fertilizer usage. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a dynamic trajectory planning method for
   point-to-point motion of three-degree-of-freedom (three-DOF)
   cable-suspended parallel robots. Natural frequencies as well as
   associated periodic trajectories that can be obtained from the
   integration of the dynamic model of an equivalent passive mechanical
   system are used to design point-to-point trajectories. The trajectories
   can be used to connect consecutive points in sequence that may lie
   beyond the static workspace of the robot. The technique ensures zero
   velocity at each of the target points and continuity of the
   accelerations. Based on the cable tension constraints, attainable
   regions can be determined to search for the next target point, while
   feasible regions of intermediate points are generated in cases for which
   a given point cannot be directly attained. An example trajectory is
   performed to illustrate the approach. An experimental implementation is
   also presented using a three-DOF prototype, and video extensions are
   provided to demonstrate the results.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{80-96}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Studies on micro-packed beds were reviewed pointing out major
   contributions with their key findings. Negligible mass transfer
   resistance and temperature gradients in micro-packed beds enables access
   to intrinsic kinetic data. Small scales also provide safety for extreme
   conditions and production of hazardous materials. Hydrodynamic studies
   in micro-packed beds suggest that stronger capillary forces give rise to
   hydrodynamic differences between macro- and micro-packed beds. Also,
   studies reach consensus that deviations from plug flow are minimal. Mass
   transfer studies in micro-packed beds have been mostly coupled with
   kinetic studies and results are typically reported as overall mass
   transfer coefficients two orders of magnitude higher than those in
   macro-scale. Among the reviewed studies, mass transfer has been
   identified as the scarcest in coverage and therefore a complementary
   work was performed on liquid-solid mass transfer coefficients (k(Ls)) in
   micro-packed beds. Experiments were performed within the
   diffusion-limited regime and the correspondence of k(LS) values with
   macro-scale correlations was discussed. It was found that in
   single-phase liquid flow, micro-scale kLs is closely predicted by
   macro-scale correlations. Comparison between macro- and micro-scale
   showed that volumetric mass transfer coefficients are higher in the
   latter due to higher solid-liquid interactions in confined volumes and
   high surface-to-volume ratios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The synthesis of reactionless mechanisms generally involves the force
   balancing of a mechanism using countermasses followed by the dynamic
   balancing of the inertia using counter-rotations. This approach requires
   that the force balanced mechanism have a constant equivalent moment of
   inertia for any configuration. Two of the main drawbacks of reactionless
   mechanisms are a significant increase in mass and actuation inertia. In
   this paper, a counter-mechanism is introduced in order to dynamically
   balance a force balanced two-DOF mechanism with variable inertia, which
   is expected to reduce the aforementioned drawbacks. The conditions for
   which the counter-mechanism matches the moment of inertia of the main
   mechanism for any configuration are derived. Then, in order to fairly
   compare the use of a counter-mechanism instead of counter-rotations, the
   balancing strategies are optimized regarding the addition of mass and
   actuation inertia using Lagrange multipliers. The results are optimal
   rules for the design of reactionless mechanisms and optimal mass-inertia
   curves which are akin to Pareto curves. These results allow to
   demonstrate the advantages of counter-mechanisms over counter-rotations,
   especially regarding added actuation inertia and compactness. Also, the
   significant influence of the radius of gyration of the counter-inertias
   on the optimal mass-inertia curves is revealed. Finally, examples of
   reactionless mechanisms are presented and prototypes are tested in order
   to validate the concepts.}},

Abstract = {{A recent novel derivation of the representation of Virasoro singular
   vectors in terms of Jack polynomials is extended to the supersymmetric
   case. The resulting expression of a generic super-Virasoro singular
   vector is given in terms of a simple differential operator (whose form
   is characteristic of the sector, NeveuSchwarz or Ramond) acting on a
   Jack superpolynomial. The latter is indexed by a superpartition
   depending upon the two integers r, sthat specify the reducible module
   under consideration. The corresponding singular vector (at grade rs/2),
   when expanded as a linear combination of Jack superpolynomials, results
   in an expression that (in addition to being proved) turns out to be more
   compact than those that have been previously conjectured. As an aside,
   in relation with the differential operator alluded to above, a
   remarkable property of the Jack superpolynomials at alpha = -3is pointed
   out. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Whilst life cycle assessment (LCA) boundaries are expanded to account
   for negative indirect consequences of bioenergy such as indirect land

   strips and drainage filtration zones in the SkAyenne region of Sweden.
   Excluding possible ILUC effects and considering oil heat substitution,
   strategically planted filter willow can achieve net global warming

Abstract = {{Composite materials are widely used in the aeronautic industry. One of
   the reasons is because they have strength and stiffness comparable to
   metals, with the added advantage of significant weight reduction.
   Infrared thermography (IT) is a safe nondestructive testing technique
   that has a fast inspection rate. In active IT, an external heat source
   is used to stimulate the material being inspected in order to generate a
   thermal contrast between the feature of interest and the background. In
   this paper, carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers are inspected using IT.
   More specifically, carbon/PEEK (polyether ether ketone) laminates with
   square Kapton inserts of different sizes and at different depths are
   tested with three different IT techniques: pulsed thermography,
   vibrothermography, and line scan thermography. The finite element method
   is used to simulate the pulsed thermography experiment. Numerical
   results displayed a very good agreement with experimental results. (C)

Abstract = {{The presented approach addresses a review of the overheating that occurs
   during radiological examinations, such as magnetic resonance imaging,
   and a series of thermal experiments to determine a thermally suitable
   fabric material that should be used for radiological gowns. Moreover, an
   automatic system for detecting and tracking of the thermal fluctuation
   is presented. It applies hue-saturated-value-based kernelled k-means
   clustering, which initializes and controls the points that lie on the
   region-of-interest (ROI) boundary. Afterward, a particle filter tracks
   the targeted ROI during the video sequence independently of previous
   locations of overheating spots. The proposed approach was tested during
   experiments and under conditions very similar to those used during real
   radiology exams. Six subjects have voluntarily participated in these
   experiments. To simulate the hot spots occurring during radiology, a
   controllable heat source was utilized near the subject's body. The
   results indicate promising accuracy for the proposed approach to track
   hot spots. Some approximations were used regarding the transmittance of
   the atmosphere, and emissivity of the fabric could be neglected because
   of the independence of the proposed approach for these parameters. The
   approach can track the heating spots continuously and correctly, even
   for moving subjects, and provides considerable robustness against motion
   artifact, which occurs during most medical radiology procedures. (C)

Abstract = {{This study investigates the electrochemical interactions between gold
   and roasted gold ore (RGO), with its associated oxide minerals serving
   as slurry, in an electrolyte saturated with atmospheric oxygen.
   Conventional cyanidation yielded a decrease of similar to 40\% in the
   gold leach rate with magnetite slurry, while increases of 25\% and 10\%
   were observed for hematite and maghemite, respectively. These gold leach
   rates were obtained by applying cathodic Tafel slopes only. SEM-EDS, in
   the case of magnetite slurry, exhibited a high accumulation of iron
   oxides on the gold surface, which is an indication of slowdown in the

Abstract = {{This paper develops a programming model, which combines logistics
   outsourcing decisions with some strategic Supply Chains' planning
   issues, such as the Security of supplies, the customer Segmentation, and
   the Extended Producer Responsibility. The purpose is to minimize both
   the expected logistics cost and the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions of
   the Supply Chain (SC) network, in the context of business environment
   uncertainty. First, we define a general structure of the closed-loop SC.
   Second, we provide constructive models to roughly estimate the
   insourcing and outsourcing logistics costs, and their corresponding GHG
   emissions. Third, we establish a stochastic plan based on a scenarios
   approach to capture the uncertainty od demand, capacity of facilities,
   quantity and quality of returns of used products, and the
   transportation, warehousing, and reprocessing costs. Fourth, we suggest
   a programming model, and an algorithm based on the Epsilon-constraint
   method to solve it. The result is a set of optimal non-dominant green SC
   configurations, which provide the decision' makers with optimal levels
   of logistics outsourcing integration within a decarbonized Supply Chain,
   before any further low-carbon investment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study carried out to monitor the
   structural behavior of a flexible pavement in cold regions, which is
   significantly affected by environmental factors and traffic loads. In
   this study, a heavy vehicle simulator was used to simulate traffic load
   and to provide enough cooling energy to create a freezing environment.
   The mechanical response of the typical Quebec flexible pavement
   structure during freezing was investigated using this research tool. An
   empirical model was also proposed and validated to describe the effect
   of each pavement layer on the mechanical behavior variation during
   freezing. The results show that the changes of moisture content and
   matric suction for unbound materials have a good correlation with the
   frost state of surrounding materials. The mechanical responses,
   including strains and stress, experience a regular variation along with
   the increase of frost penetration. The model indicates that the asphalt
   layer is playing a significant role in all the mechanical response
   variations. As for the role of other layers, the mechanical response
   variation for a given layer is mostly dependent on its condition and its
   neighboring layers.}},

Title = {{Understanding shallow and deep flow for assessing the risk of

Journal = {{MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{728-737}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, concerns have been raised about the potential
   environmental impacts of oil and gas (O\&G) exploitation, especially
   regarding groundwater resources. However, there have been few studies
   carried out to assess the actual risk of O\&G exploitation based on
   specific local conditions. This paper reports on a study aiming to
   assess the potential risk to groundwater quality related to the
   development of a tight sandstone petroleum reservoir underlying a
   shallow fractured rock aquifer system in the Haldimand sector of Gaspe,
   Quebec, Canada. In this generally rural setting, the drilling of a
   provincially permitted horizontal O\&G exploration well was halted by
   new municipal regulations. Draft provincial environmental regulations
   were subsequently issued to define environmental requirements for
   hydrocarbon exploration wells. Our study thus also aimed to provide an
   example of how to comply with the new hydrogeological characterization
   requirements. This paper reports on the process followed to
   qualitatively assess the risk of O\&G operations and natural oil seeps
   to groundwater quality. The assessment focused on indicators of
   potential preferential fluid migration paths between the reservoir level
   and shallow aquifers. Field work and data analysis were used to define
   geological, hydrogeological and geochemical contexts on which a
   numerical model was developed to represent groundwater flow, mass
   transport and groundwater residence time. The risk for groundwater
   quality was qualitatively assessed from the implications of the study
   area context relative to 1) the new provincial regulatory requirements;
   2) potential contaminant release mechanisms related to O\&G exploration
   drilling operations; and 3) the expected effects that contaminant
   releases could have on groundwater. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{Hydrogeological processes acting at the margins of confined and
   unconfined thick carbonate sequences are particularly interesting due to
   a complex system evolution including partial uplift of fully confined
   carbonate systems and subsequent erosion of cover layers. We provide
   insights into this evolution by simulating coupled density-dependent
   fluid flow and heat transport based on the Buda Thermal Karst (BTK)
   system (Hungary) in a 2D vertical plane. Applying an equivalent porous
   medium (EPM) approach using the Heatflow-Smoker finite element model,
   scenario modelling of three evolutionary steps was carried out between
   the fully-confined carbonate stage through to partly and completely
   unconfined conditions over the western ridge. The numerical simulations
   were used to derive the main evolutionary characteristics of groundwater
   flow and heat transport patterns for the unconfined and confined parts
   of the hydrogeologic system. The initial fully-confined state led to the
   development of thermal convection cells due to the insulating role of
   the low-permeability confining layer, which facilitates buoyancy-driven
   flow by restricting the dissipation of heat. Over geological time, these
   cells were gradually overprinted by gravity-driven flow and thermal
   advection due to uplift of the west ridge. The limited thickness of the
   cover allowed sufficient water infiltration into the system, which led
   to increased cooling. Further uplifting led to a prevalence of
   gravity-driven groundwater flow. The results highlight the critical role
   of confining formations on flow patterns, and their effect on heat
   distribution and dissipation over geological time scales. The results
   have important implications for heat accumulation as well as for the
   development of a deep geothermal energy potential in confined
   carbonates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anarchy principle leading to the seesaw ensemble is studied
   analytically with the usual tools of random matrix theory. The
   probability density function for the seesaw ensemble of N x N matrices

   The decoupling of the light neutrino masses and neutrino mixings implies
   no correlation between the neutrino mass eigenstates and the neutrino

Abstract = {{This paper compares two forms of government support: loan guarantee and
   direct investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs). With loan
   guarantee, government provides financial guarantees to enhance project
   creditworthiness. With direct investment, government invests capital
   directly in the project. In both forms of support, the government
   receives shares proportional to its financial commitment. We find that
   loan guarantees are more effective in reducing project borrowing costs.
   In a perfect information environment, loan guarantee support will yield
   more wealth to the government than a cost equivalent direct investment.
   But, in an informationally asymmetric environment where the government
   knows less about project quality than do private partners, in other
   words the so-called plum problem rather than the familiar lemon problem,
   this implication is mitigated. We show how the portion of shares given
   to the government can be a bargaining tool and can mitigate information
   asymmetry when structuring PPPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   consider the possible future developments in IR NDT. Our analysis shows
   that new developments will take place in various areas such as:
   acquisition, stimulation, processing and obviously an always enlarging
   range of applications with new materials which will have particular

Title = {{Various ways to take into account density change in solid-liquid phase
   change models: Formulation and consequences}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{672-683}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a classification of different methods for accommodating
   volume variations during solid-liquid phase change is presented. The
   impact of each method is analyzed with the help of a scale analysis.
   Neglecting fluid velocity at the interface or allowing fluid to
   enter/exit the domain may result in either local (at the solid-liquid
   interface) or global (within the system) mass imbalance. This can lead
   to significant differences in the transient phase change process itself
   (e.g., 19\% more time and 9\% more energy to completely solidify a given
   mass of water with models for which the total mass of the system is
   conserved). This paper aims at addressing this issue by deriving two new
   models of thermo-mechanical coupling between the PCM and its container.
   The first model is that of a PCM bounded by an elastic wall, whereas the
   second model assumes that a compressible air gap is adjacent to the PCM,
   which allows the PCM to expand more easily. Analytical expressions are
   developed for both models and can be used to predict important
   quantities at equilibrium, such as the position of the solid-liquid
   interface and the pressure rise within the system. Finally, the two
   thermo-mechanical coupling models are implemented numerically with a
   finite volume moving mesh method. Numerical simulations are performed to
   show the limits of the two models. It is observed that volume variations
   during phase change can have significant impacts on the evolution of the
   process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments were
   performed to clarify the interaction mechanisms between hydroxamic acid
   collectors and cerium hydroxides during the flotation of bastnasite and
   monazite minerals. These minerals showed considerable floatability at
   moderately alkaline pH which was related to the adsorption of hydroxamic
   acids on their surfaces as confirmed by vibrational spectroscopic and
   zeta potential measurements. DFT simulations showed that at moderately
   alkaline pH, the interactions between solvated Ce(OH)(2+) and
   Ce(OH)(2)(+) and heptyl-hydroxamic acid (HHA) anions resulted in the
   formation of, respectively, {[} Ce(OH)(HHA)(x)(H2O)(y])(2-x) (x{[}y = ]
   = 1{[}6],2{[}3],3{[}1]) and {[}Ce(OH)(2)(HHA)(x)(H2O)y](1-x) (x{[}y = ]
   = 1{[}5],2{[}1],3{[}0]) complexes. The collector anions were found to
   interact directly through formation of two covalent bonds between their
   two polar-head oxygen atoms and cerium in the hydroxide complexes.
   However, formation of such new bonds resulted in breakage of a few
   covalent/electrostatic bonds between cerium and water molecules
   initially present in the first hydration shell of the rare-earth metal
   cation. Building up in the electric double layer of the semi-soluble
   minerals, these complexes, and by extension, those from other rare-earth
   elements belonging to monazite and bastnasite, are speculated to play a
   role in the interactions between rare-earth minerals and hydroxamic acid
   collectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   pulses. Then, the unique phenomenon of dynamic population trapping
   during the ionization of atoms and molecules in intense laser fields is
   introduced. One of the consequences of population trapping in the highly
   excited states is the neutral dissociation into simple molecular
   fragments which fluoresce. Such fluorescence could be amplified in
   femtosecond laser filamentation in gases. The experimental observations
   of filament-induced fluorescence and lasing in the atmosphere and
   combustion flames are given. Excitation of molecular rotational wave
   packets (molecular alignment) and their relaxation and revival in a gas

Abstract = {{Theoretical stopping power values were inter-compared for the Bichsel,
   Janni, ICRU and Schneider relative stopping power ( RSP) estimation
   models, for a variety of tissues and tissue substitute materials taken
   from the literature. The RSPs of eleven plastic tissue substitutes were
   measured using Bragg peak shift measurements in water in order to
   establish a gold standard of RSP values specific to our centre's proton
   beam characteristics. The theoretical tissue substitute RSP values were
   computed based on literature compositions to assess the four different
   computation approaches. The Bichsel/Janni/ICRU approaches led to mean
   errors in the RSP of -0.1/+0.7/-0.8\%, respectively. Errors when using
   the Schneider approach, with I-values from the Bichsel, Janni and ICRU
   sources, followed the same pattern but were generally larger. Following
   this, the mean elemental ionisation energies were optimized until the
   differences between theoretical RSP values matched measurements. Failing
   to use optimized I-values when applying the Schneider technique to 72
   human tissues could introduce errors in the RSP of up to -1.7/+
   1.1/-0.4\% when using Bichsel/Janni/ICRU I-values, respectively. As
   such, it may be necessary to introduce an additional step in the current
   stoichiometric calibration procedure in which tissue insert RSPs are
   measured in a proton beam. Elemental I-values can then optimized to
   match these measurements, reducing the uncertainty when calculating
   human tissue RSPs.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a series of 29 gas dynamical simulations of disc galaxies,
   barred and unbarred, with various stellar masses, to study the impact of
   the bar on star formation history. Unbarred galaxies evolve very
   smoothly, with a star formation rate (SFR) that varies by at most a
   factor of 3 over a period of 2 Gyr. The evolution of barred galaxies is
   much more irregular, especially at high stellar masses. In these
   galaxies, the bar drives a substantial amount of gas towards the centre,
   resulting in a high SFR, and producing a starburst in the most massive
   galaxies. Most of the gas is converted into stars, and gas exhaustion
   leads to a rapid drop of star formation after the starburst. In massive
   barred galaxies (stellar mass) the large amount of gas funnelled towards
   the centre is completely consumed by the starburst, while in lower mass
   barred galaxies it is only partially consumed. Gas concentration is thus
   higher in lower mass barred galaxies than it is in higher mass ones.
   Even though unbarred galaxies funnelled less gas towards their centre,
   the lower SFR allows this gas to accumulate. At late times, the star
   formation efficiency is higher in barred galaxies than unbarred ones,
   enabling these galaxies to maintain a higher SFR with a smaller gas
   supply. Several properties, such as the global SFR, central SFR, or
   central gas concentration, vary monotonically with time for unbarred
   galaxies, but not for barred galaxies. Therefore one must be careful
   when comparing barred and unbarred galaxies that share one observational
   property, since these galaxies might be at very different stages of
   their respective evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) achieving high timing resolution
   (approximate to 20-50 ps) developed for timecorrelated single-photon
   counting (TCSPC) generally have very small photosensitive areas (25-100
   mu m in diameter). This limits the achievable photon counting rate and
   signal-to-noise ratio and may lead to long counting times. This is
   detrimental in applications requiring several measurements, such as
   fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) microscopy, which requires
   scanning, and time-domain diffuse optical tomography (TD-DOT). We show
   in this work that the use of an immersion lens directly affixed onto the
   photosensitive area of the SPAD helps alleviate this problem by allowing
   more light to be concentrated onto the detector. Following careful
   optical design and simulations, our experimental results show that it is
   actually possible to achieve the predicted theoretical increase in the
   photon counting rate (we achieve a factor of approximate to 4 here).
   This work is of high relevance in high timing resolution TCSPC with
   small photosensitive area detectors and should find widespread interest
   in FLIM and TD-DOT with SPADs. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{414-424}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In previous studies, Ti-Mn alloys showed promising performance for
   biomedical applications, but their elongation required improvement. In
   this study, Mo was added to Ti-Mn alloys to promote mechanical twinning
   and improve their ductility. Four alloys for biomedical applications
   were designed and fabricated by cold crucible levitation melting:
   Ti-5Mn-3Mo (TMM-53), Ti-5Mn-4Mo (TMM-54), Ti-6Mn-3Mo (TMM-63), and
   Ti-6Mn-4Mo (TMM-64). The microstructure, mechanical properties, tensile
   deformation mechanisms, and electrochemical corrosion properties of the
   alloys were evaluated. Their hardness ranges from 336 to 373 HV. Their
   Young's modulus ranges from 89 to 100 GPa. Both hardness and Young's
   modulus tend to decrease with decreasing amount of athermal omega phase,
   which is caused by increasing alloying elements contents. Mo addition
   improves the elongation of TMM-53 and TMM-54 by promoting twinning.
   Conversely, it increases the tensile strength of TMM-63 and TMM-64.
   Particularly, TMM-54 shows an elongation of 34\% with an ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS) of 935 MPa. TMM-63 shows an elongation of 14\%
   and a UTS of 1220 MPa, associated to the formation of
   deformation-induced to phase. Moreover, Mo addition decreases the
   corrosion rate of the Ti-Mn alloys to a level comparable to that of
   commercially-pure Ti. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{304}},
Pages = {{1045-1063}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new theoretical method for smoothing the diffusion
   equation in periodic porous media is presented. That strategy is named
   the method of quasiperiodic fields' because it is based on the postulate
   that the concentration is a quasiperiodic field throughout the porous
   medium. The method proceeds in four steps: (i) a first level averaging
   of the diffusion equation, (ii) the statement of a quasiperiodic
   problem, (iii) the statement of factorized quasiperiodic problems, and
   (iv) the development of a closed form for the averaged diffusion
   equation. A first application of these four steps on the initial
   diffusion equation in a periodic porous medium provides an averaged
   diffusion equation in which the effective diffusion coefficient varies
   periodically at the small scale. A second application of the four steps
   provides a smoothed diffusion equation in which the effective diffusion
   coefficient is constant. The final smoothed diffusion equation is stated
   in terms of the double average of the concentration field. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) is the largest contributor to blurring
   in proton imaging. In this work, we developed a maximum likelihood least
   squares estimator that improves proton radiography's spatial resolution.
   The water equivalent thickness (WET) through projections defined from
   the source to the detector pixels were estimated such that they
   maximizes the likelihood of the energy loss of every proton crossing the
   volume. The length spent in each projection was calculated through the
   optimized cubic spline path estimate. The proton radiographies were
   produced using Geant4 simulations. Three phantoms were studied here: a
   slanted cube in a tank of water to measure 2D spatial resolution, a
   voxelized head phantom for clinical performance evaluation as well as a
   parametric Catphan phantom (CTP528) for 3D spatial resolution. Two
   proton beam configurations were used: a parallel and a conical beam.
   Proton beams of 200 and 330 MeV were simulated to acquire the
   radiography. Spatial resolution is increased from 2.44 lp cm(-1) to 4.53
   lp cm(-1) in the 200 MeV beam and from 3.49 lp cm(-1) to 5.76 lp cm(-1)
   in the 330 MeV beam. Beam configurations do not affect the reconstructed
   spatial resolution as investigated between a radiography acquired with
   the parallel (3.49 lp cm(-1) to 5.76 lp cm(-1)) or conical beam (from
   3.49 lp cm(-1) to 5.56 lp cm(-1)). The improved images were then used as
   input in a photon tomography algorithm. The proton CT reconstruction of
   the Catphan phantom shows high spatial resolution (from 2.79 to 5.55 lp
   cm(-1) for the parallel beam and from 3.03 to 5.15 lp cm(-1) for the
   conical beam) and the reconstruction of the head phantom, although
   qualitative, shows high contrast in the gradient region. The proposed
   formulation of the optimization demonstrates serious potential to
   increase the spatial resolution (up by 65\%) in proton radiography and
   greatly accelerate proton computed tomography reconstruction.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{831}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The mass-metallicity relation shows that the galaxies with the lowest
   mass have the lowest metallicities. As most dwarf galaxies are in group
   environments, interaction effects such as tides could contribute to this
   trend. We perform a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
   simulations of dwarf galaxies in external tidal fields to examine the
   effects of tides on their metallicities and metallicity gradients. In
   our simulated galaxies, gravitational instabilities drive gas inwards
   and produce centralized star formation and a significant metallicity
   gradient. Strong tides can contribute to these instabilities, but their
   primary effect is to strip the outer low-metallicity gas, producing a
   truncated gas disk with a large metallicity. This suggests that the
   effect of tides on the mass-metallicity relation is to move dwarf
   galaxies to higher metallicities.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing companies are under pressure from consumers and
   legislation to reduce their environmental impacts. In some sectors where
   competition is particularly fierce, the ability to offer a product with
   a lighter environmental impact than the competition can be useful in
   significantly increasing market share. The forest industry, which
   harvests and processes wood, a renewable resource, also aims at being
   part of this trend towards transparency. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is
   often used to quantify the environmental footprint of harvested wood
   products (HWP). Based on a primary data inventory of four years of
   activity, this study presents an LCA of the portfolio of an innovative
   forest products manufacturer. The functional unit of that assessment is
   a cubic meter. A sensitive analysis on an economic allocation was also
   conducted. Because of loops in the studied system and flow conservation
   constraint, results of the portfolio LCA was verified using an
   organizational footprint assessment. From the material flow and the
   half-life of products, a bottom-up accounting method is suggested for
   integrating HWP in national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium looping process, on the basis of the reversible reaction between
   CaO and CO2, is a promising technology for capture of CO2 from different
   gas streams. The performance of CO2 sorbents could be easily influenced
   by the gas stream composition. As the exhaust gas stream generally
   contains a considerable amount of steam, a good understanding of its
   side effects on the performance of CaO-based sorbents is essential.
   However, there is not consensus on the mechanism with which the presence
   of steam during. carbonation influences the CO2 capture performance and
   contradictory results have been reported regarding the effect of steam
   addition during calcination. This work aims to investigate the effect of
   steam addition during either carbonation or calcination on the
   reactivity of a home-made synthetic CaO sorbent containing 78 wt\% CaO
   and 22 wt\% Ca9Al6O18. Various concentrations of steam up to 9.5 vol\%
   were provided during either carbonation or calcination for 15
   carbonation-calcination cycles (carbonation: 650 or 550 degrees C;
   calcination: 800 degrees C). The morphology changes of the sorbent after
   cyclic carbonation-calcination experiments were studied in detail at
   different operating conditions. It was concluded that the sorbent
   reactivity was significantly increased for all concentrations of steam
   injected during carbonation step, due to the accelerated solid-state
   diffusion and steam catalysis. In case of steam addition during
   calcination, the carbonation performance was affected negatively or
   positively depending on the concentration of steam in the gas stream.
   For 2.3 vol\% steam injection, the sorbent reactivity was worsened,
   while the presence of 9.5 vol\% steam increased the CO2 capture capacity
   during 9 initial cycles. Such behavior was attributed to the intensified
   material sintering in the presence of steam during calcination step,
   which results in the formation of large pores and the decrease of
   specific surface area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Does prostate volume has an impact on biochemical failure in patients

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare biochemical failure free survival (BFFS) of patients
   with small and large prostate glands treated with external beam
   radiation therapy (EBRT) and HDR (high dose rate) brachytherapy boost.
   Materials and methods: Between 2002 and 2012, 548 patients were treated
   with EBRT followed by HDR boost. The effect of covariates and prostate
   volume on biochemical failure was analyzed by survival analysis and Cox
   regression model.
   Results: The median follow-up and age were not different between the two
   groups. The mean prostate gland volume at the time of CT planning was
   48.1 and 76.0 cc in small (<60 cc) and large (>= 60 cc) prostate volume,
   respectively (p < 0.001). When PSA bounces were excluded, there was no
   significant difference between the two groups with a 5-years BFFS of
   95.8\% vs 92.3\%, p = 0.094. There were no significant differences
   between the two groups for urinary symptoms (IPSS) as well as acute and
   late GI toxicities.
   Conclusions: This study showed that a HDR brachytherapy boost in large
   prostate gland cases is feasible at the price of increased PSA bounces.
   When the benign bounces are excluded, there is no significant difference
   between the two groups for tumor control and toxicity. Therefore, in our
   experience, there is no rational precluding the use of HDR boost in
   patients with a prostate size of 60 cc or more so long as an adequate
   dosimetry is achievable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of image-guided
   high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost to the dominant intraprostatic
   lesion (DIL) using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
   including spectroscopy (MRI/magnetic resonance spectroscopy {[}MRS]).
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 2009 and March 2011, 20 patients
   with intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent multiparametric MRI/MRS
   protocol before treatment. All patients were treated with an external
   beam radiotherapy dose of 40 Gy, combined with an HDR brachytherapy
   boost of 15 Gy. Concurrently, the DIL received a boost of 18 Gy. Missing
   data during followup were handled with multiple imputations.
   RESULTS: The median followup was 62 months (range, 23-71 months). Six
   patients (31\%) were classified as favorable intermediate risk and 13
   patients (69\%) as unfavorable intermediate risk. One patient
   experienced a prostate-specific antigen biochemical failure, and the
   5-year biochemical failure-free survival rate was of 94.7\%. The mean
   International Prostate Symptom Score rose from 7, with respect to
   baseline, to 10.42 1 month after treatment, and rapidly decreased to
   6.97 after 3 months. Grade 1, 2, and 3 acute genitourinary toxicities
   were reported in 13 (68\%), 3 (16\%), and 1 (5\%) patients,
   respectively. Grade 1 and 2 late genitourinary toxicities were reported
   in 9 (53\%) and 3 (18\%) patients, respectively. Only grade 1 acute and
   late gastrointestinal toxicities were reported in 4 (21\%) and 3 (18\%)
   patients, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Delivering an HDR brachytherapy boost to the DIL using
   image-guided multi parametric MRI/MRS is feasible with good outcomes for
   biochemical control, acute and late toxicities, and dosimetric
   constraints for critical organs. (C) 2016 American Brachytherapy

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Straight, low-aspect ratio micro flow cells are used to support biofilm
   attachment and preferential accumulation at the short side-wall, which
   progressively reduces the effective channel width. The biofilm shifts
   downstream at measurable velocities under the imposed force from the
   constant laminar co-flowing nutrient stream. The dynamic behaviour of
   the biofilm viscosity is modeled semi-analytically, based on
   experimental measurements of biofilm dimensions and velocity as inputs.
   The technique advances the study of biofilm mechanical properties by
   strongly limiting biases related to non-Newtonian biofilm properties
   (e.g., shear dependent viscosity) with excellent time resolution. To
   demonstrate the proof of principle, young Pseudomonas sp. biofilms were
   analyzed under different nutrient concentrations and constant micro-flow
   conditions. The striking results show that large initial differences in
   biofilm viscosities grown under different nutrient concentrations become
   nearly identical in less than one day, followed by a continuous
   thickening process. The technique verifies that in 50 h from inoculation
   to early maturation stages, biofilm viscosity could grow by over 2
   orders of magnitude. The approach opens the way for detailed studies of
   mechanical properties under a wide variety of physiochemical conditions,
   such as ionic strength, temperature, and shear stress. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{In this study, a series of core-shell structured spheriform CO2 sorbents
   were synthesized by using CaO-based pellets as cores and different
   mesoporous metal oxides (e.g. alumina, ceria, and yttrium-stabilized
   zirconia) as shells through a repeated wet impregnation coating process.
   Cyclic CO2 capture performance of the obtained sorbents was investigated
   using a thermogravimetric analyzer. Among all the core/shell sorbents
   under study, the pellets coated with a layer of alumina exhibit the best
   performance in the retention of CO2 uptake over 20 cycles with the
   lowest activity loss of only 30.4\%, attributed to the existence of the
   thermal stable porous alumina shell which prevents the sintering and the
   aggregation of the CaO grains. Moreover, the attrition study using an
   air-jet apparatus and a standard test method reveals that such sorbents
   exhibit enhanced attrition resistance due to the protection of the
   porous shell providing them with a great potential for application in
   fluidized bed conditions.}},

Title = {{Age constraints and geochemical evolution of the Neoarchean
   mafic-ultramafic Wabassi Intrusive Complex in the Miminiska-Fort Hope
   greenstone belt, Superior Province, Canada}},
Journal = {{PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{286}},
Pages = {{101-125}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ca. 2.75-2.71 Ga Miminiska-Fort Hope greenstone belt (MFHGB) of the
   eastern Uchi domain of the Superior Province (northern Ontario) contains
   numerous mafic and ultramafic intrusions hosting Ni-Cu-(PGE)
   occurrences. The most significant, the mafic-ultramafic Wabassi
   Intrusive Complex and the nearby mafic Oxtoby Lake intrusion, formed
   between 2728 and 2727 Ma and at ca. 2717 Ma, respectively. The Max,
   Wabassi Main, and Wabassi South parts of the Wabassi Intrusive Complex
   and the Oxtoby Lake intrusion have been studied to establish their
   petrogenesis and metallogenesis, and to compare them to the highly
   prospective 2734 Ma mafic-ultramafic intrusions in the McFaulds Lake
   greenstone belt similar to 120 km to the north that host world-class
   Cr-(PGE), significant Ni-Cu-(PGE), and potentially significant Fe-Ti-V
   mineralization.
   The ca. 2728 Ma ultramafic-dominated Max intrusion is relatively
   homogeneous in composition, comprising mainly harzburgite, lherzolite,
   and wherlite with minor olivine orthopyroxenite, orthopyroxenite,
   websterite, and mesocratic gabbroic rocks. It also contains disseminated
   to patchy net-textured Fe-NiCu-(PGE) sulfides. In contrast, the ca. 2727
   Ma Wabassi Main intrusion is a layered mafic-dominated intrusion that
   consists of: (1) a basal zone containing leucocratic to mesocratic
   olivine gabbronorite and olivine norite, troctolite, Iherzolite, and
   harzburgite with high Cr contents, olivine with Mg\#(78-72),
   orthopyroxene with Mg\#(84-67), clinopyroxene with Mg\#(95-91), and
   plagioclase with An(96-37), (2) a lower zone containing mesocratic
   olivine gabbronorite-gabbro-norite and up to 10\% Fe-Ti oxides, olivine
   with Mg\#(64-19), orthopyroxene with Mg\#(67-58), clinopyroxene with
   Mg\#(80-56), and plagioclase with An(79-46), (3) a middle zone
   containing leuco- to mesocratic gabbronorite with up to 8\% Fe-Ti
   oxides, orthopyroxene with Mg\#(57-56), clinopyroxene with Mg\#(73-66),
   and plagioclase with An(71-63), and (4) an upper zone containing
   mesocratic gabbronorite, gabbro, and ferrogabbroic rocks with up to 50\%
   Fe-Ti oxides, up to 8\% apatite, low Cr and high P contents,
   orthopyroxene with Mg\#(44), clinopyroxene with Mg\#(60), and
   plagioclase with An(63-52). The ultramafic-dominated Wabassi South
   intrusion is homogeneous in composition and is composed of peridotite.
   All three intrusions are enriched in Th > LREE > MREE relative to Nb-Ta
   and Ti, suggesting that they incorporated significant amounts of upper
   crustal material. This, together with their overlapping petrographic,
   geochemical, and mineralogical characteristics, suggests that they are
   co-genetic. Their formation appears to have begun with the accumulation
   of olivine, pyroxene, and minor chromite from a contaminated high-Mg
   basaltic parental magma (similar to 12\% MgO) in the Max and Wabassi
   South magmatic conduits. Later, this magma crystallized cumulates in the
   Wabassi Main magma chamber with the following order of appearance of
   cumulus phases: olivine + chromite -> orthopyroxenei/clinopyroxene
   plagioclase -> magnetite + ilmenite -> apatite. The parental magma
   composition is more evolved than magmas responsible for the generation
   of the Cr-(PGE) and Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralization in the McFaulds Lake
   greenstone belt, but they may be more contaminated equivalents. The ca.
   2717 Ma mafic Oxtoby Lake intrusion is more mesocratic with
   significantly different trace element signatures, suggesting that it is
   unrelated or only indirectly related to the Wabassi Intrusive Complex.
   The Max, Wabassi Main, Wabassi South, and Oxtoby Lake intrusions are
   coeval with different volcanic assemblages of the MFHGB. Together with
   the mafic-ultramafic intrusions of the McFaulds Lake greenstone belt,
   they probably represent the remnants of an Archean large igneous complex
   that was emplaced within the northern Superior Province between ca. 2.88
   and 2.70 Ga. Among these four intrusions, Max may be the most
   prospective for Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralization. The high abundance of
   primitive ultramafic rocks suggests that it was an open, dynamic system
   that accumulated olivine and pyroxene, and the trace element signature
   is consistent with incorporation of significant amounts of upper crustal
   material, permissive to the formation of Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralization.

Abstract = {{The Joseph-Samson Dam is located on the St. Charles River near the
   confluence with the St. Lawrence River in the Lower Town of Quebec City.
   The dam creates a 3.7 km long reservoir, with a very popular linear park
   running alongside. This water body has esthetic value and allows
   recreational boating. With its anti-tidal gates, the dam protects from
   flooding during very high spring tides in the St. Lawrence. However, the
   dam has completely changed the formerly natural estuary into a channel
   with sedimentation formed from the organic and inorganic sediment influx
   coming from the semi-urban, urban and forest watershed. Highly
   productive fish runs up the St. Charles are a thing of the past and
   significant reduction in dissolved oxygen is now often observed.
   Furthermore, the dam may actually increase the risk of flooding in the
   Lower Town under high flows. One-dimensional simulations (HEC-RAS) were
   performed to assess the dam's impact on flood risks for different bottom
   gate settings and two-dimensional simulations (RIVER 2D) were performed
   to assess the dam's impact on river velocities and sedimentation
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Tinplate cans were used to study if electro-activated brine solution
   (EAS) is more corrosive than conventional one by ICP analysis. The
   results showed different effects of EAS on cans, alone or filled with

   with the cans. The concentrations of Zn, Fe, and Cu in the solution were
   0.028, 28.81, and 0.022 ppm, respectively. No Sn migration was observed
   in this case. When neutral or acidic chlorine-free EAS was used, no
   significant difference was observed in comparison with the corrosivity
   of standard NaCl brine. Alkaline EAS with pH>10 and negative E (<=-966
   mV) did not affect Zn, Fe, and Cu migration. However, it affected tin
   migration. Nevertheless, it is important to mention that even if some
   corrosion was observed, it was in the limit of the permitted level of

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the Cr concentrations in surface water,
   suspended particles, and bottom sediments exposed to tannery effluent
   releases in the Candeias River. Cr concentrations were compared in
   relation to environmental thresholds imposed by United States
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Brazilian Environmental
   Council (CONAMA), and the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) was calculated in
   bottom sediment. Samples were collected in flood and dry seasons. Cr
   extraction was done by an acid extraction and quantified by flame atomic
   absorption spectrometry. Most samples were found to be below the
   environmental thresholds imposed by CONAMA and USEPA, except in the one
   from the discharge zone sampled during the dry season, showing values
   1.5 and 6.1 higher than CONAMA in water and bottom sediment,
   respectively. Cr concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in
   suspended particles during dry season than flood season. Surface water
   and bottom sediment did not show significant differences between the
   seasons. The Igeo revealed an enrichment of Cr in bottom sediments after
   discharge zone, indicating that the effluent may be contributing to
   metal accumulation in the sediment. Apparently, the Candeias River shows
   a wash behavior on the river bottom, leaching the accumulated metal
   deposited on the riverbed to other areas during the flood pulses, which
   decreases Cr concentration in the discharge zone during dry seasons.
   Thus, this behavior can promote Cr dispersion to unpolluted areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is optimized
   by means of numerical simulations. The systems of interest are the
   subcritical and transcritical thermodynamic cycles. Optimizations are
   performed with the objective of determining the design that maximizes
   the specific power output. The design variables include the operating
   parameters (pressures, mass flow rates), and the best working fluid is
   determined by comparing the performance of 36 refrigerants. Optimization
   runs are performed for a wide range of geofluid temperatures (from 80 to
   180 degrees C), and for a wide range of condenser temperature (from 0.1
   to 50 degrees C). The results are summarized in charts that may be used
   as efficient tools for designing optimal geothermal power plants.
   Finally, an approximate analysis allowed to develop a new correlation
   for predicting the maximal specific power output of an ORC. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Adsorptive membranes have many applications in removal of contaminants,
   such as heavy metals and organic contaminants from water. Recently,
   increasing concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds,
   especially antibiotics, such as chlortetracycline in water and
   wastewater sources has raised concerns about their potentially adverse
   impacts on environment and human health. In this study, a series of
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/activated biochar nanofibrous membranes (NFMs)
   with different loadings of biochar (0-2\%, w/w) were fabricated using
   electrospinning. The morphology and structure of fabricated membranes
   was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform
   infrared and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that at
   1.5\% of biochar loading, the surface area reached the maximum value of
   12.4 m(2)/g and beyond this loading value, agglomeration of particles
   inhibited fine interaction with nanofibrous matrix. Also, the adsorption
   tests using chlortetracycline showed that, under environmentally
   relevant concentrations, the fabricated adsorptive NFMs had a potential
   for removal of these types of emerging contaminants from water and
   wastewaters.}},

Title = {{Effects of water soluble ions on interfacial tension (IFT) between oil
   and brine in smart and carbonated smart water injection process in oil

Abstract = {{Water injection is one of the most popular oil recovery methods in oil
   industry. Investigations have been carried out to find a more effective
   oil recovery fluid since the first practices of water injection and the
   idea of low-salinity water or `smart water' was subsequently introduced.
   The active ions in a smart water solution can significantly decrease the
   interfacial tension between oil and water in the reservoir; it also has
   the ability to change the reservoir rock wettability that in return can
   increase the recovery factor. Also, the carbonated brine injection
   causes the trapped oil to lose viscosity and increase its mobility.
   The current study is about smart water and carbonated smart water
   injection and sets out to investigate the effects of soluble ions on
   reducing the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil land water and then
   increasing the oil recovery factor. To achieve this purpose, eleven
   slats were dissolved in both formation and distilled water. The IFT was
   then measured by pendant drop method and the results are discussed.
   Furthermore, the effects of temperature and pressure on IFT are also
   investigated.
   We have obtained the optimum salt and concentration of salt for reducing
   the IFT and, on the other hand, we have investigated the effects of
   dissolved CO2 in ionic solution on IFT at different conditions. Finally,
   we have characterized the optimum conditions for the effects of water
   soluble ions on IFT between oil and brine in smart and carbonated smart
   water injection in a typical oil reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{It is of great importance to know the phase behavior of systems
   containing water and hydrocarbon in petroleum industry because reservoir
   fluids are usually saturated with water at pressure.and temperature
   condition of reservoir. There are various correlation/charts and
   thermodynamic models for prediction of water content of natural gases.
   The existing approaches usually do not present accurate predictions at
   low temperature conditions. In addition, since during the development of
   these correlations, there were not reported experimental data dealing
   with phase equilibrium in system containing water and hydrocarbons at
   low temperature conditions, these correlations and models need to be
   further verified. Present study aims to develop a method based on radial
   basis function networks optimized by genetic algorithm, namely GA-RBF
   for estimation of water content of natural gases. The model was proposed
   based on reported experimental data. Most of utilized experimental data
   were at low temperature conditions. The performance of the proposed
   model in prediction of experimental data was compared with literature

Abstract = {{This paper concerns a novel computer-based approach namely Least Square
   version of Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) algorithm to
   estimate/represent hydrate forming/dissociating conditions of various
   gases in the presence of pure water or aqueous solutions of salt(s)
   and/or alcohol(s). To this end, several models have been presented to
   predict the hydrate dissociating temperature (HDT) of C-1, C-2, C-3,
   i-C-4, CO2, H2S, N-2, and natural gas mixtures in pure water or additive
   containing solutions. For modeling purpose, an extensive database
   comprising more than 3900 experimental data have been gathered from the
   literate from 1940 to 2013. The collected databank covers wide range of
   experimental conditions at solid/liquid/vapor or solid/ice/vapor
   equilibrium of distinct hydrate systems. All the proposed models
   reproduce the targets with R-2 of greater than 0.97. The predictions of
   the developed LSSVM models for hydrate systems of C-1, C-2, C-3, i-C-4,

Abstract = {{The fusion of several coherent 800 nm femtosecond filaments is induced
   experimentally and numerically by transmitting a beam through a mask
   with circular apertures followed by the focusing lens. The far-field
   image of the four-filament fusion region reveals bright on-axis maximum
   and differs drastically from the diffraction pattern of a low energy
   beam propagating through the mask in the linear regime. In 3D+time
   numerical simulations with the carrier wave resolved we show a
   factor-of-5 saturable growth in the peak plasma density with successive
   increase in the number of mask openings. An overall spectral blueshift
   of the fundamental and the third harmonics follows the plasma density
   increase. The simulated far-field on-axis emission agrees with the
   experiment and serves as the indication of nonlinear interaction in the
   fusion region.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics of a periodically operated packed bed subjected to
   column oscillations and obliquity was studied. Electrical capacitance
   tomography (ECT) and capacitance wire mesh sensors were employed to
   measure the local instantaneous liquid saturation in stationary slanted
   and moving packed beds, respectively. A swell simulator with
   six-degree-of-freedom motions was applied to emulate the behavior of
   floating packed beds. The results revealed that column inclination from
   the vertical position considerably decayed liquid waves excited by
   different cyclic operation strategies. However, ON-OFF liquid and
   gas/liquid alternating cyclic operations showed an attempt to conserve
   wave identity in the slanted bed and to decrease phase maldistribution
   resulting from bed inclination. It was also found that symmetric and
   non-symmetric split ratios of ON-OFF liquid cyclic mode were able to
   noticeably decrease fluid maldistribution in the oscillating packed bed.
   This study opens up possible prospects for process intensification of
   floating packed bed reactors and contactors. (c) 2016 American Institute

Abstract = {{The efficiency of the ultrafiltration process during skim milk
   concentration was studied using both dynamic and constant (465 or 672
   kPa) transmembrane pressure experiments at refrigerated temperature (10
   degrees C) and high temperature (50 degrees C). The pilot-scale module
   was equipped with a 10-kDa polyethersulfone spiral-wound membrane
   element with a surface area of 2.04 m(2). Permeation flux,
   resistance-in-series model, mineral and protein rejection, and energy
   consumption were studied as a function of temperature and transmembrane
   pressure applied. Higher permeation flux values were systematically
   obtained at 50 degrees C. Also, a significant temperature effect was
   found for calcium rejection, which was lower at 10 degrees C compared
   with 50 degrees C. Total hydraulic resistance and reversible fouling
   resistance were higher at 50 degrees C than at 10 degrees C. No change
   in protein rejection was observed, depending on the operating mode
   studied. Permeation flux, which was higher at 50 degrees C, had lower
   pumping energy consumption compared with ultrafiltration at the colder
   temperature. Also, the low ultrafiltration temperature required a higher
   total energy consumption to reach the 3.6x retentate compared with
   ultrafiltration at 50 degrees C. Overall, our study shows that the
   operating parameters and temperature can be optimized using an energy
   efficiency ratio.}},

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{80-90}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Cartesian stiffness analysis of mechanisms and robotic manipulators
   is often performed using Jacobian-based stiffness analysis methods. In
   general it is necessary to consider the effect of loading, which
   introduces a Jacobian-derivative term. However, early examples of
   stiffness analyses of parallel manipulators in which the effect of
   loading was considered resulted in asymmetric stiffness matrices, which
   go against the definition of stiffness. By replicating those first
   analyses using an alternative formulation of the stiffness analysis,
   this paper finds that the earlier observed asymmetry can be explained as
   a modeling inconsistency. If that inconsistency is corrected, symmetric
   matrices are obtained, which supports the notion that the
   Jacobian-derivative term is an integral part of the stiffness analysis
   of parallel manipulators and mechanisms. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{199-212}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a synthesis approach for the design of mechanically
   safe robots based on the concept of spatial isotropic force module
   (SIFM). In this concept, a number of torque limiters are included in the
   structure of the robot in order to limit the feasible forces at the
   end-effector. SIFMs are proposed in order to ensure that the feasible
   force space at the end-effector of the robot remains well conditioned
   for any configuration of the robot, thereby alleviating the
   configuration dependent transformation between articular torques and
   Cartesian forces. In this paper, possible architectures of SIFMs are
   proposed and the conditions required to ensure isotropy of the forces at
   the end-effector are derived. Then, a three-degree-of-freedom (3-dof)
   spatial robot including a SIFM is designed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the concept, and the forces that can be applied by the
   robot along its links are also analyzed as well as the power of
   potential collisions. Finally, a prototype of a SIFM is built, which is
   rather compact since the designed torque limiters do not have to be
   co-located with an actuated joint. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Actual thermal response tests, used to estimate the subsurface thermal

   been developed in which heating cable sections inject heat in a
   borehole. Three temperature probes are strategically located at the
   borehole edge. This paper applies inverse heat transfer strategies to
   this thermal response test concept in order to identify the ground
   thermal conductivity, as well as the groundwater flow velocity and its
   direction. The suggested thermal response test and parameters estimation
   methodology are detailed. The influence of initial guessed values for
   the three unknown parameters was also studied. The work presented in
   this paper was carried out by numerical simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   The input parameters of the model are temperature, CO2 partial pressure,

   developed model are 612 and 109 data, respectively. In order to benefit
   LSSVM from Kernel learning, we compared three kernel functions to select
   the most efficient one. Furthermore, Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA)

Title = {{Substrate effect of coke particles on the structure and reactivity of
   coke/pitch mixtures in carbon anodes}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{123-131}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Carbon anodes, used in the Hall-Heroult electrolysis process, are
   subject to an overconsumption caused by CO2 attack. Several attempts
   have been made to understand the mechanism of CO2 gasification based on
   the study of the reactivity of anode cores or anode constituents (coke,
   pitch and binder matrix). In this study, the specific surface area and
   the pore volume of carbon anode and of three coke/pitch mixtures were
   measured to understand properly the CO2 reactivity. Anode sample and
   three recipes of coke/pitch mixtures (100/0; 95/5 and 85/15, w/w) with a
   particle size of -1.4 + 1.0 mm were prepared. Argon adsorption and
   mercury infiltration were used to characterize the pore size
   distribution of the four samples. The specific surface area of anode and
   partially covered coke materials (95/5) were superior to that of the
   uncovered and totally covered particles (12 m(2)/g vs. 0.5 m(2)/g).
   Although the pore volume of the uncovered coke was high (0.45 cm(3)/g),
   the pore volume of totally covered coke was low (0.35 cm(3)/g). The pore
   volume of anode and partially covered coke were similar (0.4 cm(3)/g). A
   TG instrument was used to determine the apparent reaction rates of the
   four samples at 960 degrees C under CO2 atmosphere. It was remarked that
   the apparent reaction rate of coke/pitch mixtures was reduced with
   increasing the pitch content. The anode had an apparent reaction rate
   above that of totally covered particles but below the partially covered
   particles. Based on the apparent reaction rate and the pore analysis,
   the structure of an anode can be considered as a mixture of coke
   particles with different levels of pitch penetration. The pitch
   distribution in an anode paste could prevent the preferential
   gasification of some particles, thus possibly reducing dusting
   phenomenon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present a dynamic model of silicon Bragg grating modulators that
   takes into account the distributed feedback of the grating coupled to
   depletion-based phase-shifters. We further consider the on-chip
   degradation of the radio-frequency excitation. This dynamic model allows
   the optimization of the grating design parameters such as its strength
   and length. We apply the proposed model to uniform Bragg grating
   modulators and show that grating modulators operated in reflection have
   larger 3 dB E/O bandwidth (BW), while gratings operated in transmission
   have larger optical modulation amplitude. As a result, higher speed
   on-off keying signal will be obtained using the reflection port while
   higher quality multi-level pulse amplitude modulation signal should be
   obtained in transmission, albeit at a lower baud rate. We also show that
   longer gratings have larger 3 dB modulation BW but noisier responses.
   Finally, we find that optical propagation losses results in either
   higher driving voltage or reduced modulation BW. The model is
   experimentally validated and we examine how RF propagation losses also
   limit the E/O BW.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{The Stiffness Damage Test (SDT) is an interesting tool for assessing
   damage in concrete affected by ASR. The use of a fixed loading level for
   stiffness damage testing, as previously suggested in the literature,
   limits its ability to reliably appraise the distress level of concrete
   samples, especially when different concrete strengths and aggregate
   types are used. Moreover, the test input and output parameters should be
   properly interpreted so that the SDT becomes a powerful diagnostic
   procedure. This paper presents an evaluation of the practical use of the
   SDT in engineering purposes. Results show that the use of output
   indices, i.e. SDI and PDI, instead of absolute output values, makes the
   procedure more diagnostic (i.e. not equal distress degrees can be easier
   distinguished) and less influenced by practical assumptions (e.g. choice
   of the loading level for stiffness damage testing). Based on the prior
   results, a step-by-step standard test procedure is proposed aiming to
   minimize the test variability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{437}},
Pages = {{7-18}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Quartz and tourmaline from the Val-d'Or, Quebec (Canada) orogenic gold
   vein field have oxygen isotope fractionation indicating equilibrium over
   a range of temperature (280-492 degrees C). The range of delta O-18
   values is from 9.2 to 13.8\%, and from 6.5 to 9.5\%, for quartz and
   tourmaline, respectively. The hydrogen isotope composition of tourmaline
   has a range from -63 to -13\%. The initial Sr isotope composition
   (Sr-87/Sr-86((i))) of vein tourmaline at the time of mineralization
   ranged from 0.700710 to 0.702246. Vein carbonates have a similar range
   in Sr isotope composition, form 0.701243 to 0.703641. A series of
   samples from the Sigma deposit displays no systematic variation with
   depth for delta O-18 values of quartz or tourmaline, delta D values of
   tourmaline, temperature of equilibrium, or Sr-87/Sr-86((i)). The
   Sr-87/Sr-86((i)) of local komatiite, basalt, andesite, grauwacke and
   granodiorite, at 2.7 Ga, ranged from 0.681971 to 0.7128706. Country
   rocks with low Sr-87/Sr-86((i)) are likely a consequence of hydrothermal
   resetting of the Rb/Sr system in these samples.
   Covariation of the calculated equilibrium delta D-H2O and delta
   O-18(H2O) with quartz-tourmaline equilibrium temperatures indicates
   mixing between a low-delta O-18 (<1.5\%), high delta D (>-10\%), low
   temperature (<280 degrees C) upper crustal fluid, and a high-delta O-18
   (>9.3\%), low dD (<-40\%), high temperature (>490 degrees C) deep-seated
   metamorphic fluid. At temperatures below the critical point for
   low-salinity hydrothermal fluids, delta D-H2O are affected by
   liquid-vapour phase separation, yielding the high delta D values
   characteristic of the upper crustal fluid. A broad covariation between
   delta O-18(H2O) and the Sr-87/Sr-86((i)) of tourmaline is consistent
   with mixing of two fluids from two reservoirs with different Sr
   concentrations and delta O-18(H2O) values. The low Sr-87/Sr-86((i))
   (<0.7007) inferred for the deep-seated metamorphic fluid end-member is
   consistent with Archean prograde metamorphic dewatering of typical
   volcanic and sedimentary country rocks of the Val-d'Or area. The higher
   Sr-87/Sr-86((i)) (>0.7022) of the upper crustal fluid end-member most
   likely resulted from a long history of water-rock exchange between
   Archean seawater and carbonate and radiogenic plutonic rocks of the
   Abitibi sub-province. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) has emerged as
   a new green chemistry method to produce different types of nanoparticles
   (NPs). It does not require the use of reducing or stabilizing agents,
   therefore enabling the synthesis of NPs with highly-pure surfaces. In
   this study, pure Au NPs were produced by PLAL in aqueous solutions,
   sterically stabilized using minimal PEG excess, and functionalized with
   manganese chelates to produce a dual CT/MRI contrast agent. The small
   hydrodynamic size (36.5 nm), low polydispersity (0.2) and colloidal
   stability of Au NPs@PEG-Mn2+ were demonstrated by DLS. The particles
   were further characterized by TEM, XPS, FTIR and H-1 NMR to confirm the
   purity of the Au surfaces (i.e. free from the common residual chemicals
   found after NP synthesis) and the presence of the different surface
   molecules. The potential of these particles as contrast agents for
   CT/MR! was assessed in vivo (e.g. chicken embryo). Au NPs@PEG-Mn2+ also
   demonstrated strong blood retention for at least 90 minutes following
   intravenous injection in mouse models. The promising performance of
   PEGylated PLAL-synthesized Au NPs containing manganese chelates could
   open new possibilities for the production of purer dual imaging contrast
   agents based on Au colloids.}},

Abstract = {{While scintillation dosimetry has been around for decades, the need for
   a dosimeter tailored to the reality of modern radiation therapy-in
   particular a real-time, water-equivalent, energy-independent dosimeter
   with high spatial resolution-has generated renewed interest in
   scintillators over the last 10 years. With the advent of at least one
   commercial plastic scintillation dosimeter and the ever-growing
   scientific literature on this subject, this topical review is intended
   to provide the medical physics community with a wide overview of
   scintillation physics, related optical concepts, and applications of
   plastic scintillation dosimetry.}},

Title = {{Diversity of antibiotic-resistance genes in Canadian isolates of
   Aeromonas salmonicida subsp salmonicida: dominance of pSN254b and
   discovery of pAsa8}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{The bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is a common
   pathogen in fish farms worldwide. Since the antibiotic resistance of
   this bacterial species is on the increase, it is important to have a
   broader view on this issue. In the present study, we tested the presence
   of known plasmids conferring multi-drug resistance as well as antibiotic
   resistance genes by a PCR approach in 100 Canadian A. salmonicida subsp.
   salmonicida isolates. Our study highlighted the dominance of the
   conjugative pSN254b plasmid, which confers multi-drug resistance. We
   also identified a new multi-drug plasmid named pAsa8, which has been
   characterized by a combination of sequencing technologies (Illumina and
   Oxford nanopore). This new plasmid harbors a complex class 1 integron
   similar to the one of the Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) found in
   Salmonella enterica and Proteus mirabilis. Consequently, in addition to
   providing an update on the A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida isolates
   that are resistant to antibiotics, our data suggest that this bacterium
   is potentially an important reservoir of drug resistance genes and
   should consequently be monitored more extensively. In addition, we
   describe a screening method that has the potential to become a
   diagnostic tool that is complementary to other methods currently in use.}},

Title = {{CO2-rich atmosphere strongly affects the degradation of Fe-21Mn-1C for
   biodegradable metallic implants}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{For decades, biomaterials used as implants saved the life or improved
   its quality for millions around the globe. Biodegradable metals
   constitute a new class of biomaterials especially designed for temporary
   implants. Fe-based biodegradable metals are an important sub-class, but
   their development is limited by their tendency to degrade faster in
   vitro than in vivo. Blood is known to contain a high CO2 concentration.
   This is susceptible to form various carbonates with different stability,
   thus affecting and potentially decrease the material degradation rate.
   Therefore, this work investigates the influence of CO2 on the static
   degradation of Fe-21Mn-1C alloy in modified Hanks' solution. Results
   clearly evidenced that the presence of CO2 led to different degradation
   patterns and rates. Indeed, in 5\% CO2 atmosphere, the degradation layer
   exhibited uniform, compact and dense manganese carbonate crystals,
   whereas, under ambient atmosphere, amorphous iron phosphorous compounds
   were dominant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{402-410}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen has been valued as an economical alternative injection gas for
   gas-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. Minimum miscibility
   pressure (MMP) is the most important parameter to successfully design
   N-2 flooding. In this communication, a data bank covering wide ranges of
   thermodynamic and compositional conditions was gathered from open
   literature. Afterward, a rigorous approach, namely least square support
   vector machine (LSSVM) optimized with coupled simulated annealing (CSA)
   was proposed to develop a reliable and robust model for the prediction
   of MMP of pure/impure N-2-crude oil. The results of this study showed
   that the proposed model is more reliable and accurate than the
   preexisting models in a wider range of thermodynamic and process
   conditions. The proposed model predicts the total dataset (84 MMP data
   points of pure N-2, nitrogen mixture streams and lean gases) with an
   average absolute relative error of 5.17\%. Finally, by employing the
   relevancy factor, it was found that the intermediate components of crude
   oil have the most significant impact on the nitrogen MMP estimation and
   Leverage approach shows that only two data points (2.4\%) are outside
   the applicability domain of the model proving the reliability of the
   developed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To study the electro-activation of potassium acetate, potassium
   citrate and calcium lactate aqueous solutions and to evaluate their
   antimicrobial effect against E. coli O157:H7 at ambient temperature.
   Methods and results: Potassium acetate, potassium citrate and calcium
   lactate aqueous solutions were electrically excited in the anodic
   compartment of a four sectional electro-activation reactor. Different
   properties of the electro-activated solutions were measured such as:
   solutions acidity (pH and titratable), Redox potential and vibrational
   properties by Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity
   of these solutions was evaluated against E. coli O157:H7. The results
   showed a pH decrease from 7.07 +/- 0.08, 7.53 +/- 0.12 and 6.18 +/- 0.1
   down to 2.82 +/- 0.1, 2.13 +/- 0.09 and 2.26 +/- 0.15, after 180 min of
   electro-activation of potassium acetate, potassium citrate and calcium
   lactate solution, respectively. These solutions were characterized by
   high oxidative ORP of + 1076 +/- 12, + 958 +/- 11 and + 820 +/- 14 mV,
   respectively. Raman scattering analysis of anolytes showed stretching
   vibrations of the hydrogen bonds with the major changes within the
   region of 3410-3430 cm(-1). These solutions were used against E. coli
   O157:H7 and the results from antimicrobial assays showed high
   antibacterial effect with a population reduction of >= 6 log CFU/ml
   within 5 min of treatment.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the
   electro-activation to confer to aqueous solutions of organic salts of
   highly reactive properties that differ them from their conjugated
   commercial acids. The electro-activated solutions demonstrated
   significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7. Significance
   and impact of study: This study opens new possibilities to use
   electro-activated solutions of salts of weak organic acids as food
   preservatives to develop safe, nutritive and low heat processed foods.}},

Abstract = {{A single-step procedure for the preparation of Au-MnOx NPs was achieved
   through pulsed laser ablation of a gold-manganese metal target made of a
   pressed metal powder mixture. First, a 248 nm nanosecond laser at 66.7 J
   cm(-2) was used to synthesize Au-MnOx NPs from a gold manganese metal
   target immersed in an aqueous solution at pH 11 (NaOH). It is
   demonstrated that the Au-MnOx NPs are made of a small Au core (around 5
   nm in diameter) surrounded by a very thin manganese oxide layer (0.3-1.3
   nm) as characterized by TEM, HAADF HR-STEM, and EELS. The superficial
   MnOx layer has a local structure that bears a close resemblance to that
   of Mn2O3 and MnO2 as revealed by EXAFS and XANES measurements.
   Comparative studies were also performed with a 1064 nm nanosecond laser
   at 1.4 J cm(-2). In that case, the resulting colloids are mainly made of
   a mixture of Au NPs and MnOx NPs, with few Au-MnOx NPs, thereby
   suggesting the impact of the laser wavelength and fluence on the
   synthesis process. The mechanisms responsible for the production of
   Au-MnOx core-shell NPs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Application of tetrabutylammonium bis(2-ethylhexyl)-phosphate
   ({[}N-4444]{[}DEHP]), a room temperature ionic liquid (IL), as an
   aqueous collector for flotation of model monazite and bastnasite
   minerals was investigated through micro-flotation tests, zeta potential
   measurements, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ionic liquid was shown to have
   superior performance to float both model rare-earth (RE) minerals as
   compared with calcite, dolomite and quartz minerals as typical gangue
   minerals. Parallel to this, micro-flotation tests of a rare-earth ore
   containing bastnasite and monazite minerals were found in line with
   {[}N-4444]{[}DEHP] stronger collecting power towards RE model minerals
   even outperforming hydroxamic acid-containing collectors. With regard to
   the mineral surface chemistry, zeta potential measurements, FTIR
   characterization and XPS analysis, it was established that
   {[}N-4444]{[}DEHP] uptake on bastnasite and monazite surfaces was via
   chemisorption involving specifically the P=0 and P-O groups of the IL
   anionic moiety. IL anionic and cationic interactions during RE mineral
   flotation were rationalized in terms of an inner synergistic pathway: IL
   anionic moiety chemisorbing on bastnasite and monazite surfaces
   prompting uptake of cationic moiety via electrostatic attraction and/or
   via hydrophobic chain interactions of the cation alkyl chains with the
   chemisorbed IL anionic layer. Finally, for calcite as the most
   responsive among gangue minerals, the characterization techniques
   divulged the weaker IL-surface interactions. Hence, this investigation
   opens up new prospects for more selective ionic-liquid collectors to be
   used in the flotation of RE minerals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the use of passive force and torque limiting devices
   to bound the maximum forces that can be applied at the end-effector or
   along the links of a robot, thereby ensuring the safety of human-robot
   interaction. Planar isotropic force limiting modules are proposed and
   used to analyze the force capabilities of a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF)
   planar serial robot. The force capabilities at the end-effector are
   first analyzed. It is shown that, using isotropic force limiting
   modules, the performance to safety index remains excellent for all
   configurations of the robot. The maximum contact forces along the links
   of the robot are then analyzed. Force and torque limiters are
   distributed along the structure of the robot in order to ensure that the
   forces applied at any point of contact along the links are bounded. A
   power analysis is then presented in order to support the results.
   Finally, examples of mechanical designs of force/torque limiters are
   shown to illustrate a possible practical implementation of the concept.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming since the second half of the 20(th) century has begun to
   significantly impact infrastructure integrity in permafrost environments
   and has already resulted in expensive maintenance operations. Engineers
   in countries with permafrost are actively working to adapt the design of
   structures to degrading permafrost conditions. Here, we review
   permafrost degradation processes and their geotechnical impacts. We also
   summarise mitigation techniques for protecting transportation
   infrastructure built on permafrost and for preventing permafrost
   degradation near these facilities based on the results of field and
   laboratory tests, numerical simulations and engineering practices on
   such infrastructure. We draw four conclusions: (1) climate warming and
   local surface changes have caused permafrost degradation, and resulted
   in instability and damage leading to infrastructure maintenance and
   repair; (2) passive cooling methods, including high-albedo surfacing,
   sun-sheds, air convection embankments, air ducts, heat drains and
   thermosyphons, have shown consistent cooling effects, if designed
   appropriately; (3) mitigation and adaptation methods are more expensive
   than conventional construction techniques as shown by construction cost
   data for a test site in Canada; and (4) the influence of continued
   climate warming on permafrost and infrastructure design must be
   considered within the design of new or rehabilitated infrastructure and
   within the context of the infrastructure's service life. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{In this study, high-density polyethylene/agave-coir composites with two
   fiber contents (20 and 30 wt\%) and different coir-agave fiber ratios
   (1-0, 0.8-0.2, 0.60.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.2-0.8, and 0-1) were produced in a
   two-step process using twin-screw extrusion followed by injection
   molding. The effect of mixing two different natural fibers and the
   addition of coupling agent on water absorption, mechanical properties,
   and morphology is reported. The rule of hybrid mixture was used to
   predict the properties of the composites, showing a good agreement with
   the experimental data. The results obtained showed that the combination
   of different fibers produces composites with unique characteristics as
   coir fibers absorb less water than agave fibers, while at the same time
   increase more tensile and flexural strengths. On the other hand, agave
   fibers were found to improve the impact strength of coir composites.
   Also, the effect of water absorption on the mechanical properties was
   studied. Finally, the use of a coupling agent had a positive effect on
   mechanical properties, while lowering water uptake. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are gaining popularity on the
   personal transportation market. These vehicles store energy that is
   unused when parked. This distributed energy source can therefore be used
   to provide ancillary services such as grid regulation or spinning
   reserves, but also for demand-side management. In this paper, we are
   proposing the concept of collaborative charging in the context of
   Vehicle-to-Building, where the vehicle and building operators engage
   themselves into a synergistic relation, with vehicles freely charged in
   exchange for shaving power peaks of buildings. For that purpose,
   simulations of vehicle fleets are conducted, with the charging schedule
   optimized by a linear programming model that is applied to manage the
   electric demand of a suburban university campus. These simulations, made
   in the context of a regulated electric market, demonstrate that
   collaborative charging can be financially viable for both the
   institution hosting the system and the participants. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Key components of CRISPR-Cas systems have been adapted into a powerful
   genome-editing tool that has caught the headlines and the attention of
   the public. Canonically, a customized RNA serves to guide an

   lesions that can be repaired in a personalized fashion by cellular
   machinery. Here, we turn to the microbes that are the source of this
   system to explore many of its other notable applications. These include
   mining the CRISPR `memory' arrays for functional genomic data,
   generation of customized virus-resistant or plasmid-refractory bacterial
   cells, editing of previously intractable viral genomes, and exploiting
   the unique properties of a catalytically inactive Cas9, dCas9, to serve
   as a highly customizable anti-nucleic acid `antibody'.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of sour gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide
   (H2S) is of great importance in various processes such as streams of
   sour natural gas, production of ammonia by treating synthesis gas, and
   hydrogen purification processes. Hence, developing accurate tools for
   prediction of solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions of different
   substrates seems to be of great importance. This study aims to develop
   two reliable models namely CHPSO-ANFIS and CSA-LSSVM for prediction of
   CO2 solubility in aqueous solution of mixture of 1,4-diazacyclohexane
   (piperazine, PZ). The experimental data were gathered from several
   published works in the literature. The effectiveness and accuracy of the
   proposed models were evaluated by both statistical and graphical
   approaches. Results show that the developed CHPSO-ANFIS model presents
   more accurate and reliable predictions compared to the outcomes of
   CSA-LSSVM model. The overall R-2 and AARD\% values for CHPSO-ANFIS model
   were 0.9902 and 3.76 which indicate accuracy and robustness of the
   developed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The displacement flow of two miscible Newtonian fluids is investigated
   experimentally in a vertical pipe of long aspect ratio (delta(-1)
   approximate to 210). The fluids have a small density difference and they
   have the same viscosity. The heavy displacing fluid is initially placed
   above the light displaced fluid. The displacement flow is downwards. The
   experiments cover a wide range of the two dimensionless parameters that
   largely describe the flow: the modified Reynolds number (0 <= Re-t less
   than or similar to 800) and the densimetric Froude number (0 <= Fr <=
   24). We report on the stabilizing effect of the imposed flow and uncover
   the existence of two main flow regimes at long times: a stable
   displacement flow and an unstable displacement flow. The transition
   between the two regimes occurs at a critical modified Reynolds number
   Re-t vertical bar Critical, as a function of Fr. We study in depth the
   stable flow regime: First, a lubrication model combined with a simple
   initial acceleration formulation delivers a reasonable prediction to the
   time-dependent penetrating displacing front velocity. Second, we find
   two sub-regimes for stable displacements, namely, sustained-back-flows
   and no-sustained-back-flows. The transition between the two sub-regimes
   is a marginal stationary interface flow state, which is also well
   predicted by the lubrication model. The unstable regime is associated to
   instabilities and diffusive features of the flow. In addition,
   particular patterns such as front detachment phenomenon appear in the
   unstable flow regime, for which we quantify the regions of existence
   versus the dimensionless groups. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic characterization of semiconductor colloidal quantum dots
   (cQDs) response to ionizing radiation must be performed to use them in
   radiation detection. In this study, the robustness of multi-shell (MS)
   and core/shell (CS) cQDs was investigated under irradiation.
   Radioluminescence (RL) measurements with kV and MV photon beams revealed
   a better resistance of MS cQDs to ionizing radiation, with their spectra
   fluctuating by barely similar to 1 nm. A systematic signal recovery
   between subsequent irradiations was noticed for MS cQDs only. A beam
   energy dependence of the RL stability was detected between kV and MV
   energies. At the same point of dose cumulated, the RL signal loss for
   the kV beams was observed to be similar to 6-7\% smaller than that of
   the MV beam, for both types of cQDs. These results demonstrate that MS
   cQDs are better candidates as ionizing radiation sensors than CS cQDs,
   especially in the kV energy range. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln) in Helicobacter pylori is formed by an indirect

   tRNA-dependent heterotrimeric amidotransferase (AdT) GatCAB. Widespread
   use of this pathway among prominent human pathogens, and its absence in
   the mammalian cytoplasm, identify AdT as a target for the development of
   antimicrobial agents. We present here the inhibitory properties of three
   dipeptide-like sulfone-containing compounds analogous to the
   transamidation intermediates, which are competitive inhibitors of AdT
   with respect to Glu-tRNA(Gln). Molecular docking revealed that AdT
   inhibition by these compounds depends on - stacking interactions between
   their aromatic groups and Tyr81 of the GatB subunit. The properties of
   these inhibitors indicate that the 3-terminal adenine of Glu-tRNA(Gln)
   plays a major role in binding to the AdT transamidation active site.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is currently showing
   encouraging results. However, there is still no serum-free medium that
   allows multiplying functional myoblasts, the cells required for this
   therapy, obtained from healthy donors, in sufficient number. A
   systematic screen for a defined culture medium that would allow
   expanding fully functional human myoblasts at the same rate and to the
   same extent as the existing serum-containing medium has been undertaken.
   To this end, 6 basal media and more than 60 defined additives have been
   screened for their individual as well as synergistic effects. The medium
   developed in this study permits a 12-log expansion of human myoblasts
   over a 60-day period. The cells obtained have the same capacity to fuse
   and form myofibres as myoblasts multiplied in serum-containing medium.}},

Title = {{Simplified nonlinear model for timber-concrete composite beams}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{30-42}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Timber-concrete composite (TCC) structures have been emerging in several
   industrial applications due to potential to simultaneously optimize
   their structural stiffness, dynamic vibration and ecological imprint.
   However, when one considers nonlinear behaviour of timber-to-concrete
   connections and the cracking of the concrete slab, the structural
   analysis of the composite system becomes quite complex. The scope of
   this article is to provide a powerful one-dimensional model accounting
   for the nonlinear behaviour of steel dowel connections and cracking of
   the concrete slab for better understanding the structural behaviour of
   TCC structures. First, we extended the existing Winkler model of a beam
   on an elastic foundation for calculating the load-slip deformation of a
   steel dowel connecting concrete to timber. Then, we extended the
   composite beam theory with the secant stiffness approach to account for
   the nonlinear behaviour of the connection and the cracking of concrete
   in a TCC beam. An original 4-level model for predicting the structural
   behaviour of a TCC beam starting from the behaviour of the steel dowel
   connection is developed by combining three upscaling models. The model
   has been implemented in a Finite Element Method and has been validated
   with experimental tests available in literature. An in-depth discussion
   of the results shows the usefulness of such simplified engineering model
   to better understand the structural behaviour of TCC beams in terms of
   the composite action, cracking distribution and structural ductility.

Abstract = {{Polyetherethersulfones with double bonds inserted along the main polymer
   chain are synthesized by polycondensation. The glass transition is
   modulated by increasing the size of aromatic etherethersulfone rigid
   blocks and decreasing the ratio of flexible allyl segments which contain
   a double bond. Resulting copolymers have a M-n of up to 60 000 g
   mol(-1), moderate polydispersity indices ( D or I-p) of 1.70 to 2.11,
   and are shown, by the presence of a single glass transition temperature
   in differential scanning calorimetry and by matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-offlight ( MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, to
   be random. The glass transition of copolymers follows the Gordon-Taylor
   relationship. The thermal resistance of copolymers increases when
   decreasing the amount of the flexible segment and increasing the length
   of the rigid block. Chemical aging of films is investigated by immersion
   in bleach, which is commonly used to clean membranes. Films show high
   resistance to bleach, therefore making this approach relevant to
   membrane fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{De-icing salt (NaCl) application is a common practice during winter road
   maintenance in northern countries, compromising ecosystem services.
   Ecoengineering facilities, including reactive filter beds, are becoming
   an effective strategy for road runoff management. Different materials
   (anthracite coal, dolomite, limestone, and pozzolan) were tested as
   reactive media of filter beds. Characterization showed that dolomite has
   the best physical properties (resistance to fragmentation, porosity) for
   filter bed construction and maintenance, followed by limestone. NaCl
   removal efficiency was investigated in batch at different concentrations
   (150-5000 mg L-1 Cl). Removal efficiency substantially varied depending
   on the element (Cl or Na), the material, and the added NaCl
   concentration. At the lowest NaCl concentration, Cl removal was higher
   onto anthracite (48 \%) and dolomite (59 \%); but greater Na removal was
   reached onto limestone (54 \%) and pozzolan (67 \%). At higher
   concentrations, Cl removal was similar (anthracite), decreased
   (dolomite), or increased (limestone, pozzolan); and Na removal increased
   (anthracite) or decreased (dolomite, limestone, pozzolan). Parallel
   experiments at 4 degrees C showed lower NaCl removal, anthracite being
   the most efficient. Practical applicability was evaluated in columns
   using synthetic runoff solution (NaCl and metals). NaCl removal
   efficiency was much lower in column assays with respect to batch. The
   highest NaCl removal was reached onto dolomite, followed by limestone.
   Metals were successfully removed, generally remaining over time in a
   wide range (41-89 \% Cd, 78-97 \% Ni, 44-88 \% Cu, and 3-83 \% Zn)
   depending on the material, being pozzolan the least efficient. Further
   studies including a combination of materials would be of high interest.}},

Abstract = {{Spheres are popular geometric primitives found in many manufactured

   the quality of the detected spheres, which help remove the confusion
   between perfect spheres and sphere-like shapes such as ellipsoids and
   paraboloids. A novel sampling strategy is introduced to reduce
   computational burden for sphere extraction. Experiments on both
   synthetic and scanned point clouds with different levels of noise and
   outliers are conducted and the results compared to state-of-the-art

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{The Charlevoix region, in southeastern Quebec, is characterized by a
   dramatic landscape formed by the junction of the Laurentian Highlands,
   the Charlevoix Astrobleme and the St Lawrence Estuary. At the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM), the region was completely covered by the
   Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). The complex topography of the region was the
   stage of many of the major deglacial events of southern Quebec (e.g.
   Goldthwait Sea Invasion, St Lawrence Ice-Stream, Saint-Narcisse
   Episode). We present a detailed reconstruction of the pattern of retreat
   of the LIS in the Charlevoix region based on the interpretation of
   ice-marginal features (e.g. moraines, fans) and glaciolacustrine
   landforms and deposits, two extensive field campaigns, and the
   interpretation of high-resolution 3D digital aerial photographs and
   LiDAR data. Our results indicate five moraine complexes in the region:
   the Rochette, the Brulee, the Sainte-Anne, the Saint-Narcisse and the
   Mars-Batiscan complexes. Deltas, fans, fine-grained sediments, littoral
   deposits, drainage breaches and deposits were used to identify 91
   palaeo-proglacial lakes. The identification of these lakes and their
   relation to moraine complexes enabled the reconstruction of six stages
   of lake development during the Charlevoix deglaciation. The development
   of proglacial lakes occurred in all types of terrain (highlands,
   lowlands, transitory levels above marine limit). We conclude that local
   topography had a decisive effect on promoting both moraine deposition
   and lake development. We suggest that similar topographical regions
   (hilly-mountainous) that were affected by major ice-margin
   stabilizations during glacial retreat should have experience small lakes
   dominating valleys and topographical lows.}},

Abstract = {{Typha angustifolia, Juncus maritimus, and Eleocharis palustris were
   evaluated for de-icing salt removal from runoff water. Plants were
   exposed to a range of de-icing salt levels (0.2, 0.7, 4, 8, and 13 dS
   m(-1)) in laboratory-scale subsurface constructed wetlands (CWs) for 2
   months under greenhouse conditions. Effluent characteristics, plant
   height, biomass, and Cl and Na removal rates and uptake were monitored.
   More water volume was retained in CWs of T. angustifolia (similar to 60
   \%) than of J. maritimus and E. palustris (similar to 37.5 \%), which
   accounted for the electrical conductivity increase in effluents
   (1.3-1.9-fold). Based on the NaCl removal rate, T. angustifolia showed
   the greatest phytodesalinization ability (31-60 \%) with the highest
   removal at the lowest salt levels (0.2-0.7 dS m(-1)), followed by J.
   maritimus (22-36 \%) without differences in removal among levels, and E.
   palustris (3-26 \%) presenting a removal rate highly decreased with
   increasing salt levels. Plant height and biomass were stimulated at low
   de-icing salt levels, but, at higher levels, T. angustifolia and E.
   palustris growth was inhibited (tolerance index similar to 67 and 10 \%,
   respectively, in the worst cases). Salt amounts in aboveground biomass
   in g m(-2) differed among levels and ranged as follows: 13.6-29.1 (Cl),
   4.2-9.3 (Na; T. angustifolia); 7.0-12.0 (Cl), 2.7-6.4 (Na; J.
   maritimus); and 0.9-7.6 (Cl), 0.3-1.6 (Na; E. palustris). Chloride and
   Na translocation decreased with de-icing salt increase in T.
   angustifolia, while no significant differences were found in J.
   maritimus, which is interesting for harvesting purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The use of heavy oil is increasing due to the exhaustion of the light
   crude oil wells. Meanwhile, refineries try to intensify their capacity
   and process the heaviest fractions of petroleum to turn them into a more
   valuable form. To design and operate hydro-processes, it is of great
   importance to acquire information about the hydrogen solubility in heavy
   oils. However, there are some difficulties in the hydrogen solubility
   measurements and modeling. Consequently, prediction of hydrogen
   solubility in heavy oils in an accurate and easy way is essential. In
   this study, reliable model namely Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System
   (ANFIS) was developed for prediction of hydrogen solubility in heavy oil
   fractions based on experimental data gathered from literature. The
   accuracy of the proposed model was checked using various statistical
   parameters and graphical representations. The model exhibit overall R-2
   and AARD\% values of 0.99242 and 3.4 which indicate accuracy and
   robustness of developed model. Result show that the developed model
   presents accurate results by reproducing the experimental values with an
   acceptable error. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using surface modified clay nanoparticles to improve rheological
   behavior of Hydrolized Polyacrylamid (HPAM) solution for enhanced oil
   recovery with polymer flooding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{222}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this communication, effect of Surface Modified Clay Nanoparticles
   (SMCN) on rheological behavior of Hydrolized Polyacrylamid (HPAM)
   solution and also its resistance against the increases in temperature
   and salinity were investigated experimentally. An increases in polymer
   solution viscosity result in a decrease in mobility ratio then
   consequently it may increase the polymer flooding efficiency. High
   pressures imposed on polymers during flooding processes cause a
   considerable shear stress on them, which lead to breakage of polymer
   chains. In addition, at elevated temperatures, certain chemical
   reactions are accelerated and subsequently this force polymer chains to
   compress. This kind of behavior (compactness of polymer chains) can be
   observed in a saline environment. Therefore, polymer viscosity and
   consequent flooding process efficiency is decreased. To prevent
   deformation of polymers and increase the internal friction of the
   solution, surface of certain clay nanoparticles were modified by
   specific tetrahedral redundants and located between polymer chains.
   Finally, the potential utilization of these novel clay nanoparticles in
   improving the performance of polymer flooding on an unconsolidated
   sandpacks were investigated. According to the results, we suggest 0.1\%
   wt concentration of SMCN as the optimum concentration in which the
   SMCN-HPAM solution is stable. In addition, results indicate that adding
   SMCN improves the resistance of polymer solution against an increases in
   salinity and temperature, and also its shear thinning behavior.
   Moreover, the experimental result indicates that SMCN-HPAM increases the
   oil recovery about 33\% more than ordinary polymer flooding processes.

Abstract = {{We propose a new wireless communication architecture for implanted
   systems that simultaneously stimulates neurons and record neural
   responses. This architecture can support large numbers of electrodes
   (>500), providing 100 Mb/s for the downlink of stimulation signals, and
   gigabits per second for the uplink of neural recordings. We propose a
   full-duplex transceiver architecture that shares one antenna for both
   the ultrawideband (UWB) and the 2.45-GHz industrial, scientific, and
   medical band. A new pulse shaper is used for the gigabits per second
   uplink to simplify the transceiver design, while supporting several
   modulation formats with high data rates. To validate our system-level
   design for brain-machine interfaces, we present an ex-vivo experimental
   demonstration of the architecture. While the system design is for an
   integrated solution, the proof-of-concept demonstration uses discrete
   components. Good bit error rate performance over a biological channel at
   0.5-, 1-, and 2-Gb/s data rates for uplink telemetry (UWB) and 100 Mb/s
   for downlink telemetry (2.45-GHz band) are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the JCMT Gould Belt Survey's first look results of the
   southern extent of the Orion A Molecular Cloud (delta <= -5: 31: 27.5).
   Employing a two-step structure identification process, we construct
   individual catalogues for large-scale regions of significant emission
   labelled as islands and smaller-scale subregions called fragments using
   the 850 mu m continuum maps obtained using SCUBA-2. We calculate object
   masses, sizes, column densities, and concentrations. We discuss
   fragmentation in terms of a Jeans instability analysis and highlight
   interesting structures as candidates for follow-up studies. Furthermore,
   we associate the detected emission with young stellar objects (YSOs)
   identified by Spitzer and Herschel. We find that although the population
   of active star-forming regions contains a wide variety of sizes and
   morphologies, there is a strong positive correlation between the
   concentration of an emission region and its calculated Jeans
   instability. There are, however, a number of highly unstable subregions
   in dense areas of the map that show no evidence of star formation. We
   find that only similar to 72 per cent of the YSOs defined as Class 0+I
   and flat-spectrum protostars coincide with dense 850 mu m emission
   structures (column densities > 3.7 x 10(21) cm(-2)). The remaining 28
   per cent of these objects, which are expected to be embedded in dust and
   gas, may be misclassified. Finally, we suggest that there is an
   evolution in the velocity dispersion of YSOs such that sources which are
   more evolved are associated with higher velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutions of the Cu/Mg bearing intermetallics were thoroughly
   investigated in four Al-Si hypoeutectic alloys containing various Cu (1
   and 1.6 wt pct) and Mg (0.4 and 0.8 wt pct) contents. The area fractions
   of Cu/Mg bearing phases before and after solution heat treatment (SHT)
   were quantified to evaluate the solubility/stability of the phases. Two
   Mg-bearing intermetallics (Q-Al5Cu2Mg8Si6, pi-Al8FeMg3Si6) which appear
   as gray color under optical microscope were discriminated by the
   developed etchant. Moreover, the concentrations of the elements (Cu, Mg,
   and Si) in alpha-Al were analyzed. The results illustrated that in the
   alloys containing similar to 0.4 pct Mg, Q-Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 phase was
   dissolved after 6 hours of SHT at 778 K (505 A degrees C); but
   containing in the alloys similar to 0.8 pct Mg, it was insoluble/
   partially soluble. Furthermore, after SHT at 778 K (505 A degrees C),
   Mg2Si was partially substituted by Q-phase. Applying a two-step SHT {[}6
   hours@778 K (505 A degrees C) + 8 hours@798 K (525 A degrees C)] in the
   alloys containing similar to 0.4 pct Mg helped to further dissolve the
   remaining Mg bearing intermetallics and further modified the
   microstructure, but in the alloys containing similar to 0.8 pct Mg, it
   caused partial melting of Q-phase. Thermodynamic calculations were
   carried out to assess the phase formation in equilibrium and in
   non-equilibrium conditions. There was an excellent agreement between the
   experimental results and the predicted results.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the performance of three-dimensional (3-D) woven
   interlock composite plates subjected to impact loading. Low velocity
   (lower than 10 m center dot s(-1)) impacts with highly deformable rubber
   impactor are addressed. Response variability is investigated by
   conducting several impact tests in the same conditions. The effect of
   mass and velocity on damage tolerance is studied by varying the impact
   conditions. Force-time, displacement-time and force-displacement curves
   are first analyzed in such various impact conditions. Secondly, damage
   mechanisms are highlighted through microscopic observations. The large
   geometrical deformation of the rubber impactor during impact leads to a
   loading less localized than for a hard impactor which induces a wide
   spread damage distribution. Comments on the relations between damage
   states and mass-velocity conditions are proposed. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Characterization of soil hydraulic properties is essential for modelling
   water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone. These properties are
   often assessed assuming that the soil is a non-deformable (rigid) porous
   medium. However, under real conditions, such as those found in
   agricultural systems, the soil is constantly exposed to external
   stresses induced by farm machinery and by wetting and drying cycles,
   which constantly modify the soil hydraulic properties. The main
   objective of this work was to develop a methodological framework based
   on Xray CT scanning to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the
   hydraulic properties of a soil under drainage conditions. The
   methodological framework combines the particle size distribution of a
   soil and the fractal dimension of its porosity obtained from X-ray CT
   scans to predict the saturated hydraulic conductivity and volumetric
   deformation of a soil column. The results show that the proposed
   framework provides a realistic description of the spatio-temporal
   evolution of the hydraulic properties of a soil during the drainage
   process. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Partial least squares-discriminant analysis of trace element
   compositions of magnetite from various VMS deposit subtypes: Application
   to mineral exploration}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{388-408}},

Abstract = {{The petrography and mineral chemistry of magnetite from fifteen
   volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits in Canada, and the Lasail
   VMS deposit in Oman, as well as from two VMS-associated banded iron
   formations (BIF), Austin Brook (New Brunswick, Canada) and Izok Lake
   (Nunavut, Canada), were investigated using optical microscopy, electron
   probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), and laser ablation-inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The method of robust estimation
   for compositional data (robCompositions) was applied to investigate
   geochemical censored data. Among thirty-seven elements analyzed by EPMA
   and/or LA-ICP-MS in magnetite from the studied deposits/bedrock
   lithologies, only the results for Si, Ca, Zr, Al, Mg, Ti, Zn, Co and Ni
   contain <40\% censored values, and thus could be imputed using
   robCompositions. Imputed censored data were transformed using centered
   log-ratios to overcome the closure effect on compositional data.
   Transformed data were classified by partial least squares-discriminant
   analysis (PLS-DA) to identify different compositional characteristics of
   magnetite from VMS deposits and BIFs. The integration of petrography and
   mineral chemistry identifies three types of magnetite in VMS settings:
   magmatic, hydrothermal, and metamorphic. Magmatic magnetite in VMS
   deposit host bedrocks is characterized by ilmenite exsolution and may be
   overprinted by metamorphism. Some VMS deposits contain hydrothermal
   magnetite, which is intergrown with sulfides, and shows a metamorphic
   overprint as it is partly replaced by common metamorphic minerals,
   including chlorite, sericite, anthophyllite, and/or actinolite, whereas
   the majority of the deposits are characterized by metamorphic magnetite
   formed by replacing pre-existing sulfides and/or silicates, and is
   intergrown with metamorphic minerals. Among VMS deposits of the Noranda
   mining district, the West Ansil deposit is characterized by
   hydrothermal-metamorphic magnetite zoned by inclusion-free cores and Si-
   and Mg-rich rims. Magnetite from the studied VMS-associated BIFs is also
   metamorphic in origin. Aluminum, Ti and Zn contents of magnetite can
   separate BIF from the other mineralized and un-mineralized bedrock
   lithologies in the studied VMS settings.
   PLS-DA shows that variable compositions of magnetite slightly
   discriminate different studied deposits/bedrock lithologies. The
   geochemical observations suggest that the variation in magnetite
   chemistry from different VMS settings might be sourced from differences
   in: 1) the composition and temperature of parental magmas or
   hydrothermal fluids, 2) the composition of host bedrocks, 3) the
   composition of co-forming minerals, and 4) oxygen fugacity. PLS-DA
   distinguishes magnetite compositions from the studied VMS deposits and
   BIFs from that of the other ore deposit types including Ni-Cu, porphyry
   Cu-Mo-Au, iron oxide-copper- gold, iron oxide-apatite, and the Bayan Obo
   REE-Fe-Nb deposit. Magnetite from the VMS settings on average contains
   lower concentrations of Si, Zr, Al, Mg, Ti, Zn, Co and Ni relative to
   that from the other mineral deposit types. PLS-DA of magnetite data from
   VMS deposits and BIFs of the Bathurst mining camp as well as PLS-DA of
   magnetite compositions from various mineral deposit types yield
   discrimination models for application to mineral exploration for VMS
   deposits using indicator minerals in Quaternary lithified sedimentary
   rocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   deposition. This method offers a rapid and economical way of fabricating
   interference and gradient index coatings used in many optical
   applications. To show the potential of this deposition method, a Bragg
   mirror stack was made with twenty alternating layers of oxygen-rich
   (high x) and nitrogen-rich (high y) TaOxNy thin films. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Many herbivores exhibit phenotypic variations of their digestive system
   in response to changes in quality of food resources. This digestive
   plasticity is considered an adaptive trait for individuals to help them
   cope with variation in food resources and to fulfill nutritional needs.
   We investigated whether digestive phenotypic variations could contribute
   to sustain the population of introduced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada) facing a winter diet
   of low-quality forage. We compared digestive morphology and in vitro
   digestibility of winter forage to that of deer from the original
   mainland population. Deer on Anticosti Island had a higher ruminal
   volume and digesta load (43\% and 62\%, respectively), greater
   absorption surface of the ruminal papillae, and greater relative mass of
   all forestomachs than deer from the mainland. Woody forage digestibility
   was similar between the 2 populations, even though faster kinetic
   digestion may occur for deer on Anticosti Island. Digestive plasticity
   appears to play a central role in sustaining high deer densities facing
   harsh forage conditions on Anticosti Island. Comparisons of digestive
   morphology and digestibility between populations that have access to
   forage of variable quality contribute to our understanding of the
   digestive response and the role of digestive plasticity for individuals
   facing a decline in diet quality.}},

Title = {{Predictive computational phenotyping and biomarker discovery using

Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The identification of genomic biomarkers is a key step
   towards improving diagnostic tests and therapies. We present a
   reference-free method for this task that relies on a k-mer
   representation of genomes and a machine learning algorithm that produces
   intelligible models. The method is computationally scalable and
   well-suited for whole genome sequencing studies.
   Results: The method was validated by generating models that predict the
   antibiotic resistance of C. difficile, M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa,
   and S. pneumoniae for 17 antibiotics. The obtained models are accurate,
   faithful to the biological pathways targeted by the antibiotics, and
   they provide insight into the process of resistance acquisition.
   Moreover, a theoretical analysis of the method revealed tight
   statistical guarantees on the accuracy of the obtained models,
   supporting its relevance for genomic biomarker discovery.
   Conclusions: Our method allows the generation of accurate and
   interpretable predictive models of phenotypes, which rely on a small set
   of genomic variations. The method is not limited to predicting
   antibiotic resistance in bacteria and is applicable to a variety of
   organisms and phenotypes. Kover, an efficient implementation of our
   method, is open-source and should guide biological efforts to understand
   a plethora of phenotypes (http://github. com/aldro61/kover/).}},

   demonstrated, where optical polarization demultiplexing was employed in
   the setup. We demonstrate MDM data transmission using two OAM modes over
   1.4 km of a specially designed ring core fiber without using full MIMO
   processing or optical polarization demultiplexing. We demonstrate
   reception with electrical polarization demultiplexing, i.e., minimal 2 x

Abstract = {{A strategy for the scale-up of a monolith reactor dedicated to
   gas-liquid catalytic reactions is worked out; focus is made on the
   crucial step of gas-liquid mass transfer modelling via a steady-state
   numerical study based on a single channel and single unit cell
   representation, using a frame moving with the bubble and solving the
   liquid phase only. The relevance of this simplified approach is assessed
   through a specific case (given bubble shape, channel diameter and fluid
   flow rates), and hydrodynamics as well as mass transfer results are
   successfully compared to previously published numerical, semi-analytical
   and experimental works. Influence of unit cell length and of catalytic
   surface reaction rate is thoroughly investigated. Inferred overall mass
   transfer coefficients are found to increase with bubble frequency, due
   to higher interfacial area in unit cell and intensified recirculation in
   slug. Film contribution to mass transfer is usually found dominant in
   the case of short bubbles with reactive wall, and hardly varies with
   reaction rate. However, this contribution is strongly linked to bubble
   frequency, and a reliable evaluation of local mass transfer by
   correlations demands accurate knowledge on the precise dimensions of
   bubble, slug and film entities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Denitrification during the sedimentation process in secondary settlers
   in waste-water treatment plants has been reported to be still a
   significant problem. The modelling of such a process with the
   conservation of mass leads to a nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction
   partial differential equation, which needs non-standard numerical
   methods to obtain reliable simulations. The purpose of this study is to
   provide a first extension of the Burger-Diehl settler model, which
   models sedimentation without reactions, to include biological reactions.
   This is done with a reduced biokinetic model that contains only the
   relevant particulate and soluble components. Furthermore, the
   development is limited to batch settling. The final model describes the
   last settling stage of a sequencing batch reactor with denitrification.
   The main result of the paper is a numerical scheme that is tested for
   simulations with several initial conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at developing a simple modelling tool for assessing
   gas hydrate formation as a means to separate gas mixtures. In order to
   assess the feasibility of this technology for separation, phase
   equilibrium data obtained via experimental and modelling studies are
   required for the design and optimisation of processes based on gas
   hydrate formation. Three selected gas mixtures (ethane + ethene, ethyne
   + propene, and ethyne + propane) under hydrate formation conditions were
   examined. This was done on the basis of pressure-composition plots
   obtained with the developed multi-phase-multi component model. The
   procedure, based on the equality of fugacity and material balances, is
   presented for predicting compositions in coexisting phases for
   multi-component systems under hydrate stability conditions. The
   multi-phase-multi-component model is simple and has been successfully
   validated against independent data, as well as experimental data
   obtained by our group. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A parametric study of vertical axis turbines of the H-Darrieus type is
   conducted using state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and
   the k-omega Shear Stress Transport RANS model in its unsteady form.
   Although most parameters have previously been investigated individually,
   the effect of solidity, number of blades, tip speed ratio, Reynolds
   number, fixed blade pitch angle, and blade thickness on the aerodynamic
   efficiency of the turbine is evaluated using the same performance
   evaluation set-up in order to determine what would be the best
   aerodynamic configuration and operation parameter in a given
   application. The quantitative impact of 3D effects associated with the
   blade aspect ratio and the use of end-plates is also investigated. For
   high-Reynolds applications, optimal radiusbased solidity is found to be
   around sigma = 0.2, while higher solidities show a lower maximum
   efficiency than what was previously published using simpler streamtube
   based methods. In 3D, a small blade aspect ratio (AR = 7) leads to a
   relative efficiency drop of nearly 60\% compared to the 2D prediction.
   Longer blades improve the 3D efficiency greatly. End-plates are found to
   have a positive effect on power extraction performances, as long as
   their size and thus their drag are limited. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{A New Temperature-Vegetation Triangle Algorithm with Variable Edges
   (TAVE) for Satellite-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The estimation of spatially-variable actual evapotranspiration (AET) is
   a critical challenge to regional water resources management. We propose
   a new remote sensing method, the Triangle Algorithm with Variable Edges
   (TAVE), to generate daily AET estimates based on satellite-derived land
   surface temperature and the vegetation index NDVI. The TAVE captures
   heterogeneity in AET across elevation zones and permits variability in
   determining local values of wet and dry end-member classes (known as
   edges). Compared to traditional triangle methods, TAVE introduces three
   unique features: (i) the discretization of the domain as overlapping
   elevation zones; (ii) a variable wet edge that is a function of
   elevation zone; and (iii) variable values of a combined-effect parameter
   (that accounts for aerodynamic and surface resistance, vapor pressure
   gradient, and soil moisture availability) along both wet and dry edges.
   With these features, TAVE effectively addresses the combined influence
   of terrain and water stress on semi-arid environment AET estimates. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in one of the driest
   countries in the worldJordan, and compare it to a traditional triangle
   method (TA) and a global AET product (MOD16) over different land use
   types. In irrigated agricultural lands, TAVE matched the results of the
   single crop coefficient model (-3\%), in contrast to substantial
   overestimation by TA (+234\%) and underestimation by MOD16 (-50\%). In
   forested (non-irrigated, water consuming) regions, TA and MOD16 produced
   AET average deviations 15.5 times and -3.5 times of those based on TAVE.
   As TAVE has a simple structure and low data requirements, it provides an
   efficient means to satisfy the increasing need for evapotranspiration
   estimation in data-scarce semi-arid regions. This study constitutes a
   much needed step towards the satellite-based quantification of
   agricultural water consumption in Jordan.}},

Title = {{Effect of Particle Size and Grinding Time on Gold Dissolution in Cyanide
   Solution}},
Journal = {{MINERALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The recovery of gold by ore leaching is influenced by the size of the
   particles and the chemical environment. The effect of particle size on
   the dissolution of gold is usually studied using mono-size particles as
   the gold in solution comes from the ore of a unique leached particle
   size. This paper proposes a method to estimate the gold dissolution as a
   function of particle size using a bulk ore sample, i.e., with the
   dissolved gold coming from the various sizes of particles carried by the
   ore. The results are consistent with the fact that gold dissolution
   increases with the decreasing particle size but results also indicate
   that gold dissolution of the ore within a size interval is not
   significantly affected by the grinding time used for the ore size
   reduction. Results also show a good dissolution of the gold contained in
   the fine-size fractions without oxidation and lead nitrate pre-treatment
   for an ore that is known to require such pre-treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to shed further light on the viscous reconnection
   phenomenon. To this end, we propose a robust and efficient method in
   order to quantify the degree of reconnection of two vortex tubes. This
   method is used to compare the evolutions of two simple initial vortex
   configurations: orthogonal and antiparallel. For the antiparallel
   configuration, the proposed method is compared with alternative
   estimators and it is found to improve accuracy since it can account
   properly for the formation of looping structures inside the domain. This
   observation being new, the physical mechanism for the formation of those
   looping structures is discussed. For the orthogonal configuration, we
   report results from simulations that were performed at a much higher
   vortex Reynolds number (Re-Gamma = circulation/ viscosity = 10(4)) and
   finer resolution (N-3 = 1024(3)) than previously presented in the
   literature. The incompressible Navier-stokes equations are solved
   directly (Direct Numerical Simulation or DNS) using a Fourier
   pseudospectral algorithm with triply periodic boundary conditions. The
   associated zero-circulation constraint is circumvented by solving the
   governing equations in a proper rotating frame of reference. Using ideas
   similar to those behind our method to compute the degree of
   reconnection, we split the vorticity field into its reconnected and
   non-reconnected parts, which allows to create insightful visualizations
   of the evolving vortex topology. It also allows to detect regions in the
   vorticity field that are neither reconnected nor non-reconnected and
   thus must be associated to internal looping structures. Finally, the
   Reynolds number dependence of the reconnection time scale T-rec is
   investigated in the range 500 <= Re-Gamma <= 10 000. For both initial
   configurations, the scaling is generally found to vary continuously as
   Re-Gamma is increased from T-rec similar to Re-Gamma(-1) to T-rec
   similar to Re-Gamma(-1/2), thus providing quantitative support for
   previous claims that the reconnection physics of two vortices should be
   similar regardless of their spatial arrangement. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorhexidine (CHX) is known for its high antibacterial substantivity
   and is suitable for use to bioinert medical devices due to its long-term
   antibacterial efficacy. However, CHX molecules require a crosslinking
   film to be stably immobilized on bio-inert metal surfaces. Therefore,
   polydopamine (PDA) was utilized in this study to immobilize CHX on the
   surface of 316L type stainless steel (SS316L). The SS316L disks were
   pre-treated, modified with PDA film and immobilized with different
   concentrations of CHX (10 mM-50mM). The disks were then subjected to
   various surface characterization analyses (ATRFTIR, XPS, ToF-SIMS, SEM
   and contact angle measurement) and tested for their cytocompatibility
   with human skin fibroblast (HSF) cells and antibacterial activity
   against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The results
   demonstrated the formation of a thin PDA film on the SS316L surface,
   which acted as a crosslinking medium between the metal and CHX. CHX was
   immobilized via a reduction process that covalently linked the CHX
   molecules with the functional group of PDA. The immobilization of CHX
   increased the hydrophobicity of the disk surfaces. Despite this
   property, a low concentration of CHX optimized the viability of HSF
   cells without disrupting the morphology of adherent cells. The
   immobilized disks also demonstrated high antibacterial efficacy against
   both bacteria, even at a low concentration of CHX. This study
   demonstrates a strong beneficial effect of the crosslinked PDA film in
   immobilizing CHX on bio-inert metal, and these materials are applicable
   in medical devices. Specifically, the coating will restrain bacterial
   proliferation without suffocating nearby tissues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{AimsThere is emerging evidence that point-of-use (POU) water treatment
   can be effective in the improvement of microbial water quality and the
   decrease in diarrhoeal disease incidence in humanitarian emergencies.
   Coagulant/disinfection products (CDPs) have the distinct advantage of
   providing microbial quality improvement, turbidity reductions and a free
   chlorine residual (FCR). The laboratory treatment performance of a novel
   CDP, the Pureit((R))' sachet, has been evaluated under different water
   quality conditions.
   Methods and ResultsThe CDP performance was evaluated with regard to
   bacteriological humanitarian water quality objectives as well as the
   recent World Health Organization recommendations for evaluating POU
   water treatment options. At least 4 log(10) reductions of tested
   bacterial indicators for a highly protective' status were attained in
   the tested conditions. Treated waters were consistently below 10MPN per
   100ml with regard to final Escherichia coli concentrations (i.e. low
   risk') with majority of samples with no detectable E.coli (i.e. very low
   risk'). Attainment of the target FCR levels (at least 0<bold></bold>5
   and 0<bold></bold>2mgl(-1) after 0<bold></bold>5 and 24h respectively)
   was dependant on the test water matrix. FCRs are thought to have been
   affected by the product's formulation, which contains a quenching agent
   intended to reduce chlorinous tastes. Treated water turbidity levels
   were marginally above the nonhealth-based target of five nephelometric
   turbidity units, partially due to the filtration cloth employed.
   ConclusionsThis study has served to identify the performance envelopes
   of the CDP under challenging conditions. In particular, initial alkaline
   pHs negatively affected this product's performance with regard to
   bacterial log(10) reductions.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis CDP has the potential to attain
   humanitarian drinking water quality objectives when not operating under
   extreme conditions; consistently achieving E.coli log(10) reductions
   between 4<bold></bold>5 and 5<bold></bold>2 resulting in treated water
   with E.coli concentrations mostly below the <1MPN per 100ml target
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Gas hydrate formation is considered as unfavorable phenomenon in
   petroleum industry since it leads to blockage of pipelines. Use of
   hydrate inhibitors is the most practical method to prevent gas hydrate
   formation. Two kinds of inhibitors are typically used in the industry:
   thermodynamic inhibitors and kinetic ones. Thermodynamic inhibitors
   shift the hydrate equilibrium curve to the lower temperatures and higher
   pressures. Kinetic inhibitors delay the hydrate nucleation and growth
   rates. There are some evidences that ionic liquids have dual inhibition
   effects. In this communication, three ionic liquids including
   (BMIM-BF4), (BMIM-DCA) and (TEACL) were used. Methane hydrate formation
   induction time in the presence of the aforementioned ionic liquids was
   investigated in this work. In addition, a three parameter semi-empirical
   model on the basis of chemical kinetics theory was used to
   represent/predict the data. It is shown that the semi-empirical model

   Guidelines and with the experimental results obtained from geotechnical

   design parameters such as, pipe diameter and thickness, pipeline burial
   depth, friction angle and density of the soil surrounding the pipe on
   the maximum bending strain as well as bending strain distribution along
   the pipeline. The results show that numerical models using a finite
   element method could produce reasonable predictions. However, the
   maximum predicted bending strains from the ASCE Guidelines are larger
   than those from experiments. The pipe deformation mechanisms are also
   significantly influenced by variation in burial depth, pipe surface
   characteristics, and backfill type.}},

Abstract = {{We present a valley fog case study in which radiation fog is modulated
   by topographic effects using data obtained from a field campaign
   conducted in Heber Valley, Utah from January 7-February 1, 2015, as part
   of the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations
   (MATERHORN) program. We use data collected on January 9, 2015 to gain
   insight into relationships between typical shallow radiation fog,
   turbulence, and gravity waves associated with the surrounding
   topography. A ae 10-30 m fog layer formed by radiative cooling was
   observed from 0720 to 0900 MST under cold air temperatures (aea'9 A
   degrees C), near-saturated (relative humidity with respect to water ae95
   \%), and calm wind (mostly < 0.5 m s(-1)) conditions. Drainage flows
   were observed occasionally prior to fog formation, which modulated heat
   exchanges between air masses through the action of internal gravity
   waves and cold-air pool sloshing. The fog appeared to be triggered by
   cold-air advection from the south (ae200A degrees) at 0700 MST.
   Quasi-periodic oscillations were observed before and during the fog
   event with a time period of about 15 min. These oscillations were
   detected in surface pressure, temperature, sensible heat flux, incoming
   longwave radiation, and turbulent kinetic energy measurements. We
   hypothesize that the quasi-periodic oscillations were caused by
   atmospheric gravity waves with a time period of about 10-20 min based on
   wavelet analysis. During the fog event, internal gravity waves led to
   about 1 A degrees C fluctuations in air temperatures. After 0835 MST
   when net radiation became positive, fog started to dissipate due to the
   surface heating and heat absorption by the fog particles. Overall, this
   case study provides a concrete example of how fog evolution is modulated
   by very weak thermal circulations in mountainous terrain and illustrates
   the need for high density vertical and horizontal measurements to ensure
   that the highly spatially varying physics in complex terrain are
   sufficient for hypothesis testing.}},

Abstract = {{A unit cell model is developed to capture the elasto-visco-plastic
   response of a long fibre composite using a 3-dimensional finite element
   model. Using a glass rubber model, the elasto-visco-plastic response of
   the matrix is analysed and the fibre is considered to deform
   elastically. A functionally graded interphase zone is defined in the
   region surrounding and encompassing a reinforcing fibre. The model
   subdivides the interphase zone into an infinite number of concentric
   rings where stress and strain compatibility is preserved. This model
   aims to improve on the computational efficiency of micromechanics models
   where the fibre and matrix are modeled as separate materials. The
   mechanics of the fibre deformation are governed by a transformation
   tensor for transversely isotropic materials based on Eshelby's method.
   The model is calibrated using experimental data for the transverse
   compression of a unidirectional composite: it is then validated using
   axial compression and shear data for quasi static strain rates. For
   moderate strain rate the model is also calibrated for one of the
   transverse strain rates then validated using the other strain rates and
   axial compression. The proposed unit cell model is capable of predicting
   the elasto-visco-plastic response of long fibre composites to a very
   high accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smart windows are used to reduce energy consumption and improve thermal
   and visual comfort mainly by controlling the solar flux entering into a
   building. This article presents a simulation study in which the impact
   of the applied control strategy on the overall energy consumption
   (heating, cooling and lighting) is investigated. A commercial building
   located in Montreal (Canada) with south-oriented integrated
   electrochromic windows is modeled. The hour-by-hour state of the smart
   windows required to minimize overall energy consumption while respecting
   constraints related to thermal and visual comfort is determined through
   an optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms (GA). Then, this
   quasi optimal control is compared to other approaches that could be
   applied in real-time applications: (i) two types of rule-based controls
   (RBC), i.e. RBC1 and RBC2 and (ii) a model predictive control (MPC). The
   impacts of thermal mass and installed light power density are also
   analyzed. Results show that the four control strategies under study
   presented similar energy consumption with differences in total energy
   consumption ranging from 4\% to 10\%. While more complex controllers
   such as MPC could potentially lead to improved performances considering
   more design variables, complex models and extensive commissioning, this
   study illustrates that simpler control strategies such as RBC2 can also
   lead to satisfying results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol-related problems have traditionally been conceptualized and
   measured by an effect indicator model. That is, it is generally assumed
   that observed indicators of alcohol problems are caused by a latent
   variable. However, there are reasons to think that this construct is
   more accurately conceptualized as including at least some causal
   indicators, in which observed indicators cause the latent variable. The
   present study examined the measurement model of a well-known alcohol
   consequences questionnaire, the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index.
   Participants were 703 students from a large public university in the
   Northeast mandated to an alcohol intervention. We conducted a zero
   tetrad test to examine a measurement model consisting solely of effect
   indicators and a model with both causal and effect indicators. Overall,
   the results suggested the hybrid model fit the data better than a model
   with only effect indicators. These findings have implications regarding
   the theoretical underpinnings of alcohol-related consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Water availability and management issues related to the supply of
   drinking water in northern communities are problematic in Canada. While
   rivers and lakes are abundant, they are vulnerable to contamination and
   may become dry in winter due to freezing. Groundwater can often provide
   a more secure and sustainable water source, however its availability is
   limited in northern Canada due to the presence of permafrost. Moreover,
   the exploitation of northern aquifers poses a dual challenge of
   identifying not only permafrost-free areas, but also permeable areas
   which will allow groundwater recharge and exploitation. Suitable
   aquifers are not as common in northern Canada since the shallow
   subsurface is mostly composed of low-permeability crystalline rocks or
   unconsolidated sediments of glacial origin that are highly
   heterogeneous. In order to investigate groundwater occurrence and
   associated geological contexts in Nunavik (northern Quebec, Canada),
   along with exploring how these resources will evolve in response to
   climate change, field and compilation work were conducted in the
   surroundings of the four villages of Salluit, Kuujjuaq, Umiujaq and
   Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik. These villages are located in different
   permafrost zones, ranging from continuous to discontinuous, as well as
   in different geological environments. It was found that despite the
   ubiquitous presence of permafrost, unfrozen aquifers could be
   identified, which suggests that groundwater may be available as a source
   of drinking water for small communities. Expected climate change, with
   predicted permafrost thawing and increases in temperature and
   precipitation, should enhance groundwater availability and may
   contribute to a more secure source of drinking water for northern
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the sensitivity of hydrological projections to the
   choice of potential evapotranspiration formulas on two natural
   sub-catchments, in Canada and Germany. Twenty-four equations,
   representing a large range of options, are applied for calibration over
   the whole observation time series and for future conditions. The
   modelling chain is composed of dynamically downscaled climatic
   projections and a 20-member (ensemble) hydrological model, along with a
   snow module. The roots of the sensitivity and its propagation within the
   hydrological chain are evaluated to show influences on climate change
   impact conclusions. Results show large differences between the 24
   simulated potential evapotranspiration time series. However, these
   discrepancies only moderately affect the calibration efficiency of
   hydrological models as a result of adaptation of parameters. Choice of
   formula influences hydrological projections and climate change
   conclusions for both catchments in terms of simulated and projected
   values, and also in the magnitude of changes during important dynamic
   periods such as spring and autumn high flows and summer low flows.
   Spread of the hydrological response is lower for the combinational
   formulas than for temperature-based or radiation-based equations. All
   the results reveal the importance of testing a large spectrum of
   potential evapotranspiration formulas in a decision-making context, such
   as water resources management.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a study of the impact of confinement on the
   hydrodynamic performance of oscillating-foils hydrokinetic turbines
   (OFHT). This work aims to contribute to the development of standards
   applying to marine energy converters. These blockage effects have indeed
   to be taken into account when comparing measurements obtained in flumes,
   towing tanks, and natural sites. This paper provides appropriate
   correction formula to do so for OFHT based on computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) simulations performed at a Reynolds Number Re = 3 x 10(6)
   for reduced frequencies between f{*} = 0.08 and f{*} = 0.22 considering
   area-based blockage ratios ranging from epsilon = 0.2\% to 60\%. The
   need to discriminate between the vertical and horizontal confinement and
   the impact of the foil position in the channel are also investigated and
   are shown to be of second-order as compared to the overall blockage
   level. As expected, it is confirmed that the power extracted by the OFHT
   increases with the blockage level. It is further observed that for
   blockage ratio of less than epsilon = 40\%, the power extracted scales
   linearly with e. The approach proposed to correlate the performance of
   the OFHT in different blockage conditions uses the correction proposed
   by Barnsley and Wellicome and assumes a linear relation between the
   power extracted and the blockage. This technique is shown to be accurate
   for most of the practical operating conditions for blockage ratios up to

Abstract = {{Aim: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. To study its
   complex etiology, a psoriatic skin substitute model supplemented with a
   cytokine cocktail has been used. Materials \& methods: Reconstructed
   psoriatic skin substitutes were supplemented with a cocktail of four
   cytokines: TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and IL-17A, to monitor their
   impact on gene expression by DNA microarray. Results: Gene profiling
   analyses identified several deregulated genes reported as being also
   deregulated in psoriasis skin in vivo (S100A12, IL-8, DEFB4A and KYNU).
   The expression of those genes was dramatically increased compared with
   basal levels of controls (p < 0.005 to < 0.05). Conclusion: Psoriatic
   substitutes supplemented with a cocktail of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-6
   and IL-17A showed similar transcriptome alterations to those found in
   psoriasis.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{15-23}},

Abstract = {{Silver and antimony leaching from pyrargyrite (Ag3SbS3) by ozone in acid
   media was experimentally studied in order to evaluate this method as an
   alternative to the conventional cyanidation. When 1 g pyrargyrite was
   leached in 800 mL of 0.18 M sulfuric and 0.079 g O-3/L gas was bubbled,
   it was observed that after 80\% of metals dissolution the silver and
   antimony dissolution rates decreased until completely stopping. These
   results suggest the presence of a solid product layer onto the unreacted
   pyrargyrite cores. The SEM-EDS and XRD analysis showed that antimony
   oxides were formed as a layer covering the surface of pyrargyrite
   particles, hindering reactants transferring/diffusion to the unreacted
   surface. The chemical composition of the layer was identified as a
   silver/antimony oxide AgxSb2Oy (x = 0.51 +/- 0.04 and y = 6.08 +/-
   0.43). For low solid/liquid ratios the pyrargyrite dissolution reached
   about 98\%, however, for high solid/liquid ratios a maximum value of
   antimony concentration was found to be around 0.0008 mol/L. An
   activation energy of 27.88 kJ/mol was calculated, which is a typical
   value for mixed-control systems. The kinetic study showed that the
   controlling step changed as the reaction proceeds. The oxidation
   pretreatment with ozone is a promising alternative for pyrargyrite
   dissolution, currently under development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Mineral carbonation of a nickel mine tailing (NiMT) was studied using a

   passivation despite availability of unreacted brucite. However, the
   reactive cores could be turned into easily accessible regions following
   ex-foliation of carbonated materials. Moreover, it was demonstrated that
   slow carbonate nucleation events such as during carbonation of

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sprayed concrete is a well established application method for concrete
   repairs and ground supports; its popularity ever increasing in the past
   decades. In this field, the development of new fundamental and practical
   knowledge relies heavily on understanding the placement process, which
   controls the amount of rebound loss and consequently the in-place
   material composition and properties. In this context, an important
   experimental study investigating placement mechanisms at the process
   scale (spray scale) was undertaken and key findings are presented here.
   Indeed, the spatial distribution of the in-place sprayed material,
   around the spray axis, offers a unique view of the placement mechanisms;
   the effect of the spraying process is highlighted through the evaluation
   of the in-place material composition and distribution. In light of this
   study, a new approach is provided to initiate a thorough discussion on
   how shotcreting parameters and equipment can affect rebound losses and
   the quality of the in-place material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Guava Waste to Sustain Guava (Psidium guajava) Agroecosystem: Nutrient
   ``Balance{''} Concepts}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{The Brazilian guava processing industry generates 5.5 M Mg guava waste
   year I that could be recycled sustainably in guava agro-ecosystems as
   slow-release fertilizer. Our objectives were to elaborate nutrient
   budgets and to diagnose soil, foliar, and fruit nutrient balances in
   guava orchards fertilized with guava waste. We hypothesized that (1)
   guava waste are balanced fertilizer sources that can sustain crop yield
   and soil nutrient stocks, and (2) guava agroecosystems remain productive
   within narrow ranges of nutrient balances. A 6-year experiment was
   conducted in 8-year old guava orchard applying 0-9-18-27-36 Mg ha(-1)
   guava waste (dry mass basis) and the locally recommended mineral
   fertilization. Nutrient budgets were compiled as balance sheets. Foliar
   and fruit nutrient balances were computed as isometric log ratios to
   avoid data redundancy or resonance due to nutrient interactions and the
   closure to measurement unit. The N. P, and several other nutrients were
   applied in excess of crop removal while K was in deficit whatever the
   guava waste treatment. The foliar diagnostic accuracy reached 93\% using
   isometric log ratios and knn classification, generating reliable foliar
   nutrient and concentration ranges at high yield level. The plant mined
   the soil K reserves without any significant effect on fruit yield and
   foliar nutrient balances involving K. High guava productivity can be
   reached at lower soil test K and P values than thought before.
   Parsimonious dosage of fresh guava waste should be supplemented with
   mineral K fertilizers to recycle guava waste sustainably in guava
   agroecosystems. Brazilian growers can benefit from this research by
   lowering soil test P and K threshold values to avoid over-fertilization
   and using fresh guava waste supplemented with mineral fertilizers,
   especially K. Because yield was negatively correlated with fruit acidity
   and Brix index, balanced plant nutrition and fertilization diagnosis
   will have to consider not only fruit yield targets but also fruit
   quality to meet requirements for guava processing.}},

Title = {{Growing networks of overlapping communities with internal structure}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{We introduce an intuitive model that describes both the emergence of
   community structure and the evolution of the internal structure of
   communities in growing social networks. The model comprises two
   complementary mechanisms: One mechanism accounts for the evolution of
   the internal link structure of a single community, and the second
   mechanism coordinates the growth of multiple overlapping communities.
   The first mechanism is based on the assumption that each node
   establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the
   community at different rates. We demonstrate that this simple mechanism
   gives rise to an effective maximal degree within communities. This
   observation is related to the anthropological theory known as Dunbar's
   number, i.e., the empirical observation of a maximal number of ties
   which an average individual can sustain within its social groups. The
   second mechanism is based on a recently proposed generalization of
   preferential attachment to community structure, appropriately called
   structural preferential attachment (SPA). The combination of these two
   mechanisms into a single model (SPA+) allows us to reproduce a number of
   the global statistics of real networks: The distribution of community
   sizes, of node memberships, and of degrees. The SPA+ model also predicts
   (a) three qualitative regimes for the degree distribution within
   overlapping communities and (b) strong correlations between the number
   of communities to which a node belongs and its number of connections
   within each community. We present empirical evidence that support our
   findings in real complex networks.}},

Title = {{y The JCMT Gould Belt Survey: evidence for radiative heating and

Abstract = {{We present SCUBA-2 450 mu m and 850 mu m observations of the W40 complex
   in the Serpens-Aquila region as part of the James Clerk Maxwell
   Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Survey (GBS) of nearby star-forming regions.
   We investigate radiative heating by constructing temperature maps from
   the ratio of SCUBA-2 fluxes using a fixed dust opacity spectral index,
   beta = 1.8, and a beam convolution kernel to achieve a common 14.8
   arcsec resolution. We identify 82 clumps ranging between 10 and 36 K
   with a mean temperature of 20 +/- 3 K. Clump temperature is strongly
   correlated with proximity to the external OB association and there is no
   evidence that the embedded protostars significantly heat the dust. We
   identify 31 clumps that have cores with densities greater than
   10(5)cm(-3). 13 of these cores contain embedded Class 0/I protostars.
   Many cores are associated with bright-rimmed clouds seen in Herschel 70
   mu m images. From JCMT HARP observations of the (CO)-C-12 3-2 line, we
   find contamination of the 850 mu m band of up to 20 per cent. We
   investigate the free-free contribution to SCUBA-2 bands from large-scale
   and ultracompact H ii regions using archival VLA data and find the
   contribution is limited to individual stars, accounting for 9 per cent
   of flux per beam at 450 mu m or 12 per cent at 850 mu m in these cases.
   We conclude that radiative heating has potentially influenced the
   formation of stars in the Dust Arc sub-region, favouring Jeans stable
   clouds in the warm east and fragmentation in the cool west.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, hemp fibers (mercerized or not) were modified by a
   coupling agent (maleated polyethylene) to evaluate the level of
   interfacial improvement related to wettability or adhesion in LMDPE
   composites. To do so, different analyses in the solid (thermogravimetric
   analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, and scanning electron microscopy)
   and melt (rheology) states were combined. From the results obtained, it
   can be shown that mercerization mostly controls the level of wettability
   (physical contact) of the fibers, while the addition of a coupling agent
   mostly controls interfacial adhesion (chemical interactions). These
   conclusions were obtained based on shifts in transition temperatures
   (T-g and T-a), as well as maxima in van Gurp- Palmen plots. Overall, the
   best properties were obtained when mercerization was combined with
   coupling agent addition under optimized processing conditions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Recently, antimicrobial and decontaminating textiles, such as cotton a
   natural carbohydrate polymer, are generating more attention. Plant
   materials used for natural dyes are expected to impart biofunctional
   properties and high added valued functional textiles. In the current
   study, surface modification of cotton to maximize the dye amount on the
   surface has been investigated. Physical modification using nitrogen
   hydrogen plasma, chemical modification using chitosan and chemical
   modification using dopamine as biopolymers imparting amino groups were
   explored. Furthermore, dye exhaustion of curcumin, as a natural
   functional dye has been studied. Dye stability tests were also performed
   after fabric washing using hospital washing protocol to predict the
   durability of the functionalizations. The results demonstrated that
   cotton surfaces treated with dopamine exhibit a high level of dye uptake
   (78\%) and a good washing fastness. The use of non-toxic and natural
   additives during cotton finishing process could give the opportunity of
   cradle to cradle design for antimicrobial textile industries. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Incorporation of selected metallic elements into diamond-like carbon
   (DLC) has emerged as an innovative approach to add unique functional
   properties to DLC coatings, thus opening up a range of new potential
   applications in fields as diverse as sensors, tribology, and
   biomaterials. However, deposition by plasma techniques of
   metal-containing DLC coatings with well-defined structural properties
   and metal distribution is currently hindered by the limited
   understanding of their growth mechanisms. We report here a
   silver-incorporated diamond-like carbon coating (Ag-DLC) prepared in a
   hybrid plasma reactor which allowed independent control of the metal
   content and the carbon film structure and morphology. Morphological and
   chemical analyses of Ag-DLC films were performed by atomic force
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The vertical distribution of silver from the surface
   toward the coating bulk was found to be highly inhomogeneous due to top
   surface segregation and clustering of silver nanoparticles. Two plasma
   parameters, the sputtered Ag flux and ion energy, were shown to
   influence the spatial distribution of-silver particles. On the basis of
   these findings, a mechanism for Ag-DLC growth by plasma was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{An effective mussel-inspired multidentate block copolymer strategy

   The resultant aqueous Cat-MDBC/ESNP colloids with diameter approximate
   to 16 nm and core diameter approximate to 2 nm were non-toxic to cells
   up to 200 mg/mL and exhibit excellent colloidal stability in
   physiological condition (pH=7) as well as in the presence of IgG model
   protein. More promisingly, they had the relaxivity ratio to be
   r(2)/r(1)=1.5, which is significantly lower than PEG-coated SNPs with
   core diameter=1.5-6 nm; further which is similar to those of Gd-DOTA
   T-1-weighted contrast agents. These results suggest that aqueous

Title = {{Effects of water and basin depths in single basin solar stills: An
   experimental and theoretical study}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The effects of water depth in solar stills were studied in many earlier
   works. It was revealed that in the previous experimental works, the
   water surface-cover distance (WCD) was altered with the change of the
   water depth. However, in this research, the effects of water depth and
   WCD were investigated separately, and effects of water depth on the
   performance of solar stills with the same WCD were examined for the
   first time. In this way at first, some experiments were conducted in the
   summer and winter seasons, using the stills with the same water depths,
   but different basin depths (i.e. different WCDs). It was found that WCD
   can affect the amount of distillate yield up to 26\%. Thus, it was
   concluded that to study the effect of water depth accurately, different
   stills should be employed at the same time (to keep WCD constant). In
   the second step, some experiments were conducted using four stills in
   the summer, fall and winter seasons to examine the effects of water
   depth, while the WCD was-constant. In addition, the stills with
   different water depths were modeled analytically and their performance
   was investigated. Moreover, an empirical relationship was obtained
   between the distillate yield and the water depth. By comparing the
   results of this empirical relation with previous studies, it was
   revealed that the past researches reported a lower dependency (in the
   average 15\%) of the distillate yield on the water depth, since in their
   experimental works, WCD was changed along with the water depth. (C) 2016

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{31}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Polylactic acid (PLA) biocomposites were produced by a combination of
   extrusion and injection molding with three cellulosic reinforcements
   (agave, coir, and pine) and contents (10, 20, and 30\%). In particular,
   some samples were subjected to thermal annealing (105 degrees C for 1 h)
   to modify the crystallinity of the materials. In all cases,
   morphological (scanning electron microscopy) and thermal (differential
   scanning calorimetry, dynamical mechanical thermal analysis)
   characterizations were related to the mechanical properties (Charpy
   impact, tensile and flexural tests). The results showed that annealing
   increased the crystallinity for all the materials produced, but
   different mechanical behaviors were observed depending on fiber type and
   content. For example, annealing increased the impact strength and
   flexural modulus of PLA and PLA biocomposites (agave, coir, and pine),
   while decreasing their flexural strength. But the main conclusion is
   that fiber addition combined with thermal annealing can substantially
   increase the thermal stability of the studied materials. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{The objective of the present work is to distinguish and quantify the
   role of porosity and external surface of particles in gasification of
   carbon anodes and to determine a critical pore size. For this purpose
   nine particle size ranges with an average diameter varying from 33 to
   4380 mu m were reacted with CO2 at 960 degrees C and the pore size
   distribution of the samples were determined. Pore volume classification
   was performed using argon adsorption and mercury intrusion after being
   gasified. The results revealed that the open pores having a pore size of
   40 mu m and larger would be the most active pores for CO2 gasification
   of anode. It was shown that the external surface of particles and the
   open pores greater than the critical size are the major parameters
   determining the anode mass loss through its CO2 reaction. (C) 2016

Title = {{Radial distribution of iron oxide and silica particles in the reject
   flow of a spiral concentrator}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{51-59}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Spiral concentrators are used in the iron ore industry to separate heavy
   iron oxide carrier particles from the light silica ones. Losses of iron
   occur mainly in the fine (-75 mu m) and coarse (+600 mu m) size
   fractions. This paper analyzes the radial distribution of iron oxide and
   silica particles in the reject of a 7 turn spiral. A splitter divides
   the reject flow into six (6) streams that can be sampled individually.
   Results show that coarse iron carrier particles settle mainly in the
   inner part of the spiral trough. Although fine iron particles are mostly
   concentrated in the outer part of the spiral trough, a significant
   proportion of these particles remain captive close to the concentrate
   ports. Coarse silica particles (+600 mu m) are not concentrated in the
   innermost part of the spiral trough, while a significant concentration
   of silica particles in the size range of 75 to 212 mu m is found close
   to the concentrate ports. This observation is coherent with the size of
   the silica particles that contaminate the spiral concentrate. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This study aims at developing lightweight and high performance
   electrically conductive nanocomposites for proton exchange membrane fuel
   cell (PEMFC) bipolar plates (BPPs). These composites were made from an
   optimized co-continuous mixture of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and
   polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) reinforced with highly conductive carbon
   additives composed of carbon black (CB) and synthetic graphite (GR).
   Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were functionalized then used to
   improve BPPs electrical conductivity and their mechanical properties,
   such as flexural and impact strengths. It was observed that the best BPP
   prototype was obtained using nitric acid (HNO3)-functionalized MWCNT.
   The latter led to the smothest BPP surface, the lowest through-plane
   resitivity (0.12 cm) and the highest impact and flexural strengths.
   These results are attributed to the improved dispersion of the
   functionalized MWCNT, a result of their best compatibilization with the
   (PET/PVDF) polymeric phase. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Abstract = {{To characterize the low energy behavior of scintillating materials used
   in plastic scintillation detectors (PSDs), 3 PSDs were developed using
   polystyrene-based scintillating materials emitting in different
   wavelengths. These detectors were exposed to National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST)-matched low-energy beams ranging from 20
   kVp to 250 kVp, and to Cs-137 and Co-60 beams. The dose in polystyrene
   was compared to the dose in air measured by NIST-calibrated ionization
   chambers at the same location. Analysis of every beam quality spectrum
   was used to extract the beam parameters and the effective mass
   energy-absorption coefficient. Monte Carlo simulations were also
   performed to calculate the energy absorbed in the scintillators' volume.
   The scintillators' expected response was then compared to the
   experimental measurements and an energy-dependent correction factor was
   identified to account for low-energy quenching in the scintillators. The
   empirical Birks model was then compared to these values to verify its
   validity for low-energy electrons. The clear optical fiber response was
   below 0.2\% of the scintillator's light for x-ray beams, indicating that
   a negligible amount of fluorescence contamination was produced. However,
   for higher-energy beams (Cs-137 and Co-60), the scintillators' response
   was corrected for the Cerenkov stem effect. The scintillators' response
   increased by a factor of approximately 4 from a 20 kVp to a Co-60 beam.
   The decrease in sensitivity from ionization quenching reached a local
   minimum of about 11\% +/- 1\% between 40 keV and 60 keV x-ray beam mean
   energy, but dropped by 20\% for very low-energy (13 keV) beams. The
   Birks model may be used to fit the experimental data, but it must take
   into account the energy dependence of the kB quenching parameter. A
   detailed comprehension of intrinsic scintillator response is essential
   for proper calibration of PSD dosimeters for radiology.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions of a pure iron surface with biological
   elements, such as ions and proteins in an aqueous medium, is essential
   for an accurate in vitro assessment of corrosion patterns. In fact, the
   synergy of chlorides, carbonates, phosphates and complex organic
   molecules present in the body environment is a key factor affecting both
   in vivo and in vitro degradation of materials, especially iron and its
   alloys. The aim of this work was the assessment of degradation patterns
   of pure iron in 5 commercial pseudo-physiological solutions by a
   thorough study of degraded surface chemistry and morphology. It also
   provides a methodological basis to understand the short-term degradation
   mechanism of degradable iron depending on the surrounding physiological
   media. The standard static immersion corrosion test was modified to
   adapt the procedure to pseudo-physiological solutions. After a 14-day
   static immersion test, the surfaces of samples were investigated by
   scanning electron microscopy, stylus profilometry and atomic force
   microscopy techniques. The chemistry and phase composition of the
   degraded layers were evaluated, respectively, by X-ray photoelectron
   spectrometry and X-ray diffractometry. The morphology and composition of
   the degradation layers were found to be different for the
   test-solutions: for phosphate-rich solutions, the formation of an
   adherent passive layer was found; degradation mechanisms related to
   general corrosion were predominant for all the other solutions. In
   conclusion, the chemical composition of the used medium plays a
   fundamental role in the degradation pattern of pure iron, so that direct
   comparisons of solutions with different ion concentrations, as reported
   in the literature, need to be carefully assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Xylanases catalyze the hydrolysis of xylan, an abundant carbon and
   energy source with important commercial ramifications. Despite
   tremendous efforts devoted to the catalytic improvement of xylanases,
   success remains limited because of our relatively poor understanding of
   their molecular properties. Previous reports suggested the potential
   role of atomic-scale residue dynamics in modulating the catalytic
   activity of GH11 xylanases; however, dynamics in these studies was
   probed on time scales orders of magnitude faster than the catalytic time
   frame. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance titration and relaxation
   dispersion experiments (N-15-CPMG) in combination with X-ray
   crystallography and computational simulations to probe conformational
   motions occurring on the catalytically relevant millisecond time frame
   in xylanase B2 (XlnB2) and its catalytically impaired mutant E87A from
   Streptomyces lividans 66. Our results show distinct dynamical properties
   for the apo and ligand-bound states of the enzymes. The apo form of
   XlnB2 experiences conformational exchange for residues in the fingers
   and palm regions of the catalytic cleft, while the catalytically
   impaired E87A variant displays millisecond dynamics only in the fingers,
   demonstrating the long-range effect of the mutation on flexibility.
   Ligand binding induces enhanced conformational exchange of residues
   interacting with the ligand in the fingers and thumb loop regions,
   emphasizing the potential role of residue motions in the fingers and
   thumb loop regions for recognition, positioning, processivity, and/or
   stabilization of ligands in XlnB2. To the best of our knowledge, this
   work represents the first experimental characterization of millisecond
   dynamics in a GH11 xylanase family member. These results offer new
   insights into the potential role of conformational exchange in GH11
   enzymes, providing essential dynamic information to help improve protein
   engineering and design applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, high density polyethylene (HDPE)/hemp fiber composites
   were produced by extrusion compounding followed by injection molding. In
   particular, the effect of ground tire rubber (GTR) and coupling agent

   mechanical properties of these natural fiber composites (NFC). From the
   samples produced, a complete characterization was performed including
   morphology, density, hardness, as well as mechanical properties in
   tension, flexion, and impact. The results indicate that substantial
   improvement in NFC impact strength occurred after GTR addition, while
   tensile and flexural moduli/strengths decreased. On the other hand, the
   addition of a coupling agent was able to improve adhesion between each
   phase resulting in better composite properties. Overall, the final
   properties of the composites represent a balance between
   elasticity/toughness from GTR and rigidity/strength from hemp and MAPE.
   From the data obtained, a regression model for different properties is
   presented to design/control the final properties of these composites.}},

Abstract = {{An alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) is one of the many deleterious
   processes affecting the durability of concrete infrastructure worldwide.
   It is the result of reactions between the alkaline pore solution in
   concrete and some reactive phases in the aggregate. The reactions lead
   to the formation of an expansive force within the concrete, which, in
   certain conditions, can lead to damaging expansions and cracking in the
   concrete. For such damaging expansion to occur, all of the following
   conditions must be present simultaneously: (a) a sufficiently alkaline
   pore solution, (b) a critical amount of reactive material and (c) a
   sufficient supply of water. Effective specifications to avoid damage
   from the above reactions are based on ensuring that at least one of the
   these conditions is absent. The development of the precautions against
   AARs around the world generally involves the determination of the
   necessary level of precaution required based on the aggregate's
   reactivity, the size of the structural element and the environment
   (exposure conditions), and a classification of the `criticality' of the
   structure to build. The development and implementation of preventive
   actions according to the level of precaution required are then
   undertaken following prescriptive or performance approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Several laboratory performance tests for alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR)
   have been used worldwide for about 20 years. However, a review performed
   one of the present authors in 2006 concluded that none of the test
   methods meets all the criteria for an ideal performance test. In the
   last decade, research has been performed in several countries with the
   aim to improve current AAR performance test methods and develop
   alternative tests. The Rilem (The International Union of Laboratories
   and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures) Technical
   Committee (TC) 258-AAA (2014-2019) is also focusing on this topic. The
   main purpose of this technical committee is to develop and promote a
   reliable performance-based testing concept for the prevention of
   deleterious AAR. Strong emphasis will be placed on the implementation of
   the Rilem methods and recommendations as national and international
   standards. It is crucial to link the results from the accelerated
   laboratory testing to field behaviour, primarily against field exposure
   sites. Some results from such exposure sites are included in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the performance of code acquisition system in
   atmospheric optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) communications
   using optical orthogonal codes. Memory introduced by temporal
   correlation of optical fading process precludes us from using the Markov
   chain model for a code acquisition analysis. By considering this issue,
   we discuss how to extend the applicability of the Markov chain model to
   the atmospheric OCDMA communications. We analyze and compare the
   performance of correlator and chip level detector (CLD) structures in
   the acquisition system. In our analysis, we consider the effects of free
   space optical channel impairments, multiple access interference, and
   receiver thermal noise in the context of semi-classical photon-counting
   approach. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of various two stage
   schemes that utilize different combinations of active correlator,
   matched filter, and CLD in search and verification stages, and we find
   the optimum acquisition scheme among them. Numerical results show
   significant improvement in reducing the acquisition time and required
   power for synchronization using our optimum scheme in the wireless OCDMA
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{In this communication, a new approach for the modeling of acid gas
   (H2S/CO2) solubility in aqueous solutions of alkanolamines (MEA, DEA,
   TEA, MDEA and DGA) is introduced. The modeling and calculation approach
   is comparatively easier than similar methods presented in the literature
   and is capable of solving a non-linear set of equations using a
   Newton-Raphson algorithm. The distinct advantages of the approach are
   the ability to model solubility for the systems concerned via
   significantly reduced calculation routines and computational times, and
   without the use of optimization methods, while producing comparable
   modeling performance. A detailed development of the model construction
   and computational approach is presented, along with possible problems,
   as well as proposed solutions. The proposed method (Soltani Panah,
   Mohammadi, Ramjugernath: SMR) is demonstrated for the estimation of the
   solubility of H2S/CO2 in the aforementioned alkanolamines using the
   Deshmukh-Mather model. The results obtained from the SMR method were
   compared with that using the Smith-Missen method. The methods have been
   compared in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. Moreover, for
   examining capability of the SMR method to predict the solubility of H2S
   and CO2 once they are being absorbed together, the solubility of the
   latter two acid gases in aqueous solution of DEA was estimated and
   compared using the SMR and the Smith-Missen algorithms. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The effects of synthesized copper nanofluids containing CTAB with
   concentrations ranging from Cu(0.00001 M) + CTAB (0.00015 M) to Cu
   (0.00018 M) + CTAB (0.0022 M), water-based copper nano fluids with
   concentrations of 0.0157 M and 0.157 M, and aqueous solutions of CTAB
   with four concentrations of 0.00015 M, 0.00056 M, 0.0011 M and 0.0022 M
   are studied on the induction time of methane hydrate formation, the
   amount of methane consumed in the hydrate formation process, and the
   hydrate growth rate, in a 390 cm(3) stainless steel stirred-tank reactor
   under a stirring speed of 800 rpm. The experiments were conducted at
   initial conditions of 275.15 K and 5.5 MPa. Detailed experimental
   results show that synthesized copper nanofluids and CTAB solutions
   reduce the induction time of methane hydrate formation, but CTAB seems
   to be more effective in this regard. All tested additives have positive
   effects on the amount of methane consumed in the hydrate formation and
   the apparent rate constant of methane hydrate growth. However,
   water-based copper nanofluids with high concentrations of 0.0157 M and
   0.157 M seem to be more effective in increasing the amount of methane
   consumed in hydrate formation. The presence of CTAB in the systems under
   study is more effective in increasing the average growth rate constant,

   hydrate formation compared to copper nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{A soil test N (STN) is required to implement N fertilizer
   recommendations for vegetable crops in cultivated organic soils. A STN
   can be developed using the isometric log ratio (ILR) to balance soil C,
   N, and other soil components amalgamated into a filling value (F-v) and
   to derive a Mahalanobis distance (M-2) as STN. Our objective was to
   conduct a meta-analysis of multi-year and multi-site N trials on lettuce
   (Latuca sativa L.) response to added N along a gradient of M-2 values,
   and to develop an N recommendation model. Twenty-four N fertilization
   experiments were conducted from 2002 to 2006 in organic soils of
   southwestern Quebec. Each crop received four N rates from zero to
   120-150 kg N ha(-1) applied before seeding or in split applications. The
   relationship between N requirements by lettuce and STN was quadratic
   whether lettuce was seeded or planted. There were three STN fertility
   classes delineated by M-2 values of 1 and 5.5. The N recommendation
   model and its uncertainty were valuable for M-2 values up to 8.4. This
   approach provides a reliable test soil N to implement appropriate
   fertilizer recommendations for lettuce in organic soils.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated fatty acids can be converted into mono and dicarboxylic
   acids, which are applicably valuable materials, through oxidative
   cleavage reaction in the presence of a highly efficient catalyst/oxidant
   system. In this work, two types of advanced heterogeneous catalysts have
   been developed; (i) high surface area mesoporous tungsten
   oxide/gamma-alumina mixed metal oxide, and (ii) surfactant-capped
   tungsten oxide nanoparticles. Various technique including N-2
   adsorption/desorption isotherms, XRD, SEM, EDS, TGA and catalytic test
   were used to monitor the physicochemical and catalytic properties of
   these materials. The characterization results revealed that type (i)
   materials exhibit high surface area and narrow particle size
   distribution, and the used surfactant could quantitatively enough cap
   the surface of type (ii) materials. The catalytic activities of these
   materials in the oxidative cleavage of oleic acid with H2O2 as oxidant
   were investigated. GC-MS was used to determine the produced amounts of
   desired products, azelaic and pelargonic acids. The catalytic test
   results showed more than 90\% conversion for type (ii) catalyst in 5 h
   reaction at 120 degrees C with acceptable production yields for azelaic
   and pelargonic acids. The significantly higher activity of this catalyst
   compared to type (i) arises from the interesting surface properties of
   tungsten oxides nanoparticles, which make them able to exploit the good
   features of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the shear behavior of concrete beams reinforced
   with basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars. In this study, 10
   reinforced concrete beams with no transverse reinforcement, including 2
   beams reinforced with longitudinal steel bars, were constructed and
   tested until failure. The test variables were the longitudinal
   reinforcement ratio and the span-to-depth ratio of the beams. The test
   results were compared with predictions of different available codes and
   design guidelines. Shear design equations of the CAN/CSA-806-12 code and
   the JSCE-97 guidelines provided accurate predictions. However, the
   predictions of CAN/CSA-806-12 were not conservative in some cases,
   whereas those of the ACI-440.1R-15 and the CAN/CSA-S6-10 were
   conservative. The test results were combined with the experimental
   results of a large database, including 75 beams and one-way slabs
   reinforced with carbon, glass, aramid, and BFRP bars. The behavior of
   beams reinforced with BFRP bars was quite similar to that of beams
   reinforced with glass and aramid fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars.
   The test results demonstrate the potential of using BFRP bars as
   alternative reinforcement in concrete members.}},

   Water Storage and Flows of a Small Watershed}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{3D hydrological modeling was performed, using CATHY ( acronym for
   CATchment HYdrology model), with the basic objective of checking whether
   the model could reproduce the effects of subsurface agricultural
   drainage on stream flows and soil water storage. The model was also used
   to further our understanding of the impact of soil hydrodynamic
   properties on watershed hydrology. Flows simulated by CATHY were
   consistent with traditional subsurface drainage approaches and, for wet
   years, flows at the outlet of the study watershed corroborated well with
   observed data. Temporal storage variation analyses illustrated that
   flows depended not only on the amount of rainfall, but also on its
   distribution throughout the year. Subsurface agricultural drainage
   increased base and total flows, and decreased peak flows. Hydrograph
   separation using simulated results indicated that exfiltration was the
   most dominant process; peak flows were largely characterized by overland
   flow; and subsurface drain flow variations were low.}},

Abstract = {{Primary aluminum production is a very energy-intensive industry (similar
   to 13MWh per ton of aluminum produced), involving several complex
   processes within a plant. The paper presents a mass, energy and exergy
   analysis of an entire smelter. This work was motivated by the need to
   evaluate the potential for waste heat recovery/thermal integration in
   such a plant. Three of the main sectors of a smelter are studied, namely
   the carbon anode production, the electrolytic reduction and the casting.
   The analysis is applied to a typical smelter producing 260000 MTAl per
   year. It was found that the most important waste heat source is the
   exhaust gases, with an exergy of 0.57MWh per ton of aluminum produced.
   The total exergy destroyed in the plant was found to be around
   7.7MWh/MTAl. The potential for doing useful work associated with heat
   dissipated at process boundaries is also evaluated. Results highlight
   sources of thermodynamic inefficiencies and indicate where exergy is
   mainly destroyed throughout the plant. The results contribute in
   developing a better understanding of the energy and exergy flow within a
   smelter. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study reviews current patients' prioritization systems and presents
   an innovative integrated three-step decisional framework in an attempt
   to overcome their limitations. In its first step, the proposed framework
   encompasses fuzzy logic, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to formalize
   stakeholders' goals and objectives. In the second step, the assessments
   made on each patient's condition are integrated by data envelopment
   analysis (DEA) and compared among them by a min-max regret approach
   (MRA) to obtain a primary prioritization of patients. The third step
   uses the delay ratio, the risk criteria score, and a profile matrix to
   introduce dynamic aspects related to the evolution of patients'
   condition and changes in the patient's list to the prioritization
   process. This three-step framework not only considers the surgery team
   members' opinions but also considers the patient's opinions in the
   decision-making process. The new framework has been implemented in the
   Orthopedic Surgery Ward, Shohada University Hospital, Iran, showing very
   promising results and advantages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{358-379}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, three different modifications of the basic Rankine
   thermodynamic cycle are proposed. The objective is to increase the
   thermal efficiency of power systems based on Rankine cycles. The three
   new systems are named ``Rankine-1SCR{''}, ``Rankine-2SCR{''}, and
   ``Rankine-3SCR{''} cycles, and they consist of linking a refrigeration
   cycle to the basic Rankine cycle. The idea is to use the refrigeration
   cycle to create a low temperature heat sink for the Rankine cycle. These
   three new power plant configurations are modeled and optimized with
   numerical tools, and then they are compared with the basic Rankine
   cycle. The objective function is the thermal efficiency of the systems
   (i.e., net power output (kW) divided by heat rate (kW) entering the
   system), and the design variables are the operating temperatures within
   the systems. Among the 84 x 84 (i.e., 7056) possible combinations of
   working and cooling fluids investigated in this paper, it is shown that:
   (i) the Rankine-1SCR system is advantageous for 1338 different fluid
   combinations, (ii) the Rankine-2SCR system is advantageous for 772
   different fluid combinations, and (iii) the Rankine-3SCR system is
   advantageous for 768 different fluid combinations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study presents the simulation of hydrological processes and
   nutrient transport and turnover processes using two integrated numerical
   models: Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) (Arnold et al., 1998), an
   empirical and semi-distributed numerical model; and Modelo Hidrodinamico
   (MOHID) (Neves, 1985), a physics-based and fully distributed numerical
   model. This work shows that both models reproduce satisfactorily water
   and nitrate exportation at the watershed scale at annual and daily
   basis, MOHID providing slightly better results. At the watershed scale,
   both SWAT and MOHID simulated similarly and satisfactorily the
   denitrification amount. However, as MOHID numerical model was the only
   one able to reproduce adequately the spatial variation of the soil
   hydrological conditions and water table level fluctuation, it proved to
   be the only model able of reproducing the spatial variation of the
   nutrient cycling processes that are dependent to the soil hydrological
   conditions such as the denitrification process. This evidences the
   strength of the fully distributed and physics-based models to simulate
   the spatial variability of nutrient cycling processes that are dependent
   to the hydrological conditions of the soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Vaporization enthalpy is an essential property in various areas of
   science and engineering applications such as optimizing the
   transportation processes, designing the oil and gas production and
   processing facilities, and heat flux calculations. This work aims to
   develop an intelligent technique, namely Radial Basis Function (RBF)
   approach to predict the vaporization enthalpy of petroleum fractions and
   pure hydrocarbons. The model was coupled with an optimization algorithm
   namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the tuning parameters of RBF
   model. The model performance was evaluated through various graphical and
   statistical approaches. Results of the developed GA-RBF model were also
   compared with other literature correlations and intelligent models. It
   was found that the proposed GA-RBF model exhibits reliable results with
   acceptable accuracy for the prediction of experimental vaporization
   enthalpy data. In addition, results show that the model outperforms
   other literature models and correlations and exhibits better performance
   for prediction of experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Modeling viscosity of alcohols based on the CPA-EoS plus f -theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},

Volume = {{220}},

Abstract = {{Friction (f) theory is one of the methods for modeling viscosity of
   fluids. According to this theory, the viscosity of a fluid is obtained
   from dilute gas viscosity, and the viscosity of the residual friction.
   The residual friction is included in the van der Waals attraction and
   repulsive terms, which are calculated with an equation of state (EOS).
   In this study, we examined the capability of combining the CPA
   (Cubic-Plus-Association) Equation of State with the f-theory for
   estimating viscosity of different alcohols (methanol, ethanol,
   1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-octanol). Also,
   worth noting that CPA f-theory model performance, compared to PR
   f-theory and SRK f-theory models, shows better results. For the CPA
   f-theory model, the overall absolute average deviation (overall AAD) for
   2B scheme is approximately equal to 0.54\% and for the 3B scheme, it is
   approximately equal to 0.45\%, while the overall AAD for PR f-theory
   model is approximately equal to 1.13\% and for the SRK f-theory model is
   approximately equal to 1.15\%. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Surfactants have ability to reduce the interfacial tension between
   residual oil and water and give high recovery factor. Adsorption of
   surfactant onto the solid surface makes it less effective in reduction
   of interfacial tension in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications.
   Adsorption of Trigoonella foenum-graceum (TFG) as a nonionic surfactant
   on crushed sandstone rock was investigated in this work Conductivity
   technique was used to measure amount of surfactant adsorbed on crushed
   rock. Batch experiments were used to investigate the adsorption of
   surfactant on solid rock surface. In addition, different adsorption
   equilibrium and kinetic models were fitted to experimental data and
   parameters for each model were determined. Among the two and three
   equilibrium models, the Jovanovic and Brouers-Sotolongo models exhibited
   better predictions and were most suitable for prediction of surfactant
   adsorption. The kinetic adsorption of surfactant was best suited to
   pseudo-second order model. Furthermore, the experimental adsorption data
   were modeled using a method named GA-RBF. It was concluded that the
   proposed GA-RBF model is accurate in prediction of kinetic adsorption
   behavior of surfactant The results of this study can be useful in
   surfactant selection in FOR processes especially for chemical flooding
   schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complete stiffness analysis of a parallel manipulator considers the

   be applied to limited-DoF parallel manipulators. The experimental
   validation was performed by comparing differential wrench measurements
   with predictions based on stiffness analyses with increasing levels of
   detail. For this purpose, two passive parallel mechanisms were designed,
   namely, a planar 3DoF mechanism and a spatial 1DoF mechanism. For these
   mechanisms, it was shown that a stiffness analysis becomes more accurate
   if preloading and structural compliance are considered.}},

Title = {{Trajectory Generation for Three-Degree-of-Freedom Cable-Suspended
   Parallel Robots Based on Analytical Integration of the Dynamic Equations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a trajectory generation technique for three
   degree-of-freedom (3-dof) planar cable-suspended parallel robots. Based
   on the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the robot, positive constant
   ratios between cable tensions and cable lengths are assumed. This
   assumption allows the transformation of the dynamic equations into
   linear differential equations with constant coefficients for the
   positioning part, while the orientation equation becomes a pendulum-like
   differential equation for which accurate solutions can be found in the
   literature. The integration of the differential equations is shown to
   yield families of translational trajectories and associated special
   frequencies. This result generalizes the special cases previously
   identified in the literature. Combining the results obtained with
   translational trajectories and rotational trajectories, more general
   combined motions are analyzed. Examples are given in order to
   demonstrate the results. Because of the initial assumption on which the
   proposed method is based, the ratio between cable forces and cable
   lengths is constant and hence always positive, which ensures that all
   cables remain under tension. Therefore, the acceleration vector remains
   in the column space of the Jacobian matrix, which means that the
   mechanism can smoothly pass through kinematic singularities. The
   proposed trajectory planning approach can be used to plan dynamic
   trajectories that extend beyond the static workspace of the mechanism.}},

   offshore floating applications}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{51-62}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional modeling of liquid drainage dynamics in vertical,
   inclined and oscillating packed bed reactors is virtually inexistent in
   the literature. An attempt was made in this work where liquid drainage
   dynamics in vertical, inclined and oscillating packed bed reactors was
   analyzed via an unsteady-state three-dimensional two-fluid hydrodynamic
   model. Angular oscillations of the packed bed reactor between two angled
   symmetrical positions and between vertical and inclined position were
   considered while bed non-uniformity was described using radial porosity
   distributions. The simulation results highlighted the fully
   interpretable trends of the transient liquid flow in packed beds and
   underlined the differences in the transient behavior of the vertical,
   inclined and oscillating packed bed reactors. Although the initial
   period of liquid drainage was dominated by gravity regardless of bed
   configuration, the packed bed angle with respect to gravity direction
   had a significant impact on the liquid drainage dynamics. Cross-sections
   along streamwise direction both for static and oscillating inclined
   positions of the bed highlighted gas-rich uppermost and liquid-rich
   lowermost domains. Unlike vertical beds for which drainage occurred
   according to a quasi-plug flow of the liquid core region, drainage of
   inclined beds underlined 3D liquid flow structures with liquid-rich
   lowermost cross-sections which accelerated liquid withdrawal. Compared
   to the inclined bed case, liquid drainage was delayed under oscillating
   regimes as a result of reverse secondary flows induced by the column
   motion. The initial drainage process was controlled by the liquid flow
   in the bed lowermost part whereas oscillations between two symmetrically
   angled positions led to almost cross-sectionally uniform liquid drainage
   distribution. This is valuable and it is plausible that at long time the
   performance of packed bed reactors onboard offshore floating non
   stationary platforms is insignificantly affected by the oscillations
   between two symmetrically angled positions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   STAR-FORMING CLUMPS}},

Abstract = {{The dust emissivity spectral index, beta, is a critical parameter for
   deriving the mass and temperature of star-forming structures and,
   consequently, their gravitational stability. The beta value is dependent
   on various dust grain properties, such as size, porosity, and surface
   composition, and is expected to vary as dust grains evolve. Here we
   present beta, dust temperature, and optical depth maps of the
   star-forming clumps in the Perseus Molecular Cloud determined from
   fitting spectral energy distributions to combined Herschel and JCMT
   observations in the 160, 250, 350, 500, and 850 mu m bands. Most of the
   derived beta and dust temperature values fall within the ranges of
   1.0-2.7 and 8-20 K, respectively. In Perseus, we find the beta
   distribution differs significantly from clump to clump, indicative of
   grain growth. Furthermore, we also see significant localized beta
   variations within individual clumps and find low-beta regions correlate
   with local temperature peaks, hinting at the possible origins of
   low-beta grains. Throughout Perseus, we also see indications of heating
   from B stars and embedded protostars, as well evidence of outflows
   shaping the local landscape.}},

Title = {{A hybrid scenario cluster decomposition algorithm for supply chain

Abstract = {{We propose a Hybrid Scenario Cluster Decomposition (HSCD) heuristic for
   solving a large-scale multistage stochastic mixed-integer programming
   (MS-MIP) model corresponding to a supply chain tactical planning
   problem. The HSCD algorithm decomposes the original scenario tree into
   smaller sub-trees that share a certain number of predecessor nodes.
   Then, the MS-MIP model is decomposed into smaller scenario-cluster
   multi-stage stochastic sub-models coordinated by Lagrangian terms in
   their objective functions, in order to compensate the lack of
   non-anticipativity corresponding to common ancestor nodes of sub-trees.
   The sub-gradient algorithm is then implemented in order to guide the
   scenario-cluster sub models into an implementable solution. Moreover, a
   Variable Fixing Heuristic is embedded into the sub gradient algorithm in
   order to accelerate its convergence rate. Along with the possibility of
   parallelization, the HSCD algorithm provides the possibility of
   embedding various heuristics for solving scenario cluster sub-models.
   The algorithm is specialized to lumber supply chain tactical planning
   under demand and supply uncertainty. An ad-hoc heuristic, based on
   Lagrangian Relaxation, is proposed to solve each scenario-cluster
   sub-model. Our experimental results on a set of realistic-scale test
   cases reveal the efficiency of HSCD in terms of solution quality and
   computation time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents user-interactive and wireless-communicating
   radio-frequency (RF) textiles made from glass-metal-polymer composite
   fibers that interact with the user through touch-sensing and that relays
   the touch data through IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth protocols at 2.4 GHz

   and 2.4 GHz wireless communications using submillimeter
   glass-metal-polymer composite fibers imbedded into the textile host.
   Tests conducted with these user-interactive RF textiles have shown that
   the emissive performance in terms of radiation pattern, gain, and signal
   strength adequately address short-range wireless communications
   applications in compliance with Bluetooth protocols, and that the
   user-interaction is enabled through capacitive finger-touch sensing with
   a 1 ms time response. This approach demonstrates that glass-fiber
   textiles can be adequately designed for user-interactive and wireless
   communications applications addressing 2.4 GHz frequency bands while
   preserving the mechanical and cosmetic properties of the garments.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional numerical simulations of methane gas migration from

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to provide insight into
   the behavior of methane as it migrates from a leaky decommissioned
   hydrocarbon well into a shallow aquifer. The conceptual model includes
   gas-phase migration from a leaky well, dissolution into groundwater,
   advective-dispersive transport and biodegradation of the dissolved
   methane plume. Gas-phase migration is simulated using the DuMu(x)
   multiphase simulator, while transport and fate of the dissolved phase is
   simulated using the BIONAPL/3D reactive transport model. Methane
   behavior is simulated for two conceptual models: first in a shallow
   confined aquifer containing a decommissioned leaky well based on a
   monitored field site near Lindbergh, Alberta, Canada, and secondly on a
   representative unconfined aquifer based loosely on the Borden, Ontario,
   field site. The simulations show that the Lindbergh site confined
   aquifer data are generally consistent with a 2 year methane leak of 2-20
   m(3)/d, assuming anaerobic (sulfate-reducing) methane oxidation and with
   maximum oxidation rates of 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-3) kg/m(3)/d. Under the
   highest oxidation rate, dissolved methane decreased from solubility (110
   mg/L) to the threshold concentration of 10 mg/L within 5 years. In the
   unconfined case with the same leakage rate, including both aerobic and
   anaerobic methane oxidation, the methane plume was less extensive
   compared to the confined aquifer scenarios. Unconfined aquifers may
   therefore be less vulnerable to impacts from methane leaks along
   decommissioned wells. At other potential leakage sites, site-specific
   data on the natural background geochemistry would be necessary to make
   reliable predictions on the fate of methane in groundwater.}},

   methods by restriction fragment analysis of PCR-amplified 28S-rRNA from
   Algerian fermented raw bovine milk (Rayeb). Selected yeasts S.
   suaveolens, I. orientalis, K. marxianus and W. anomalus produced esters
   and higher esters which can exert a pertinent influence on the sensory
   characteristics of Rayeb. Viability of S. suaveolens and W. anomalus
   using three methods of drying (freeze-drying, convective drying, and
   spray-drying) and during 4 months of storage at 4 degrees C and 25
   degrees C in the darkness was studied. Immediately after each drying
   method, high survival was obtained using freeze-drying followed by
   convective drying in rice cakes and spray-drying respectively. During
   storage at 4 degrees C, convective drying provided better survival of
   yeast cultures of S. suaveolens and W. anomalus than freeze-drying. At
   25 degrees C of storage, convective and freeze-dried yeast cultures
   showed no significant loss of viable cells up to 2 months of storage.
   Spray-dried yeast cultures had the greatest loss of viable count during
   the 3 months of storage at 25 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Cranberry Gas Exchange under Short-term Hypoxic Soil Conditions}},
Journal = {{HORTSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{910-914}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Cranberries were grown under controlled environmental conditions to
   determine the effects of soil waterlogging on cranberry gas exchange in
   three growth stages and to investigate the recovery time after
   waterlogging. Photosynthesis declined by 28\% after the first day of
   waterlogging at the bud elongation stage and was 46\% lower after the
   fifth day. At the flowering stage, the reduction in photosynthesis
   started to be significant only after the fifth day, whereas no reduction
   was observed at the fruit development stage. Stomatal limitations were
   responsible, in part, for the observed decrease in photosynthesis since
   stomatal conductance (gs) declined by 68\% and 45\% after the fifth day
   of waterlogging during bud elongation and flowering, respectively. After
   water drained away in the saturated treatments, leaf photosynthesis
   remained lower than in the unsaturated control treatment for 1 to more
   than 10 days at the bud elongation stage. Our results demonstrate that
   short-term hypoxic soil conditions can alter cranberry gas exchange
   depending on plant growth stage, and suggest that adequate drainage or
   control of the water table depth is required to avoid the negative
   effects of soil waterlogging on cranberry yield.}},

Abstract = {{This article expands upon detrital zircon geochronology with a sampling
   and analysis strategy dating variably tectonized granitoid conglomerate
   clasts. Its purpose is to elucidate details of the provenance's
   tectonomagmatic history from deformation-relative age distributions. The
   method involves bulk samples of clasts, sorted based on the degree of
   internal ductile deformation. Isolating granitoid clasts, we divide them
   into three subsets: undeformed, slightly deformed, and deformed. Laser
   ablation, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb
   geochronology is performed on zircon separates of each subset. Our case
   study, involving the Permian Hongliuhe Formation in the southern Central
   Asian Orogenic Belt, analyzes each of the three clast subsets, as well
   as sandstone detrital samples, at three stratigraphic levels and yields
   a profile of the unroofed provenance. Clast age distributions exhibit
   different, wider-age spectra than sandstone samples, an effect of
   proximity to the respective provenance. They indicate a minimal lag
   time, implying rapid exhumation rates, whereas sandstone data alone
   would indicate a 90 Myr lag time. Early Paleozoic arc-building episodes
   appear as Ordovician peaks in sandstone data and Silurian-Devonian peaks
   in clast data, indicating a younging of magmatism toward proximal
   provenance. A magmatic hiatus starts in the Devonian, correlating with
   the latest age of deformed clasts, interpreted as timing of collisional
   tectonics. The detailed age spectra provide regional tectonic context
   and interpretation of processes, as well as more robust provenance
   interpretation than could be determined from sandstone samples alone.
   The variably tectonized clast detrital geochronology method removes
   human sampling bias and the practical limits of studying regional
   granitoid distributions.}},

   Carbon Anodes}},
Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{High quality baked carbon anodes contribute to the optimal performance
   of aluminum reduction cells. However, the currently decreasing quality
   and increasing variability of anode raw materials (coke and pitch) make
   it challenging to manufacture the anodes with consistent overall
   quality. Intercepting faulty anodes (e.g., presence of cracks and pores)
   before they are set in reduction cells and deteriorate their performance
   is therefore important. This is a difficult task, even in modern and
   well-instrumented anode plants, because lab testing using core samples
   can only characterize a small proportion of the anode production due to
   the costly, time-consuming, and destructive nature of the analytical
   methods. In addition, these results are not necessarily representative
   of the whole anode block. The objective of this work is to develop a
   rapid and non-destructive method for quality control of baked anodes
   using acousto-ultrasonic (AU) techniques. The acoustic responses of
   anode samples (sliced sections) were analyzed using a combination of
   temporal features computed from AU signals and principal component
   analysis (PCA). The AU signals were found sensitive to pores and cracks
   and were able to discriminate the two types of defects. The results were
   validated qualitatively by submitting the samples to X-ray Computed
   Tomography (CT scan).}},

   at Watershed Scale}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Winter road network management is a source of anthropogenic salinity in
   the Saint-Augustin Lake watershed (Quebec City, QC, Canada). To prevent
   the potential impact caused by road runoff involving de-icing salts
   (NaCl) and trace metals (Cd and Pb) on the watershed, a full-scale
   treatment chain system (including a detention basin, a filtering bed,
   and a constructed wetland) was built. Average Cl and Na concentrations
   in groundwater were higher in wells affected by road network (125 mg/L
   Cl and 64 mg/L Na) than in control wells (13 mg/L Cl and 33 mg/L Na)
   suggesting a contamination by de-icing salts. The monitoring of influent
   and effluent surface water in the treatment system has shown a seasonal
   dependence in NaCl concentrations and electrical conductivity values,
   being the highest in summer, linked with the lower precipitation and
   higher temperature. Concentration ranges were as follows: 114-846 mg/L
   Na and 158-1757 mg/L Cl (summer) >61-559 mg/L Na and 63-799 mg/L Cl
   (spring and autumn). The treatment system removal efficiency was
   significant, however with seasonal variations: 16\%-20\% Cl, 3\%-25\%
   Na, 7\%-10\% Cd and 7\%-36\% Pb. The treatment system has shown an
   interesting potential to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic salinity
   at watershed scale with higher expected performances in the subsequent
   years of operation.}},

   the occurrence and genetic variability of (pro)phages within the
   Bifidobacterium genus, a dominant bacterial group of the human infant
   microbiota. Here, we performed cataloguing of the predicted prophage
   sequences from the genomes of all currently recognized bifidobacterial
   type strains. We analysed their genetic diversity and deduced their
   evolutionary development, thereby highlighting an intriguing origin.
   Furthermore, we assessed infant gut microbiomes for the presence of
   (pro)phage sequences and found compelling evidence that these viral
   elements influence the composition of bifidobacterial communities in the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the collision-avoidance trajectory design and
   simulation of a virtual kinesthetic feedback system. The system has two
   sliders driven in two tracks, respectively, and produces virtual masses
   when the user holds and moves the system. Trajectory planning
   considering both the ideal and constrained scenarios in applications is
   carried out. A collision-avoidance trajectory is designed based on the
   quintic polynomial, and the influence of the time interval and the
   switching point is discussed. Simulations were performed to verify the
   function of the system. The results show that without constraints, the
   system can produce prescribed virtual masses. The displacements of the
   slider are affected by the error between the prescribed virtual mass and
   the real mass of the system. With the constraints of the tracks'
   lengths, the produced virtual masses are altered from the prescribed.
   Adjusting the time interval and the switching point could optimize the
   performance of the system when the geometric parameters of the system
   are set.}},

   under N-2 are mainly composed of hydrophilic functionalities, which
   explain their fast degradation upon exposure to an aqueous environment.
   In contrast, PPs synthesized under Ar lead to a slower degradation rate
   due to their hydrocarbon structure containing some hydrolyzable

Title = {{Objective interpretation of induced polarization tomography using a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{218-233}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The objective interpretation of induced polarization tomography for
   applications in periglacial environments is sometimes challenging using
   smoothness-regularized least square inversion because strong resistivity
   contrasts are often present. Ambiguities arise from the regularization
   process which smooths the contrast between layers and from artifacts
   created by the inversion. In periglacial environments, where frozen and
   thawed ground can coexist with large resistivity contrasts, such
   artefacts are often found in the models of electrical resistivity.
   To assess reliable cryohydrogeological models from the inversion of
   induced polarization tomography, quantitative interpretation criteria
   are needed. The present work describes a methodology based on
   forward-inverse modeling to build a cryohydrogeological model from
   induced polarization data and prior information using the resistivity
   and chargeability gradients to map transitions between adjacent layers.
   This methodology is tested on field-data acquired over a coarse grained
   aquifer within a glaciomarine deposit and ice-rich permafrost mounds
   within marine sediments. Delineation of the permafrost base is achieved
   despite the presence of an inversion artefact. The results of the
   interpretation are used to further constrain the inversion in order to
   map the ice-content based on the resistivity model and an empirical
   relationship. The proposed methodology provides a way to extract
   quantitative information even in difficult environmental settings. (C)

Abstract = {{In the first part of this study, asymmetric microcellular composites

   contents. High-density polyethylene, flax fiber, and azodicarbonamide
   were used for the matrix, reinforcement, and chemical blowing agent,
   respectively. From the samples produced, mechanical properties (tensile,
   flexion, torsion, impact) are analyzed in this second part. Mechanical
   properties were found to be strongly influenced by density reduction and
   natural fiber content. It was also found that fiber addition provides
   higher reinforcement in flexion than torsion and tension. Also, flexural
   modulus and impact strength were relatively unaffected by foaming agent
   content for the range of parameters studied. From the experimental data
   obtained, a simple mechanical model based on density profile is

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{524-530}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Currently, there are high dose rate afterloaders available that
   can drive two different radioactive sources simultaneously. The
   source-source and source-cable attenuations are not taken into account
   by current planning systems. The purpose of this work is to characterize
   these effects and their overall impact on clinically relevant metrics.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Ir-192 (Yb-169) Flexitron source is modeled
   within a Monte Carlo code, and its water dose distribution is evaluated.
   A second source (cable) is placed parallel at various distances to
   quantify the dose perturbations. The dual-source setup is then
   transposed to clinical prostate plans (n = 11). Each plan D-90 is
   compared to the single-source D-90. The worst-case scenario (two sources
   traveling in closely located positions) establishes the upper bounds of
   the deviations. Two setups are considered with sources constrained in
   catheter pairs or freely distributed. A metric proportional to the dwell
   times and R-2 (where R is the intersource separation) helps determine
   the source position in each configuration.
   RESULTS: The dose profiles vs. R-2 (3-20 mm) show a maximal dose
   reduction effect of 65\% (25\%) for Yb-169 (Ir-192) at small distances.
   A shadow region with at least 10\% dose difference extends up to 10 cm.
   A similar study with a steel drive cable shows similar behavior with a
   maximal decrease of 10\% (3\%) under irradiation of a Yb-169 (Ir-192)
   source. The relative D-90 difference with the single source setup is
   2.3\% on average, up to 3.7\%. It is obtained by superimposing the
   contributions from catheter pairs in the dual-source loading.
   CONCLUSION: Overall deviations observed in D-90 compared to a single
   source setup are not significant for all cases studied. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Despite the crucial role of epibenthic primary producers (cyanobacteria,
   green and red algae), no diversity curves for calcimicrobes and
   calcareous algae are available to assess the pyramiding paleoecology
   characterizing the Ordovician biodiversification episode. A total of 24
   taxa of calcimicrobes and calcareous algae are identified from a
   Dapingian to lower Katian succession of carbonate sedimentary rocks
   exposed at the Leyayilitag ridge, Bachu Uplift, Tarim Basin, northwest
   China. Calcimicrobes (14 taxa), Dasycladales (seven taxa), Bryopsidales
   (one taxon), and Cyclocrinales (two taxa) contribute to five distinct
   taphocoenoses characterizing a suite of carbonate mounds. In
   stratigraphic order, these are calathid sponge mounds, algal
   calcimicrobial mounds, algal mounds, algal reefs, and calcimicrobial
   mounds. Within the lower Katian Belodina confluens Zone, the diversity
   increases substantially from around 5 to more than 20 taxa per 2 Ma.
   This increase in diversity is based on new calcimicrobes (Bija,
   Ortonella, Garwoodia, Hedstroemia, Rothpletzella, Phacelophyton,
   Rauserina) and the diversification of Dasycladales and Cyclocrinales. By
   comparison, the global diversity of calcimicrobes and calcareous algae
   (derived from literature data) started to increase earlier, namely
   within the late Darriwilian Pygodus serra Zone (offset of about 4 Ma).
   This offset might be due to the peculiar lithology of the Sandbian
   Tumuxiuke Formation (condensed section of red nodular limestones bounded
   by disconformities). However, a similar temporal offset is recorded for
   calathid sponge mounds; therefore, the Tarim tectonic microplate (Tarim
   Block) might display an endemic-anachronistic character. The diversity
   curves of Ordovician benthic primary producers (calcimicrobes,
   calcareous algae) are similar to those recorded by some fossil groups,
   in particular eleutherozoan echinoderms.}},

Abstract = {{The cryopreservation of human lymphocytes is an essential step for the
   achievement of several cellular therapies. Besides, T cells are
   considered as promising actors in cancer therapy for their cytotoxic and
   regulatory properties. Consequently, the development of tools to monitor
   the impact of freezing and thawing processes on their fine distribution
   may be an asset to achieve quality control in cellular therapy. In this
   study, the phenotypes of freshly isolated human mononuclear cells were
   compared to those observed following one cycle of cryopreservation and
   rest periods 0 h,1 h and 24 h after thawing but before staining. T cells
   were scrutinized for their distribution according to naive, memory
   effector, regulatory and helper subsets. Flow cytometry analyses were
   done using eight-color antibody panels as proposed by the Human
   Immunophenotyping Consortium. Data were further analyzed by using
   conventional directed gating and clustering software, namely SPADE and
   viSNE. Overall, SPADE and viSNE tools were very efficient to monitor the
   outcome of PBMC populations and T cell subsets. T cells were more
   sensitive to cryopreservation than other cells. Our results indicated
   that submitting the thawed cells to a 1 h rest period improved the
   detection of some cell markers when compared to fresh samples. In
   contrast, cells submitted to a 24 h rest period, or to none, were less
   representative of fresh sample distribution. The heterogeneity of PBMC,
   as well as the effects of freeze-thaw cycle on their distribution, can
   be easily monitored by using SPADE and viSNE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The search for a degradable metal simultaneously showing mechanical
   properties equal or higher to that of stainless steel and uniform
   degradation is still an open challenge. Several magnesium-based alloys
   have been studied, but their degradation rate has proved to be too fast
   and rarely homogeneous. Fe-based alloys show appropriate mechanical
   properties but very low degradation rate. In the present work, four
   novel Zn-Mg and two Zn-Al binary alloys were investigated as potential
   biodegradable materials for stent applications. The alloys were
   developed by casting process and homogenized at 350 degrees C for 48 h
   followed by hot extrusion at 250 Tube extrusion was performed at 300
   degrees C to produce tubes with outer/inner diameter of 4/1.5 mm as
   precursors for biodegradable stents. Corrosion tests were performed
   using Hanks' modified solution. Extruded alloys exhibited slightly
   superior corrosion resistance and slower degradation rate than those of
   their cast counterparts, but all had corrosion rates roughly half that
   of a standard purity Mg control. Hot extrusion of Zn-Mg alloys shifted
   the corrosion regime from localized pitting to more uniform erosion,
   mainly due to the refinement of second phase particles. Zn-0.5Mg is the
   most promising material for stent applications with a good combination
   of strength, ductility, strain hardening exponent and an appropriate
   rate of loss of mechanical integrity during degradation. An EBSD
   analysis in the vicinity of the laser cut Zn-0.5Mg tube found no grain
   coarsening or texture modification confirming that, after laser cutting,
   the grain size and texture orientation of the final stent remains
   unchanged. This work shows the potential for Zn alloys to be considered
   for stent applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glycerolysis of triglycerides (corn oil) was carried out over CeO2

   results in an increased basic strength and amounts of strong basic
   sites. Moreover, the lixiviation of CaO in the glycerol at high
   temperature, which is the key problem in the glycerolysis reaction over
   CaO-based catalysts, was inhibited significantly. XRD, N-2
   adsorption-desorption isotherms and SEM results exhibit introducing CeO2
   increases the surface area, pore volume and pore size of CaO catalysts,
   which are beneficial to the catalytic activity. The 2CaO-1CeO(2)

Abstract = {{Interfacial tension (IFT) is a key parameter which affects the remaining
   oil in place and fluid distributions in an oil reservoir. Mobilization
   of trapped oil in a reservoir after primary and secondary recovery
   schemes, as part of a tertiary oil recovery, requires a true and
   accurate understanding of interfacial interactions between oil, brine
   and reservoir rock. This study presents an investigation of temperature,
   pressure and synthetic formation water salinity effects on interfacial
   tension of two carbonate oil reservoirs. A pendant drop instrument was
   used to perform the measurements. In addition, Least Square Support
   Vector Machine (LS-SVM) in combination with Coupled Simulated Annealing
   (CSA) was used to model the values of IFT. Results show that the IFT of
   reservoir A increases with increasing temperature, pressure and salinity
   of synthetic formation water and the IFT data for reservoir B increases
   with increasing pressure and salinity of synthetic formation water but
   decreases with increasing pressure. The results of modeling studies show
   that the developed model is accurate for prediction of experimental IFT
   data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, oil palm fibers (OFF) and clay particles were modified and
   then incorporated to reinforce high density polyethylene (HDPE). The
   hybrid composites were prepared and compounded with a compatibilizer by
   twin-screw extrusion followed by injection molding. The evolution of
   thermal, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical performances of the hybrid
   composites as a function of filler content was investigated. The
   morphological study showed that the alkali treatment of OFF fibers
   enhanced their surface interaction with the polymer, while the addition
   of a coupling agent increased the interfacial adhesion between both
   fillers and the polymer matrix leading to improved filler
   dispersion/distribution (homogeneity). The tensile properties results
   showed that the 12.5:12.5 hybrids composite had the best tensile
   properties with a gain of 49\% in Young's modulus and 11\% in tensile
   strength. For the dynamic mechanical characterization, an increase in
   the complex modulus was observed with filler addition. Finally, the
   thermal stability of the hybrid composites increased with clay addition
   which is more thermally stable than OFF. The results obtained confirmed
   the viability of the combination between fibers and particles, thus
   opening new perspectives for the use of these natural by-products. (C)

Abstract = {{A self-propelled flexible flapping wing 2D numerical model undergoing a
   combined pitching and heaving motion is presented. Since such freely
   moving foil experiences zero net thrust, a definition of efficiency for
   this kind of problem is proposed and discussed against other
   formulations found in the literature. It is also shown that the
   deviation motion of wings such as that found in natural flyers is likely
   a consequence of the fluid structure dynamics of the wings. The passive
   deviation motion observed in numerical simulations is either a
   consequence of a feathering mechanism referred to as rigid feathering or
   of the inertial displacement caused by the wing deformation. The effects
   of flexibility on the performance of the wing are also presented. It is
   found that flexibility may significantly enhance the efficiency in
   pressure-driven deformation cases. The rigid feathering mechanism is
   found to have an effect similar to that of the feathering caused by wing
   flexibility on the performances of pressure-driven deformation cases.

Title = {{Effects of heat treatment and acid washing on properties and reactivity
   of charcoal}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{101-113}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Due to its highly amorphous carbon structure and abundant minerals
   content, as received charcoal possesses several undesirable
   characteristics such as low density and electrical conductivity in
   addition to its extremely high air and CO2 reactivities. These
   disadvantages are the most challenging obstacle for using this material
   as an alternative for petroleum coke in anode manufacturing processes.
   In this work, heat treatment under inert conditions was found to be a
   useful method to improve the molecular structure of charcoal, during
   this process continuous growth of the more ordered carbon structure at
   the expense of the amorphous forms was detected using XRD and Raman
   spectroscopy. Consequently, an improvement in the physical properties
   and the reactivity of charcoal occurred. In addition, acid washing was
   employed to eliminate the inorganic minerals of the charcoal. It was
   found that combination between acid washing and heat treatment produced
   charcoal having lower reactivity and better physical properties. The
   burning behavior of the pretreated charcoal samples was found to be
   comparable to that of calcined petroleum coke. Accordingly, using the
   pretreated charcoal to substitute up to 10\% of coke in the anode recipe
   did not show a negative effect on the anode's reactivity to both air and
   CO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOLID STATE IONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{290}},
Pages = {{40-46}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sulfur-multi-walled carbon nanotube composites were synthesized via two
   different strategies of a simple ball milling process (S/MWCNT-1) and a
   two-step procedure of liquid-phase infiltration and melt diffusion
   (S/MWCNT-2). The influence of preparation method on the structure of the
   composite materials was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field
   emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As compared to
   the S/MWCNT-1 composite, the sulfur in the S/MWCNT-2 composite was
   highly dispersed and partially embedded into the pores and hollow tubes
   of carbon nanotubes, leading to suppress the shuttle mechanism and
   therefore improve the discharge capacity and the cycle stability. The
   S/MWCNT-2 composite showed an initial discharge capacity of 866 mAh
   g(-1) and a capacity retention of 69\% after 50 cycles at 0.5 C rate,
   much higher than S/MWCNT-1 composite. The impact of morphology of the
   composite electrodes on the electrochemical performance was further
   investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and SEM
   techniques. Compared with the S/MWCNT-1 composite, the S/MWCNT-2 cathode
   well maintained its homogeneous and porous morphology after 50 cycles
   and a less formation of passive layer on the cathode surface was
   observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   theory (DFT) have been carried out. The DFT simulation results confirmed
   that the interaction of ethyl xanthate with solvated copper hydroxides
   was more energetically favorable than with iron hydroxides. The
   simulations also showed that negatively-charged iron hydroxide
   complexes, should they arise at alkaline pH in the electrical double
   layer surrounding iron hydroxide precipitates, bring about no affinity
   vis-a-vis ethyl xanthate collector and quite contrarily, their formation
   and adsorption on the precipitate surface could inhibit the collector
   adsorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide decorated with MnFe204 microspheres composed a
   hybrid composite (MnFe2O4-G) that was synthesized by a facile and green
   strategy involving immobilizing the MnFe2O4 microspheres on the graphene
   nanosheets via a simple one -pot solvothermal route. The composites were
   characterized using transmission and scanning electron microscopy,
   Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and surface area measurements. It was
   demonstrated that the composite of single -layer graphene oxide with
   manganese ferrite magnetic micro spheres exhibited adsorption properties
   for efficient removal of glyphosate from contaminated water. The as
   -prepared graphene manganese ferrite composite was tested for the
   adsorption of glyphosate by analytical methods under diverse
   experimental conditions. With respect to contact time measurements, the
   adsorption of glyphosate increased and reached equilibrium within 8 h at
   25 degrees C with a maximum adsorption capacity of 39 mg g(-1) at 5
   degrees C. The Freundlich model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic
   model correlated satisfactorily to the experimental data. Thermodynamic
   studies revealed that the adsorption of glyphosate onto MnFe2O4-G was
   spontaneous, exothermic and feasible in the range of 5-45 degrees C.
   Therefore, the MnFe2O4-G hybrids synthesized in this research may offer
   an attractive adsorbent candidate for highly efficient removal of
   glyphosate from contaminated water for water treatment and purification
   processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An introduction to utilising the redundancy of a kinematically redundant
   parallel manipulator to operate a gripper}},
Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although parallel manipulators provide several benefits compared to
   similar-sized serial manipulators, they typically exhibit a limited
   rotational workspace. One approach to designing a parallel manipulator
   with infinite range of tool rotation around one axis is to introduce
   kinematic redundancy. This is typically achieved by extending a
   non-redundant mechanism with an additional actuator and a supplemental
   degree of freedom, while the degrees of freedom of the tool platform
   remain the same. The main drawback of this approach is the cost of the
   additional actuator. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of
   harvesting the motion in the additional degree of freedom to operate a
   gripper. The benefits of the proposed idea include saving the cost of a
   gripper actuator and reducing the mass of the manipulated platform.
   Additionally, the requirement to provide the manipulated platform with
   compressed air or electric power is removed. Several variants of a
   kinematically redundant manipulated platform with five degrees of
   freedom are introduced along with conceptual mechanical designs for
   transforming the redundant platform motion into the opening and closing
   of a gripper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Five Podoviridae Phages Infecting Citrobacter
   freundii}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Citrobacter freundii causes opportunistic infections in humans and
   animals, which are becoming difficult to treat due to increased
   antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to explore phages as
   potential antimicrobial agents against this opportunistic pathogen. We
   isolated and characterized five new virulent phages, SH1, SH2, SH3, SH4,
   and SH5 from sewage samples in Tunisia. Morphological and genomic
   analyses revealed that the five C. freundii phages belong to the
   Caudovirales order, Podoviridae family, and Autographivirinae subfamily.
   Their linear double-stranded DNA genomes range from 39,158 to 39,832 bp
   and are terminally redundant with direct repeats between 183 and 242 bp.
   The five genomes share the same organization as coliphage T7. Based on
   genomic comparisons and on the phylogeny of the DNA polymerases, we
   assigned the five phages to the T7virus genus but separated them into
   two different groups. Phages SH1 and SH2 are very similar to previously
   characterized phages phiYeO3-12 and phiSG-JL2, infecting, respectively,
   Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica, as well as sharing more
   than 80\% identity with most genes of coliphage T7. Phages SH3, SH4, and
   SH5 are very similar to phages KlF and Dev2, infecting, respectively,
   Escherichia coil and Cronobacter turicensis. Several structural proteins
   of phages SH1, SH3, and SH4 were detected by mass spectrometry. The five
   phages were also stable from pH 5 to 10. No genes coding for known
   virulence factors or integrases were found, suggesting that the five
   isolated phages could be good candidates for therapeutic applications to
   prevent or treat C. freundii infections. In addition, this study
   increases our knowledge about the evolutionary relationships within the
   T7virus genus.}},

Title = {{Consistency of scalar potentials from quantum de Sitter space}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Consistency of the unconventional view of de Sitter space as a quantum
   theory of gravity with a finite number of degrees of freedom requires
   that Coleman-De Luccia tunneling rates to vacua with negative
   cosmological constant should be interpreted as recurrences to
   low-entropy states. This demand translates into two constraints, or
   consistency conditions, on the scalar potential that are generically as
   follows: (1) the distance in field space between the de Sitter vacuum
   and any other vacuum with negative cosmological constant must be of the
   order of the reduced Planck mass or larger and (2) the fourth root of
   the vacuum energy density of the de Sitter vacuum must be smaller than
   the fourth root of the typical scale of the scalar potential. These
   consistency conditions shed a different light on both outstanding
   hierarchy problems of the standard model of particle physics: the scale
   of electroweak symmetry breaking and the scale of the cosmological
   constant. Beyond the unconventional interpretation of quantum de Sitter
   space, we complete the analytic understanding of the thin-wall
   approximation of Coleman-De Luccia tunneling, extend its numerical
   analysis to generic potentials and discuss the role of gravity in
   stabilizing the standard model potential.}},

Abstract = {{Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae produce and secrete multilamellar
   bodies (MLBs) when fed digestible bacteria. The aim of the present study
   was to elucidate the proteic content of MLBs. The lipid composition of
   MLBs is mainly amoebal in origin, suggesting that MLB formation is a
   protozoa-driven process that could play a significant role in amoebal
   physiology. We identified four major proteins on purified MLBs using
   mass spectrometry in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms
   governing MLB formation and, eventually, to elucidate the true function
   of MLBs. These proteins were SctA, PhoPQ, PonC and a protein containing
   a cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase (CDD) zinc-binding region. SctA is
   a component of pycnosomes, which are membranous materials that are
   continuously secreted by amoebae. The presence of SctA on MLBs was
   confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting using a specific
   anti-SctA antibody. The CDD protein may be one of the proteins
   recognized by the H36 antibody, which was used as a MLB marker in a
   previous study. The function of the CDD protein is unknown.
   Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses confirmed that the H36
   antibody is a better marker of MLBs than the anti-SctA antibody. This
   study is an additional step to elucidate the potential role of MLBs and
   revealed that only a small set of proteins appeared to be present on
   MLBs.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects are essential to future cloud
   computing. Further increase in optical transmission speed has been
   hindered by power consumption and limited bandwidth resources, for which

   80 Gb/s PAM operation of a silicon microring modulator (MRM) with an
   ultralow power consumption below 7 fJ/bit. We also report the first
   demonstration of PAM-8 modulation of MRMs in the Gb/s order, achieving
   error-free capability at 45 Gb/s, using 1 fJ/bit. To the best of our
   knowledge, these results feature the lowest power consumption, per
   transmitted bit, ever demonstrated at such high data rates. We further
   demonstrate PAM data transmission up to 64 Gb/s over 5 km. Simultaneous
   achievement of ultrafast modulation and ultralow power consumption is a
   critical step toward next-generation optical interconnects. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Total dry matter and proteins were differentially and preferentially

   of the extraction medium pH, CM concentration and salt concentrations

   most significant effect. The maximal total dry matter (42.8 +/- 1.18\%)
   extractability was obtained with 5\% CM at pH 12 without salt addition,
   whereas the maximal for total protein (58.12 +/- 1.47\%) was obtained
   with 15\% CM under the same conditions. The minimal extractability for
   the dry matter (26.63 +/- 0.67\%) was obtained with 5\% CM at pH 10
   without salt added and the minimal protein extractability was observed
   in a 10\% CM at pH 10, in 0.01 NaCl. Turbidity and f-potential
   measurements indicated that pH 5 was the optimum condition for the
   highest protein extraction yield. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that salt
   addition contributes to higher solubility of canola proteins

Abstract = {{Powder metallurgy steels frequently withstand cyclic loading in service.
   Therefore, it is of high importance to thoroughly understand their
   fatigue properties. A detailed study of the effect of microstructure
   heterogeneity on fatigue properties of sinter-hardened PM steels was
   performed using admixed nickel PM steels (FN0208) as well as pre-alloyed
   PM steels (FL5208). Specimens were pressed and sintered to a density of
   7.3 g/cm(3) in order to specifically investigate the effect of
   microstructural constituents on fatigue properties. Fatigue crack growth
   rates were measured at four different R-ratios, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7
   for both PM steels. The negative effect of increasing the R-ratio on
   fatigue properties was observed for both alloys. The crack propagation
   paths were studied using optical microscopy and the tortuosity of the
   crack paths were compared with their equivalent linear paths. This
   approach allowed us to determine the effect of microstructure in
   different fatigue conditions. Fatigue fracture surfaces were also
   studied using scanning electron microscopy. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that hot blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars
   in globular clusters present abundance anomalies of certain chemical
   elements in their atmosphere; some metals are overabundant while helium
   is underabundant. Vertical stratification of chemical species, including
   iron, is also found in the atmosphere of a number of these objects. The
   aim of our work is to do a detailed abundance analysis of BHB stars
   found in the field. We studied the stars HD 128801, HD 143459, HD
   213781, and HZ 27, using our high-resolution spectra in the visible
   region obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and
   also Feige 86, using existing Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle
   Spectrograph visible spectra from the ESO archives. We searched for
   vertical stratification of the elements identified in our five stars,
   with the ZEEMAN2 code and stellar model atmospheres of PHOENIX. We
   confirm here the star rotational and radial velocities previously found,
   along with their average abundances. For the three cooler stars in our
   sample (HD 128801, HD143459, and HZ 27), most elements detected are
   underabundant. For the two hotter stars (Feige 86 and HD213781), the
   abundances of most elements are near or above their solar value. Of all
   the elements studied, only phosphorus is clearly found to be vertically
   stratified in the atmosphere of HD213781. Marginal indications of
   vertical stratification of iron is observed for Feige 86. The chemical
   properties of the five field BHB stars are consistent with those of
   their globular-cluster counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at developing a biocomposite using polypropylene (PP)
   as the matrix and Argan nut shell (ANS) as reinforcement. Also,
   styrene-(ethylene-butene)-styrene triblock copolymer grafted with maleic
   anhydride (SEBS-g-MA) was used as a coupling agent. The samples were
   prepared by using extrusion compounding followed by injection molding to
   determine the effect of filler and coupling agent content on the
   morphological, thermal, mechanical, and hygroscopic properties of the
   biocomposites. SEM micrographs revealed that good ANS
   dispersion/distribution into PP was achieved with an important reduction
   of fiber pull-out, micro-spaces, and voids with coupling agent addition.
   This led to substantial improvement intension, torsion, and water
   absorption reduction due to improved interfacial adhesion. Although ANS
   particles did not significantly modify the thermal stability of PP, the
   use of a coupling agent increased it. The experimental data were
   compared with several theoretical models such Voigt, Reuss, Hirsch, and
   Tsai-Pagano to characterize the interfacial adhesion quality and to
   determine the elastic modulus of a single ANS particle. Finally, all the
   results show that Argan waste to produce PP biocomposites is an
   interesting avenue to effectively deal with agricultural wastes and
   develop valuable industrial and practical applications. (C) 2016

Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{With their large field of view, anamorphosis, and areas of enhanced
   magnification, panomorph lenses are an interesting choice for navigation
   systems for mobile robotics in which knowledge of the surroundings is
   mandatory. However, panomorph lenses special characteristics can be
   challenging during the calibration process. This study focuses on the
   calibration of two panomorph stereoscopic systems with a model and
   technique developed for narrow-angle lenses, the ``Camera Calibration
   Toolbox for MATLAB.{''} In order to assess the performance of the
   systems, the mean reprojection error (MRE) related to the calibration
   and the reconstruction error of control points of an object of interest
   at various locations in the field of view are used. The calibrations
   were successful and exhibit MREs of less than one pixel in all cases.
   However, some poorly reconstructed control points illustrate that an
   acceptable MRE guarantees neither the quality of 3-D reconstruction nor
   its uniformity in the field of view. In addition, the nonuniformity in
   the 3-D reconstruction quality indicates that panomorph lenses require a
   more accurate estimation of the principal point (center of distortion)
   coordinates to improve the calibration and therefore the 3-D
   reconstruction. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{We present a novel, fully-integrated, low-power full-duplex transceiver
   (FDT) to support high-density and bidirectional neural interfacing
   applications (high-channel count stimulating and recording) with
   asymmetric data rates: higher rates are required for recording (uplink
   signals) than stimulation (downlink signals). The transmitter (TX) and
   receiver (RX) share a single antenna to reduce implant size and
   complexity. The TX uses impulse radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) based on
   an edge combining approach, and the RX uses a novel 2.4-GHz on-off
   keying (OOK) receiver. Proper isolation (>20 dB) between the TX and RX
   path is implemented 1) by shaping the transmitted pulses to fall within
   the unregulated UWB spectrum (3.1-7 GHz), and 2) by space-efficient
   filtering (avoiding a circulator or diplexer) of the downlink OOK
   spectrum in the RX low-noise amplifier. The UWB 3.1-7 GHz transmitter
   can use either OOK or binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation
   schemes. The proposed FDT provides dual band 500-Mbps TX uplink data
   rate and 100 Mbps RX downlink data rate, and it is fully integrated into
   standard TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS within a total size of 0.8 mm(2). The total
   measured power consumption is 10.4 mW in full duplex mode (5 mW at 100
   Mbps for RX, and 5.4 mW at 500 Mbps or 10.8 pJ/bit for TX).
   Additionally, a 3-coil inductive link along with on-chip power
   management circuits allows to powering up the implantable transceiver
   wirelessly by delivering 25 mW extracted from a 13.56-MHz carrier
   signal, at a total efficiency of 41.6\%.}},

Abstract = {{Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is a fish pathogen known to
   have a rich plasmidome. In the present study, we discovered an isolate
   of this bacterium bearing an additional unidentified small plasmid.
   After having sequenced the DNA of that isolate by next generation
   sequencing, it appeared that the new small plasmid is a ColE1-type
   replicon plasmid, named here pAsa7. This plasmid bears a functional
   chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase-encoding gene (cat-pAsa7) previously
   unknown in A. salmonicida and responsible for resistance to
   chloramphenicol. A comparison of pAsa7 with pAsa2, the only known
   ColE1-type replicon plasmid usually found in A. salmonicida subsp.
   salmonicida, revealed that even if both plasmids share a high structural
   similarity, it is still unclear if pAsa7 is a derivative of pAsa2 since
   they showed several mutations at the nucleotide level. Transcriptomic
   analysis revealed that the cat-pAsa4 gene, another
   chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase-encoding gene, found on the large
   plasmid pAsa4, was significantly more transcribed than cat-pAsa7. This
   was correlated with a higher chloramphenicol resistance for isolates
   bearing pAsa4 compared with the one having pAsa7. Finally, a
   phylogenetic analysis showed that both CAT-pAsa4 and CAT-pAsa7 proteins
   were in different clusters. The clustering was supported by the identity
   of residues involved in the catalytic site. In addition, to give a
   better understanding of the large drug-resistance panel of A.
   salmonicida, this study reinforces the hypothesis that A. salmonicida
   subsp. salmonicida is a considerable reservoir for mobile genetic
   elements such as plasmids.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a clinical prototype with a wearable patient
   interface for microwave breast cancer detection. The long-term aim of
   the prototype is a breast health monitoring application. The system
   operates using multistatic time-domain pulsed radar, with 16 flexible
   antennas embedded into a bra. Unlike the previously reported,
   table-based prototype with a rigid cup-like holder, the wearable one
   requires no immersion medium and enables simple localization of breast
   surface. In comparison with the table-based prototype, the wearable one
   is also significantly more cost-effective and has a smaller footprint.
   To demonstrate the improved functionality of the wearable prototype, we
   here report the outcome of daily testing of the new, wearable prototype
   on a healthy volunteer over a 28-day period. The resulting data (both
   signals and reconstructed images) is compared to that obtained with our
   table-based prototype. We show that the use of the wearable prototype
   has improved the quality of collected volunteer data by every
   investigated measure. This work demonstrates the proof-of-concept for a
   wearable breast health monitoring array, which can be further optimized
   in the future for use with patients with various breast sizes and tissue
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers an innovative technique for rehabilitation of severely
   corroded reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams using fabric-reinforced
   cementitious matrix (FRCM). Eight RC T-beam specimens were constructed
   and tested to failure under four-point load configuration. One beam was
   neither corroded nor repaired to act as a benchmark. Seven beams were
   presubjected to accelerated corrosion for 5 months that corresponded to
   an average tensile steel mass loss of 22\%. Corrosion was restricted to
   the tensile steel located in the middle third of the beam span. Six
   corroded beams were repaired with either carbon or basalt FRCM system
   whereas one corroded beam was left unrepaired. The fabrics were
   internally embedded within the clear cover of the corroded-repaired
   region and/or externally bonded along the beam span. Corrosion damage
   significantly reduced the flexural capacity and ductility of the
   unrepaired beam. The basalt FRCM system could not restore the original
   flexural capacity of the beam whereas the carbon FRCM system fully
   restored the capacity. Doubling the amount of the internally embedded
   carbon FRCM layers slightly increased the strength gain but restored
   only 90\% of the original beam ductility. The use of a combination of
   internally embedded and externally bonded carbon FRCM layers was more
   effective in improving the flexural response than the use of same amount
   of FRCM layers internally embedded within the corroded-repaired region.

Abstract = {{After the introduction of a medical device into the body, adhesive
   proteins such as fibronectin (Fn) will adsorb to the surface of the
   biomaterial. Monocytes (MCs) will interact with these adsorbed proteins,
   and adopt either a proinflammatory and/or prowound healing phenotype,
   thereby influencing many blood interaction events including
   thrombogenesis. In this work, Fn adsorption as well as subsequent MC
   response and thrombus formation were investigated on two
   surfaces-modified polyetherurethanes (PEUs) using different surface
   modifiers: an anionic/dihydroxyl oligomeric (ADO) additive, known to
   enable cell adhesion, and a fluorinated polypropylene oxide oligomer
   (PPO), known to reduce platelet adhesion. Results indicated that at 24 h
   of MC culture, PEU-ADO and PEU-PPO promoted an anti-inflammatory
   character relative to the base PEU. Longer clotting times, based on a
   free hemoglobin assay, were also found on the two surface-modified PEUs
   relative to the native one, suggesting their potential for the reduction
   of thrombus formation. In presence of a Fn monolayer, the
   surface-modified PEUs conserved a lower thrombogenic character than the
   base PEU, and was however significantly decreased when compared to prior
   protein adsorption. Furthermore, Fn coatings increased the MC production
   levels of tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-10 at 24 h, while not
   affecting the anti-inflammatory effect of the modifications relative to
   the base PEU. This finding was most prominent on PEU-PPO, suggesting
   that the interaction of the adsorbed Fn with blood cells was different
   for the two additives. Hence, the results highlighted differentiating
   effects of Fn adsorption on specific blood activating processes related
   to inflammatory and thrombotic responses. (C) 2016 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate semiconductor optical amplifier

   each of three channels during single pumped SOA wavelength conversion
   are studied with respect to three different channel spacings (or
   frequency grids). The BER performance of all converted channels fall
   below the FEC threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3), even with a 50 GHz grid. The
   results show the tradeoff between channel spacing, CE, and BER power
   penalty. Closely packed channels, which clearly increase spectral
   efficiency, are also shown to decrease conversion power penalty,
   potentially counter balancing increased crosstalk levels. These results
   can be used to optimize routing and spectrum allocation strategy when
   SOA wavelength converter(s) are present in the optical link.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonic modulators have strong nonlinear behavior in phase
   modulation and frequency response, which needs to be carefully addressed
   when they are used in highcapacity transmission systems. We demonstrate
   a comprehensive model for depletion-mode Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs)
   on silicon-on-insulator, which provides a bridge between device design
   and system performance optimization. Our methodology involves physical
   models of p-n-junction phase-shifters and traveling-wave electrodes, as
   well as circuit models for the dynamic microwave-light interactions and
   time-domain analysis. Critical aspects in the transmission line design
   for high-frequency operation are numerically studied for a case of
   p-n-junction loaded coplanar-strip electrode. The dynamic interaction
   between light and microwave is simulated using a distributed circuit
   model solved by the finite-difference time-domain method, allowing for
   accurate prediction of both small-signal and large-signal responses. The
   validity of the model is confirmed by the comparison with experimental
   results for a series push-pull MZM with a 6 mm phase shifter. The
   simulation shows excellent agreement with experiment for high-speed
   operation up to 46 Gb/s. We show that this time-domain model can well
   predict the impact of the nonlinear behavior on the large-signal
   response, in contrast to the poor prediction from linear models in the
   frequency domain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a time-domain vibration observer and controller for
   physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). The proposed
   observer/controller aims at reducing or eliminating vibrations that may
   occur in stiff interactions. The vibration observer algorithm first
   detects minima and maxima of a given signal with robustness in regards
   to noise. Based on these extrema, a vibration index is computed and then
   used by an adaptive controller to adjust the control gains in order to
   reduce vibrations. The controller is activated only when the amplitude
   of the vibrations exceeds a given threshold and thus it does not
   influence the performance in normal operation. Also, the observer does
   not require a model and can analyze a wide time frame with only a few
   computations. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on two different
   prototypes that use an admittance controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In vitro digestion assays provide useful data for wild ruminant
   ecologists. It remains highly constraining, however, to conduct these
   assays in the field. We evaluated various proxies for in vitro digestion
   assays that use ruminal liquor from wild ruminants. The ruminal liquor
   of freshly killed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was used to
   measure in vitro true digestibility (IVTD), total gas, and volatile
   fatty acids (VFA) production of dominant summer and winter forage. We
   evaluated the ability of 4 proxies to predict these digestibility
   variables: 1) IVTD, total gas, and VFA produced with cow ruminal liquor;
   2) acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentration; 3) CO2 production from
   soil-forage mixtures; and 4) predictive models based on near infrared
   spectra (NIRS) of forages. Predictions using NIRS were best correlated
   with all deer digestibility variables (each r(2) > 0.93) with limited
   bias across forage species. Forage ADF and CO2 production from
   soil-forage mixtures were related with all digestibility variables (r(2)
   = 0.62-0.95). Digestion assays using cow ruminal liquor was relatively
   good for predicting IVTD (r(2) = 0.94) from deer ruminal liquor, but the
   weakest for predicting total gas (r(2) = 0.63) and VFA production (r(2)
   = 0.44). Calibrated NIRS models could substantially improve the
   prediction of in vitro digestibility variables. If access to NIRS
   technology or the ability to collect reference data with deer inocula
   for NIRS calibrations is impractical, forage ADF or CO2 production from
   soil-forage mixtures remain acceptable alternatives. Comparing the
   digestion kinetics and VFA production of wild and domestic ruminants is
   an innovative avenue for better understanding the adaptive ecophysiology
   of digestion by different herbivores. (C) 2016 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines velocity components in 3D and shear stress
   distributions in flows with adverse pressure gradient over a gravel-bed
   channel using three types of vegetation on banks, rice, straw and Typha
   stems. Results of this experimental study are compared with those for
   flows in the bare bank channel. Results show that the flows with adverse
   pressure gradient are not self-similar in vegetated and bare banks
   channels. The logarithmic law and parabolic law can be used to well
   describe flow in the inner and outer regions, respectively, but with
   different relative flow depths. Shear stress distributions depend on
   nature of bank roughness and the secondary flow effects because of small
   values of the aspect ratio and adverse pressure gradient. Quadrant
   analysis is performed to investigate the effect of different vegetation
   covers on the Reynolds stress distributions at the central axis of
   channel and near the vegetated banks. Vegetation covers influence the
   contributions of different quadrants to the shear stress distribution,
   showing that sweeps and ejections are dominant events for all vegetated
   banks for near bed region. However, near the water surface the
   contributions of outwards and inwards for banks with Typha stems are
   more important than those for rice and straw. Instead of using a single
   value for friction factor, for different vegetated banks, a range of
   friction factor has to be applied in river restoration projects.
   Vegetated banks result in an increase of more than 60\% in friction
   factor in comparison with that for bare banks under adverse pressure
   gradient flows. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It is now common knowledge that enzymes are mobile entities relying on
   complex atomic-scale dynamics and coordinated conformational events for
   proper ligand recognition and catalysis. However, the exact role of
   protein dynamics in enzyme function remains either poorly understood or

   biophysical observations and biological significance by first describing
   a number of common experimental and computational methodologies employed
   to characterize atomic-scale residue motions on various timescales in
   enzymes, and second by illustrating how the knowledge of these motions
   can be used to describe the functional behavior of enzymes and even act
   upon it. Two biologically relevant examples will be highlighted, namely
   the HIV-1 protease and DNA polymerase beta enzyme systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new modular lab on a chip design for
   multimodal neurotransmitter (NT) sensing and niosome generation based on
   a plug-and-play concept. This architecture is a first step toward an
   automated platform for an automated modulation of neurotransmitter
   concentration to understand and/or treat neurodegenerative diseases. A
   modular approach has been adopted in order to handle measurement or drug
   delivery or both measurement and drug delivery simultaneously. The
   system is composed of three fully independent modules: three-channel
   peristaltic micropumping system, a three-channel potentiostat and a
   multi-unit microfluidic system composed of pseudo-Y and cross-shape
   channels containing a miniature electrode array. The system was
   wirelessly controlled by a computer interface. The system is compact,
   with all the microfluidic and sensing components packaged in a 5 cm x 4
   cm x 4 cm box. Applied to serotonin, a linear calibration curve down to
   0.125 mM, with a limit of detection of 31 mu M was collected at
   unfunctionalized electrodes. Added sensitivity and selectivity was
   achieved by incorporating functionalized electrodes for dopamine
   sensing. Electrode functionalization was achieved with gold
   nanoparticles and using DNA and o-phenylene diamine polymer. The
   as-configured platform is demonstrated as a central component toward an
   ``intelligent{''} drug delivery system based on a feedback loop to
   monitor drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Supplemental feeding of honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera:
   Apidae) colonies in spring is essential for colony buildup in northern
   apicultural regions. The impact of pollen and syrup feeding on drone
   production and sperm quality is not well-documented, but may improve
   fecundation of early-bred queens. We measured the impact of feeding
   sucrose syrup, and protein supplements to colonies in early spring in
   eastern Canada. Drones were reared under different nutritional regimes,
   and mature individuals were then assessed in regard to size, weight, and
   semen quality (semen volume, sperm count, and viability). Results showed
   significant increases in drone weight and abdomen size when colonies
   were fed sucrose and a protein supplement. Colonies receiving no
   additional nourishment had significantly less semen volume per drone and
   lower sperm viability. Our study demonstrates that feeding honey bee
   colonies in spring with sucrose syrup and a protein supplement is
   important to enhance drone reproductive quality.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have shown a statistically significant increase of
   life-time risk of radiation-induced cancer from CT examinations. In this
   context, in Canada, the Quebec's provincial clinical center of expertise
   in radiation safety (CECR) has led a province-wide tour of 180 CT
   installations in order to: (i) evaluate the technical and functional
   performance of CT scanners, (ii) evaluate and improve radiation safety
   practices and (iii) initiate, with local teams, a CT dose optimization
   process. The CT tour consisted of a two day visit of CT installations by
   a CECR multidisciplinary team of medical physicists, engineers and
   medical imaging technologists (MITs) carried out in close collaboration
   with local teams composed of MITs, radiologists, physicists, engineers
   and managers. The CECR has evaluated 112 CT scanners since 2011.
   Optimization of CT protocols was performed in all centers visited. The
   average dose reduction obtained from optimization was 19\%, 24\% and
   21\% for adult head, thorax and abdomen-pelvis, respectively. The main
   recommendations often made by the CECR experts were: (1) the
   implementation of low-dose protocols for the follow-up of pulmonary
   nodules and for renal calculi, (2) the compliance to the prescribed scan
   range as defined by local guidelines, (3) the correct positioning of
   patients and (4) the use of bismuth shielding to reduce the dose to
   radiosensitive organs. The CECR approach to optimize CT doses to
   patients is based on the active participation of local stakeholders and
   takes into account the performance of CT scanners. The clinical
   requirements as expressed by radiologists remain at the core of the
   optimization process.}},

Abstract = {{Inadequate and (or) inconsistent soil sample preparation techniques
   (SPT) contribute to excessive variance, difficulties in soil test
   interpretation, and incorrect lime and fertilizer recommendations. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of SPT of five
   laboratories in Quebec (Canada) on chemical parameters measurement
   reliability. Samples of fine (G1), medium (G2), and coarse (G3) textured
   soils were collected from the surface layer. Three 500 g portions of
   each soil were sent to each laboratory for preparation. In addition, all
   samples were analyzed by the same laboratory for routine analyses.
   Nested ANOVA in a hierarchical model were performed with components of
   SPT interlaboratory reproducibility, SPT intralaboratory replicability,
   and intralaboratory soil analysis repeatability. Before samples were
   analyzed, we observed an important interlaboratory heterogeneity of
   particle size distributions for the same samples; due to sample
   preparation techniques, this can affect results of the analyses. Of all
   variables analyzed, the only significant, outside acceptable variations
   due to SPT were (1) pH(water) in G1; (2) PM-III, AlM-III, and
   (P/Al)(M-III) in G1 and G2; (3) KM-III, CaM-III, MgM-III and organic
   matter in G3; and (4) MnM-III and CuM-III in G1, G2, and G3. The steps
   in SPT, mostly drying and crushing, require standardization to reduce
   the variance of the entire soil testing process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the emissive properties of wearable
   wireless-communicating textiles made from multimaterial fibers for
   network applications at 2.4 GHz frequency. Tests conducted on these
   textiles have shown that, for on-body and off-body scenarios, the
   emissive properties in terms of return loss (S-11), radiation pattern,
   efficiency (gain), and bit-error rate (BER) adequately address
   short-range wireless communications applications at Mbps data-rate
   scales. The wireless-communicating textiles were fabricated by
   integrating polymer-glass-metal fiber composites into textile hosts
   using conventional weaving process. This multimaterial fiber approach
   provided good radio-frequency (RF) emissive properties in compliance
   with safety regulations while preserving the mechanical and cosmetic
   properties of the garments. These results demonstrate that multimaterial
   fiber textiles could be designed for short-range wireless network
   applications addressing the IEEE 802.11b/g/n and IEEE 802.15.4 standards
   at 2.4 GHz frequency.}},

Abstract = {{New high lithium ion conductor glass-ceramics with NASICON-type
   structure (Li1 + x + yAlxCryGe2 - x - y(PO4)(3), x + y = 0.5) were
   synthesized using melt-quenching method and converted to glass-ceramics
   through heat treatment. Influence of addition of different
   concentrations of aluminum and chromium in LiGe2(PO4)(3) glass ceramic
   was investigated. Substitution of Ge4+ ions by Al3+ and Cr3+ ions
   induced more Li+ ions in A(2) vacant sites and also changed the unit
   cell parameters and resulted in ionic conductivity improvement of
   glass-ceramics. The glass-ceramics were characterized by X-ray
   Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM),
   Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC), Complex Impedance Spectroscopy (CIS) and cyclic
   voltammetry (CV). The highest lithium ion conductivity of 6.65 x 10(-3)

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of field data collected over a desert playa in
   western Utah, USA in May 2013, the most synoptically active month of the
   year, as part of the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and
   Observations (MATERHORN) program. The results show that decreasing
   surface albedo, decreasing Bowen ratio and increasing net radiation with
   increasing soil moisture sustained a powerful positive feedback
   mechanism promoting large evaporation rates immediately following rain
   events. Additionally, it was found that, while nocturnal evaporation was
   negligible during dry periods, it was quite significant (up to 30 \% of
   the daily cumulative flux) during nights following rain events. Our
   results further show that the highest spatial variability in surface
   soil moisture is found under dry conditions. Finally, we report strong
   spatial heterogeneities in evaporation rates following a rain event. The
   cumulative evaporation for the different sampling sites over a five-day
   period varied from 0.1 to 6.6 mm. Overall, this study allows us to
   better understand the mechanisms underlying soil moisture dynamics of
   desert playas as well as evaporation following occasional rain events.}},

Abstract = {{Near-surface turbulence data from the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric
   Modeling and Observations (MATERHORN) program are used to study
   countergradient heat fluxes through the early evening transition. Two
   sites, subjected to similar large-scale forcing, but with vastly
   different surface and sub-surface characteristics, are considered. The
   Playa site is situated at the interior of a large dry lakebed desert
   with high sub-surface soil moisture, shallow water table, and devoid of
   vegetation. The Sagebrush site is located in a desert steppe region with
   sparse vegetation and little soil moisture. Countergradient sensible
   heat fluxes are observed during the transition at both sites. The
   transition process is both site and height dependent. At the Sagebrush
   site, the countergradient flux at 5 m and below occurs when the sign
   change of the sensible heat flux precedes the local temperature gradient
   sign change. For 10 m and above, the countergradient flux occurs when
   the sign change of the sensible heat flux follows the local temperature
   gradient sign change. At the Playa site, the countergradient flux at all
   tower levels occurs when the sign change of the sensible heat flux
   follows the local temperature gradient sign change. The phenomenon is
   explained in terms of the mean temperature and heat-flux evolution. The
   temperature gradient sign reversal is a top-down process while the flux
   reversal occurs nearly simultaneously at all heights. The differing
   countergradient behaviour is primarily due to the different subsurface
   thermal characteristics at the two sites. The combined high volumetric
   heat capacity and high thermal conductivity at the Playa site lead to
   small vertical temperature gradients that affect the relative magnitude
   of terms in the heat-flux tendency equation. A critical ratio of the
   gradient production to buoyant production of sensible heat flux is
   suggested so as to predict the countergradient behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{As continuous process, CO2 capture from natural gas is crucial for
   enhancing the heating value of the gas and reduction of CO2 emissions as
   greenhouse gas, as well. A commonly applied CO2 capture technology is
   based on absorption by amine solutions. A novel study of adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique is performed in this
   communication for modeling the CO2 loading capacity of MEA, DEA, and TEA
   aqueous solutions as function of system's temperature, partial pressure
   of CO2, and concentration of amines at aqueous phase. Development of
   ANFIS models are on the basis of the Gaussian membership function. The
   results obtained by the presented ANFIS models are analyzed by employing
   average relative deviation (\%ARD), absolute average relative deviation
   (\%AARD), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of
   determination (R-2) as performance indicators. The prediction
   capabilities of the proposed ANFIS models have also been compared to the
   previously developed LSSVM models. With accordance to the error analysis
   results, applying ANFIS soft computing approach leads to significant
   improvement for modeling the CO2 capture with amine solutions compared
   to the available LSSVM models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the pharmaceutical industry, leftover medications that have not been
   properly disposed not only damage the environment but also might turn
   into a peril to people's health if being redistributed illegally in
   undeveloped countries. In contrary, if they are returned to the
   pharmaceutical producer before their expiry dates, they can be sold at
   subsidized prices or donated in such countries. In this research, we
   explore the role of providing incentives to customers in order to
   facilitate leftover returns and improve the sustainability for a real
   pharmaceutical reverse supply chain (RSC). Moreover, this research
   investigates the effect of having a proper coordination method between a
   producer of medications and third party logistics (3PL) companies,
   responsible for collecting unwanted medications from customer zones.
   Finally, a technique is also proposed to share the RSC's saving among
   the producer and the 3PL companies. The experimental results on a real
   case study indicate that introducing incentives to customers could
   decrease the amount of uncollected medications from 18\% up to 6.5\%.
   Furthermore, having a proper coordination with 3PL companies could
   guarantee a full medication recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although to date some technologies producing bio-based phosphorus (P)
   fertilizers have been proposed and implemented, the efficient use of the
   recovered products is still limited due to legislative constraints and
   lack of insights in the P release with time and in the corresponding
   mechanisms. The aim of this work was to evaluate the fertilizer
   performance in terms of P release and use efficiency of recovered
   struvite, FePO4-sludge, digestate, and animal manure as compared to
   fossil reserve-based mineral triple superphosphate (TSP). First, product
   physicochemical characteristics and P fractions in the context of
   European fertilizer legislation were assessed. Next, a controlled
   greenhouse experiment was set up to evaluate plant reactions as well as
   changes of P availability in a sandy soil with high P status and a
   Rheinsand soil with low P status. Soil P fractions were determined in
   the extracts with water, ammonium lactate and CaCl2, and in soil
   solution sampled with Rhizon soil moisture samplers. Based on all
   results, it is worth conducting long-term field trials to evaluate the P
   release effect of struvite and digestate as compared to animal manure
   and TSP on different soil types with varying P status. These products
   showed promise as sustainable substitutes for conventional P fertilizers
   and could contribute to a more efficient use of P in agriculture. A
   refined classification of P application standards/recommendations in
   terms of soil P status, soil texture, and fertilizer characteristics,
   next to the crop P demand, is recommended. Moreover, the additional use
   of Rhizon samplers for determination of direct available P, including
   dissolved organic P, is proposed for better understanding and
   categorization of different P fertilizers in environmental and
   fertilizer legislations.}},

Title = {{Scaling and statistics of large-defect adverse pressure gradient
   turbulent boundary layers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{109-124}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to test similarity laws and scaling
   ideas, as well as characterize turbulence behaviour of large-defect
   adverse-pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers using six
   experimental and numerical databases including a new direct numerical
   simulation of a strongly decelerated non-equilibrium turbulent boundary
   layer. In the latter flow, at a moderate Reynolds number, the mean
   velocity profiles depart from the classical law of the wall throughout
   the inner region including in the viscous sublayer and they do not
   follow the log law. However, the agreement is excellent with the
   extended law of the wall that accounts for the pressure gradient for the
   viscous sublayer. The Reynolds stress components are not self-similar in
   the viscous sublayer when the velocity defect is important, but they
   scale reasonably well with the pressure-viscous scales.
   Detailed comparisons of the six different flows are made in the outer
   region. In order to do such comparisons, an outer region velocity scale
   analogous to the commonly defined free shear layer velocity scales is
   introduced. It is found that the investigated one-point velocity
   statistics in the upper half of large-defect boundary layers resemble
   those of a mixing layer: mean velocity defect, Reynolds stresses,
   turbulent kinetic energy budgets, uv correlation factor and structure
   parameter -< uv >/2k. The dominant peaks of turbulence production and
   Reynolds stresses are located roughly in the middle of the boundary
   layer. The profiles of the uv correlation factor reveal that u and v
   become less correlated throughout the boundary layer as the mean
   velocity defect increases, especially near the wall. The structure
   parameter is low in the large-defect disequilibrium boundary layers,
   similar to large-defect equilibrium flows and mixing layers and
   decreases as the mean velocity defect increases. All
   large-velocity-defect boundary layers analysed are found to be less
   efficient in extracting turbulent energy from the mean flow than
   zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers, even throughout the
   outer region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{227}},

Abstract = {{Aiming for a control of the morphology and phase purity of the final
   product, two commercially available organic templates, supplying
   tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) and methyltriethylammonium (MTEA(+)) cations
   in the synthesis mixture, were used for the hydrothermal synthesis of
   ZSM-12 zeolite. As key factors, alkalinity and water content of the
   synthesis mixture and silicon and aluminum source types were
   comprehensively studied using these two organic templates. All the
   products obtained were characterized by powder XRD, SEM, N-2
   physisorption, Si-29 and Al-27-MAS solid state NMR and TGA techniques.
   Using TEAOH organic template and organic Si and Al sources along with
   the proper adjustment of water and sodium hydroxide contents in
   synthesis mixture, mono-sized polycrystalline particles of ZSM-12 with
   high crystallinity and purity were synthesized. Alleviating TEAOH
   drawbacks, MTEA(+) organocation in the hydroxide form was used which led
   to the formation of mono-sized ZSM-12 single crystals. When using MTEAOH
   organic template, hydroxide ion and Na+ contents and the type of Al
   source were found to be playing major roles toward nucleation and growth
   of ZSM-12 crystals. Owing to increased alkalinity of the synthesis
   mixture, MTEAOH also promoted faster crystallization over a wide-range
   of Si/Al ratio (30 to infinity). The discrete mono-dispersed synthesized
   crystals possessed a well-defined cubic morphology with no impurities.

Journal = {{PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{278}},
Pages = {{126-144}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The uraniferous, Proterozoic Otish Basin of the southeastern Superior
   Province hosts shallow-dipping sills and northeast to northwest-trending
   dykes of the Otish Gabbro suite and the north-trending Matoush dyke.
   Otish Gabbro sills comprise two distinct geochemical groups that reflect
   different degrees of crystal accumulation in a common olivine-tholeiitic
   parental magma. Group 1 Otish gabbros approach liquid compositions,
   whereas Group 2 gabbros are crystal cumulates of olivine + plagioclase +
   clinopyroxene. The high Nb/Yb, La/Yb, Th/Yb and low Zr/Nb ratios of the
   Otish Gabbro sills reflect trace element enriched, mantle-derived
   parental liquids, modified by the addition of a crustal component. A
   north trending Matoush dyke records a second magmatic event in the Otish
   Basin, genetically unrelated to the emplacement of the Otish Gabbro
   sills. In contrast to the gabbros, the strongly altered Matoush dyke has
   more fractionated trace element patterns and strong enrichments in light
   rare earth elements (LREE) that are indicative of a lamprophyric
   affinity.
   The Otish Gabbro sills are part of a large ca. 2.17 Ga magmatic event
   that also generated the extensive Biscotasing and Payne River dyke
   swarms in the south-central and northeastern Superior Province,
   respectively. The contemporaneous mafic dyke swarms experienced
   relatively minor crustal contamination and their high Nb/Zr and Nb/Yb
   ratios suggest derivation from fertile mantle sources. Furthermore, the
   low Ti/Yb ratios of the ca. 2.17 Ga magmas are consistent with melting
   at relatively shallow depths (<100 km), implying removal of the depleted
   Archean lithosphere from a large portion of the Superior Province and
   replacement by a more fertile Proterozoic mantle. The variable
   geochemical composition of the ca. 2.17 Ga mafic magmas indicates
   melting of a compositionally heterogeneous mantle and appears
   inconsistent with a common distal mantle plume source. A more suitable
   petrogenetic model for the ca. 2.17 Ga dyke swarms of the Superior
   Province is vertical rise of mantle-derived magmas in a rifting
   environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A new composite connector for timber-concrete composite structures}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{84-92}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Timber-concrete composite (TCC) structures are emerging in several
   industrial applications as an efficient method for optimizing the
   structural performance and the cost of construction. Their effectiveness
   depends strongly on the kind of connection employed. In order to
   guarantee sufficient ductility to the structure without sacrificing its
   stiffness and strength, the connections have to be rigid, strong and
   deform plastically before the brittle collapse of the timber or concrete
   members. This work presents a new composite connector, which can be used
   to enhance the ductility of a structure without significant loss of
   stiffness at serviceability limit states. The studied composite
   connector consists of a composite cylinder made of ultra-high
   performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) shell with a steel
   cylindrical core. The UHPFRC enhances micro-cracking resistance and
   energy dissipation under large deformations. Performance characteristics
   of the connectors of various sizes have been evaluated using shear tests
   of connections. The results show that the connection stiffness is
   principally governed by the diameter of the concrete shell, while the
   connection resistance is principally governed by the diameter of the
   steel core. A beam on a Winkler foundation model has been applied to
   describe the behaviour of the composite connector in the shear tests.
   Finally, the composite beam theory has been applied to predict the
   structural behaviour of TCC beams with different parameters of the
   composite connectors. The results show that the diameters of the
   concrete shell and of the steel core of the connector can be
   conveniently varied to optimize the TCC beam performance by
   significantly enhancing its structural ductility without significant
   loss of flexural stiffness and load bearing capacity. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) has been demonstrated as valuable
   technique for the characterization of magnetic nanomaterials. To be
   analyzed by MFM techniques, nanomaterials are generally deposited on
   flat substrates, resulting in an additional contrast in MFM images due
   to unavoidable heterogeneous electrostatic tip-sample interactions,
   which cannot be easily distinguished from the magnetic one. In order to
   correctly interpret MFM data, a method to remove the electrostatic
   contributions from MFM images is needed. In this work, we propose a new
   MFM technique, called controlled magnetization MFM (CM-MFM), based on
   the in situ control of the probe magnetization state, which allows the
   evaluation and the elimination of electrostatic contribution in MFM
   images. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through a
   challenging case study, i.e., the analysis of superparamagnetic
   nanoparticles in absence of applied external magnetic field. Our CM-MFM
   technique allowed us to acquire magnetic images depurated of the
   electrostatic contributions, which revealed that the magnetic field
   generated by the tip is sufficient to completely orient the
   superparamagnetic nanoparticles and that the magnetic tip-sample
   interaction is describable through simple models once the electrostatic

Abstract = {{The sorption of water and methanol droplets on Teflon films, as well as
   on various representative classes of hydrocarbon-based proton exchange
   membranes (PEMs) was investigated using contact angle measurement (drop
   shape method) during wetting under ambient open-air conditions. Teflon
   films exhibited constant hydrophobic surfaces when contacted with water,
   but a significant sorption of methanol, The PEMs showed slow sorption of
   water, and a significant sorption of methanol. The differences in
   sorption of water and methanol on Teflon and PEMs arose from the
   match/compatibility in the surface free energies as well as polarities
   between a liquid and a membrane. The significant discrepancies in
   surface free energies and polarities between water (72.0 mJ m(-2) and
   70.1\%, respectively): and Teflon film (14.0 mJ m(-2) and 4.9\%,
   respectively) lead to a highly hydrophobic surface and no discernible
   sorption of water on Teflon films, while the relative similarity or
   minor discrepancy in surface free energies and polarities between
   methanol (22.5 mJ m(-2) and 17.0\%, respectively) and Teflon film (14.0
   mJ m(-2) and 4.9\%, respectively) results in a significant sorption of
   methanol on Teflon. The surface free energies of PEMs were calculated
   using the harmonic-mean approach; based on contact angle measurements
   rising both water and driodomethane as, probes. The results show that
   PEMs have initial surface free energies ranging from 44.1 to 54.0 mJ
   m(-2) along with polarities in the range of 20.8 to 29.1\%, for a
   selection of typical sulfonated polymers. The surface free energies of
   ionomers were principally contributed to by the nonpolar component, but
   the presence of polar groups in the polymer increased the polar
   component, leading to an increase in surface free energy. Of the PEMs
   investigated, sulfonated: poly(aryl ether ether nitrile) has a higher
   surface energy than those of other ionomers with similar sulfonate
   contents. The compatibility between water/methanol and PEMs was
   investigated on the aspect of surface free energies. The present study
   provides a plausible strategy to prescreen potential PEMs and optimize
   membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{The headloss prediction capability of a wastewater biofiltration model
   is evaluated on data from a full-scale tertiary nitrifying biofilter
   unit located in the Paris conurbation (Acheres, France; 6,000,000

   nutrient conversion and TSS filtration observations. In this paper the
   mass of extracted biofilm during biofilter backwash and the headloss
   value at the start of an operation cycle are first calibrated on sludge
   production estimations and relative pressure measurements over the year
   2009. The calibrated model is then used on two one-month periods in 2012
   for which hourly headloss measurements were acquired. The observed
   trends are correctly predicted for 2009 but the model exhibits some
   heavy daily variation that is not found in measurements. Hourly
   predictions stay close to observations, although the model error rises
   slightly when the headloss does not vary much. The global model shows
   that both nutrient conversion and headloss build-up can be reasonably
   well predicted at the same time on a full-scale plant.}},

Abstract = {{Spirals are gravity concentrators used for the valorization of coal and
   heavy minerals. Coarse hematite iron ores in Canada are usually
   concentrated by spirals. Spirals classify the particles according to
   their size and specific gravity. Several mathematical models were
   proposed to simulate the operation of spirals using a balance between
   the various forces acting on particles. However few models provide a
   method to account for wash water addition and the opening of concentrate
   ports that are two strategic variables for the operation of spiral
   classifiers. This paper proposes a model to incorporate these variables
   in a simulation scheme and validates the model with pilot plant data.

Abstract = {{Asphaltene precipitation causes several problems during different stages
   of oil production in the reservoirs. Experimental measurement of
   asphaltene precipitation is cumbersome, expensive and tedious. In this
   communication, the amount of asphaltene precipitation during titration
   experiments was modeled as a function of easily measureable parameters
   including temperature, type of solvent, and solvent to oil dilution
   ratio. A large data bank of asphaltene precipitation was collected from
   different sources, covering a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and
   different types of crude oils. Least square support vector machine
   (LSSVM) optimized with a stochastic algorithm named couples simulated
   annealing (CSA) was employed for the purpose of modeling. The data bank
   was divided into four sections based on the type of solvent and solvent
   to oil dilution ratio. Subsequently, for each section a model was
   proposed and, the results showed that all of the proposed models can
   predict the amount of asphaltene precipitation with enough accuracy. In
   general, the proposed CSA-LSSVM models can predict asphaltene
   precipitation with an average absolute relative error of 9.46\%. The
   proposed models were compared to pre-existing models and both graphical
   and statistical analyses indicated the superiority of the proposed
   CSA-LSSVM models over the pre-existing ones. Finally, a mathematical
   model was used which not only defines the applicability domain of the
   proposed models, but also evaluates the quality of experimental data and
   detects the probable outliers. The results demonstrated that all of the
   proposed models are statistically valid and only 3.3\% of the data may
   be recognized as the probable outliers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{822}},

Abstract = {{We perform a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of
   isolated dwarf galaxies to compare different metal mixing models. In
   particular, we examine the role of diffusion in the production of
   enriched outflows and in determining the metallicity distributions of
   gas and stars. We investigate different diffusion strengths by changing
   the pre-factor of the diffusion coefficient, by varying how the
   diffusion coefficient is calculated from the local velocity
   distribution, and by varying whether the speed of sound is included as a
   velocity term. Stronger diffusion produces a tighter {[}O/Fe]-{[}Fe/H]
   distribution in the gas and cuts off the gas metallicity distribution
   function at lower metallicities. Diffusion suppresses the formation of
   low-metallicity stars, even with weak diffusion, and also strips metals
   from enriched outflows. This produces a remarkably tight correlation
   between ``metal mass-loading{''} (mean metal outflow rate divided by
   mean metal production rate) and the strength of diffusion, even when the
   diffusion coefficient is calculated in different ways. The effectiveness
   of outflows at removing metals from dwarf galaxies and the metal
   distribution of the gas is thus dependent on the strength of diffusion.
   By contrast, we show that the metallicities of stars are not strongly
   dependent on the strength of diffusion, provided that some diffusion is
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Several cases of concrete deterioration involving sulfide-bearing

   guidelines are currently available to enable making a precise decision
   on the deleterious potential of aggregates containing iron sulfide

   protocol to evaluate the potential deleterious effects of
   iron-sulfide-bearing aggregates prior to their use in concrete. The
   findings of this paper are based on tests developed within the past few
   years as part of a major research project. The protocol is divided into
   three major phases: 1) total sulfur content measurement; 2) oxygen
   consumption evaluation; and 3) an accelerated mortar bar expansion test.
   Tentative limits are proposed for each phase of the protocol, which
   still need to be validated through the testing of a wider range of

Abstract = {{Stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) is one of the few algorithmic
   solutions available to optimize large-scale water resources systems
   while explicitly considering uncertainty. This paper explores the
   consequences of, and proposes a solution to, the existence of multiple
   near-optimal solutions (MNOS) when using SDDP for mid or long-term river
   basin management. These issues arise when the optimization problem
   cannot be properly parametrized due to poorly defined and/or unavailable
   data sets. This work shows that when MNOS exists, (1) SDDP explores more
   than one solution trajectory in the same run, suggesting different
   decisions in distinct simulation years even for the same point in the
   state-space, and (2) SDDP is shown to be very sensitive to even minimal
   variations of the problem setting, e.g., initial conditionswe call this
   algorithmic chaos. Results that exhibit such sensitivity are difficult
   to interpret. This work proposes a reoptimization method, which
   simulates system decisions by periodically applying cuts from one given
   year from the SDDP run. Simulation results obtained through this
   reoptimization approach are steady state solutions, meaning that their
   probability distributions are stable from year to year.}},

Title = {{Discrete Element Method Modeling of the Rheological Properties of
   Coke/Pitch Mixtures}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Rheological properties of pitch and pitch/coke mixtures at temperatures
   around 150 degrees C are of great interest for the carbon anode
   manufacturing process in the aluminum industry. In the present work, a
   cohesive viscoelastic contact model based on Burger's model is developed
   using the discrete element method (DEM) on the YADE, the open-source DEM
   software. A dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) is used to measure the
   viscoelastic properties of pitch at 150 degrees C. The experimental data
   obtained is then used to estimate the Burger's model parameters and
   calibrate the DEM model. The DSR tests were then simulated by a
   three-dimensional model. Very good agreement was observed between the
   experimental data and simulation results. Coke aggregates were modeled
   by overlapping spheres in the DEM model. Coke/pitch mixtures were
   numerically created by adding 5, 10, 20, and 30 percent of coke
   aggregates of the size range of 0.297-0.595 mm (similar to 30 + 50 mesh)
   to pitch. Adding up to 30\% of coke aggregates to pitch can increase its
   complex shear modulus at 60 Hz from 273 Pa to 1557 Pa. Results also
   showed that adding coke particles increases both storage and loss
   moduli, while it does not have a meaningful effect on the phase angle of
   pitch.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical investigation of the effects of
   chordwise flexibility on flapping wings at low Reynolds number. The
   numerical simulations are performed with a partitioned fluid-structure
   interaction algorithm using artificial compressibility stabilization.
   The choice of the structural dimensionless parameters is based on
   scaling arguments and is compared against parameters used by other
   authors. The different regimes, namely inertia-driven and
   pressure-driven wing deformations, are presented along with their
   effects on the topology of the flow and on the performance of a heaving
   and pitching flapping wing in propulsion regime. It is found that
   pressure-driven deformations can significantly increase the thrust
   efficiency if a suitable amount of flexibility is used. Significant
   thrust increases are also observed in zero pitching amplitude cases. The
   effects of the second and third deformation modes on the performances of
   pressure-driven deformation cases are discussed. On the other hand,
   inertia-driven deformations generally deteriorate aerodynamic
   performances of flapping wings unless the behavior of the wing
   deformation is modified by the presence of sustainable superharmonics in
   a way that produces slight improvements. It is also shown that wing
   flexibility can act as an efficient passive pitching mechanism that
   allows fair thrust and better efficiency to be achieved when compared to
   a rigid pitching-heaving wing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In temperate climates, covers with capillary barrier effects (CCBEs) are
   being used successfully to prevent oxygen fluxes from reaching covered
   potentially acid mine drainage (AMD) generating mine tailings. In
   northern climates, the more attractive option for mine site reclamation
   is insulation covers, which are designed to keep reactive materials
   frozen. This article suggests that CCBEs can simultaneously control
   oxygen migration and mine waste temperature to inhibit AMD generation.
   However, in northern conditions, where natural fine-grained materials
   needed for the CCBE moisture-retaining layer are not always available,
   soil-bentonite mixtures could be used instead. This laboratory study
   assessed-using instrumented columns-the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on
   the performance of three CCBEs made with crushed rock-bentonite
   mixtures. An oxygen diffusion test was developed to determine the
   effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen (De) and its sensitivity to
   freeze-thaw cycles. The results show good initial performance for the
   saturated CCBEs. However, the tested CCBEs are significantly affected by
   freeze-thaw cycles and have limited oxygen-limiting ability.}},

Title = {{RGD and BMP-2 mimetic peptide crosstalk enhances osteogenic commitment
   of human bone marrow stem cells}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{132-142}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) commitment and
   differentiation are dictated by bioactive molecules sequestered within
   their Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM). One common approach to mimic the
   physiological environment is to functionalize biomaterial surfaces with
   ECM-derived peptides able to recruit stem cells and trigger their
   linage-specific differentiation. The objective of this work was to
   investigate the effect of RGD and BMP-2 ligands crosstalk and density on
   the extent of hBMSCs osteogenic commitment, without recourse to
   differentiation medium. RGD peptide promotes cell adhesion via cell
   transmembrane integrin receptors, while BMP-2 peptide, corresponding to
   residues 73-92 of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2, was shown to induce
   hBMSCs osteoblast differentiation. The immobilization of peptides on
   aminated glass was ascertained by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
   (XPS), the density of grafted peptides was quantified by fluorescence
   microscopy and the surface roughness was evaluated using Atomic Force
   Microscopy (AFM). The osteogenic commitment of hBMSCs cultured on RGD
   and/or BMP-2 surfaces was characterized by immunohistochemistry using
   STRO-1 as specific stem cells marker and Runx-2 as an earlier osteogenic
   marker. Biological results showed that the osteogenic commitment of
   hBMSCs was enhanced on bifunctionalized surfaces as compared to surfaces
   containing BMP-2, while on RGD surfaces cells mainly preserved their
   sternness character. These results demonstrated that RGD and BMP-2
   mimetic peptides act synergistically to enhance hBMSCs osteogenesis
   without supplementing the media with osteogenic factors. These findings
   contribute to the development of biomimetic materials, allowing a deeper
   understanding of signaling pathways that govern the transition of stem
   cells towards the osteoblastic lineage.
   Statement of Significance
   For a long time, scientists thought that the differentiation of
   Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) into bone cells was dictated by growth
   factors. This manuscript shed light on other ligands that play a crucial
   role in regulating MSCs fate. In concrete terms, it was demonstrated
   that the osteoinductive effect of BMP-2 peptide is 2 folds improved in
   the presence of adhesive RGD peptide. Compared to previous works
   highlighting this synergistic cooperation between RGD and BMP-2
   peptides, the main strength of this work lies to the use of primitive
   human cells (hMSCs) and well-defined biomimetic material surfaces
   (controlled surface roughness and peptide densities). This work provides
   valuable insights to develop custom-designed in vitro cell culture
   models, capable of targeting the desired cell response. (C) 2016 Acta

Abstract = {{Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis
   worldwide. Transmission to humans occurs through consumption of
   contaminated food or water. The conditions affecting the persistence of
   C. jejuni in the environment are poorly understood. Some protozoa
   package and excrete bacteria into multilamellar bodies (MLBs). Packaged
   bacteria are protected from deleterious conditions, which increases
   their survival. We hypothesized that C. jejuni could be packaged under
   aerobic conditions by the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii or the ciliate
   Tetrahymena pyriformis, both of which are able to package other
   pathogenic bacteria. A. castellanii did not produce MLBs containing C.
   jejuni. In contrast, when incubated with T. pyriformis, C. jejuni was
   ingested, packaged in MLBs, and then expelled into the milieu. The
   viability of the bacteria inside MLBs was confirmed by microscopic
   analyses. The kinetics of C. jejuni culturability showed that packaging
   increased the survival of C. jejuni up to 60 h, in contrast to the
   strong survival defect seen in ciliate-free culture. This study suggests
   that T. pyriformis may increase the risk of persistence of C. jejuni in
   the environment and its possible transmission between different
   reservoirs in food and potable water through packaging.}},

Title = {{Cyclic peptides identified by phage display are competitive inhibitors
   of the tRNA-dependent amidotransferase of Helicobacter pylori}},
Journal = {{PEPTIDES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{8-15}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In Helicobacter pylon, the heterotrimeric tRNA-dependent
   amidotransferase (GatCAB) is essential for protein biosynthesis because
   it catalyzes the conversion of misacylated GluARNA(Gln) and AspARNA(Asn)
   into Gln-tRNA(Gln) and Asn-tRNA(Asn), respectively. In this study, we
   used a phage library to identify peptide inhibitors of GatCAB. A library
   displaying loop-constrained heptapeptides was used to screen for phages
   binding to the purified GatCAB. To optimize the probability of obtaining
   competitive inhibitors of GatCAB with respect to its substrate
   GluARNA(Gln), we used that purified substrate in the biopanning process
   of the phage-display technique to elute phages bound to GatCAB at the
   third round of the biopanning process. Among the eluted phages, we
   identified several that encode cyclic peptides rich in Trp and Pro that
   inhibit H. pylon GatCAB in vitro. Peptides P10 and P9 were shown to be
   competitive inhibitors of GatCAB with respect to its substrate
   GluARNA(Gln), with K, values of 126 and 392 mu M, respectively. The
   docking models revealed that the Trp residues of these peptides form
   pi-pi stacking interactions with Tyr81 of the synthetase active site, as
   does the 3'-terminal A76 of tRNA, supporting their competitive behavior
   with respect to GluARNA(Gln) in the transamidation reaction. These
   peptides can be used as scaffolds in the search for novel antibiotics
   against the pathogenic bacteria that require GatCAB for Gln-tRNA(Gln)
   and/or Asn-tRNA(Asn) formation. 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanocomposites based on Nylon 6 and nanocrystalline
   cellulose (NCC) were prepared by melt compounding. Then, morphological,
   thermal, and mechanical properties were analyzed for NCC content between
   0 and 7 wt\%. Morphological analyses showed different roughness in
   fractured surface of neat Nylon and its nanocomposites caused by the
   presence of NCC. Mechanical results showed that the optimum properties
   were obtained at 3\% NCC which could be related to relatively good NCC
   dispersion at low concentrations with good Nylon-NCC bonding. Overall,
   flexural (41\%) and tensile (23\%) moduli, as well as tensile strength
   (11\%) were increased up to 3\% of NCC. However, elongation at break and
   impact strength decreased with NCC addition. Finally, density and
   hardness showed only a small increase of 5 and 3\%, respectively. POLYM.

Abstract = {{Damage following static indentation of jute/hemp (50 wt.\% total fiber

   (SWIR) infrared reflectography and transmittography, infrared
   thermography (IRT), digital speckle photography (DSP), and holographic
   interferometry (HI), to discover and evaluate real defects in a laminate
   with a complex structure. A comparative study between thermographic data
   acquired in the mid- (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectrum
   bands, by pulsed (PT) and square pulse (SPT) thermography, is reported
   and analyzed. A thermal simulation by COMSOL (R) Multiphysics (COMSOL
   Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) to validate the heating provided is also
   added. The robust SOBI (SOBI-RO) algorithm, available into the ICALAB
   Toolbox (BSI RIKEN ABSP Lab, Hirosawa, Japan) and operating in the
   MATLAB (R) (The Math Works, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) environment, was
   applied on SPT data with results comparable to the ones acquired by
   several thermographic techniques. Finally, segmentation operators were
   applied both to the NIR/SWIR transmittography images and to a
   characteristic principal component thermography (PCT) image (EOFs) to
   visualize damage in the area surrounding indentation.}},

Title = {{Buoyant displacement flows in slightly non-uniform channels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{795}},
Pages = {{876-913}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We consider displacement flows in slightly diverging or converging plane
   channels. The two fluids are miscible and buoyancy is significant. We
   assume that the channel is oriented close to horizontal. Employing a
   classical lubrication approximation, we simplify the governing equations
   to furnish a semi-analytical solution for the flux functions. Then, we
   demonstrate how the non-uniformity of the displacement flow geometry can
   affect the propagation of the interface between the heavy and light
   fluids in time, for various parameters studied, e. g. the viscosity
   ratio, a buoyancy number and rheological features. By setting the
   molecular diffusion effects to zero, certain solution behaviours at
   longer times can be practically predicted through the associated
   hyperbolic problem, using which it becomes possible to directly compute
   the interfacial features of interest, e. g. leading and trailing front
   heights and speeds. For a Newtonian displacement flow in a converging or
   uniform channel, as the buoyancy number increases from zero, we are able
   to classify three flow regimes based on the behaviour of the trailing
   front near the top of the channel: a no-back-flow regime, a stationary
   interface flow regime, and a sustained back-flow regime. For the case of
   a diverging channel flow, the sustained back-flow regime is replaced by
   an eventually stationary interface flow regime. In addition, as the
   displacement flow progresses, the leading front speed typically
   increases (decreases) in a converging (diverging) channel, while the
   opposite is usually true for the front height. For the no-back-flow
   regime (i. e. with small buoyancy), the solution of the displacement
   flow at long times in all the geometries considered converges to a
   similarity form, while no similarity form is found for the other flow
   regimes. As the displacement flow develops, frontal diffusive effects
   are reduced (enhanced) in a converging (diverging) channel and multiple
   fronts are progressively less (more) present in a converging (diverging)
   channel. Regarding non-Newtonian effects, a shear-thinning fluid
   displacing a Newtonian fluid exhibits an increasingly fast front that
   has a short height in a converging channel. When a yield stress is
   present in the displaced fluid, it is possible to find residual wall
   layers of displaced fluid that are completely static. These layers
   disappear at a certain critical downstream distance in a converging
   channel while they appear at a critical distance in a diverging channel.
   Finally, the combination of strong buoyant and yield-stress effects can
   modify the destiny of a second front that follows the leading front.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of fission products, which include numerous isotopes of
   lanthanides, can impact the isotopic ratios of these elements in the
   environment. A cloud point extraction (CPE) method was used as a
   preconcentration/separation strategy prior to measurement of isotopic
   ratios of three lanthanides (Nd, Sm, and Eu) by inductively coupled
   plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS). To minimise polyatomic
   interference, the combination of interferents removal by CPE,
   reaction/collision cell conditions in He and NH3 mode and tandem
   quadrupole configuration was investigated and provided optimal results
   for the determination of isotopic ratio in environmental samples.
   Isotopic ratios were initially measured in San Joaquin soil
   (NIST-2709a), an area with little contamination of nuclear origin.
   Finally, samples collected from three sites with known nuclear
   activities (Fangataufa Lagoon in French Polynesia, Chernobyl and the
   Ottawa River near Chalk River Laboratory) were analysed and all
   exhibited altered Nd-143/145, Sm-147/149, and Eu-151/153. These results
   demonstrate the potential of CPE and ICP-MS/MS for the detection of
   altered isotopic ratio in environmental samples collected in area
   subjected to nuclear anthropogenic contamination. The detection of
   variations in these isotopic ratios of fission products represents the
   first application of CPE in nuclear forensic investigations of
   environmental samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolite ZSM-12 with different Si:Al molar ratios and one-dimensional
   channels with 12 oxygen ring apertures (12R) was synthesized and
   characterized by different techniques such as: X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area
   (BET), elemental analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed pyridine, and NH3
   temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The synthesized samples were
   tested as hydrocarbon (HC) trap adsorbents using toluene and ethylene as
   heavy and light probe molecules for HCs in the exhaust stream at engine
   cold-start. High heating rate desorption experiments were performed
   using the Phytronix Laser Diode Thermal Desorption system (S-960 LDTD)
   coupled with an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) chamber
   (Phytronix Technologies, Canada) after adsorption of toluene-ethylene
   mixtures. Three heating rates, which reflect the actual heating rates of
   the catalytic muffler, were used for the desorption process: 3 degrees
   C/s, 5 degrees C/s, and 9 degrees C/s. For all solids considered in this
   study, the two HCs desorbed above 240 degrees C, which is the light-off
   temperature of the three-way catalyst. Ag-ZSM-12 with different Si:Al
   ratios was found the most appropriate HC trapping adsorbent in spite of
   its slightly lower adsorption capacity. A high desorption temperature
   for ethylene and toluene was associated with the large density of strong
   Lewis acid sites in this solid.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally investigate postcompensation of nonlinear distortions
   induced by a wavelength converter (WC) based on four-wave mixing in a

   digital filter-based back-propagation (DFBP) method. We perform
   postcompensation of nonlinear distortions following single stage
   wavelength conversion of 5 Gbd 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
   We examine the DFBP performance in the presence of a degraded optical
   signal-to-noise ratio at the WC input, and explore the WC optimal
   operating conditions. Also, we experimentally demonstrate for the first
   time in the literature the dual stage wavelength conversion of QAM
   signals, in particular, 5 Gbd 64-QAM, and show that bit error rate below
   hard-decision forward error correction threshold is only possible with
   postcompensation of nonlinear distortions. These results are of
   importance for the development of wavelength-routed networks requiring
   successive wavelength conversion stages to enhance routing capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for the effective separation and determination of the most
   abundant actinides relevant to the nuclear industry (U, Th, Np, Pu and
   Am) was developed based on cloud point extraction (CPE) using
   H2DEH{[}MDP] (P,P-di-(2-ethylhexyl) methanediphosphonic acid) as a
   ligand. The extractability of actinides with varying concentrations of
   nitric acid and hydrochloric acid were assessed. The robustness of the
   method was demonstrated for environmental matrices such as reference
   materials and spiked liquid samples for the quantification of the gross
   actinide content. This analytical strategy may replace traditional
   sample preparation techniques used in radiological methods for gross
   measurements of radioactivity, and may act as a rapid screening tool in
   emergency situations. The developed method is a greener alternative to
   common radiochemical sample preparation techniques such as
   co-precipitation or evaporation. The formation of a small-volume
   surfactant-rich phase containing the complexed actinides enables rapid,
   highly selective and great enrichment of the analytes in this phase. The
   proposed method shows good extraction and separation yield compared to
   existing methods, since the surfactant-rich phase is soluble in water
   and can therefore be redispersed quantitatively in a medium compatible
   with mass spectrometry while providing fast isolation of the actinide
   content. Separation of actinides can be achieved after by wet ashing of
   the surfactant-rich phase obtained by CPE if coupled to the proper
   radiochemical separation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Abandonment of vineyards after uprooting has dramatically increased in
   last decades in Mediterranean countries, often followed by vegetation
   expansion processes. Inadequate management strategies can have negative
   consequences on soil quality. We studied how the age and type of
   vegetation cover and several environmental characteristics (lithology,
   soil properties, vineyard slope and so on) after vineyard uprooting and
   abandonment contribute to the variation patterns in total, HAc (acetic
   acid-method, HAc) and EDTA-extractable (ethylenediaminetetraacetic
   acid-method) concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in soils. We sampled
   141 points from vineyards and abandoned vineyard Mediterranean soils
   recolonized by natural vegetation in recent decades. The contribution of
   several environmental variables (e.g. age and type of vegetation cover,
   lithology, soil properties and vineyard slope) to the total and
   extractable concentrations of metals was evaluated by canonical
   ordination based on redundancy analysis, considering the interaction
   between both environmental and response variables. The ranges of total
   metal contents were: 0.01-0.15 (Cd), 2.6-34 (Cu), 6.6-30 (Pb), and 2992
   mg kg(-1) (Zn). Cadmium (11-100\%) had the highest relative
   extractability with both extractants, and Zn and Pb the lowest. The
   total and EDTA-extractable of Cd, Pb and Zn were positively related to
   the age of abandonment, to the presence of Agrostis castellana and
   Retama sphaerocarpa, and to the contents of Fe-oxides, clay and organic
   matter (OM). A different pattern was noted for Cu, positively related to
   vineyard soils. Soil properties successfully explained HAc-extractable
   Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn but the age and type of vegetation cover lost
   significance. Clay content was negatively related to HAc-extractable Cu
   and Pb; and OM was positively related to HAc-Cd and Zn. In conclusion,
   the time elapsed after vineyard uprooting, and subsequent land
   abandonment, affects the soil content and availability of metals, and
   this impact depended on the colonizing plant species and soil
   properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the avoidance of singularities of 3-RPR parallel
   mechanisms, for a given workspace. Two approaches are proposed: (1) the
   dimensional synthesis of such robots for a prescribed singularity-free
   workspace, and (2) their reconfiguration via actuation redundancy. The
   proposed approach for the dimensional synthesis of 3-RPR parallel
   mechanisms considers the constraints required for obtaining the optimal
   mechanism geometry in order to contain a desired workspace while
   avoiding singularities. A relaxation method based on the McCormick
   relaxation is presented to convexify the associated optimization
   problem. To prevent the relaxation from becoming too loose, a
   branch-and-prune algorithm is proposed, which converges to the globally
   optimal solution. Upon a different approach, a 3-RPR PM with
   self-reconfiguration capability is introduced. This redundant
   manipulator can change its geometry to obtain singularity-free paths
   between prescribed points inside its workspace. The proposed trajectory
   planning strategy works in 2 phases: the first where the mechanism acts
   as a 2-PRPR PM, and the second where it behaves as a 3-RPR PM. Finally,
   several case studies are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed algorithms. The running times of the proposed algorithms are
   remarkably low compared to those of other methods proposed in the
   literature. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Collaboration in transportation between two or more agents is becoming
   an important approach to find efficient solutions or plans. Efficiency
   can be measured in, for example, lower cost or more flexibility. An
   important aspect of the collaboration is to decide on how to share the
   benefits-for example, cost, profit, or resources. There are many sharing
   mechanisms or cost allocations proposed in the literature. Some are
   based on simple proportional rules and others are based on theoretical
   concepts found in game theory. We provide a survey on cost allocation
   methods found in the literature on collaborative transportation,
   including problems on planning, vehicle routing, traveling salesman,
   distribution, and inventory. A total of 55 scientific articles compose
   the main part of the survey, most of them published between 2010 and
   2015. We identify more than 40 cost allocation methods used in this
   stream of literature. We describe the theoretical basis for the main
   methods as well as the cases where they are used. We also report savings
   from the collaborations when they are based on industrial data. Some
   directions for future research are discussed.}},

Title = {{Sawdust and Bark-Based Substrates for Soilless Strawberry Production:
   Irrigation and Electrical Conductivity Management}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to optimize a soilless growing system for
   producing bare-root strawberry transplants in three organic substrates.
   Three trials were conducted in the Quebec City area to determine the
   productivity potential of a peat-sawdust mixture (PS25) and an aged bark
   (AB) material compared to conventional coconut fiber (CF) substrate. A
   first experiment was carried out to define appropriate irrigation set
   points for each substrate that allowed optimal plant growth and fruit
   yields. For all substrates, wetter conditions (irrigation started at
   -1.0 kPa for CF; -1.5 kPa for AB and PS25, relative to -1.5 kPa for CF;
   -2.5 kPa for AB and PS25) enhanced plant growth and fruit production.
   The second trial was carried out to test the productivity potential for
   commercial production of the three substrates using high-tunnels. After
   the addition of an initial fertilizer application to PS25, we
   successfully established bare-root plants that gave similar fruit yields
   than those in CF and AB. The productivity potential of PS25 and AB were
   further confirmed during a third trial under greenhouse conditions. The
   critical factor for plant establishment in PS25 was attributed to
   consistent N, P and S immobilization by microorganisms, as well as the
   retention of other elements (Mg2+, K+) in the growth media. Taken
   together, our results showed that PS25 and AB are promising alternative
   substrates to coconut coir dust for strawberry cultivation. This paper
   also provides a useful guide for strawberry cultivation in Quebec, and
   suggests future research that might be conducted to optimize soilless
   systems for cold-climate strawberry production in Northern America.}},

   extend the formalism developed for PMD in SMFs to describe OAM-PMD. The
   characteristics of the modal beat lengths, birefringence correlation
   lengths, and the mean value of OAM-PMD are investigated. A
   fixed-analyzer technique is proposed and demonstrated to characterize
   this phenomenon in OAM fibers. Two different types of OAM fiber are
   examined. The measured results are compared with the theoretical

Abstract = {{Clathrate hydrate dissociation data were measured for systems comprising
   of refrigerants (R134a, R410a and R507) + water + MgCl2 at varying salt
   concentrations. The ternary system for R134a + water + MgCl2 was
   measured at salt concentrations of (0.259, 0.546, and 0.868) mol.kg(-1)
   in the temperature range of (277.1-283) K and a pressure range of
   (0.114-0.428) MPa. Hydrate measurements for the \{R410a or R507\} +
   water + MgCl2 systems were measured at salt concentrations of (0.259 and
   0.546) mol.kg(-1) in the temperature range of (274.3-293) K and a
   pressure range of (0.154-1.421) MPa. The isochoric pressure-search
   method was used to measure the hydrate dissociation data. This study is
   a continuation of previous investigations which focused on obtaining
   hydrate dissociation data for R134a, R410a and R507 refrigerants in NaCI
   and CaCl2 aqueous solutions. The measured hydrate dissociation data can
   be used to design industrial wastewater treatment and desalination
   processes. The results show that the effect of salt concentration on
   hydrate formation is smaller for MgCl2 aqueous solutions compared to
   CaCl2 and NaCl as salt concentration increases. Modelling of the
   measured data is performed using a combination of the solid solution
   theory of van der Waals and Platteeuw, the Aasberg-Petersen et al.
   model, and the Peng-Robinson equation of state with classical mixing
   rules. The model is in good agreement with the measured hydrate
   dissociation data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown in literature that gas hydrates can be used in sugar
   milling processes as a means of increasing the solids content in aqueous
   carbohydrate systems. In order to fully understand the practicalities of
   using gas hydrate technology in this regard, it is important to
   accurately know hydrate formation/dissociation conditions. The aim of
   this study is to obtain hydrate dissociation conditions of various
   refrigerant hydrates in the presence of sucrose aqueous solutions. The
   data will be used to design an aqueous solution separation process. The
   measurements were performed using the isochoric pressure search method
   with a newly developed high-pressure apparatus. New experimental gas
   hydrate systems measured include R134a + water + (12 or 15) weight
   percent sucrose, R410a + water + (12 or 15) weight percent sucrose, and
   R507 + water + (12 or 15) weight percent sucrose. Measurements were
   undertaken in the temperature range between (276.5 and 289.1) K and
   pressures ranging from (0.136-0.962) MPa. In addition, a sucrose sample
   supplied by the Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI) in Durban, South
   Africa was also investigated. The results show that the presence of
   sucrose exhibits an inhibition effect on hydrate formation. This is seen
   by the shift of the equilibrium phase boundary to either higher
   pressures or lower temperatures. Additionally, through measurements
   performed on the SMRI sample it can be seen that the presence of
   additional carbohydrates (glucose and fructose) in the system increases
   the effect of inhibition on hydrate formation. A thermodynamic model
   based on the van der Waals -Platteeuw solid solution theory was used to
   model the hydrate dissociation conditions. A good agreement between the
   experimental measurements and the model was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An efficient process for the purification of anthocyanin monomeric
   isomers from wild blueberries of Lake Saint-Jean region (Quebec, Canada)
   was developed and easy scalable at industrial purpose. The blueberries
   were soaked in acidified ethanol, filtered, and the filtrate was cleaned
   by solid phase extraction using silica gel C-18 and DSC-SCX
   cation-exchange resin. Anthocyanin-enriched elutes (87 wt.\%) were
   successfully fractionated by preparative liquid chromatography. The
   major anthocyanins mono-galactoside, -glucoside and -arabinoside isomers
   of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin were isolated
   with a purity up to 100\% according to their LC-MS and H-1 NMR spectra.
   The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the obtained pure
   anthocyanins was evaluated. Delphinidin-3-galactoside has the highest
   capacity (13.062 +/- 2.729 mu mol TE/mu mol), and malvidin-3-glucoside
   the lowest (0.851 +/- 0.032 mu mol TE/mu mol). A mechanistic pathway

Abstract = {{This study addresses the problem of multi-objective optimal allocation
   and management of multiple battery energy storage (BES) units. The
   multi-objective genetic algorithm is first used to find the so-called
   Pareto front while minimisation of power losses and the total installed
   capacity of the BES units are simultaneous objective functions. A number
   of solutions are chosen and developed over one year to find the best
   schedule for BES utilisation taking into account the power factor (PF)
   of the charge and discharge modes. Results of studies on the IEEE
   reliability test system 1996 confirm the existence of an optimal
   solution for loss reduction. Optimal tuning of the charge and discharge
   PFs has also proven effective for marginal loss reduction and saving
   energy every day of the year. Finally, it is shown that the power loss
   would decrease, even during charge hours, if PFs of BESs are optimally
   tuned.}},

Abstract = {{The Skyrme Model seems unable to reproduce the small binding energy in
   nuclei. It was realized recently that near BPS Skyrme Models may be more
   appropriate in that regard since their solutions nearly saturate the
   Bogomol'nyi bound resulting therefore in a nuclear mass that is almost
   proportional to the baryon number A. We are interested in a class of
   such models which include terms up to order six in derivatives of the
   pion fields in the regime where the nonlinear sigma and Skyrme terms are
   assumed to be relatively small. We demonstrate that with a proper choice
   of potential, one can obtain constant baryon density configurations, as
   opposed to the usual shell-like configurations emerging from the Skyrme
   Model. This four-parameter model also lead to a very good agreement of
   the binding energy per nucleon B/A with respect to experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Objective: Hydrogen gas cavity is formed during in vivo
   degradation of magnesium implants. In many studies, the gas cavity is
   mostly punctured out subcutaneously. However, this procedure becomes
   inapplicable in certain internal surgeries; therefore, the effect of
   this gas cavity is worth further assessment.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the effect of hydrogen gas
   evolution on the mortality of rats and analysed the whole body capacity
   to relieve the gas. Porous pure-magnesium implants were implanted in the
   femoral bone defect of adult Sprague-Dawley rats up to 18 days, and
   their survival rate was calculated while the gas cavity size was
   measured, and its effect was analysed with support of radiographic and
   blood analysis.
   Results: The gas cavity was rapidly formed surrounding the implantation
   site and obviously decreased the rats' survival rate. The gas was
   observed to swell the surrounding implantation site by filling the loose
   compartments and then dispersing subcutaneously to other areas.
   Conclusion: The rat's whole body capacity was unable to tolerate the
   rapid and persistent hydrogen gas cavity formation as shown by high
   postimplantation mortality. Copyright (C) 2016, The Authors. Published

   the Internet. However, the localization of these destinations on the
   topology has a significant influence on the observed dynamics.
   We study the dynamics observed when the destinations are localized at a

   different dynamics. The local dynamics observed in our case is mainly a

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel architecture of kinematically redundant
   parallel mechanisms. This family of mechanisms is similar to the
   well-known Gough-Stewart platform, and it retains its advantages, i.e.,
   the members connecting the base to the moving platform are only
   subjected to tensile/compressive loads. The proposed architecture
   exploits kinematic redundancy to avoid singularities and extend the
   rotational workspace. The novel kinematic architecture is described, and
   the associated kinematic relationships are developed. Based on the
   derivation of the Jacobian matrices, it is shown that the singularities
   of this type of mechanism are governed by the orientation of passive
   links connecting the redundant legs to the platform. Grassmann geometry
   is then used to demonstrate that, given some simple geometric
   assumptions on the architecture, all singularities can be avoided by
   exploiting the kinematic redundancy. The orientational workspace is then
   discussed, and a graphical representation is provided for an example
   architecture comprising nine actuators, whose orientational workspace is
   shown to be very large. The translational workspace is also studied.
   Example trajectories are given in order to illustrate the capabilities
   of the mechanism to produce very large rotation angles without
   encountering singularities. Computer animations of the trajectories are
   provided in a multimedia extension of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{In cold regions, climate affects flexible pavement performance, such as

   can no longer be considered as fixed for pavement design. Climate
   simulations were performed for Quebec conditions to determine the
   evolution of the air freezing index over the coming decades. Using a
   relationship between average frost heave and the yearly roughness
   deterioration rate and a proposed method to consider decreasing air
   freezing index, the effect of climate change was quantified with respect
   to the 1971-2000 conditions. Thinner pavement structures are obtained
   with the calculation approach, and its effect was quantified in terms of
   materials and pavement life. It was shown that a reduction of 100 mm
   could be considered for pavements built on frost sensitive soils. In
   addition, the proposed method showed an increase of pavement life,
   quantified with roughness, for most of the cases considered.}},

Title = {{Impact of cryoconcentration on casein micelle size distribution,

   refrigerated storage}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE \& EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{68-76}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cryoconcentration combined with a cascade effect was used to concentrate
   skim milk up to 25.12\% total dry matter. Size, shape, and
   inter-micellar distance of casein micelles were characterized by
   ZetasizerNano-ZS, transmission electron microscopy, and ImageJ analyses.
   Flow properties of the cryoconcentrated skim milk were evaluated during
   5 weeks of storage under refrigerated condition at 4 degrees C. Milk
   color was also evaluated according to the L{*}, a{*}, and b{*} system.
   The cryoconcentrated skim milk obtained after three cryoconcentration
   cycles was characterized by a monomodal distribution of its micelles
   with a tendency to smaller casein micelles. Approximately 60\% of the
   total micellar volume was occupied by the casein micelles with a size of
   100-200 nm, less than 18\% of the volume with a size of 50-100 nm and
   only less than 1\% was occupied by micelles with a size >350 nm. This
   result shows that cryoconcentration changed the distribution of the mean
   size of the casein micelles to smaller units. No significant difference
   was observed on the inter-micellar distance. Cryoconcentration
   significantly improved the color of skim milk by increasing the L{*}
   value up to 67 which was similar to that of whole milk Transition from a
   Newtonian to a non-Newtonian behavior was observed from the fourth week
   storage with a slight increase of casein micelle size.
   Industrial relevance: A concentration procedure of skim milk based on a
   complete block cryoconcentration technique was proposed. Application of
   this sub-zero technology permitted the concentration of skim milk total
   dry matter up to 25\%. The casein micelle size was positively affected
   by moving the major part of the micelles toward the smaller size,
   whereas the inter-micellar distance was not affected. This new knowledge
   can be exploited in milk-based products to enhance the product
   stability. The cryoconcentrated skim milk color was positively affected
   since its L{*} value, which represents the milk whiteness, was
   significantly improved. The flow behavior of the cryoconcentrated milk
   was of Newtonian type up to 4 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C. The
   generated knowledge in this study can be easily used by the milk
   processing industry in order to make stable milk product with high dry
   matter content without adding milk powder, which negatively affects the
   product sensory properties (floury consistency). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In order to understand the impact of anode change on heat transfer and
   magnetohydrodynamic flow in aluminum smelting cells, a transient
   three-dimensional (3D) coupled mathematical model has been developed.
   The solutions of the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations
   were simultaneously implemented by the finite volume method with full
   coupling of the Joule heating and Lorentz force through solving the
   electrical potential equation. The volume of fluid approach was employed
   to describe the two-phase flow. The phase change of molten electrolyte
   (bath) as well as molten aluminum (metal) was modeled by an
   enthalpy-based technique, where the mushy zone is treated as a porous
   medium with a porosity equal to the liquid fraction. The effect of the
   new anode temperature on recovery time was also analyzed. A reasonable
   agreement between the test data and simulated results is obtained. The
   results indicate that the temperature of the bath under cold anodes
   first decreases reaching the minimal value and rises under the effect of
   increasing Joule heating, and finally returns to steady state. The
   colder bath decays the velocity, and the around ledge becomes thicker.
   The lowest temperature of the bath below new anodes increases from 1118
   K to 1143 K (845 degrees C to 870 degrees C) with the new anode
   temperature ranging from 298 K to 498 K (25 degrees C to 225 degrees C),
   and the recovery time reduces from 22.5 to 20 hours. (C) The Minerals,

Abstract = {{In this communication, a corresponding states-based model for the
   calculation/estimation of the gas compressibility factor (z-factor) of
   natural gasses is proposed. The method applies the gene expression
   programming (GEP) algorithm. The parameters of the new model comprise
   the pseudo-reduced pressure and pseudo reduced temperature. For
   assessing the performance and accuracy of the developed model, several
   statistical and graphical error analyses have been applied
   simultaneously. Additionally, comparisons have been made between this
   method and the most widely-used correlations and equations of state
   (EoS) available in the literature. Various statistical parameters are
   also used to evaluate the validity and the predictive capability of the
   newly developed method. Furthermore, the Leverage approach (Williams
   plot) is used to determine the realm of prediction capability of the new
   z-factor model and to detect any probable erroneous data points. The
   results obtained demonstrate that the newly proposed model is more
   reliable and more effective than the empirical models and EoS methods
   for prediction of z-factors of natural gasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This article reports on the development of a new method for the accurate
   and precise determination of the amount of scandium, Sc, in
   silicon-containing minerals, based on the use of tandem quadrupole
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS). The tandem
   quadrupole instrument enables new mass filtering configurations, which
   can reduce polyatomic interferences during the determination of Sc in
   mineral matrices. He and O-2 were used and compared as collision and
   reaction gases for the removal of interferences at m/z 45 and 61.
   Using helium gas was ineffective to overcome all of the spectral
   interferences observed at m/z 45 and particularly for Si-based
   interferences. However, conversion of Sc+ ions into ScO+ ions (after
   bombardment with O-2 in the octopole reaction system coupled with the
   use of the instrument in MS/MS mass-shift mode) provided
   interference-free conditions and sufficiently low limits of detection,
   down to 3 ng L-1, to accurately detect Sc. The accuracy of the proposed
   methodology was assessed by analyzing five different reference materials
   (BX-N, OKA-2, NIM-L SY-3 and GH). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cheese-whey, a major co-product of the dairy industry, has recently been
   the subject of many technological applications. We studied the
   bioconversion of whey into valuable bio-products such as a potential
   lactulose prebiotic and compounds with antioxidant properties. This
   paper examines efficiency, safety, and economics of electro-activation
   as an eco-friendly technology for a maximum valorization of whey. Thus,
   a bottom up approach was therefore addressed. The effect of 4
   experimental parameters low working temperatures (0, 10, and 25 degrees
   C), current intensities (400, 600, and 800 mA), volume conditions (100,
   200, and 300 mL), and feed concentrations {[}7, 14, and 28\% (wt/vol)]
   on lactose-whey isomerization to lactulose under electro-activation
   process were studied. Structural characteristics of whey proteins and
   antioxidant functionality were also investigated. The results showed a
   compromise to be reached between both parameters. Therefore, the maximum
   yield of 35\% of lactulose was achieved after 40 min of reaction at the
   working temperature of 10 degrees C under 400 mA electric current field
   and 100-mL volume conditions with using feed solution at 7\% (wt/vol).
   The isomerization of lactose to lactulose is accomplished by subsequent
   degradation to galactose, but only at a very small amount. Additionally,
   whey electro-activation showed significantly elevated antioxidant
   capacity compared with the untreated samples. The enhancement of
   antioxidant functionality of whey electro-activation resulted from the
   synergistic effect of its partial hydrolysis and the formation of
   antioxidant components that were able to scavenge free radicals. In
   conclusion, the findings of this study reveal that the whey treated by
   the safety electro-activation technology has both lactulose-prebiotic
   and antioxidant properties and could have a substantial application in
   the manufacture of pharmaceutical and functional foods.}},

   changing currently-used processes, the primary aluminum industry will
   need to consider capturing CO2 released in the electrolytic cells. In
   order to make the capture more economically attractive to the aluminum
   industry, the possibility of using a blended amine absorption solution
   which combines the advantages of two different amines (a fast reactivity
   from a cyclic polyamine, piperazine (PZ), and a high absorption capacity
   and low regeneration cost from a sterically-hindered alkanolamine) is
   considered in this work. Specific to an aluminum plant, not only the
   costs and benefits of a CO2 capture facility are evaluated, but also the
   possibility and cost of coupling the capture process with a waste heat
   recovery strategy. A mixture of 0.08g/g PZ and 0.32g/g AMP appears to be
   the most appropriate, reducing the capital costs by 25\% and operating
   costs by 29\% compared to the use of MEA (monoethanolamine) solutions.
   The capture cost is evaluated to be 65.10 \$/ton of CO2 avoided (without
   carbon tax). A thermal integration of the capture plant within the
   primary aluminum smelter could further reduce the cost to 57.57 \$/ton
   of CO2 avoided, or equivalently, 69.56 \$/ton of Al produced (without
   carbon tax).}},

Abstract = {{Among the gas dispersion properties affecting flotation column behavior,
   the bubble size distribution (BSD) is one of the most important. Its
   control could positively contribute to optimize the metallurgical
   performance. Experimental tests are carried out in a laboratory
   flotation column working with air and water. The objective is to
   regulate the BSD to a desired distribution set-point. BSD is measured in
   real-time using an image analysis method and a dynamic non-linear model
   (Wiener) for BSD, based on a log-normal distribution, is identified.
   Finally, a constrained model predictive controller is designed to
   control the BSD. The proposed approach leads to good control results,
   thus confirming the possibility to use this strategy to optimize the
   valuable mineral recovery by adequately selecting the BSD for a given
   particle size distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   fraction, the elastic and elastic-plastic properties of the
   nanocomposites are compared under biaxial and triaxial loading

   size is presented. When NCC and SWCNT have equal particle length and
   number but different particle diameter, both can produce similar
   improvement on biaxial mechanical properties. Finally, NCC and SWCNT are
   compared from an economic point of view to get similar mechanical
   performance (biaxial properties). The results show that NCC is about 646

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative analysis of state-of-the art image
   processing-based fire color detection rules and methods in the context
   of geometrical characteristics measurement of wildland fires. Two new
   rules and two new detection methods using an intelligent combination of
   the rules are presented, and their performances are compared with their
   counterparts. The benchmark is performed on approximately two hundred
   million fire pixels and seven hundred million non-fire pixels extracted
   from five hundred wildland images under diverse imaging conditions. The
   fire pixels are categorized according to fire color and existence of
   smoke; meanwhile, non-fire pixels are categorized according to the
   average intensity of the corresponding image. This characterization
   allows to analyze the performance of each rule by category. It is shown
   that the performances of the existing rules and methods from the
   literature are category dependent, and none of them is able to perform
   equally well on all categories. Meanwhile, a new proposed method based
   on machine learning techniques and using all the rules as features
   outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in the literature by
   performing almost equally well on different categories. Thus, this

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel experimental chamber with uniform wireless
   power distribution in 3D for enabling long-term biomedical experiments
   with small freely moving animal subjects. The implemented power
   transmission chamber prototype is based on arrays of parallel resonators
   and multicoil inductive links, to form a novel and highly efficient
   wireless power transmission system. The power transmitter unit includes
   several identical resonators enclosed in a scalable array of overlapping
   square coils which are connected in parallel to provide uniform power
   distribution along x and y. Moreover, the proposed chamber uses two
   arrays of primary resonators, facing each other, and connected in
   parallel to achieve uniform power distribution along the z axis. Each
   surface includes 9 overlapped coils connected in parallel and
   implemented into two layers of FR4 printed circuit board. The chamber
   features a natural power localization mechanism, which simplifies its
   implementation and ease its operation by avoiding the need for active
   detection and control mechanisms. A single power surface based on the
   proposed approach can provide a power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 69\%
   and a power delivered to the load (PDL) of 120 mW, for a separation
   distance of 4 cm, whereas the complete chamber prototype provides a
   uniform PTE of 59\% and a PDL of 100 mW in 3D, everywhere inside the
   chamber with a size of 27 x 27 x 16cm(3).}},

Abstract = {{Permeability as a fundamental reservoir property plays a key role in
   reserve estimation, numerical reservoir simulation, reservoir
   engineering calculations, drilling planning, and mapping reservoir
   quality. In heterogeneous reservoir, due to complexity, natural
   heterogeneity, non-uniformity, and non-linearity in parameters,
   prediction of permeability is not straightforward. To ease this problem,
   a novel mathematical robust model has been proposed to predict the
   permeability in heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs. To this end, a
   fairly new soft computing method, namely least square support vector
   machine (LSSVM) modeling optimized with coupled simulated annealing
   (CSA) optimization technique was utilized. Statistical and graphical
   error analyses have been employed separately to evaluate the accuracy
   and reliability of the proposed model. Furthermore, this model
   performance has been compared with a newly developed multilayer
   perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) model. The obtained
   results have shown the more robustness, efficiency and reliability of
   the proposed CSA-LSSVM model in comparison with the developed MLP-ANN
   model for the prediction of permeability in heterogeneous carbonate
   reservoirs. Estimations were found to be within acceptable agreement
   with the actual field data of permeability, with a root mean square
   error of approximately 0.42 for CSA-LSSVM model in testing phase, and a
   R-squared value of 0.98. Additionally, these error parameters for
   MLP-ANN are 0.68 and 0.89 in testing stage, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Two experimental small-scale cells have been constructed in the field to
   better understand passive mineral carbonation under natural atmospheric
   conditions in the ultramafic milling wastes of Thetford Mines (Quebec,

   amounts of antigorite, brucite and magnetite. These wastes could serve
   as significant and long-term CO2 sinks but the mechanisms and rates of
   mineral carbonation are not well understood. In this paper, the design
   of the experimental cells along with observations on gas composition,
   gas pressure, soil temperature, volumetric water content and mineral
   composition are presented with the objective to better understand the
   mineral carbonation processes under natural conditions and to propose a
   conceptual model for mineral carbonation at the field cell scale. Low
   CO2 concentrations (5-50 ppm) measured in the experimental cells and the
   presence of hydromagnesite suggest that natural and passive mineral
   carbonation is a significant process occurring in the magnesium-rich
   wastes (4 kg/m(3)/year of sequestrated CO2). In the proposed conceptual
   model, atmospheric CO2 (similar to 400 ppm) dissolves in the hygroscopic
   water of the piles, where weathering of magnesium silicates forms
   magnesium carbonates. Water saturation in the cells is relatively stable
   over time and varies between 0.4 and 0.65, which is higher than optimal
   saturation values proposed in the literature, reducing CO2 transport in
   the unsaturated zone. Gas-phase CO2 concentrations along with gas flow
   rate measurements in the cells suggest that the reaction is most active
   close to the surface and that diffusion of CO2 is the dominant transport
   mechanism in the wastes. Although the carbonation reaction is
   exothermic, no evidence of thermal convection has been observed in the
   experimental cells. This conceptual model will serve to support a
   reactive transport model in order to quantify and optimize the amount of
   CO2 that can be captured in chrysotile milling waste piles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to the design of multi-axial force
   sensing elements. We show that it is possible to measure multiple forces
   by detecting stress components-namely, normal stress, shear stress, and
   torque-with a single sensing element. Multi-axis force-torque sensors
   have become popular in the field of robotics, because they provide
   valuable information to robots during physical interaction; but these
   sensors have posed a challenge to researchers during fabrication, as
   they typically require multiple uni-axial sensing elements scattered
   over the mechanical structure of the force-torque sensor. We solve this
   problem by accomplishing the same functionality with just one sensing
   element. Our sensing element is composed of layers of elastomer, with
   conductive electrodes integrated within the two sensitive layers. When a
   force is applied, some (or all) of the electrodes within each layer are
   compressed, changing the capacitance and providing stress images. A
   stress-imaging analysis, thus, allows us to reliably infer the applied
   force. In this paper, we describe the design, fabrication, and
   characterization of our triaxial sensing element. After constructing the
   prototype, we validate its performance using a series of experiments.
   The results demonstrate that our stress-imaging analysis method does
   indeed allow the measurement of multiple force components with a single
   sensing element.}},

Abstract = {{High manganese austenitic steels such as Fe-20Mn-1.2C alloys are among
   the most promising candidates for biodegradable stents applications due
   to their high strength, high ductility and their chemical composition.
   In the current work, 14 day static in-vitro tests were performed in
   controlled atmosphere to assess the degradation behavior in three common
   pseudo-physiological solutions, i.e. commercial Hanks' (CH), modified
   Hanks' (MH) and albumin-enriched Dulbecco's modified phosphate buffered
   saline (DPBS) solutions. The degraded samples surfaces as well as the
   degradation products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR).
   Degradation of material and degradation products are shown to be
   strongly dependent on the test medium due to the presence of different
   ionic species such as HCO3-, CO3-, Ca2+ or phosphate groups. In both MH
   and CH solutions, the increased content of HCO3- ions seems to promote
   MnCO3 crystal growth on sample surfaces whereas the presence of albumin
   and high content of phosphate ions promotes the formation of an
   amorphous layer rich in phosphates, iron and manganese. (C) 2015

Pages = {{21-31}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper integrates production, maintenance, and quality for an
   imperfect process in a multi-period multi-product capacitated lot-sizing
   context. The production system is modeled as an imperfect machine, whose
   the status is considered to be either in-control or out-of-control. When
   the machine is out of control, it produces a fraction of nonconforming
   items. During each period, this machine is inspected and imperfect
   preventive maintenance activities are simultaneously performed to reduce
   its age, proportional to the preventive maintenance level. The objective
   is to minimize the total cost, while satisfying the demand for all
   products. Our optimization model allows for a joint selection of the
   optimal values of production plan, and the maintenance policy, while
   taking into account quality related costs. A solution algorithm is
   developed and illustrative numerical examples are presented. It is found
   that the increase in PM level leads to reductions in quality control
   costs. Furthermore, if the cost of performing PM is high to the point
   where it is not compensated for by reductions in the quality related
   costs, then performing PM is not justifiable. Finally, using
   non-periodic preventive maintenance with the possibility of different
   preventive maintenance levels may result in an improvement of the total
   cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the dynamic behaviour of two-layer composite
   beams, which is an important aspect of performance of structures, such
   as a concrete slab on a girder in residential floors or bridges. After
   briefly reviewing the composite beam theory based on Euler-Bernoulli
   hypothesis, the dynamic formulation is extended by including the effect
   of the relative longitudinal motion of the layers in the rotatory
   inertia, which can be particularly important for timber-concrete
   composite beams. The governing equation and the finite element model are
   derived in detail and validated by comparing the natural frequency
   predictions against other methods. A parametric analysis shows the key
   factors, which affect the rotatory inertia and its influence on the
   frequency of a single-span composite beam with different boundary
   conditions. The effect of the rotatory inertia on the first natural
   frequency of the composite beam appears below 5 percent; however, the
   effect on the higher natural frequencies becomes more important and not
   negligible in a full dynamics analysis. Finally, a simplified equation
   is proposed to account for the effect of the rotatory inertia on the
   calculation of the frequency of a composite beam for design purpose. (C)

Abstract = {{The interactions of diisobutyl dithiophosphinate with bare

   Experimental observations supported by DFT simulations concur in that
   attachment of the solvated collector to the activated sphalerite surface
   is through adsorbed lead cations or lead hydroxides where as for the
   bare sphalerite, the collector was most stable in its solvated state and
   not as an adsorbed specie. Accounting for solvation effects by including
   a swarm of water molecules in DFT simulations was necessary to infer
   plausible surface interactions between collector, solvent, and bare or
   lead-activated sphalerite. The experimental data and DFT simulations
   indicate, affinity of the collector toward surface-adsorbed lead species
   was predicted to form stable covalent bonds between collector sulfur

Abstract = {{The vaporization enthalpies of petroleum fractions are required in
   processing and transportation applications, as well as to optimize and
   design oil and gas production, and in heat flux calculations. A model
   was developed in this study for determining the vaporization enthalpies
   of pure hydrocarbon components and petroleum fractions. The model uses a
   least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm which is adjusted
   using a coupled simulated annealing (CSA) tuning tool. The inputs into
   the model are the boiling point temperature, specific gravity, and
   molecular weight. A comparative study was also undertaken between the
   method developed in the current study, neural network models, and some
   previously published empirical correlations. The Leverage approach was
   used to identify probable outlier data. It is found that only one data
   point from the vaporization enthalpy database in literature is an
   outlier. The results obtained indicate that the proposed CSA-LSSVM
   method is more rapid, accurate, and effective than available empirical
   correlations and neural network modeling for determination of the
   vaporization enthalpies of pure hydrocarbon components, as well as
   petroleum fractions. The LSSVM mathematical algorithm provides good
   results, as are indicated by an overall average absolute relative
   deviation of the predicted property from the real data of 1.16\%, and an
   overall squared correlation coefficient of 0.9982. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Asphaltene precipitation causes rigorous problems in petroleum industry
   such as: relative permeability reduction, wettability alteration,
   blockage of the flow, etc. Therefore, accurate determination of onset
   pressures of asphaltene precipitation is necessary. These pressures can
   be obtained by experimental measurements on representative samples of
   the crude oils; however, laboratory analysis of crude oil samples is
   costly, time consuming and cumbersome. In this communication, three
   simple and accurate expressions have been proposed for prediction of
   lower and upper onset pressures of asphaltene precipitation as well as
   saturation pressures. To this end, 33 crude oil samples were collected
   from open literature sources. Afterward, two constrained multivariable
   search methods, namely generalized reduced gradient (GRG) and successive
   linear programming (SLP), were employed for modeling and expediting the
   process of achieving a good feasible solution. Then, comparative studies
   were conducted between the developed equations and equations of state as
   well as empirical correlations. The results illustrate that the
   developed equations are accurate, reliable and superior to all other
   published models. The results show that the proposed equations can
   predict lower onset pressure, upper onset pressure and saturation
   pressure with average absolute percent relative errors of 5.04\%,
   3.93\%, and 3.81\%, respectively. Besides, it is found that molecular
   weight of heptane-plus fraction has the greatest impact on the lower
   onset pressure, while methane has the most significant effect on both of
   the saturation and upper onset pressures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, the Guggenheim equation was used to estimate the critical
   temperature (T-c) of 106 ionic liquids using experimental surface
   tension data as inputs. A group contribution (GC) and a Quantitative
   Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) model were also developed to
   correlate/predict the T-c of ionic liquids. It was shown that a lack of
   sufficiently large database for T-c lead's to the development of models
   with low prediction capability. The models output as well as the T-c
   values estimated from the surface tension data were compared with the
   critical temperatures calculated by the Valderrama et al. method. The
   results show that the Valderrama et al. method produces different data
   values compared with the values calculated by the Guggenheim equation.
   Neither the GC, QSPR, nor Valderrama's method is capable of reliable
   prediction of the T-c of ionic liquids. Consequently, the calculated T-c
   values are not reliable enough to be used in the development of
   corresponding state models for prediction of other thermophysical
   properties of ionic liquids. Any usage of critical properties of ionic
   liquids should be done with a serious caution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The effect of annealing on the surface hydrophilicity of various
   representative classes of hydrocarbon based proton exchange membranes
   (PEMs) is investigated. In all cases, a more hydrophilic membrane
   surface develops after annealing at elevated temperatures. The annealing
   time also had some influence, but in different ways depending on the
   class of PEM. Longer annealing times resulted in more hydrophilic
   membrane surfaces for copolymerized sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone)
   (SPEEK-HQ), while the opposite behavior occurred in sulfonated poly(aryl
   ether ether ketone) (Ph-SPEEK), sulfonated poly(aryl ether ether ketone
   ketone) (Ph-m-SPEEKK) and sulfonated poly (aryl ether ether nitrile)
   (SPAEEN-B). Increased surface hydrophilicity upon annealing results from
   ionic cluster decomposition, according to the ``Eisenberg-Hird-Moore
   model{''} (EHM). The increased surface hydrophilicity is supported by
   contact angle (CA) measurements, and the cluster decomposition is
   auxiliarily supported by probing the level of atomic sulfur (sulfonic
   acid) within different surface depths using angle-dependent XPS as well
   as ATR-FTIR. Membrane acidification leads to more hydrophilic surfaces
   by elimination of the hydrogen bonding that occurs between
   strongly-bound residual solvent (dimethylacetamide, DMAc) and PEM
   sulfonic acid groups. The study of physicochemical tuning of surface
   hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of PEMs by annealing and acidification
   provides insights for improving membrane electrode assembly (MEA)
   fabrication in fuel cell (FC). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   laser filamentation (FIL). Among them, high electric field assisted
   laser FIL produced nitrogen fluorescence more efficiently than either
   pure CD or pure FIL processes. The nonlinear enhancement of fluorescence
   from the interaction of the laser filament and corona discharging
   electric field resulted in a more efficient ionization along the laser
   filament zone, which was confirmed by the spectroscopic measurement of
   both ionization-induced fluorescence and plasma-scattered 800 nm laser
   pulses. This is believed to be the key precursor process for

Title = {{Constrained growth of complex scale-independent systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Scale independence is a ubiquitous feature of complex systems that
   implies a highly skewed distribution of resources with no characteristic
   scale. Research has long focused on why systems as varied as protein
   networks, evolution, and stock actions all feature scale independence.
   Assuming that they simply do, we focus here on describing how this
   behavior emerges, in contrast to more idealized models usually
   considered. We arrive at the conjecture that a minimal model to explain
   the growth toward scale independence involves only two coupled dynamical
   features: the first is the well-known preferential attachment principle,
   and the second is a general form of delayed temporal scaling. While the
   first is sufficient, the second is present in all studied data and
   appears to maximize the speed of convergence to true scale independence.
   The delay in this temporal scaling acts as a coupling between population
   growth and individual activity. Together, these two dynamical properties
   appear to pave a precise evolution path, such that even an instantaneous
   snapshot of a distribution is enough to reconstruct the past of the
   system and predict its future. We validate our approach and confirm its
   usefulness in diverse spheres of human activities, ranging from
   scientific and artistic productivity to sexual relations and online
   traffic.}},

Abstract = {{A well-resolved DNS of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer
   at moderately high Reynolds number is analyzed in order to visually
   assess, in three dimensions, the existence of instantaneous realizations
   of outer region hairpins and hairpin packets. For this purpose, fifty
   independent 2D streamwise-wall-normal slices of DNS data at R-e theta =
   4300 are employed to mimic lower-resolution PIV velocity fields using
   the mimicking procedure of Rahgozar et al. (2013). The two-dimensional
   structure identification scheme of Adrian et al. (2000) is then applied
   on this resolution-degraded DNS data in order to discover the signatures
   of hairpins and hairpin packets. Subsequently, the 2D motions that are
   identified as signatures of hairpins and hairpin packets are isolated
   and visualized in three dimensions using the fully resolved DNS data. In
   agreement with Adrian et al. (2000), the hairpin and hairpin packet
   signatures are frequently observed in the mimicked planes. However, the
   3D character of the 2D signatures is found to be significantly different
   from the inferred hairpins and hairpin packets. The 2D packet
   signatures, when viewed in 3D, generally correspond to a series of
   irregular and complex vortex tubes which are not necessarily different
   from other nearby vortex tubes in terms of their shape, size and
   intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three different types of perovskite-based nanocomposites were
   synthesized by calcination of the same gel mixtures (molar ratio for
   La:Sr:Co 0.4:0.6:1.0) under different reaction conditions
   (unconventional method: calcination at 1000 degrees C and 800 degrees C
   under vacuum; and conventional method: calcination in air at 1000

   reduction using propene (C3H6) as a reductant in the presence of oxygen

   analyzed results showed that multiphase products were found by the
   unconventional method (in the absence of oxygen), whereas the
   conventional method (in the presence of oxygen) yielded single-phase
   perovskites. The multiphase nanocomposite products prepared under vacuum
   at 1000 degrees C exhibited higher catalytic activity and higher N-2
   yield compared with the samples obtained under vacuum at lower
   temperature (800 degrees C) and the single-phase perovskites.}},

Abstract = {{Lime requirement (LR) to reach and maintain target soil pH levels could
   be determined using environmentally friendly methods to avoid buffer
   solutions containing toxic chemicals. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can
   predict soil properties related to soil pH buffering capacity,
   potentially supporting LR models. The aim of this study was to develop
   IR-based LR models across a wide range of soils in Quebec, Canada. The
   estimated exchangeable acidity (EEA) index was computed from the cation
   exchange capacity determined by the NH4OAc (pH 7.0) method (CEC-NH4OAc)
   minus the sum of Mehlich-III extractable non-acidic cations. The
   performance was high for IR-inferred CEC-NH4OAc predicted from
   mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared (NIR) spectra or computed from
   quantified organic C and NIR- and MIR-predicted clay content (0.82 <=
   R-2 <= 0.91 in validation). The performance in cross-validation of EEA
   using quantified CEC-NH4OAc (0.81 <= R-2 <= 0.89) was higher than
   Shoemaker-McLean-Pratt (SMP) buffer (0.15 <= R-2 <= 0.77) for target
   pH(H2O) values between 5.5 and 6.5, and similar for a target pH(H2O) of
   7.0. To support LR determination of cropping systems such as potato
   (Solanum tuberosum L.) that requires low pH (< 6.5) or to maintain
   adequate pH levels at low LRs (<1.5 g CaCO3 kg(-1)), the EEA index using
   CEC-NH4OAc inferred within +/- 2.3 cmolc kg(-1) was found to be more
   accurate than the SMP buffer. Direct prediction of the EEA-derived LR
   using NIR and MIR spectroscopy showed low performance (validation R-2 <=
   0.48) compared with EEA computed from IR-inferred CEC-NH4OAc. The IR
   spectroscopy can improve routine LR determination at low cost.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of an internal reflector (IR) on the
   productivity of a single-slope solar still (during the summer and
   winter) experimentally and theoretically. A mathematical model was
   presented which took into account the effect of all walls (north, south,
   west and east) of the still on the amount of received solar radiation to
   brine, and the model was validated with the experimental data. The model
   can calculate the yield of the still with and without IR on various
   walls. The results show that the simultaneous use of IR on front and
   side walls enhances the still's efficiency by 18\%. However,
   installation of an IR on the back wall can increase the annual
   efficiency by 22\%. The installation of IRs on all walls in comparison
   to a still without IR can increase the distillate production at winter,
   summer and the entire year by 65\%, 22\% and 34\%, respectively.
   Furthermore, the effect of cloud factor on the installation of IRs on
   all walls was examined, and the results indicate that the increasing the
   cloud factor decreases the influence of IRs significantly. (C) 2015

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Many bacteria can resist phagocytic digestion by various protozoa. Some
   of these bacteria ( all human pathogens) are known to be packaged in
   multilamellar bodies produced in the phagocytic pathway of the protozoa
   and that are secreted into the extracellular milieu. Packaged bacteria
   are protected from harsh conditions, and the packaging process is
   suspected to promote bacterial persistence in the environment. To date,
   only a limited number of protozoa, belonging to free-living amoebae and
   ciliates, have been shown to perform bacteria packaging. It is still
   unknown if social amoebae can do bacteria packaging. The link between
   the capacity of 136 bacterial isolates to resist the grazing of the
   social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and to be packaged by this amoeba
   was investigated in the present study. The 45 bacterial isolates
   displaying a resisting phenotype were tested for their capacity to be
   packaged. A total of seven isolates from Cupriavidus, Micrococcus,
   Microbacterium and Rathayibacter genera seemed to be packaged and
   secreted by D. discoideum based on immunofluorescence results. Electron
   microscopy confirmed that the Cupriavidus and Rathayibacter isolates
   were formally packaged. These results show that social amoebae can
   package some bacteria from the environment revealing a new aspect of
   microbial ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional finite element (FE) models normally assume the laminated
   core as a non-conductive material, and therefore, the damping effect of
   the eddy currents is ignored in the field solution. Besides, the use of
   integrated iron loss models in FE software could result in overestimated
   eddy current losses at high frequencies if the skin effect is ignored.
   This paper presents a simple way to accurately predict eddy current
   losses in laminations with FE analysis. An experimental setup along with
   the simulation models is used to demonstrate the validity of the method.
   The utility of this method in loss separation and identification of loss
   coefficients in the presence of skin effect is also illustrated. This
   method is also applied to a synchronous permanent magnet (PM) machine
   with sinusoidal current.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that a large proportion of ferrous PM components
   require secondary machining operations for dimensional conformance or
   for producing geometrical features that cannot be generated during die
   compaction. Nevertheless, the machining behavior of PM parts is
   generally characterized as being ``difficult{''} due to the presence of
   residual porosity that lowers thermal conductivity and induces
   interrupted cutting. Several admixed additives such as MnS and BN-h can
   be used to improve the machining behavior of PM steels. Nevertheless,
   their negative effect on mechanical properties, especially fatigue
   resistance, makes their utilization uninteresting for the fabrication of
   high-performance PM steel components. This article summarizes the work
   carried out to develop a novel PM steel that was especially engineered
   to form machinability enhancing precipitates. This new material is
   pre-alloyed with tin (Sn) in order to form Cu-Sn (Cu(alpha))
   precipitates during transient liquid phase sintering. The newly
   developed material presents machinability improvement of 165\% compared
   to reference material used in the PM industry as well as increases in
   toughness and fatigue resistance of 100\% and 13\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic forcing factors and their changes
   significantly impact water resources in many river basins around the
   world. Information on such changes can be derived from fine scale in
   situ and satellite observations, used in combination with hydrological
   models. The latter need to account for hydrological changes caused by
   human activities to correctly estimate the actual water resource. In
   this study, we consider the catchment area of the Garonne river (in
   France) to investigate the capabilities of space-based observations and
   up-to-date hydrological modeling in estimating water resources of a
   river basin modified by human activities and a changing climate. Using
   the ISBA-MODCOU and SWAT hydrological models, we find that the water
   resources of the Garonne basin display a negative climate trend since
   1960. The snow component of the two models is validated using the
   moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover extent
   climatology. Crop sowing dates based on remote sensing studies are also
   considered in the validation procedure. Use of this dataset improves the
   simulated evapotranspiration and river discharge amounts when compared
   to conventional data. Finally, we investigate the benefit of using the
   MAELIA multi-agent model that accounts for a realistic agricultural and
   management scenario. Among other results, we find that changes in crop
   systems have significant impacts on water uptake for agriculture. This
   work constitutes a basis for the construction of a future modeling
   framework of the sociological and hydrological system of the Garonne
   river region.}},

Abstract = {{The production of condensate, in addition to gas can improve the
   recovery factor of gas condensate reservoirs, as well as increase the
   economic feasibility of the reservoir. Dew point pressure (DPP) is
   regarded as one of the vital parameters for characterizing a gas
   condensate reservoir. The accurate estimation of DPP is however still a
   major challenge for reservoir engineers. In this study, a consistent,
   accurate, and simple-to-use model is proposed for the prediction of DPP
   in gas condensate reservoirs using a reliable soft-computing approach
   known as gene expression programming (GEP). The computational approach
   utilizes a comprehensive dataset of DPP, as well as properties of C7+,
   reservoir temperature, and hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon reservoir
   fluid compositions. The model proposed is compared to three well-known
   empirical correlations. The proposed model produces an average absolute
   relative deviation of approximately 7.88\% and is clearly superior to
   previously published methods for the prediction of dew point pressure in
   gas condensate reservoirs. (C) 2015 Taiwan Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Introducing large woody debris into streams is a common practice in
   restoration projects. Beyond the complexity of flow patterns and
   sediment movements in streams where woody debris are found or placed, it
   seems that our understanding of the basic hydraulics of large roughness
   elements in small channels remains limited. Underestimating the drag
   force affecting large roughness elements can compromise the success of
   stream restoration projects. Results from a simple experimental setting
   confirm that drag force estimates based on approaches developed for
   small cylinders are not valid when applied to large cylinders. Indeed,
   the classic drag force equation that uses an empirical drag coefficient
   is found to significantly underestimate measured drag forces, even when
   corrected for the blockage ratio'. In contrast, application of specific
   momentum can yield good estimates of the drag force. A dimensionless
   depth is defined in a 1D context as a function of the flow depth,
   critical flow depth and cylinder diameter. A cylinder is considered to
   be large' when this dimensionless depth is smaller than 2. In this
   instance, a relationship is established to estimate the upstream flow
   depth and the drag force acting on the cylinder. This research bridges
   the small roughness element theory widely recognized in hydraulic
   engineering with the theory applicable to large, flow controlling
   structures such as weirs. From a practical perspective, this research
   can be used to assist in the design of engineered large woody debris
   structures. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the pharmaceutical reverse supply chain. For
   this industry, the reverse supply chain is usually not owned by a single

   to coordinate the collection of unwanted medications at customer zones.
   Using a Lagrangian relaxation method, the model is solved for a real
   generic pharmaceutical company. Coordination efforts are required from
   the supply chain entities, facing environmental regulations, to collect
   and recycle unwanted medications. Therefore, a bonus sharing technique
   is also proposed based on each entity's investment in the coordination
   process. Some numerical results are presented and discussed for two case
   studies. It shows that up to 28\% more products could be collected if
   companies coordinate their operations efficiently. Besides, future

Abstract = {{A multilayer material was produced by rotational molding to study the
   effect of composition on the mechanical behavior of a cylindrical liquid

   The core (middle) layer was foamed LMDPE with different amount of
   foaming agent (0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 wt\%). Finally, the third
   (internal) layer was neat LMDPE. This structure was produced to optimize
   the mechanical properties of the molded parts while decreasing weight
   with good surface properties. From the morphological analysis, it was
   observed that the layers are not always well defined because of gas
   migration, especially from the foamed core to the composite layer. As
   expected, density increased with fiber content while decreasing with
   foaming agent concentration. In general, impact strength (Charpy and
   Gardner) was directly related to the overall density of the part. POLYM.

Abstract = {{Diamond-impregnated drill bits are known to be low energy vibration
   seismic sources. With the strong interference from the drill rig, it is
   difficult to obtain the drill-bit wavefield with a surface receiver
   array. To overcome the challenge of surface wave interference generated
   from the rig for seismic-while-drilling (SWD), we need to separate the
   rig-and bit-generated signals. To this end, we apply two wavefield
   separation methods, the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform and the f-k
   filter, and compare their performance. The applicability of these
   methods is based on the drill rig and drill bit having different spatial
   positions. While the drill-bit spatial position changes during the
   process of drilling, the drill rig remains stationary. This results in
   the source wavefields from the drill rig and the drill-bit having
   different characteristics, and allows us to separate and extract the
   drill-bit signal. We use a synthetic model to compare the KL transform
   and f-k filter. Both techniques are robust when the noise wavefield has
   consistent amplitude moveout. However, for changing amplitudes, such as
   the rig noise, which has an unrepeatable wavefield due to power
   amplitude variation, we show that the KL transform performs better in
   such situations. We also show the results of signal analysis of the SWD
   experiment data acquired from Brukunga, South Australia. We demonstrate
   the feasibility of the KL transform in separating the coherent noises
   from the stationary drill rig in a hard rock drilling environment,
   particularly emphasising the suppression of the surface and direct waves
   from the rig. The results show that drill-rig noise can be effectively
   suppressed in the correlation domain.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel leaching system involving NO2-Cu to oxidize
   and complex silver without the use of cyanide, ammonia or thiosulfate.
   It is possible to oxidize metallic silver through the reduction reaction
   of the nitrite ions, the cupric-nitrite complexes seem to be responsible
   for increasing the silver leaching kinetics; the nitrite ions act as a
   complexing agent for the silver ions in the solution. The effect of
   cupric ions concentration (0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.2 M) and nitrite ions
   concentration (1.0 M, 1.35 M and 1.5 M) on the dissolution kinetics of
   silver was evaluated. Based on the results the best leaching conditions
   were worked out as: 1.5 M nitrite ions and 0.2 M copper ions at a
   natural pH of 5.0. This leaching solution dissolves 80\% of silver
   within 6 h. The effect of temperature on the dissolution kinetics of
   silver was studied at the room temperature till 30, 45, 50 and 55
   degrees C, showing a progressive increase in silver recovery from 7.69\%
   to 10.38\%, 28.62\%, 44.7\% and 53.93\%, respectively in 30 min. The
   kinetic analysis revealed that silver leaching depends on the
   temperature and rate controlling step corresponds to the silver
   dissolution through the chemical reaction. The apparent activation
   energy of the reaction is found to be 50.92 kJ/mol, along with the
   enthalpy and entropy of activation values of 48.34 kJ/mol and -139.05
   J/mol K, respectively. The kinetic model corresponding to the silver
   leaching can be represented by the expression: 1 - (1 - x)(1/3) = k(0)
   exp. (-50.92/RT) t. The analysis of solid residue obtained after
   leaching at pH 5 by XRD and SEM with elemental mapping showed the
   formation of a copper-hydroxysulfate species, brochantite, formed in the
   bulk solution and not on the silver particle surface. The leaching
   results of silver by the NO2-Cu system were also ratified by the species
   distribution diagrams. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this work, composites based on polypropylene (PP)
   and maple wood flour (MF) were prepared by melt compounding using
   twin-screw extrusion followed by compression molding. The morphological
   and mechanical properties of the composites were analyzed for three
   samples: PP, MF/PP and MF/PP containing maleic anhydride grafted
   polypropylene (MAPP) as coupling agent. The results showed that MF/PP
   composites have improved mechanical properties, especially tensile
   modulus (+33 \%), with only 8 \% increase in density. The addition of
   MAPP further improved the mechanical properties, in particular tensile
   modulus (up to 51 \%), which could be related to better fiber/matrix
   adhesion. In the second step, nano crystalline cellulose (NCC) was added
   to all samples to produce NCC-MF/PP hybrid composites. From the
   mechanical analysis performed, the hybrid composites with MAPP have
   improved properties, especially tensile (+53 \%) and flexural (+40 \%)
   moduli. These results confirmed that multi-scale hybrid NCC-MF
   composites can substantially improve the mechanical properties of
   polyolefins with limited increase in density (14 \%) leading to high
   specific properties.}},

Abstract = {{Five activated sludge models describing N2O production by ammonium
   oxidising bacteria (AOB) were compared to four different long-term
   process data sets. Each model considers one of the two known N2O
   production pathways by AOB, namely the AOB denitrification pathway and
   the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway, with specific kinetic expressions.
   Satisfactory calibration could be obtained in most cases, but none of
   the models was able to describe all the N2O data obtained in the
   different systems with a similar parameter set. Variability of the
   parameters can be related to difficulties related to undescribed local
   concentration heterogeneities, physiological adaptation of
   micro-organisms, a microbial population switch, or regulation between
   multiple AOB pathways. This variability could be due to a dependence of
   the N2O production pathways on the nitrite (or free nitrous acid-FNA)
   concentrations and other operational conditions in different systems.
   This work gives an overview of the potentialities and limits of single
   AOB pathway models. Indicating in which condition each single pathway
   model is likely to explain the experimental observations, this work will
   also facilitate future work on models in which the two main N2O pathways
   active in AOB are represented together.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{32-49}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The availability of influent wastewater time series is crucial when
   using models to assess the performance of a wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP) under dynamic flow and loading conditions. Given the difficulty
   of collecting sufficient data, synthetic generation could be the only
   option. In this paper a hybrid of statistical (a Markov chain-gamma
   model for stochastic generation of rainfall and two different
   multivariate autoregressive models for stochastic generation of air
   temperature and influent time series in dry conditions) and conceptual
   modeling techniques is proposed for synthetic generation of influent
   time series. The time series of rainfall and influent in dry weather
   conditions are generated using two types of statistical models. These
   two time series serve as inputs to a conceptual sewer model for
   generation of influent time series. The application of the proposed
   influent generator to the Eindhoven WWTP shows that it is a powerful
   tool for realistic generation of influent time series and is well-suited
   for probabilistic design of WWTPs as it considers both the effect of
   input variability and total model uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamic behavior of gas-liquid downflow in vertical, inclined,

   considered while bed non-uniformity was described using radial porosity
   distributions. For vertical and slightly inclined columns, two-phase
   flow was concentrated in the core area of the bed. However, the
   two-phase flow was predicted to deviate significantly from axial
   symmetry at higher inclinations with prominent liquid accumulation in
   the bottommost reactor cross-sectional area. Oscillating packed beds
   unveiled complex reverse secondary flows radially and circumferentially
   resulting in oscillatory patterns of liquid holdup and pressure drop
   whose amplitude and propagation frequency were affected by column
   inclination angle and travel time between vertical and angled positions.

Title = {{Non-Darcy flow and thermal radiation in convective embankment modeling}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{91-99}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The design of convective embankments generally hinges on the use of
   numerical models that describe buoyancy-driven flow and heat transfer in
   porous media. A review of the literature reveals that most of the models
   used in the study of convective embankments assume that heat transfer
   occurs by conduction and convection, and that airflow can be described
   with Darcy's law. This is inconsistent with recent experimental evidence
   that suggests that radiative heat transfer is significant, and that
   Darcy's law does not adequately describe the relation between
   superficial flux and gradient in rockfill materials. In response to
   these shortcomings, a new model is herein derived to account for both
   radiative heat transfer and non-Darcy effects. After demonstrating its
   ability to solve fairly complex steady-state problems, the model is used
   to gain insight into the relative importance of radiative heat transfer
   and non-Darcy flow on the thermal response of a typical railway
   embankment. The radiative heat transfer is shown to be greater during
   the summer months. This increases the temperature at the base of the
   embankment, which in turn, increases the wintertime convective heat
   transfer. This additional heat extraction does not counteract the effect
   of the radiative heat transfer, and the wintertime temperatures below
   the embankment are shown to be warmer than that computed without
   radiative and non-Darcy effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BackgroundA point-of-care rapid test (POCRT) may help early and targeted
   use of antiviral drugs for the management of influenza A infection.
   Objective(i) To determine whether antiviral treatment based on a POCRT
   for influenza A is cost-effective and, (ii) to determine the thresholds
   of key test parameters (sensitivity, specificity and cost) at which a
   POCRT based-strategy appears to be cost effective.
   MethodsAn hybrid << susceptible, infected, recovered (SIR) >>
   compartmental transmission and Markov decision analytic model was used
   to simulate the cost-effectiveness of antiviral treatment based on a
   POCRT for influenza A in the social perspective. Data input parameters
   used were retrieved from peer-review published studies and government
   databases. The outcome considered was the incremental cost per life-year
   saved for one seasonal influenza season.
   ResultsIn the base-case analysis, the antiviral treatment based on POCRT
   saves 2 lives/100000 person-years and costs \$7600 less than the
   empirical antiviral treatment based on clinical judgment alone, which
   demonstrates that the POCRT-based strategy is dominant. In one and two
   way-sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to the POCRT accuracy
   and cost, to the vaccination coverage as well as to the prevalence of
   influenza A. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the POCRT strategy
   is cost-effective in 66\% of cases, for a commonly accepted threshold of
   \$50000 per life-year saved.
   ConclusionThe influenza antiviral treatment based on POCRT could be
   cost-effective in specific conditions of performance, price and disease
   prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{Canola proteins extracted by electroactivated solutions were
   incorporated to gluten-free biscuits made from blend of rice and
   buckwheat flours. Physical and textural properties were significantly
   influenced by these proteins. Isolates and concentrates did not behave
   in a similar way. A significant increase in diameter was noted for all
   of the supplemented samples. An increase in thickness was observed for
   the samples added with protein concentrate, whereas the spread ratio
   decreased for all the samples compared to control. The hardness of
   biscuits decreased with the addition of the proteins as compared to the
   control. The changes in biscuit hardness or fracture strength were in
   line with the changes in dough hardness. Biscuits containing protein
   concentrate had lighter, more aerated texture as shown by scanning
   electron microscopy with lesser amounts of gelatinised starch,
   indicating improved gas-holding capacity and more stabilised structure.
   Protein-supplemented biscuits have lower moisture and water activity.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a constitutive framework based on a rate-dependent
   crystal plasticity theory is employed to simulate localized deformation
   phenomena in hexagonal closed-packed (HCP) metals such as magnesium. A
   new and simplified method to account for deformation twinning is
   proposed. The new framework allows the twinned zones and the parent
   matrix to rotate independently. This is an extension of an earlier model
   presented by Levesque et al. (2010). Simulations are performed on AM30
   and AZ31B magnesium alloys using the new crystal plasticity model where
   crystallographic slip and deformation twinning are the principal
   deformation mechanisms. Different simulations such as tension,
   compression, and forming limit diagram (FLD) calculations are performed
   to compare the results of the new formulation with the conventional
   method presented earlier. In addition, the effect of the material
   texture on formability using the new formulation is assessed. It is
   shown that the new framework leads to different forming limit diagrams
   (FLDs) and the FLD resulted from the new framework predicts higher
   formability. It is understood that, the new formulation accommodates
   higher slip activity and more realistic twin-parent interactions. (C)

Title = {{Designing Multi-Axis Force-Torque Sensors by Minimizing the Amplitudes
   of Their Nonlinear Displacements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Compliant multi-axis force-torque sensors play a crucial role in many
   emerging robotic applications, such as telemanipulation, haptic devices
   and human-robot physical interaction. In order to synthesize the
   compliant architectures at the core of these sensors, several
   researchers have devised performance indices from mechanism theory. This
   paper follows the same approach, but includes the innovation of using
   the changes in the compliant mechanism geometry as a new performance
   index. Once external forces are applied, the compliant mechanism
   deviates from its unloaded configuration, and thus, changes in geometry
   prevent the sensor from exhibiting a linear response. In order to
   minimize this nonlinear behavior, the potential sources of error are
   analyzed by applying linear algebra techniques to the expression of the
   Cartesian force mapping. Two performance indices are then presented and
   combined. The first index measures the variations of the Jacobian matrix
   about the unloaded configuration. The second index measures the
   amplification of the error arising from the joint displacements
   measurement. The resulting indices can be expressed symbolically, making
   them easier to evaluate and synthesize. Finally, we apply the
   performance indices we have developed to simple compliant mechanisms,
   and discuss the results.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{790}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Self-preservation (SP) solutions on the axis of a turbulent round jet
   are derived for the transport equation of the second-order structure
   function of the turbulent kinetic energy (k), which may be interpreted
   as a scale-by-scale (s.b.s.) energy budget. The analysis shows that the
   mean turbulent energy dissipation rate, (epsilon) over bar, evolves like
   x(-4) (x is the streamwise direction). It is important to stress that
   this derivation does not use the constancy of the non-dimensional
   dissipation rate parameter C-c =(epsilon) over bar mu(13)/Lu (L-u and u'
   are the integral length scale and root mean square of the longitudinal
   velocity fluctuation respectively). We show, in fact, that the constancy
   of C-epsilon is simply a consequence of complete SP (i.e. SP at all
   scales of motion). The significance of the analysis relates to the fact
   that the SP requirements for the mean velocity and mean turbulent
   kinetic energy (i.e. U similar to x(-1) and k similar to x(-2)
   respectively) are derived without invoking the transport equations for U
   and k. Experimental hot-wire data along the axis of a turbulent round
   jet show that, after a transient downstream distance which increases
   with Reynolds number, the turbulence statistics comply with complete SP.
   For example, the measured (epsilon) over bar agrees well with the SP
   prediction, i.e. (epsilon) over bar similar to x(-4), while the Taylor
   microscale Reynolds number Re-lambda remains constant. The analytical
   expression for the prefactor A(epsilon) for (epsilon) over bar similar
   to (x-x(o))(-4) (where x(o) is a virtual origin), first developed by
   Thiesset et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 748, 2014, R2) and rederived here
   solely from the SP analysis of the s.b.s. energy budget, is validated
   and provides a relatively simple and accurate method for estimating
   (epsilon) over bar along the axis of a turbulent round jet.}},

Title = {{Combining chitinase C and N-acetylhexosaminidase from Streptomyces

Abstract = {{The enzymatic bioconversion of chitin is of considerable interest for
   the natural production of bioactive compounds such as
   chitooligosaccharides and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Key enzymes
   are involved in the natural processing of chitin, hydrolyzing this
   abundant biopolymer to yield chitooligosaccharides with substantial
   value to the medicinal and biotechnological fields. In this study,
   chitinase C (ScChiC) from the soil bacterium and chitin decomposer
   Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was expressed, purified and characterized.
   We also optimized a Streptomyces lividans system generating ScChiC
   expression yields nearly 500-fold higher than the previously reported
   heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme was
   found to be stable below 55 degrees C for a broad range of pH values (pH
   3.5-9) and exhibited high activity against chitin and
   chitooligosaccharides to form chitobiose (C2) as main product. Crab
   shell chitin hydrolysis profiles also revealed that ScChiC catalyzes the
   bioconversion of chitopolysaccharides through an endo-nonprocessive mode
   of action. When combining ScChiC with an N-acetylhexosaminidase from S.
   coelicolorA3(2) (ScHEX) in an assay using crude extracts and crystalline
   chitin as substrate, GlcNAc was generated as final product with a yield
   over 90\% after 8 h incubation. This chitin hydrolysis yield represents
   one of the most efficient enzyme bioconversion of chitopolysaccharides
   to G1cNAc characterized to date, making the S. coelicolor ScChiC-ScHEX
   pair a potentially suitable contender for the viable industrial
   production of this important bioactive compound. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Composite proton exchange membranes (PEMs) intended for fuel cell
   applications were prepared by embedding of various amounts of dispersed
   tri-sulfonic acid ethyl POSS (S-Et-POSS) and tri-sulfonic acid butyl
   FOSS (S-Bu-POSS) in thin films of sulfonated poly ether ether ketone.
   The electrical properties of the PEMs were studied by Impedance
   spectroscopy and it was found that their conductivity a changes with the
   filler content following a curve with a maximum. The water uptake of
   these PEMs showed the same dependence. The investigation of initial
   isolated S-POSS substances revealed the properties of typical
   electrolytes, which however in both cases possessed low conductivities
   of 1.17 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) (S-Et-POSS) and 3.52 x 10(-5) S cm(-1)
   (S-Bu-POSS). At the same time, the insoluble in water S-FOSS was found
   forming highly conductive interface layer when wetted with liquid water
   and hence producing a strong positive impact on the conductivity of the
   composite PEM. Electrical properties of the composites were analysed
   within the frameworks of effective medium theory and bounding models,
   allowing to evaluate analytically the range of possible conductivity
   values. It was found that these approaches produced quite good
   approximation of the experimental data and constituted a fair basis for
   interpretation of the observed relationship. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We have solved the long-standing problem of the mechanism of terahertz

   contribution from neutrals by four-wave mixing is much weaker and higher
   in frequency than the distinctive plasma lower-frequency contribution.
   The former is in the forward direction while the latter is in a cone and
   reveals an abrupt down-shift to the plasma frequency. Ring-shaped
   spatial distributions of the THz radiation are shown to be of universal
   nature and they occur in both collimated and focusing propagation
   geometries. Experimental measurements of the frequency-angular spectrum
   generated by 130-fs laser pulses agree with numerical simulations based
   on a unidirectional pulse propagation model.}},

Title = {{Considering Future Potential Regarding Structural Diversity in Selection
   of Forest Reserves}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{A rich structural diversity in forests promotes biodiversity. Forests
   are dynamic and therefore it is crucial to consider future structural
   potential when selecting reserves, to make robust conservation
   decisions. We analyzed forests in boreal Sweden based on 17,599 National
   Forest Inventory (NFI) plots with the main aim to understand how
   effectiveness of reserves depends on the time dimension in the selection
   process, specifically by considering future structural diversity. In the
   study both the economic value and future values of 15 structural
   variables were simulated during a 100 year period. To get a net present
   structural value (NPSV), a single value covering both current and future
   values, we used four discounting alternatives: (1) only considering
   present values, (2) giving equal importance to values in each of the 100
   years within the planning horizon, (3) applying an annual discount rate
   considering the risk that values could be lost, and (4) only considering
   the values in year 100. The four alternatives were evaluated in a
   reserve selection model under budget-constrained and area-constrained
   selections. When selecting young forests higher structural richness
   could be reached at a quarter of the cost over almost twice the area in
   a budget-constrained selection compared to an area-constrained
   selection. Our results point to the importance of considering future
   structural diversity in the selection of forest reserves and not as is
   done currently to base the selection on existing values. Targeting
   future values increases structural diversity and implies a relatively
   lower cost. Further, our results show that a re-orientation from old to
   young forests would imply savings while offering a more extensive
   reserve network with high structural qualities in the future. However,
   caution must be raised against a drastic reorientation of the current
   old-forest strategy since remnants of ancient forests will need to be
   prioritized due to their role for disturbance-sensitive species.}},

Abstract = {{Wabush Lake is one of the few very well-constrained source-to-sink
   sedimentary systems in the world that exhibits near-continuous turbidity
   currents. In this system, approximately 20 million tons of mine tailings
   are delivered each year to a 40 km(2) lake. Multibeam bathymetric
   surveys of this lake were carried out between 1999 and 2011. In
   addition, a program of extensive sampling and seismic surveys, an
   airborne LiDAR survey and a photogrammetric survey were carried out
   during this period. The objective of this study was to determine the
   evolution through time of this anthropic source-to-sink system, from the
   point where sediments exit the slurry pipelines at the head of the
   system to the distal end and bottom of the Lake. The total volume of the
   Lake is around 1 x 10(9) m(3).
   Analysis of subaerial and subaqueous datasets allows the evaluation of
   disposal strategies on the delta topset and on tailings accumulation.
   Disposal strategies influence the dynamics of the channels on the
   topset, thus in turn affecting the accumulation of tailings throughout
   the lake, as well as the shoreline advancement rate. Subaqueous
   erosional channels present on the bed of the Lake influence the
   depositional pattern of tailings as well as their granulometric
   distribution. These erosional channels are created by the shoreward
   migration of knickpoints. In some places, this migration can be
   documented over multiple surveys.
   Finally, sequential analysis of the 1999, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2011
   surveys has allowed detailed documentation of the infilling of the Lake,
   including the migration of sediment depocenters, the mechanism of
   emplacement and the progressive infilling of a series of minibasins. (C)

Title = {{Toward prediction of petroleum reservoir fluids properties: A rigorous
   model for estimation of solution gas-oil ratio}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{The amount of dissolved gas in production oil has been always a great
   question in oil and gas industry. Solution gas oil ratio is considered
   as a representative for the fraction of gas which is dissolved in oil
   during different stages of oil production. Several experimental methods
   have been developed for measuring this parameter. However, experimental
   procedures are usually time consuming, tedious and expensive. Thus,
   development of analytical equations and empirical correlations for
   estimation of solution gas oil ratio is of vital importance. In this
   study, a novel learning approach called least square support vector
   machine (LSSVM) optimized by coupled simulated annealing (CSA) was
   developed for calculating solution gas oil ratio as a function of
   temperature, bubble point pressure, gas specific gravity and oil. API.
   To this end, a large number of data points including more than a
   thousand data sets from multiple reservoirs covering a wide range of
   reservoir conditions and pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) properties
   were gathered from various sources of literature. In addition, several
   statistical and graphical analyses including Average Absolute Percentage
   Relative Error (AAPRE), Average Percentage Relative Error (APRE), Root
   Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R-2) were
   carried out to evaluate the accuracy and validity of model and to
   compare it with the most well-known implicit and explicit correlations
   of solution gas oil ratio estimation. Moreover, relevancy factor was
   employed to investigate the impact of each input parameter on solution
   gas oil ratio showing that bubble point pressure has the greatest effect
   on solution gas oil ratio. Finally, leverage approach was utilized to
   detect the data outliers and to find the applicability domain of the
   proposed model. The results in this study show that the developed model
   is able to estimate solution gas oil ratio with high accuracy and
   reliability making it possible to use the model in commercial software
   packages with various applications in oil and gas industry. (C) 2016

   Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 spores}},

Abstract = {{Combined effects of moderate temperatures and the electro-activated
   aqueous solutions of potassium acetate and potassium citrate on the
   inactivation of C. sporogenes PA 3679 spores (D-121 degrees C = 1.18
   min) were studied. Four types of solutions (potassium acetate
   with/without KCl and potassium citrate with/without KCl) were activated
   at 400 mA for 60 min. The oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and pH
   values ranged from +417.50 to +104333 mV and 3.18 to 3.47, respectively.
   The combination of these solutions with a moderate heat treatment (95
   degrees C, 105 degrees C, and 115 degrees C) for different time (5, 10,
   20, and 30 min) was sufficient to reach a 100\% of spore destruction
   (inactivation) in a medium with an initial contamination level comprised
   between 7.0 and 7.8 log CFU/mL,. The sporicidal effect of solutions was
   also present even if activated solutions were applied atone against
   spores without being combined with heat treatment. Spore morphology was
   determined under transmission electron microscopy and showed that there
   were important damages, such as rupture of spores and release of spore
   components in all of the treated spores. Thus, the sporicidal effect
   detected was the result of inactivation mechanisms of electro-activated
   solutions on spores. In almost all of observed micrographs, there were
   coreless spores, deformed spores, or debris of spores. The current
   investigation can be used for achieving further studies in order to
   better understand the mechanisms of inactivation of C. sporogenes spores
   by electro-activated solutions. Industrial relevance: This research
   article aims to study the combined effect of electro-activated potassium
   acetate and citrate solutions and moderate heat treatment on the
   viability of Clostridium sporogenes in model solutions as a
   non-pathogenic surrogate of Clostridium botulinum. The objective was to
   use hurdle technology to produce nutritious, minimally processed foods
   while ensuring food safety. Moreover, this approach allowed for a
   reduced level of sodium in canned foods since the solutions were
   sodium-free. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Implanted antennas for implant-to-air data communications must be
   composed of material compatible with biological tissues. We design
   single and dual-polarization antennas for wireless ultra-wideband neural
   recording systems using an inhomogeneous multi-layer model of the human
   head. Antennas made from flexible materials are more easily adapted to
   implantation; we investigate both flexible and rigid materials and
   examine performance trade-offs. The proposed antennas are designed to
   operate in a frequency range of 2-11 GHz (having S-11 below 10 dB)
   covering both the 2.45 GHz (ISM) band and the 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB band.
   Measurements confirm simulation results showing flexible antennas have
   little performance degradation due to bending effects (in terms of
   impedance matching). Our miniaturized flexible antennas are 12 mm x 12
   mm and 10 mm x 9 mm for single and dual-polarizations, respectively.
   Finally, a comparison is made of four implantable antennas covering the
   2-11 GHz range: 1) rigid, single polarization, 2) rigid, dual
   polarization, 3) flexible, single polariz ation and 4) flexible, dual
   polarization. In all cases a rigid antenna is used outside the body,
   with an appropriate polarization. Several advantages were confirmed for
   dual polarization antennas: 1) smaller size, 2) lower sensitivity to
   angular misalignments, and 3) higher fidelity.}},

   hardness, elastic modulus and wear resistance of the coatings increased
   with increasing TiB2 content in the Fe3Al matrix. The wear mechanisms
   strongly depended on the sliding speed and the presence of TiB2

Abstract = {{The effect of Nafion ionomer content on performance of a proton exchange
   membrane (PEM) fuel cell operated with home-made anodic and cathodic
   electrodes fabricated from a novel metal organic framework (MOF) derived
   Pt-based electrocatalyst was investigated via numerical simulation and
   experimental measurement. First, the parameter sensitivity analysis was
   performed to identify the most influential parameters of the model.
   Then, these parameters were calibrated for different fuel cell designs
   investigated in the current study by employing the corresponding
   experimental data. Afterwards, the calibrated model was used to examine
   the impact of Nafion content in the catalyst layer of home-made
   electrodes. Finally, the qualitative trend predicted by this model was
   experimentally surveyed by varying the Nafion content between 10-50
   wt.\% in the catalyst layer of home-made electrodes. At the anode side,
   the performance of home-made electrode in a PEM fuel cell demonstrated
   small dependency on Nafion content. For the cathodic home-made
   electrode, Nafion content was found to affect the PEM fuel cell
   performance more strongly. Although the model could correctly capture
   the impact of Nafion content on calculated polarization curves, the
   model predicted optimum values significantly deviate from the
   experimental results. This was related to the several simplifications
   made during model development.}},

Title = {{THE JCMT GOULD BELT SURVEY: A FIRST LOOK AT DENSE CORES IN ORION B}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{817}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a first look at the SCUBA-2 observations of three sub-regions
   of the Orion B molecular cloud: LDN 1622, NGC 2023/2024, and NGC
   2068/2071, from the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey. We identify 29, 564,
   and 322 dense cores in L1622, NGC 2023/2024, and NGC 2068/2071
   respectively, using the SCUBA-2 850 mu m map, and present their basic
   properties, including their peak fluxes, total fluxes, and sizes, and an
   estimate of the corresponding 450 mu m peak fluxes and total fluxes,
   using the FellWalker source extraction algorithm. Assuming a constant
   temperature of 20 K, the starless dense cores have a mass function
   similar to that found in previous dense core analyses, with a
   Salpeter-like slope at the high-mass end. The majority of cores appear
   stable to gravitational collapse when considering only thermal pressure;
   indeed, most of the cores which have masses above the thermal Jeans mass
   are already associated with at least one protostar. At higher cloud
   column densities, above 1-2 x 10(23) cm(-2), most of the mass is found
   within dense cores, while at lower cloud column densities, below 1 x
   10(23) cm(-2), this fraction drops to 10\% or lower. Overall, the
   fraction of dense cores associated with a protostar is quite small (<
   8\%), but becomes larger for the densest and most centrally concentrated
   cores. NGC 2023/2024 and NGC 2068/2071 appear to be on the path to
   forming a significant number of stars in the future, while L1622 has
   little additional mass in dense cores to form many new stars.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic performance of two oxides coated anodes (OCSs) meshes and
   one OCA plate was investigated in a zinc electrowinning electrolyte at
   38 degrees C. Their electrochemical behaviors were compared with that of
   a conventional Pb-0.7\% Ag alloy anode. Electrochemical measurements
   such as cyclic voltammetric, galvanostatic, potentiodynamic,
   open-circuit potential (OCP) and in situ electrochemical noise
   measurements were considered. After 2 h of OCP test, the linear
   polarization shows that the corrosion current density of the
   Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh electrode is the lowest (3.37 mu A/cm(2)) among the
   three OCAs and shows excellent performance. Additionally, after 24 h of
   galvanostatic polarization at 50 mA/cm(2) and 38 degrees C, the Ti/MnO2
   mesh anode has the highest potential (1.799 V), followed by the
   Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) plate (1.775 V) and Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh (1.705 V)
   anodes. After 24 h of galvanostatic polarization followed by 16 h of
   decay, the linear polarization method confirms the sequence obtained
   after 2 h of OCP test, and the Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh attains the lowest
   corrosion current density. The Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) mesh anode also shows
   better performance after 24 h of galvanostatic polarization with the
   overpotential lower than that of the conventional Pb-Ag anode by about
   245 mV.}},

Title = {{Clearance rate regulation in mussels: Adding the effect of seston level
   to a model of internal state-based regulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{475}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We tested a model of clearance rate regulation that specifies that
   clearance rate is driven by the density of energy reserves and is
   modulated by factors such as biochemical signalling and seston
   concentration (Frechette, M.2012. A model of clearance rate regulation
   in mussels. J. Sea Res. 73:32-40). Mussels were fed natural seston at
   high and low concentrations for 71 days to manipulate the density of
   energy reserves ({''}position effect{''}). Clearance rate of each group
   was assayed in a two-level repeated-measures design experiment, within
   and among days. The effect of position and its interactions was not
   significant. It is likely that the low seston level treatment was too
   mild to generate phenotypic flexibility in clearance rate. The effect of
   time, however, was significant at all scales. Seston variability allowed
   examining the functional response of mean clearance rate to seston
   level. Short-term clearance rate was bounded by seston concentration at
   very low and high seston concentration. Between concentration extremes,
   however, short-term clearance rate was not regulated by actual seston
   concentration. On some occasions hysteresis dominated the functional
   response, implying delayed regulation, presumably in response to gut
   fullness. Hourly-averaged mean clearance rate exhibited a
   clearly-defined non monotonous response to seston level. Therefore we
   modified the initial model formulation in order to include the effect of
   low seston level. We found an excellent fit between the modified model
   and the data. Therefore, in spite of appearing erratic at intermediate
   seston level, short-term clearance rate patterns are embedded within a
   well-defined functional response. Understanding these patterns
   apparently requires that seston level, its temporal variability and the
   dynamics of gut fullness be taken into account. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Title = {{Using exponential geometry for estimating oil production in the SAGD
   process}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{113-121}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{SAGD, a steam injection method, is known as one of the most effective
   ways of heavy oil recovery. In addition to existing numerical methods, a
   fast alternative for evaluation of heavy oil recovery from a porous
   media by SAGD is to use semi-analytical models, which in recent years
   have considerably progressed.
   Along this evolution, this study is aimed at introducing a model based
   on that suggested by Reis. Therefore, a more accurate estimation of oil
   production rate, steam chamber expansion and the amount of steam
   required for the process can be made. In this model, the most important
   mechanism for heavy oil recovery by SAGD is heat conduction and
   consequently gravity drainage of heated oil. The innovation established
   in this work is representing the location of oil-steam interface by an
   exponential function to excel the linear assumption in Reis's model. The
   presented model is finally compared with experimental, numerical and
   field data to assess its quality. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome as a model for vascular aging}},
Journal = {{BIOGERONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{129-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging
   disorder caused by a de novo genetic mutation that leads to the
   accumulation of a splicing isoform of lamin A termed progerin. Progerin
   expression alters the organization of the nuclear lamina and chromatin.
   The life expectancy of HGPS patients is severely reduced due to critical
   cardiovascular defects. Progerin also accumulates in an age-dependent
   manner in the vascular cells of adults that do not carry genetic
   mutations associated with HGPS. The molecular mechanisms that lead to
   vascular dysfunction in HGPS may therefore also play a role in vascular
   aging. The vascular phenotypic and molecular changes observed in HGPS
   are strikingly similar to those seen with age, including increased
   senescence, altered mechanotransduction and stem cell exhaustion. This
   article discusses the similarities and differences between age-dependent
   and HGPS-related vascular aging to highlight the relevance of HGPS as a
   model for vascular aging. Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from
   HGPS patients are suggested as an attractive model to study vascular
   aging in order to develop novel approaches to treat cardiovascular
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Dystocias are common in dairy cows and often adversely affect
   production, reproduction, animal welfare, labor, and economics within
   the dairy industry. An automated device that accurately predicts the
   onset of calving could potentially minimize the effect of dystocias by
   enabling producers to intervene early. Although many well-documented
   indicators can detect the imminence of calving, research is limited on
   their effectiveness to predict calving when measured by automated
   devices. The objective of this experiment was to determine if a decrease
   in vaginal temperature (VT), rumination (RT), and lying time (LT), or an
   increase in lying bouts (LB), as measured by 3 automated devices, could
   accurately predict the onset of calving within 24, 12, and 6 h. The
   combination of these 4 calving indicators was also evaluated. Forty-two
   multiparous Holstein cows housed in tie-stalls were fitted with a
   temperature logger inserted in the vaginal cavity 7 +/- 2 d before their
   expected calving date; VT was recorded at 1-min intervals. An
   ear-attached sensor recorded rumination time every hour based on ear
   movement while an accelerometer fitted to the right hind leg recorded
   cow position at 1-min intervals. On average, VT were 0.3 +/- 0.03
   degrees C lower, and RT and LT were 41 +/- 17 and 52 +/- 28 mm lower,
   respectively, on the calving day compared with the previous 4 d. Cows
   had 2 +/- 1 more LB on the calving day. Of the 4 indicators, a decrease
   in VT >= 0.1 degrees C was best able to predict calving within the next
   24 h with a sensitivity of 74\%, specificity of 74\%, positive and
   negative predictive values of 51 and 89\%, and area under the curve of
   0.80. Combining the indicators enhanced the performance to predict
   calving within the next 24, 12, and 6 h with best overall results
   obtained by combining the 3 devices for prediction within the next 24 h
   (sensitivity: 77\%, specificity: 77\%, positive and negative predictive
   values: 56 and 90\%, area under the curve: 0.82). These results indicate
   that a device that could simultaneously measure these 4 calving
   indicators could not precisely determine the onset of calving, but the
   information collected would assist dairy farmers in monitoring the onset
   of calving.}},

Abstract = {{Polypropylene hybrid composites were produced by using coir fibers and
   coir shell particles at a total weight content of 20\%. The effect of
   hybridization and coupling agent on the morphological, structural,

   filler/matrix interfacial adhesion. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates
   that thermal degradation of shell particles (285/465 degrees C) is lower
   than coir fibers (331/474 degrees C). The combination of coir fibers and
   particles has a positive effect on the Young's modulus with hybrid
   composites showing intermediate values between non-hybrid composites
   (improvement between 35 and 50\%). The modeling of the mechanical
   behavior of the manufactured composites was done by physical models

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to simulate the forming process of green anodes.
   For this purpose, a nonlinear compressible viscoplastic constitutive law
   is presented. The concept of natural reference configuration is
   considered. Within an isothermal thermodynamic framework, a Helmholtz
   free energy is proposed to take into account the nonlinear compressible
   deformation process occurring between natural reference configuration
   and current configuration. A dissipation potential is introduced in
   order to characterize the irreversible aspect of compaction process. The
   constitutive law is thus formulated through two equations: (1) an
   expression of Cauchy stress tensor and (2) a differential equation
   characterizing the evolution of the natural reference configuration.
   Material parameters are assumed to be a function of the apparent green
   density. An experimental study is carried out in order to characterize
   the compaction behavior of the anode paste. A user's material VUMAT
   subroutine for finite-element dynamic explicit analysis has been
   developed and implemented in the ABAQUS commercial software. To evaluate
   the model predictive capability, numerical simulations of the compaction
   forming process of anode paste were performed. Simulation results show
   that the constitutive law predicts the experimental trends and gives
   insight of physical responses. This constitutes a first step toward
   characterizing the anode paste behavior and making a benchmark with
   experimental results on the forming process of anode paste.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, great effort has been devoted to the development of
   biomaterials that come into contact with blood. The surfaces of these
   materials need to be of suitable mechanical strength, and present
   anti-thrombogenic and anti-calcification properties. Chitosan is a
   natural polymer that has attracted attention due to its potential to act
   as a biomaterial. However, chitosan contains amino groups in its
   structure that may promote thrombogenesis and calcification. A strategy
   to reduce these properties constitutes the introduction of sulfonate
   groups (R-SO3-) in the chitosan chain. Another interesting biopolymer
   with similar characteristics to those of heparin is carrageenan, which
   has sulfate groups in its structure. As such, we evaluated ``in
   vitro{''} calcification and thrombogenic processes on surfaces of
   pristine and sulfonated chitosan and on polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC)
   of chitosan and carrageenan. Results indicate that PEC demonstrate
   significant reductions in calcification and thrombogenic potential,
   probably due to the presence of sulfonate groups in both the carrageenan
   and treated chitosan. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A cultural practice for cooling cranberry plants and avoiding yield
   losses due to overheating is to turn on sprinkler irrigation for a few
   minutes when a critical temperature threshold is reached. The purpose of
   this study was to determine: (i) the critical leaf temperature to start
   irrigation for evaporative cooling in cranberry production, (ii) the
   combined effects of heat and water stress, and (iii) the beneficial
   effects of evaporative cooling through irrigation on field microclimate
   and plant physiology. The optimum temperature range for carbon dioxide
   (CO2) assimilation was between 25 and 29 degrees C, with photosynthesis
   (A(n)) declining by II\% at 33 degrees C and by 22\% at 37 degrees C due
   in part to stomatal limitations. The reduction in An was greater under
   low soil moisture conditions. When applying sprinkler irrigation in the
   field, leaf temperature was reduced by 5-10 degrees C and the efficiency
   of evaporative cooling was greater, with greater vapor pressure deficit
   of the air within the crop canopy before the irrigation. Under
   controlled environmental conditions, one cooling event resulted in a
   carbon gain of 19\% relative to untreated plants and was able to reduce
   midday depression. Additional cooling events during the day had no
   significant effect on carbon gain. Among the main cranberry-growing
   regions, New Jersey is an area where sprinkler irrigation for
   evaporative cooling could be beneficial for preventing yield limitations
   due to heat stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most prevalent pathogenic bacteria

   pathogenic staphylococci in cheese. Six selected phages belonging to the
   three Caudovirales families (Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Podoviridae) were
   strictly lytic, had a broad host range, and did not carry genes coding
   for virulence traits in their genomes. However, they were sensitive to
   pasteurization. At MOI levels of 15, 45, and 150, two anti-S. aureus
   phage cocktails, each containing three phages, one from each of the
   three phage families, eradicated a 10(6) CFU/g S. aureus population

   these phages did not trigger over-production of S. aureus enterotoxin C.

   includes human and fish pathogens. The Aeromonas salmonicida species has
   the peculiarity of including five known subspecies. However, few studies
   of the genomes of A. salmonicida subspecies have been reported to date.
   Results: We sequenced the genomes of additional A. salmonicida isolates,
   including three from India, using next-generation sequencing in order to
   gain a better understanding of the genomic and phylogenetic links
   between A. salmonicida subspecies. Their relative phylogenetic positions
   were confirmed by a core genome phylogeny based on 1645 gene sequences.
   The Indian isolates, which formed a sub-group together with A.
   salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica, were able to grow at either at 18
   degrees C and 37 degrees C, unlike the A. salmonicida psychrophilic
   isolates that did not grow at 37 degrees C. Amino acid frequencies, GC
   content, tRNA composition, loss and gain of genes during evolution,
   pseudogenes as well as genes under positive selection and the mobilome
   were studied to explain this intraspecies dichotomy.
   Conclusion: Insertion sequences appeared to be an important driving
   force that locked the psychrophilic strains into their particular
   lifestyle in order to conserve their genomic integrity. This
   observation, based on comparative genomics, is in agreement with
   previous results showing that insertion sequence mobility induced by
   heat in A. salmonicida subspecies causes genomic plasticity, resulting
   in a deleterious effect on the virulence of the bacterium. We provide a
   proof-of-concept that selfish DNAs play a major role in the evolution of
   bacterial species by modeling genomes.}},

Abstract = {{The acid-catalyzed reaction of glycerol with aqueous formaldehyde was
   studied using various heterogeneous catalysts for the production of
   glycerol formal. Owing to the high amount of water involved in the
   reaction medium, three types of water-tolerant heterogeneous catalysts
   namely acid functionalized periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs),
   zeolite ZSM-5 and a heteropoly compound Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 as well as
   commercial catalyst Amberlyst-15 were used for glycerol acetalization.
   The activity of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 was found superior to that of the other
   catalysts and the glycerol conversion was over 70\% within 60 min of
   reaction time. The effects of different parameters including
   temperature, feed,composition and catalyst content, were studied as
   well. The distribution of the two glycerol formal isomers could be
   controlled by changing reaction parameters. Optimum reactive parameters
   were studied to control the distribution of the acetal isomers aiming to
   reach a high selectivity to the six-member ring isomer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nanotechnologies form a field of research that is still emerging with
   major gaps in knowledge regarding the behavior and potential
   toxicological risks of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in soils. While
   most of the studies are conducted in porous media (quartz and glass
   beads) and culture media, less frequently are the studies carried out in
   natural soils. However, the complex interactions occurring in soils,
   mediated by both soil components and soil organisms, are essential in
   bioavailability processes. Therefore, this paper is intended to
   highlight particularly the bioavailability of ENPs in soils. The
   potential release pathways of ENPs to soils are described and are faced
   with a lack of specific regulation and definitive nomenclature. This
   paper reviews a number of studies regarding ENP toxicological
   bioavailability on microorganisms and microfauna, mesofauna, and
   macrofauna inhabiting the soil, as well as on soil-plant systems. The
   paper especially discusses ENP behavior in soils that affect ENP
   bioavailability to the edaphic biota. Particular attention is paid to
   the factors regulating these processes {[}i. e., (1) ENP-dependent
   factors, (2) soil properties, and (3) soil components], focusing on
   organic matter. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main concerns in the control of over-constrained cable driven
   parallel mechanisms is the handling of the tension distribution, which
   is crucial to the proper mechanism behaviour. For example, it dictates
   the power consumption and stiffness of the mechanism. One problem that
   remains to be addressed is the handling of cable tensions when the
   end-effector moves beyond its wrench-feasible workspace, a situation
   that can arise when the robot is used as a haptic interface. Most
   existing algorithms are capable of determining whether a specified
   wrench is unfeasible, but cannot return a suitable second-best tension
   distribution in such situations. This paper presents an algorithm based
   on quadratic programming that is capable of handling these situations in
   real time. The algorithm provides the exact tension distribution for
   exerting the prescribed wrench when the end-effector is inside the robot
   workspace. Moreover, when the end-effector is outside of the robot
   workspace, the algorithm returns a tension distribution that
   approximately generates the prescribed wrench. The effectiveness of the
   algorithm is first illustrated using the simulation of a simple

Abstract = {{To find seed treatments that are acceptable for organic cereal
   production, we tested the efficacy of three treatments, i.e. dry heat, a
   low dose of acetic acid vapours (AAV-L), and a high dose of AAV (AAV-H),
   to control Fusarium graminearum (Fg) and Bipolaris sorokiniana (Bs), two
   seed-borne pathogens affecting emergence and yield in barley and wheat.
   These treatments were compared with a control (no treatment) and Vitaflo
   (R)-280. Treatments were applied on six barley and six wheat seed lots
   contaminated with Fg at a rate of > 20\% (i.e. > 20\% of seeds
   contaminated) and/or Bs at a rate of > 50\%. For all Fg-contaminated
   lots, the three non-chemical treatments reduced the contamination rate
   under the rejection threshold of 15\%, which is the Danish
   recommendation for Fusarium spp. For Bs-contaminated lots, AAV-H reduced
   contamination the most, followed by AAV-L, and then by dry heat, which
   had no effect on barley. However, these treatments did not reduce Bs
   contamination under the rejection threshold of 30\%, except for AAV-H in
   one barley lot and dry heat in one wheat lot. Also, AAV-H reduced the
   germination in three wheat lots and in the hulless barley AC Hawkeye,
   and this had negative effects on grain yield for two of the wheat lots.
   AAV-H had no effect on grain yield in the other lots, and neither did
   the other treatments in any of the lots. Dry heat was effective for
   controlling Fg in both cereals, whereas AAV-H showed some potential to
   control both pathogens, but only in covered grains. None of the
   treatments evaluated appears to be appropriate for reducing
   contamination by either pathogens in wheat and barley.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the electricity network undergoes more perturbations due to
   the market demand. Additionally, an increase of the production from
   alternative resources such as wind or solar also induces important
   variations on the grid. Hydraulic power plants are used to respond
   quickly to these variations to stabilize the network. Hydraulic turbines
   have to face more frequent start-up and stop sequences that might
   shorten significantly their life time. In this context, an experimental
   analysis of start-up sequences has been conducted on the bulb turbine
   model of the BulbT project at the Hydraulic Machines Laboratory (LAMH)
   of Laval University. Maintaining a constant head, guide vanes are opened
   from 0 degrees to 30 degrees. Three guide vanes opening speed have been
   chosen from 5 degrees /s to 20 degrees /s. Several repetitions were done
   for each guide vanes opening speed. During these sequences, synchronous
   time resolved measurements have been performed. Pressure signals were
   recorded at the runner inlet and outlet and along the draft tube. Also,
   25 pressure measurements and strain measurements were obtained on the
   runner blades. Time resolved particle image velocimetry were used to
   evaluate flowrate during start-up for some repetitions. Torque
   fluctuations at shaft were also monitored. This paper presents the
   experimental set-up and start-up conditions chosen to simulate a
   prototype start-up. Transient flowrate methodology is explained and
   validation measurements are detailed. The preliminary results of global
   performances and runner pressure measurements are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Properly controlling comminution circuits is generally acknowledged to
   be highly profitable for any mining site's bottom line. On the other
   hand, the process control problem of comminution circuits is challenging
   due to circulating loads and non-linear transport/transformation rates.
   As the performance and robustness Of the control System highly rely oil
   a good understanding of the process dynamics, characterizing the
   deterministic behavior requires a certain level of operation disruption
   (bump tests). For a grinding circuit, it implies affecting the
   throughput and product size distributions. The management team can be
   reluctant to risk obvious consequences on downstream processing stages
   i.e. inadequate mineral liberation, reduction of product, quality, and
   perhaps even recovery losses. Process simulation becomes in this case an
   attractive tool to design, assess, and pre-commission advanced control
   strategies. This paper presents a phenomenological dynamic Simulator for
   comminution (circuits developed in Matlab/Simulink (R). The block model
   programming allows changing plant layout or control loops easily, and is
   flexible for future extensions or model upgrades as any block can be
   simply added to the library or replaced with its updated version. The
   flexibility of the modular approach allows testing; any control system,
   from basic PID loops to advanced control schemes. A simulation case
   study shows how the simulation model can capture the behavior of an
   actual circuit once properly calibrated. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Real-time simulation plays an important role not only in the design and
   commissioning of new control strategies, but also in training the
   operators before the actual system is installed. There are in the market
   several simulation environments for carrying out these tasks. However,
   there is still a need of having more flexible environments that can be
   easily integrated with other systems and tools such as real-time
   optimization and advanced data analysis. In this work, several standard
   tools such as Simulink (R) Simulink (R) OPC toolbox, RSLogix 5000, and
   FactoryTalk (R) are integrated to simulate a control strategy for a SAG
   mill designed to keep the mill operating in the stable region by
   manipulating the fresh ore feed. The implementation of this strategy is
   based on standard control blocks available in the ControlLogix
   Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Experimental results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach to integrate standard tools, and
   open new possibilities for further developments in the design of
   advanced monitoring and control strategies for industrial processes. (C)

Abstract = {{Drug delivery at the nano-scale is becoming an important topic in nano
   and regenerative medicine as it can offer a very localized therapy.
   Therefore, niosomes are one of the most important vehicles to release
   drug at the nanoscale. In this paper, we present a new automated
   microsystem for niosome generation on-demand. Used niosome were based on
   a mixture of cholesterol and dicetyl phosphate with chloroform. Three
   compact micropumps are connected to a microfluidic substrate in order to
   generate 100 nm noisome vesicles. Through this paper we also
   investigated the impact of using 150 m m pseudo-Y and cross shape
   microchannel on the diameter of vesicles. We have observed reliable
   results with Y-shaped microchannel, which was able to generate vesicles
   down to 91 nm. All the system is based on a low-cost fabrication process
   using dry photo resist.}},

   is provided for each channel, enabling development of scalable systems
   that can interface with different types of high-density neural
   micro-probes. The proposed circuit, which have been fabricated in a TSMC
   180-nm CMOS process, employs a first order noise shaping topology with a
   passive integrator and a low-supply voltage of 0.6 V to achieve ultra
   low-power consumption and small size. The proposed ADC clearly
   outperforms other designs with a power consumption as low as 110 nW for
   a precision of 9 bits (11-fJ per conversion), a silicon area of only 82
   mu m x 84 mu m, and one of the best reported figure of merit among
   recently published data converters utilized in similar applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a short-impulse ultra-wide band (UWB) transmitter is
   introduced to enable large-scale neural recordings within miniature
   brain implants including thousands of channels. The proposed impulse
   radio UWB transmitter uses a BPSK modulation scheme, the carrier signal
   of which uses only two delayed impulses to encode the transmitted
   signal. The proposed UWB transmitter has been implemented into a CMOS
   180 nm technology. It occupies 300 mu m x 230 mu m, and consumes only
   6.7 pJ/bit from a 1.8-V supply. Experimental results show that the
   transmitter has a bandwidth of 2.6 GHz to 5.6 GHz and achieves a maximum
   data rate of 800 Mbps, which outperforms existing low-power UWB
   transmitters for similar applications.}},

Abstract = {{Low distortion applications are increasingly demanded especially in the
   medical and audiovisual fields. Equally important, body sensors are more
   and more used in the medical, sports and space research fields. For
   instance, the breathing and heart rate signals fluctuate in the 0.5 to 5
   Hz frequency range while several of the common biophysiological signals
   are situated between the 0.1 to 1 kHz spectrum like the
   electrooculography (EOG), the electroencephalography (EEG), the
   electrocardiogram (ECG), the electromyography (EMG). In this paper, an
   active low-pass filter using very high linear pseudo-resistors is
   presented. The pseudo-resistors allow the realization of very large
   resistances using small silicon area. More importantly, our proposed
   linearization technique provides tunable pseudo-resistors with very high
   linearity measured thanks to the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the
   output signal. Simulations results show that the proposed circuit's
   cutoff frequency is tunable in a wide range from 34 Hz to 20 kHz. In
   other words, we we were able to achieve a resistance value as high as
   0.46 G Omega for a THD of -60 dB or 0.1\%. Comparatively, for a cutoff
   frequency of 141 Hz and equivalent resistance of 0.11 G Omega, our
   filter achieves a THD as high as -83 dB or 0.007\%.}},

Abstract = {{Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) based-therapies are currently one of the
   most successful strategies to treat immune disorders, cancer and
   infectious diseases. Vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV)
   are very attractive to deliver the genes coding the mAbs because they
   allow long-term expression thus, reducing the number of administrations.
   They can also penetrate biological barriers such as the
   blood-brain-barrier to transduce cells localized in immunoprivileged
   organs. Recent animal studies with AAV have demonstrated the capacity of
   AAV to deliver sufficient quantity of antibodies to confer an efficient
   immunoprotection against chronic and infectious diseases for several
   months to years. The treatment was successfully applied either for
   prophylaxis or therapeutic use, depending on the disease and its
   progression. In this review, we discuss the advantages and the
   limitations of AAV for mAb and immunoadhesin delivery. Recent advances
   in vector design and antibody engineering are also presented.
   Optimization of the vector design can improve the kinetic and the level
   of mAbs expression whereas protein engineering can enhance transgene
   product properties. Furthermore, an exhaustive review of pre-clinical
   studies for chronic diseases including Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis and cancer is presented as well as for infectious
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{A precisely controlled network of protein-protein interactions
   constitutes the basis for functional signaling pathways. This
   equilibrium is more often than not disrupted in cancer cells, by the
   aberrant expression or activation of oncogenic proteins. Therefore, the
   analysis of protein interaction networks in cancer cells has become
   crucial to expand our comprehension of the molecular underpinnings of
   tumor formation and progression. This protocol describes a sample
   preparation method for the analysis of signaling complexes by mass
   spectrometry (MS), following the affinity purification of a protein of
   interest from a cancer cell line or a solid tumor. In particular, we
   provide a spin tip-based protease digestion procedure that offers a more
   rapid and controlled alternative to other gel-based and gel-free
   methods. This sample preparation protocol represents a useful strategy
   to identify protein interactions and to gain insight into the molecular
   mechanisms that contribute to a given cancer phenotype.}},

Journal = {{REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Abstract = {{Soil fertility evaluation through soil analysis traditionally does not
   consider interaction among elements. To include the interaction effect
   in interpretation of soil analyses, an experiment was conducted to
   evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kg N
   per plant per cycle) with urea (45 \% N) and potassium fertilization (0,
   0.55, 1.1, and 2.2 kg K2O per plant per cycle) with potassium chloride
   (60 \% K2O) on soil cationic balance. The experiment was carried out in
   an irrigated commercial production area of `Paluma' guava, for five
   consecutive cycles, 2009 through 2012, using the concept of isometric
   log ratio (ilr) to evaluate soil cationic balance through {[}K, Ca, Mg |

Title = {{Nitrogen and Potassium Fertilization in a Guava Orchard Evaluated for
   Five Cycles: Effects on the Plant and on Production}},
Journal = {{REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Abstract = {{Guava response to fertilization can be monitored through plant tissue
   analysis. Correct interpretation of these results, based on standard
   levels, is of great importance for correct nutrient management of the
   crop. However, standard levels are constantly criticized for not
   considering interactions among elements. To improve the nutritional
   diagnosis of `Paluma' guava (Psidium guajava L., Myrtaceae), an
   experiment was conducted using nitrogen fertilization (0, 0.5, 1.0, and
   2.0 kg per plant per cycle of N, with urea as a source with 45 \% N),
   and potassium fertilization (0, 0.55, 1.1, and 2.2 kg per plant per
   cycle of K2O, with potassium chloride as a source with 60 \% K2O) in an
   irrigated commercial area for five consecutive cycles, 2009 through
   2012, observing the influence of fertilizers and climate and assessing
   yield and leaf element content, using the concept of isometric log
   ratios (ilr) to interpret leaf analysis results (N, P, Ca, Mg, K, and
   S). This paper showed that nutrient balances and nutrient concentration
   values can be interpreted coherently using compositional data analysis.
   Ranges of nutrient balances also were established for ``Paluma{''} guava
   and validated through ranges grounded in nutrient contents currently
   used in Brazil. Nitrogen fertilization increased ``Paluma{''} guava
   yield. The 0.5 kg N application rate per plant and the other studied
   treatments practically showed the same results, and their values were
   affected by pruning time as well as the nutrient balances.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{A two phase model for two-dimensional solidification problems with
   variable densities was developed by coupling the Stefan problem with the
   Stokes problem and applying a mass conserving velocity condition on the
   phase change interface. The extended finite element method (XFEM) was
   used to capture the strong discontinuity of the velocity and pressure as
   well as the jump in heat flux at the i nterface. The melting temperature
   and velocity condition were imposed on the interface using a Lagrange
   multiplier and the penalization method, respectively. The resulting
   formulations were then coupled using a fixed point iteration a lgorithm.
   Three examples were investigated and the results were compared to
   numerical results coming from a commercial software using ALE techniques
   to track the solid/liquid interface. The model was able to reproduce the
   benchmark simulations while maintaining a sharp phase change interface
   and conserving mass.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, robotics has been seen as a key solution to improve the
   quality of life of amputees. In order to create smarter robotic
   prosthetic devices to be used in an everyday context, one must be able
   to interface them seamlessly with the end-user in an inexpensive, yet
   reliable way. In this paper, we are looking at guiding a robotic device
   by detecting gestures through measurement of the electrical activity of
   muscles captured by surface electromyography (sEMG). Reliable sEMG-based
   gesture classifiers for end-users are challenging to design, as they
   must be extremely robust to signal drift, muscle fatigue and small
   electrode displacement without the need for constant recalibration. In
   spite of extensive research, sophisticated sEMG classifiers for
   prostheses guidance are not yet widely used, as systems often fail to
   solve these issues simultaneously. We propose to address these problems
   by employing Convolutional Neural Networks. Specifically as a first
   step, we demonstrate their viability to the problem of gesture
   recognition for a low-cost, low-sampling rate (200Hz) consumer-grade,
   8-channel, dry electrodes sEMG device called Myo armband (Thalmic Labs)
   on able-bodied subjects. To this effect, we assessed the robustness of
   this machine learning oriented approach by classifying a combination of
   7 hand/wrist gestures with an accuracy of similar to 97.9\% in
   real-time, over a period of 6 consecutive days with no recalibration. In
   addition, we used the classifier (in conjunction with orientation data)
   to guide a 6DoF robotic arm, using the armband with the same speed and
   precision as with a joystick. We also show that the classifier is able
   to generalize to different users by testing it on 18 participants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an anticipative robot kinematic limitation avoidance
   algorithm for collaborative robots. The main objective is to improve the
   performance and the intuitivity of the physical human-robot interaction.
   One obstacle to achieve this goal is the management of limitations such
   as joint position limitation, singularities and collisions with the
   environment. Indeed, in addition to performing a given principal task,
   human users must pay a close attention to the manipulator configuration
   in order to handle the kinematic limitations. The proposed anticipative
   algorithm aims at relieving the human user from having to deal with such
   limitations. The algorithm is first presented and detailed for each
   individual limitation of a planar RR serial robot. The framework
   developed to manage several limitations occurring simultaneously is then
   presented. Finally, experiments are performed in order to assess the
   performance of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the economic importance of forest products industries in
   Canada, there has been an increasing interest in studying the operations
   and interactions of all the relevant entities involved in its supply
   chain (SC). The forest products industry has a set of specific SC
   characteristics to meet the needs of its final consumers. While a
   growing number of mathematical and simulation models are being presented
   for the SC in this sector, an integrated formal structure is evidently
   required for guiding the development of and evaluating these models.
   Therefore, in this research, we systematically review and identify
   existing frameworks for modelling SCs with the interest of highlighting
   the ones relevant to the forest products SCs. While we find no framework
   specific to the forest products industry, we identify a number of
   existing frameworks that could be customized to represent the industry's
   SC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a mathematical model to plan logistics
   activities in a forest products supply chain. In particular, a
   mixed-integer linear program is developed to maximize the total profit
   of the value chain, involving decisions related to the volumes of wood
   to harvest and to keep in stock, as well as the quantities to deliver to
   each business unit to meet market demand. The model also includes
   different constraints concerning fibre freshness across the network
   (forest, sawmills, and paper mill), as this has an effect on operation
   costs and supply decisions. Various scenarios based on the demand
   variation, price fluctuations, and wood aging levels are tested,
   followed by a sensitivity analysis. Results show that price and demand
   variations as well as fibre freshness are important criteria to consider
   in the procurement and production planning for increasing the forest
   supply chain benefits. The scenarios analysed also confirm the
   usefulness of the model in guiding companies to make adequate planning
   decisions according to their business environment.}},

Abstract = {{This article applies an optimization and simulation framework to
   identify the impacts of uncontrollable supply in the demand-driven wood
   remanufacturing industry. In the remanufacturing business, providing
   supply of raw materials in terms of quality is an uncontrollable
   process, especially when combined with other industry characteristics
   such as divergent co-production, alternative processes, make-to-order
   philosophy and short order cycle times. By considering a set of key
   performance indicators (KPIs) to measure production plan efficiency, our
   framework uses a periodic re-planning strategy based on a rolling
   horizon. Then, the source of lumber is perturbed, leading to different
   supply scenarios. Simulations are conducted using a mixture experimental
   design approach to identify the safety threshold of supply changes in
   the scenarios regarding the selected KPIs. This threshold of all KPIs
   leads us to an overall optimum region which includes a series of
   desirable scenarios. The proposed framework allows planner to understand
   the impact of supply policies to deal with uncertainties.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{There is a trend that sawmills are more focused on particular valuable
   products in their production. This has led to an increased demand for
   sawlogs that are better adapted to the target products and production
   efficiency. Depending on the product being produced there are different
   log properties which are better adapted for certain products than
   others. Sawmills can require hard constraints on log properties such as
   length, diameter, internode length and sound knots. Some properties are
   not required but are desired as they make the production more efficient
   or increase the frequencies of preferred products. In these cases, we
   include an added value corresponding to what the industry is willing to
   pay for improved adaptation of the raw material. To achieve this, we
   propose an optimization model that integrates logging operations
   (bucking and forwarding) at harvest areas, transportation planning and
   flexible description of demand at sawmills. High flexibility for sorting
   at harvest areas may require additional piles of different properties to
   be generated. Instead of using a large number of special assortments, we
   allow many sorting alternatives depending on the requirements used at
   the industries. The transportation planning decides on the flows between
   harvest areas and sawmills while considering demand and supply. Even if
   many potential piles are used in the planning model, only a few may be
   used in practice. We present computational results based on 16
   synthesized geographically distributed harvest areas, each representing
   all regional variation of mature sample trees from the Swedish National
   Forest Inventory and a number of sawmills.}},

Abstract = {{Sweet sorghum and sweet pearl millet have good agro-industrial potential
   because they can be used as energy crops, using the sugary juice
   contained in their stalks to produce bioethanol, while the bagasse
   (pressing residues) can be used as animal feed. However, the process of
   extracting the juice and consequently the sugar from the biomass of
   these crops needs to be explored. For this study, two experimental
   presses, a four-roller press and a hydraulic press, were designed and
   built at the Department of Soils and Agri-Food Engineering of Universite
   Laval, in Quebec, Canada. With bioethanol production in mind, an
   experiment was carried out using the hydraulic press to investigate the
   effects of stalk chopping mode (fine vs. coarse) and various compressive
   forces, as well as a comparison between the two presses, to determine
   the more suitable press for extracting the sugary juice from these crops
   with or without leaves. The roller press gave good results with sweet
   sorghum, as no significant difference between the presses was found in
   the volume of juice extracted if the leaves were removed prior to
   extraction. However, the hydraulic press was more suitable than the
   roller press for extracting juice from sweet pearl millet. Chopping mode
   did not have any effect on the volume of juice extracted. Leaves should
   be removed prior to pressing with the roller press. When using the
   hydraulic press, leaf removal was necessary only with sweet sorghum. An
   estimated ethanol yield of 1956 L ha(-1) could be achieved using the
   hydraulic press to extract the juice from sweet sorghum without leaves.}},

Abstract = {{The energy consumption is one of the main problems which remain to be
   addressed in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Therefore, in recent years
   several clustering routing protocols for homogeneous and heterogeneous
   sensor networks have been proposed since these protocols are playing a
   key role in reducing energy consumption of the WSNs. A new Multi-Level
   Energy-Efficient Clustering (MLEEC) heterogeneous protocol is reported
   in this paper, where an optimal clustering and a threshold for Cluster
   Head (CH) election are proposed. The numerical results obtained show
   that the proposed protocol exceeds the performance of existing
   representatives of heterogeneous WSN routing protocols in term of
   lifetime and the number of messages received by the sink node. In
   addition, the balancing of the energy dissipated between the nodes is
   more important than for the other protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Maps are a vital component in autonomous mobile systems. However, they
   can be computationally expensive to build, particularly in the case of
   globally-consistent ones. To circumvent this issue, topometric
   approaches have been proposed, especially in the context of the
   Teach-and-Repeat paradigm. These topometric maps are graphs, where nodes
   are local maps and edges are the known transform between these nodes.
   When building these topometric maps, one important question is how far
   apart should these local maps be collected in the environment. On one
   hand, a densely sampled topometric map will be more robust, but at the
   cost of an increased database size. On the other hand, fewer local maps
   mean a more efficient topometric map. Traditional approaches record
   these local maps at a fixed, regular intervals. In this paper, we
   propose an offline algorithm that automatically prunes nodes in a way
   that offers some empirical guarantees on localization errors. In
   particular, our approach is based on first collecting a densely sampled
   topometric map, then finding a minimal subset of nodes using a

   three datasets confirmed the ability of our approach to minimize the

Abstract = {{Action analysis from video data has been attracting more and more
   attention in computer vision over the past decade. The main focus has
   been classifying videos into one of k action classes from fully observed
   videos. However, all of the time, intelligent systems are enforced to
   make decisions under uncertainty and based on incomplete information.
   This need motivates us to introduce the problem of analyzing the
   uncertainty associated with dyadic human activities and move to a new
   level of generality in the action analysis problem. Analyzing the
   uncertainty, here, refers to categorizing the likelihood of activities
   in trimmed video clips called time-slices which are extracted from the
   full video. To this intent, we exploit the state-of-the-art methods to
   extract interest points in time-slices and represent them. We also
   present an accumulative uncertainty to depict the uncertainty associated
   with partially observed videos for the task of early activity
   recognition. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   framework in analyzing dyadic activities under uncertainty and in
   evaluating the performance of early activity recognition methods.}},

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive
   learning stage and a considerable amount of training images. Recently,
   with the introduction of these models (and in particular convolutional
   neural network (CNN)), it is believed that the best solution to achieve
   a system with high performance on scene classification is to learn deep
   scene features using CNN. While this can be true for large-scale image
   datasets (in the scale of one-million training images), the feasibility
   of reaching state-of-the-art performances in other complex datasets with
   a handful training examples remains unclear. Here, we argue that we can
   reach a highly accurate performance by presenting a simple model on the
   scene classification problem.
   This paper presents a hierarchical two-stage scene classification
   framework based on indoor versus outdoor notion. The suggested approach
   is a simple, yet a very efficient global image representation model for
   scene recognition. Though the term of indoor versus outdoor has been in
   the literature for quite a while, here we go further than that and
   propose a scene classifier model which classifies all the outdoor scene
   classes versus one undifferentiated indoor class. To achieve this, we
   tackle the problem of scene classification by using distributions of
   quantized filter responses to characterize the scenes. Later the
   classifier outputs either one of the several outdoor scene classes or a
   generic indoor scene class. We validate the proposed approach by feeding
   the algorithm with two benchmark datasets: 15-Scene category and SUN397.
   Successful experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed
   approach. With the presented model, we reach an average accuracy of
   97.84\% and 55.1\% in outdoor scenes and 93.09\% and 92.4\% in the
   indoor scene class on 15-Scene and SUN397 respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Bag of visual words (BoVW) remains a very competitive representation in
   the domain of scene classification. In this framework, extracting SIFT
   descriptors on a dense grid of pixels has shown to lead to a better
   performance. However, due to the nature of SIFT as an edge-based
   descriptor, computing SIFT on homogeneous regions might result in
   non-stable region descriptors. The suggested solution in the literature
   is ignoring and discarding these regions descriptors from the final
   image-level representation.
   We argue that homogeneous regions contain valuable scene information if
   represented appropriately. In such manner, a simple yet effective method
   to model homogeneous image regions is proposed. We call these models
   contextual information, where their importance on scene classification
   is investigated. The final image-level representation is the stacking of
   feature vectors from homogeneous and non-homogeneous regions. The
   proposed approach is validated on two de-facto standard databases for
   scene classification: Fifteen Scene Categories and 67 Indoor Scenes
   datasets. Experimental results on these two datasets show the
   effectiveness of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The frail elderly in Canada face a tough decision when
   they start to lose autonomy: whether to stay at home or move to another
   location. This study seeks to scale up and evaluate the implementation
   of shared decision-making (SDM) in interprofessional (IP) home care
   teams caring for elderly clients or their caregivers facing a decision
   about staying at home or moving elsewhere.
   Methods: A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial involving 8 Health and
   Social Service Centers (HSSCs) will be conducted with IP home care
   teams. HSSCs are the unit of randomisation. A decision guide will be
   passively distributed to all of the participating HSSCs at the beginning
   of the project. The participating HSSCs will then be randomised to 1 of
   4 intervention start times, separated by 7-month intervals. The primary
   outcome is whether or not clients and caregivers assumed an active role
   in decision-making, assessed with a modified version of the Control
   Preferences Scale. The intervention, targeted at IP home care teams,
   consists of a 1.5 hour online tutorial and a 3.5 hour skills building
   workshop in IP SDM. Clients will be eligible for outcome assessment if
   they (1) are aged >= 65; (2) are receiving care from the IP home care
   team of the enrolled HSSCs; (3) have made a decision about whether to
   stay at home or move to another location during the recruitment periods;
   (4) are able to read, understand and write French or English; (5) can
   give informed consent. If clients are not able to provide informed
   consent, their primary caregiver will become the eligible participant.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethics committee review approval has been
   obtained from the Multicenter Ethics Committee of CISSS-Laval. Results
   will be disseminated at conferences, on websites of team members and in
   peer-reviewed and professional journals intended for policymakers and
   managers.}},

Title = {{Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain
   adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar
   but different distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the
   theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain
   transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that
   cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target)
   domains.
   The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network
   architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain
   and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data
   is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the
   emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning
   task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the
   shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be
   achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few
   standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting
   augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and
   stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little e
   ff ort using any of the deep learning packages.
   We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classi fi
   cation problems (document sentiment analysis and image classi fi
   cation), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on
   standard benchmarks is achieved. We also validate the approach for
   descriptor learning task in the context of person re-identi fi cation
   application.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{4710-4717}},
Abstract = {{Continuous, non-intrusive measurements of time-varying viscosity of
   Pseudomonas sp. biofilms are made using a microfluidic method that
   combines video tracking with a semi-empirical viscous flow model. The
   approach uses measured velocity and height of tracked biofilm segments,
   which move under the constant laminar flow of a nutrient solution.
   Following a low viscosity growth stage, rapid thickening was observed.
   During this stage, viscosity increased by over an order of magnitude in
   less than ten hours. The technique was also demonstrated as a promising
   platform for parallel experiments by subjecting multiple biofilmladen
   microchannels to nutrient solutions containing NaCl in the range of 0 to
   34 mM. Preliminary data suggest a strong relationship between ionic
   strength and biofilm properties, such as average viscosity and rapid
   thickening onset time. The technique opens the way for a combinatorial
   approach to study the response of biofilm viscosity under
   well-controlled physical, chemical and biological growth conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A landform is an area of a terrain with its own recognisable shape. Its
   definition is often qualitative and inherently vague. Hence landforms
   are difficult to formalise in view of their extraction from a DTM. This
   paper presents a two-level framework for the representation of
   landforms. The objective is to provide a structure where landforms can
   be conceptually designed according to a common model which can be
   implemented. It follows the principle that landforms are not defined by
   geometrical characteristics but by salient features perceived by people.
   Hence, these salient features define a skeleton around which the
   landform is built. The first level of our model defines general concepts
   forming a landform prototype while the second level provides a model for
   the translation of these concepts and landform extraction on a DTM. The
   model is still under construction and preliminary results together with
   current developments are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, reliable and secure transmission over generic-Gaussian
   wiretap channel model is investigated. An Adaptive Granular Hybrid
   Automatic Repeat reQuest (AG-HARQ) protocol is proposed which tries to
   minimize the required rate for successful decoding by the legitimate
   parties while amplifying the privacy by minimizing the information
   leakage to a wiretapper. In the case of LDPC decoding failure at the
   legitimate receiver (Bob), a retransmission is requested until correct
   decoding or until the maximum number of transmitted packets is reached.
   As soon as Bob is able to correctly decode the LDPC codeword, the
   retransmissions are stopped to avoid any additional bits leakage to the
   eavesdropper (Eve). In our proposed method, to minimize the leakage, a
   confidence level index, C-j, for correct decoding is defined as the mean
   of absolute value of the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR). In the case of
   failure, only the sub-packets with the smallest C-j values will be
   retransmitted since they represent the most unreliable information
   sub-packets. Frame Error Rate (FER) is used as a metric to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Many electric power utilities, such as Hydro Quebec, are capacity
   limited despite having enormous energy surpluses. When demand and supply

   power utilities seeking improvement of the efficiency of their power
   plants. Also presented is a comparative investigation of the effects of
   choosing different disutility functions on OLC performance with respect

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new sensor control algorithm to adapt the
   operation parameters of the sensors in order to optimize temporal
   coverage. Traditional sensor control algorithms rely on
   non-probabilistic sensor coverage models and simple target trajectory
   prediction methods, while the new algorithm overcomes all these
   limitations. The proposed approach make an optimization of one sensor at
   the time, processed in a random order. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art general purpose
   optimization method (i. e., CMA-ES). Results show that our algorithm
   produces the results in a much shorter time in all the cases considered,
   while the final coverage of the network was superior in a smaller map
   and competitive in larger maps. Therefore, the new algorithm can be used
   in scenarios where response within some time limit is of great
   importance (e. g., real-time control of the sensors).}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of an operator's functional state (i.e., the
   multidimensional pattern of human psychophysiological conditions that
   mediates performance) has great potential for increasing safety and
   reliability of critical systems. However, live monitoring of functional
   state using physiological and behavioral data still faces several
   challenges before achieving the level of precision required in many
   operational contexts. One open question is the level of granularity of
   the models. Is a general model sufficient or should subject-specific
   models be trained to ensure high accuracy? Another challenge concerns
   the formalization of a valid ground truth for training classifiers. This
   is critical in order to train models that are operationally relevant.
   This paper introduces the Decontextualized Dynamic Performance (DDP)
   metric which allows models to be trained simultaneously on different
   tasks using machine learning algorithms. This paper reports the
   performance of various classification algorithms at different levels of

Abstract = {{This work examines the role of NaOH and Ca(OH)(2) on the hydrothermal
   decomposition of industrial jarosite deposited by a Mexican company in a
   tailings dam. The industrial jarosite is mainly composed by
   natrojarosite and contains 150 g Ag/t, showing a narrow particle size
   distribution, as revealed by XRD, fire assay, SEM-EDS and laser-daction
   analysis. The effect of the pH, when using NaOH or Ca(OH)(2) as
   alkalinizing agent was studied by carrying out decomposition experiments
   at different pH values and 60 degrees C in a homogeneous size particle
   system (pH = 8, 9, 10 and 11) and in a heterogeneous size particle
   system (pH = 11). Also, the kinetic study of the process and the
   controlling step of the decomposition reaction when NaOH and Ca(OH)(2)
   are used was determined by fitting the data obtained to the shrinking
   core model for spherical particles of constant size. These results,
   supported by chemical (EDS), morphological (SEM) and mapping of elements
   (EDS) analysis of a partially reacted jarosite particle allowed to
   conclude that when NaOH is used, the process kinetics is controlled by
   the chemical reaction and when Ca(OH)(2) is used, the rate determining
   step is changed to a diffusion control through a layer of solid
   products.}},

   algorithm able to process incoming tweets. A first implementation of the

   produces a partition of tweets similar to the manual partition obtained
   from humans. In future work, we plan to extend this algorithm with
   additional features and integrate the resulting analytical capabilities

Abstract = {{Partner selection is gradually recognized as an essential factor in
   gaining success in a cooperative settings. In this paper, a novel
   approach based on fuzzy AHP group decision-making for partner selection
   of joint venture projects is proposed. In this approach, first, the
   influential factors for selection of appropriate partners based on
   literature review and interviews with experts are identified. Then,
   using a method considering the risk, knowledge, and educational
   background of decision-makers, the impact of decision-makers is
   calculated. Pairwise comparison matrices are performed, and the weights
   of criteria are calculated based on two methods (multiplicative and
   additive). Then, the calculated weights of criteria and the potential
   partners have been ranked via an efficient ranking index. Finally, the
   application of this methodology to a real case study in National Iranian
   Petrochemical Company (NPC) is conducted. The contribution of this study
   is developing a fresh systematic approach for partner selection of
   international joint ventures and application in a real-life case study
   to present an operational guideline to the petrochemical industries. The
   results of this study reveal that the equipment of the partner, its
   financial capacity, trusts and management skills are the most important
   criteria for establishing the durable partners in the international
   joint venture of NPC. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology. All

Abstract = {{Potato fertilization response models have been developed for 46 soil
   series in the province of Quebec, Canada. This study aimed to create a
   set of representative soil classes based on morphological data so that
   they reflect suitable soil properties for growing potato. Data of modal
   soil profiles of soil series contain morphological attributes from
   master horizons (including bedrock) with diagnoses indicating the
   absence (0), weak expression (0.5) or presence (1) of specific
   properties (pedogenetic features), and particle-size distribution. A
   distance matrix was calculated to represent the dissimilarity between
   the soil profiles. Using multidimensional scaling technique, soil
   profiles distributed in a feature space were clustered using the fuzzy
   k-means with extragrades algorithm to allow expressing soil groups as
   continuous variables, hence facilitating modeling. The dissimilarity
   measure between soil profiles computed using soil descriptions (e.g.,
   color, pH, and C content) at experimental sites showed that genetic
   horizon indices can be used as a basis to compare and allocate soil
   profiles to existing classes. In conclusion, numerical clustering

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to reorient a free-floating serial
   manipulator using internal motion based on a path planning algorithm
   using a dynamic model of the manipulator and a potential function.
   Simulations with the proposed algorithm are performed using a nonlinear
   optimization technique in order to determine the actuator's velocity
   trajectories that achieve the reorientation. An example trajectory is
   presented in which a three-link planar robot starts from a pose in which
   all the links are aligned and ends with the same joint configuration but
   with the robot having completed a 180 degrees rotation. For this
   example, the algorithm finds trajectories that allow the robot to
   complete approximately 94\% of the reorientation. To verify the
   simulation results against a real robot, a prototype of a planar robot
   with three bodies and two revolute joints is built. The experiments
   conducted show that the prototype is able to achieve the prescribed
   reorientation, even though the control of the orientation was
   implemented in an open-loop mode.}},

Abstract = {{In this Paper, we propose a new method for safe electrical neural
   stimulation. Current mode digital-toanalog converters are used to
   generate the cathodic and the anodic stimulation phases. A
   sample-and-hold and a window comparator circuit are used to compare the
   voltage of the electrode and the tissue with a target value within a
   safe voltage range of -50 mV to +50 mV. When the electrode voltage falls
   below the lower bound or above the upper bound of such a safe voltage
   range, the anodic stimulation pulse width is modified in such a way that
   the electrode voltage remains in the safe range. High-level pulse
   shrinking (HLPS) and low-level pulse shrinking (HLPS) elements are used
   in digital part to modify anodic pulse width. Simulation results for the
   proposed circuit implemented in a 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS technology confirm
   proper functioning and show that the proposed circuit requires extremely
   low power compared to other charge balancing schemes, with a power
   consumption of 4.2 mu W.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic forcing factors and their changes
   significantly impact water resources in many river basins around the
   world. Information on such changes can be derived from fine scale in
   situ and satellite observations, used in combination with hydrological
   models. The latter need to account for hydrological changes caused by
   human activities to correctly estimate the actual water resource. In
   this study, we consider the catchment area of the Garonne river (in
   France) to investigate the capabilities of space-based observations and
   up-to-date hydrological modeling in estimating water resources of a
   river basin modified by human activities and a changing climate. Using
   the ISBA-MODCOU and SWAT hydrological models, we find that the water
   resources of the Garonne basin display a negative climate trend since
   1960. The snow component of the two models is validated using the
   moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover extent
   climatology. Crop sowing dates based on remote sensing studies are also
   considered in the validation procedure. Use of this dataset improves the
   simulated evapotranspiration and river discharge amounts when compared
   to conventional data. Finally, we investigate the benefit of using the
   MAELIA multi-agent model that accounts for a realistic agricultural and
   management scenario. Among other results, we find that changes in crop
   systems have significant impacts on water uptake for agriculture. This
   work constitutes a basis for the construction of a future modeling
   framework of the sociological and hydrological system of the Garonne
   river region.}},

Abstract = {{There is a clinical need for tissue-engineered small-diameter (< 6 mm)
   vascular grafts since clinical applications are halted by the limited
   suitability of autologous or synthetic grafts. This study uses the
   self-assembly approach to produce a fibroblast-derived decellularized
   vascular scaffold (FDVS) that can be available off-the-shelf. Briefly,
   extracellular matrix scaffolds were produced using human dermal
   fibroblasts sheets rolled around a mandrel, maintained in culture to
   allow for the formation of cohesive and three-dimensional tubular
   constructs, and decellularized by immersion in deionized water. The
   FDVSs were implanted as an aortic interpositional graft in six
   Sprague-Dawley rats for 6 months. Five out of the six implants were
   still patent 6 months after the surgery. Histological analysis showed
   the infiltration of cells on both abluminal and luminal sides, and
   immunofluorescence analysis suggested the formation of neomedia
   comprised of smooth muscle cells and lined underneath with an
   endothelium. Furthermore, to verify the feasibility of producing
   tissue-engineered blood vessels of clinically relevant length and
   diameter, scaffolds with a 4.6 mm inner diameter and 17 cm in length
   were fabricated with success and stored for an extended period of time,
   while maintaining suitable properties following the storage period. This
   novel demonstration of the potential of the FDVS could accelerate the
   clinical availability of tissue-engineered blood vessels and warrants
   further preclinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Wastes resulting from the nuclear electricity production have to be
   isolated from the biosphere for a very long period of time. For this
   purpose, deep underground repository in weak permeable geological layers
   is considered as a reliable solution for the nuclear waste storage. It
   is however well established that during excavation, the underground
   drilling process engenders cracks and eventually fractures {[}1] that
   deteriorate the hydro-mechanical properties of the surrounding host
   material in the so-called Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ). The EDZ
   behaviour is a major issue because it may constitute a preferential flow
   path for radionuclide migration. Consequently, the characterisation of
   the material transport properties and of the transfer kinetics that
   occur around galleries still need to be investigated. The EDZ properties
   may be also affected by host rock-gallery air interactions. Ventilation
   induced drying may also provoke additional cracking, which potentially
   alters the transport properties of the damaged zone. Large-scale air
   ventilation experiments are performed in Underground Research
   Laboratories (URL) that have been constructed to check the feasibility
   of the repository. A numerical modelling of the SDZ air ventilation test
   (Andra URL) performed in a low permeability rock is proposed in order to
   both predict the development of the EDZ during excavation and study the
   air interaction with the host formation during maintenance phases.}},

Title = {{Joint reliability based design and periodic preventive maintenance
   policy for systems sold with warranty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-17}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The authors consider a system which is a part of a complex
   equipment (e.g. aircraft, automobile, medical equipment, production
   machine, etc.), and which consists of N independent series subsystems.
   The purpose of this paper is to determine simultaneously the system
   design (reliability) and its preventive maintenance (PM) replacements
   periodicity which minimize the total average cost per time unit over the
   equipment useful life, taking into account a minimum required
   reliability level between consecutive replacements.
   Design/methodology/approach - The problem is tackled in the context of
   reliability-based design (RBD) considering at the same time the burn-in
   of components, the warranty commitment and the maintenance strategy to
   be adopted. A mathematical model is developed to express the total
   average cost per time unit to be minimized under a reliability
   constraint. The total average cost includes the cost of acquiring and
   assembling components, the burn-in of each component, preventive and
   corrective replacements performed during the warranty and post-warranty
   periods. A numerical procedure is proposed to solve the problem.
   Findings - For any given set of input data including components
   reliability, their cost and the costs of their preventive and corrective
   replacements, the system design (reliability) and the periodicity of
   preventive replacement during the post-warranty period is obtained such
   as the system's total average cost per time unit is minimized. The
   obtained results clearly indicate that a decrease in the number of PM
   actions to be performed during the post-warranty period increases the
   number of components to be added at each subsystem at the design stage.
   Research limitations/implications - Given that the objective function
   (cost rate function) to be minimized is non-linear and involves several
   integer variables, it has not been possible to derive the optimal
   solution. A numerical procedure based on a heuristic approach has been
   proposed to solve the problem finding a nearly optimal solution for a
   given set of input data.
   Practical implications - This paper offers to manufacturers a
   comprehensive approach to look for the most economical combination of
   the reliability level to be given to their products at the design stage,
   on one hand, and the PM policy to be adopted, on the other hand, given
   the offered warranty and service for the products and reliability
   requirements during the life cycle.
   Originality/value - While the RBD problem has been largely treated, most
   of the published works have focussed on the development or the
   improvement of solving techniques used to find the optimal
   configuration. In this paper the authors provide a more comprehensive
   approach that considers simultaneously RBD, the burn-in and warranty
   periods, along with the maintenance policy to be adopted. The authors
   also consider the context of products whose component failures cannot be
   rectified through repair actions. They can only be fixed by replacement.}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterials are materials from which medical devices are made. Based on
   their chemical composition, they can be polymers, metals, ceramics or
   composites. Metals are still the most used biomaterials mostly due to
   their superior mechanical properties and can be found in orthopedic,
   cardiovascular and dental implants. However, many type of implants can
   only work properly when polymers or ceramics are also used in pair with
   metals such as in total knee or hip arthroplasties. Nowadays,
   biomaterials are no longer seen as inert substances supporting or
   replacing dysfunctional tissues or organs. They are now required to
   promote the healing process and self-disintegrate once the process is
   completed. All the efforts in searching ideal biomaterials are paid to
   improve the wellness and health of human beings. This chapter is
   intended to give a brief introduction to the structure and property of
   biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Advancement in wireless and microsystems technology have ushered in new
   devices that can directly interface with the central nervous system for
   stimulating and/or monitoring neural circuitry. In this paper, we
   present the design of low-power CMOS integrated transceivers intended
   for utilization into large-scale multi-channel neural
   stimulating/monitoring implants. We discuss the design and the
   implementation of different modulation schemes and pulse shaping
   strategies within CMOS circuits, we review the most critical design
   challenges of this sensitive application, we compare different solutions
   and circuit topologies in terms of performance and safety, and we
   introduce a suitable implantable UWB antenna. In particular, we present
   an integrated transmitter (TX) and a receiver (RX) that are designed to
   share a single implantable antenna. The TX generates ultra wideband
   (UWB) impulses based on edge combining, and the RX uses a low-power
   ISM-2.4-GHz narrow-band OOK receiver topology. The RX can support
   downlink telemetry of neural stimulation applications with a data rate
   as high as 100 Mbps within a power budget of 5 mW, while the TX is
   designed to support uplink back telemetry with a data rate of up to 800
   Mbps for power consumption of 5.36 mW for BPSK modulation. Finally, we
   present measurement results obtained with biological tissues that
   confirm the full functionality of the fabricated implantable
   transceiver.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the modern topology of multilevel converters,
   which are suitable for use in high power photovoltaic applications with
   the focus on achieving lower total harmonic distortion and better
   efficiency. Multilevel converters offer several advantages compared to
   conventional types. Multilevel converters provide high quality output
   while using the low switching frequency. It affects the switching
   losses, size of semiconductor switches and harmonic filters. This
   research investigates various topologies of multilevel converter for
   high power photovoltaic applications and compares their THD, efficiency,
   number of required semiconductors and other important characteristics.
   All topologies are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink in the same operating
   conditions. Finally, the more suitable multilevel topology is selected
   with respect to the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses critical issues and reports key findings with
   regards to the development of participant-generic operator functional
   state (OFS) models in the context of cognitive work. Conceptually, this
   research is concerned with the nature of the relationship between the
   physiological state of individuals and human performance. Participants
   were physiologically monitored (cardiac, respiratory, and eye activity)
   during the execution a set of two cognitive tasks - n-back and visual
   search - for which there were two levels of difficulty. Levels of
   difficulty were associated with levels of mental workload. Performance
   on the tasks was also monitored and linked with OFS. Modeling of the
   relationship between physiological state and OFS involved systematic
   manipulation of three parameters: (1) size of smoothing window for
   performance, (2) performance decrement threshold for labelling
   functional and sub-functional states, and (3) the mode of classification
   being either prospective or descriptive. Modeling was performed using
   two types of classifiers. Results show that (1) models that use
   bio-behavioral data were capable of classifying performance on new
   participant data above chance, (2) levels of mental workload were better
   classified than OFS, (3) size of smoothing window had a significant
   impact on classifier performance, and (4) size of smoothing window,
   threshold values, and classifier type had a significant impact on
   sensitivity and specificity. Implications for the use of OFS models in
   operational contexts are discussed.}},
