Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a probabilistic analysis approach for
   assessing the reliability of supply chain for contingency operation
   consisting of several cities. We consider that the demand of cities and
   the quantity of products available at distribution centre are uncertain.
   Also, we analyze the case where the quality of products available at
   distribution center is considered uncertain. We evaluate the reliability
   of supply chain without making any particular assumption on normality of
   distribution of population demand and the quantity of products available
   at distribution center. Also, we analyse the problem with making
   correlation between demand of each city and quantity of products
   available at distribution center. To conduct a probabilistic analysis we
   consider the supply chain as a structure that undergoes an external load
   represented by the demand of population during the crisis period and
   resist to this load by its strength represented by the quantity of
   products available at distribution center. The reliability of supply
   chain for contingency operation is defined as the probability that the
   available inventory at distribution center meets all population demand
   during crisis period. The supply chain is considered laded{''} if the
   quantity available at distribution center is less than population demand
   during crisis period. First Order Reliability Method is used to evaluate
   the reliability of supply chain.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, lot sizing problem is integrated with preventive
   maintenance scheduling taking into account several aspects of the

   it can reduce the costs. The significance of the savings resulted from
   joint models supports the competency of the organization. Age based
   imperfect maintenance with increasing hazard rate and its influences on
   production and quality systems is addressed, and related cost
   evaluations are developed. Length of quality inspection intervals is
   determined such that the integrated hazard rates over all segments of a
   period for a certain machine are equal. The optimum value of the
   integrated hazard depends on multiple factors, including reworking cost,
   backorder cost, production size, etc. The mathematical model is a
   nonlinear optimization problem and a genetic algorithm is used to solve
   it. A numerical example and extensive investigations are also conducted.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) reacting turbulent two-phase
   flow field of a scaled swirl-stabilized gas turbine combustor is
   numerically investigated using the commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT
   (TM)-v14. The first scope of this study aims to explicitly compare the
   predictive capabilities of two turbulence models namely Scale-Adaptive
   Simulation (SAS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for a reasonable
   compromise between accuracy of results and global computational cost
   when applied to simulate swirl-stabilized spray combustion. The second
   scope of the study is to couple chemical reactions to the turbulent flow
   using a realistic chemistry model and also to model the local chemical
   non equilibrium effects caused by turbulent strain. Standard Eulerian
   and Lagrangian formulations are used to describe both gaseous and liquid
   phases respectively. The fuel used is liquid jet-A1 which is injected in
   the form of a polydisperse spray and the droplet evaporation rate is
   calculated using the infinite conductivity model. One-component
   (n-decane) and two-component fuels (n-decane + toluene) are used as
   jet-A1 surrogates. The combustion model is based on the first and second
   moments of the mixture fraction, and a presumed probability density
   function (PDF) is used to model turbulent chemistry interactions. The
   instantaneous thermochemical state necessary for the chemistry
   tabulation is determined by using initially the partial equilibrium
   assumption (PEQ) and thereafter, the detailed non-equilibrium (NEQ)
   calculations through the laminar flamelet concept. The combustion
   chemistry of these surrogates is represented through a reduced chemical
   kinetic mechanism (CKM) comprising I 045 reactions among 139 species,
   derived from the detailed jet-A1 surrogate model, JetSurf 2.0, Numerical
   results are compared with a set of published data for a steady spray
   flame. Firstly, it is observed that, by coupling the two turbulence
   models with a combustion model incorporating a representative chemistry
   to account for non-equilibrium effects with realistic fuel properties,
   the models predict reasonably well the main combustion trends, with a
   superior performance for LES in terms of trade-off between accuracy and
   computing time. Secondly, because of some assumptions with the
   combustion model, some discrepancies are found in the prediction of
   species slowly produced or consumed such as CO and H-2. Finally, the
   study emphasizes the dominant advantage of an adequate resolution of the
   mixing characteristics especially with the more demanding simulation of
   a swirl-stabilized spray flame.}},

Abstract = {{Many 2D mechanical models have been developed to simulate liquid
   sloshing of a partially filled tank with different shapes. However,
   those models don't represent properly the complex liquid motion,
   especially in the case of the portable tanks. Indeed, forces exerted on
   the fluid can be lateral, longitudinal and vertical. Then, liquid
   displacement and pressure forces applied to the tank walls are
   undervalued and can cause design flaws. In this case, 2D mechanical
   models are ineffective for the simulation of liquid motion properly. It
   this study a 3D equivalent mechanical model has been developed. This
   dynamical model is used to simulate different liquid motion in a
   partially filled tank that take into account any sort of excitement
   forces and get more accurate results in terms of displacements and
   pressure forces. Afterward, various tank forms and their compatibility
   with the 3D model are discussed, such as circular, modified oval and
   modified trapezoidal sections. Finally, equations of motion are
   developed for each tank shape.}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at analysis of transient lateral slosh in a
   partially-filled cylindrical tank with different designs of longitudinal
   partial baffles using a coupled multimodal and boundary-element method.
   A boundary element method is initially formulated to solve the
   eigenvalue problem of free liquid slosh, assuming inviscid,
   incompressible and irrotational flows. Significant improvement in
   computational time is achieved by reducing the generalized eigenvalue
   problem to a standard one involving only the velocity potentials on the
   half free-surface length using the zoning method. The generalized
   coordinates of the free-surface oscillations under a lateral excitation
   are then obtained from superposition of the natural slosh modes. The
   lateral slosh force is also formulated in terms of the generalized
   coordinates and hydrodynamic coefficients. The validity of the model is
   illustrated through comparisons with available analytical solutions. Two
   different designs of longitudinal baffles are considered: bottom- and
   top-mounted baffles. The effect of different baffle designs on the
   normalized slosh frequencies, modes and lateral force are investigated.
   It is shown that the multimodal method yields computationally efficient
   solutions of liquid slosh within moving baffled containers. The results
   suggest that the effectiveness of baffles in suppressing the liquid
   oscillations is strongly affected by the baffle length relative to the
   free-surface height. The top mounted baffle yields the greatest
   effectiveness, when it pierces the free-surface. The bottom-mounted
   baffle, however, may not be considered as an efficient mean for
   controlling the liquid slosh in tank vehicles where the liquid fill
   height is above 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Delayed deformations in concrete under sustained loading may depend on
   complex chemo-hydro-mechanical phenomena. Generally, the creep
   deformation of a cement paste is distinguished in the short-term and
   long-term. Simply speaking, the former can be associated to the
   diffusion of gel water in pores and cracks and it is mainly volumetric
   (i.e., volumetric deformation), reversible, and bounded. The latter can
   be associated to the sliding of the sheets of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate
   (C-S-H), which is mainly deviatoric (i.e., shape deformation),
   irreversible and with an unbounded asymptotic deformation. From an
   experimental point of view, recent studies have shown that
   microindentation is a powerful technique to quickly characterize basic
   creep thanks to the reduced characteristic time of a sample size of few
   micrometers. The objective of this project is twofold: (1) investigating
   the effect of relative humidity on the creep behavior by
   microindentation; (2) characterize the viscous behavior of the interface
   transition zones (ITZ) around a rigid inclusion. In particular, the
   project investigated two different relative humidity, 33\% and 85\%, by
   considering both creep and relaxation microindentation tests. The
   presented results show the effect of the moisture content on the creep
   behavior of cement paste both at short and long terms. In addition, the
   results showed that the ITZ zone around an aggregate showed higher creep
   than the bulk cement paste. Those results provide new insights to
   understand the role of water and interface porosity on the creep
   mechanisms of concrete.}},

Abstract = {{The new Sequential Multi-block PLS algorithm is applied for establishing
   multivariate specification regions jointly on multiple types of MW
   materials. SMB-PLS distinguishes between process variations associated
   with raw materials from other orthogonal sources of variations such as
   operating policies. Combinations of raw material properties not
   compensated by the control schemes are clearly identified. Multivariate
   specifications are required for these combinations to avoid negative
   impact on process performance and product quality. The method was
   applied to an industrial aluminum smelter. Bad combinations of raw
   material properties were identified and validated against process

Abstract = {{Active droop compensation systems, so called active bouncers, for
   klystron modulators based on monolithic pulse transformers perform the
   regulation of the output pulse voltage while simultaneously withstand
   all the primary current of the modulator. This imposes the utilization
   of high power semiconductors which can produce high switching losses and
   degrade the overall system efficiency. In order to overcome this issue,
   this paper proposes a new active bouncer topology based on the parallel
   connection of two different power converters: the first one is in charge
   of handling the majority of the primary current at high efficiency, and
   the second one is used to fine tune the bouncer voltage via a high
   bandwidth converter rated at a fraction of the first parallel connected
   converter. Detailed comparison between a classical active bouncer and
   two variants of the proposed topology are presented and based on
   numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a resources-optimized digital action potential (AP)
   detector featuring an adaptive threshold based on a new Sigma-delta
   control loop. The proposed AP detector is optimized for utilizing low
   hardware resources, which makes it suitable for implementation on most
   popular low-power microcontrollers units (MCU). The adaptive threshold
   is calculated using a digital control loop based on a Sigma-delta
   modulator that precisely estimates the standard deviation of the
   amplitude of the neuronal signal. The detector was implemented on a
   popular low-power MCU and fully characterized experimentally using
   previously recorded neural signals with different signal-to-noise
   ratios. A comparison of the obtained results with other thresholding
   approaches shows that the proposed method can compete with high
   performance and highly resources demanding spike detection approaches
   while achieving up to 100\% of true positive detection rate at high SNR,
   and up to 63\% for an SNR as low as 0 dB, while necessitating an
   execution time as low as 11 mu s with the MCU operating at 8 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Assistive Technologies (ATs) also called extrinsic enablers are useful
   tools for people living with various disabilities. The key points when
   designing such useful devices not only concern their intended goal, but
   also the most suitable human-machine interface (HMI) that should be
   provided to users. This paper describes the design of a highly intuitive
   wireless controller for people living with upper body disabilities with
   a residual or complete control of their neck and their shoulders. Tested
   with JACO, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) assistive robotic arm with 3
   flexible fingers on its end-effector, the system described in this
   article is made of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components and
   allows a full emulation of JACO's standard controller, a 3 axis joystick
   with 7 user buttons. To do so, three nine-degree-of-freedom (9-DOF)
   inertial measurement units (IMUs) are connected to a microcontroller and
   help measuring the user's head and shoulders position, using a
   complementary filter approach. The results are then transmitted to a
   base-station via a 2.4-GHz low-power wireless transceiver and
   interpreted by the control algorithm running on a PC host. A dedicated
   software interface allows the user to quickly calibrate the controller,
   and translates the information into suitable commands for JACO. The
   proposed controller is thoroughly described, from the electronic design
   to implemented algorithms and user interfaces. Its performance and
   future improvements are discussed as well.}},

Abstract = {{This project aims to see if accelerators based on FPGAs are worthwhile
   for DNA assembly. It involves reprogramming an already existing
   algorithm - called Ray - to be run either on such an accelerator or on a
   CPU to be able to compare both. It has been achieved using the OpenCL
   language. The focus is put on modifying and optimizing the original
   algorithm to better suit the new parallelization tool. Upon running the
   new program on some datasets, it becomes clear that FPGAs are a very
   capable platform that can fare better than the traditional approach,
   both on raw performance and energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a digital spike detector using an adaptive
   threshold which is suitable for real time processing of 32
   electrophysiological channels in parallel. Such a new scheme is based on
   a Sigma-delta control loop that precisely estimates the standard
   deviation of the amplitude of the noise of the input signal to optimize
   the detection rate. Additionally, it is not dependent on the amplitude
   of the input signal thanks to a robust algorithm. The spike detector is
   implemented inside a Spartan-6 FPGA using low resources, only FPGA basic
   logic blocks, and is using a low clock frequency under 6 MHz for minimal
   power consumption. We present a comparison showing that the proposed
   system can compete with a dedicated off-line spike detection software.
   The whole system achieves up to 100\% of true positive detection rate
   for SNRs down to 5 dB while achieving 623\% of true positive detection
   rate for an SNR as low as -2 dB at a 150 AP/s firing rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the use of a kernel density estimation to measure
   similarities between trajectories. The similarities are then used to
   predict the future locations of a target. For a given environment with a
   history of previous target trajectories, the goal is to establish a
   probabilistic framework to predict the future trajectory of currently
   observed targets based on their recent moves. Instead of clustering
   trajectories into groups, we calculate the similarity between a given
   test trajectory and the set of all past trajectories in a dataset. Next,
   we use a weighted mechanism for prediction, that can be used in target
   tracking and collision avoidance applications. The proposed method is
   compared with two other commonly used similarity models (PCA and LCSS)
   over a dataset of simulated trajectories, and two datasets of real
   observations. Results show that the proposed method significantly
   outperforms the existing models for those datasets and experimental
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major goals for mobile robots is to be able to traverse any
   kind of terrains. A possible way to achieve this goal is by the use of
   legged robots, as they have increased mobility. However, this would
   require them to be able to modify their gaits, based on the
   identification of the terrain that they are currently traversing. In
   this paper, we introduce a number of novel methods to address this issue
   of autonomous terrain classification and clustering, based on tactile
   data collected with a walking robot. The proposed learning methods are
   based on the Pitman-Yor process mixture of Gaussians, a Bayesian
   nonparametric prior, well-suited for density estimation. This model is
   initially used to learn the non-Gaussian distribution of the features
   produced from proprioceptive (force/torque) signals from the legs,
   registered during the interaction of one robot foot with a terrain.
   Then, we exploit its capacity on clustering and discovering structures
   in the data to identify terrains in the feature space. Experiments were
   conducted on a six-legged robot, thus demonstrating the applicability of
   the PitmanYor process mixture of Gaussians for terrain identification.
   In particular, we obtained a classification success rate of 82\% and
   51\% accuracy, with our supervised learning and unsupervised learning
   approach respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Spike detection is a signal processing technique that can enable
   significant data rate reduction and resource savings in wireless brain
   monitoring. In these systems, energy-efficient spike detection
   algorithms are sought for enabling real-time signal processing while
   consuming low-power. As several spike detectors are based on ASIC, FPGA
   or low-power microcontroller unit (MCU), such algorithms must add little
   overhead to the entire system, while ensuring low error rate. In this
   paper, we present a comparative study of three different spike detection
   algorithms targeted toward implementation into low-power
   resource-constrained electronic systems. As practical validation, all
   candidate algorithms have been implemented on a popular low-power MCU
   and were fully characterized experimentally using previously recorded
   neural signals with different signal-to-noise ratios. A cost function
   based on detection rates, execution times, power consumption and
   resource utilization have been created and employed for comparing the
   detectors. The performances of all candidates are reported, and the best
   detector is identified. All candidate detectors present detection rate
   above 95\% at high SNR, and above 78\% for low SNR and can reduce the
   power consumption by up to 22.7\%. This paper is the first to
   demonstrate the performances and hardware limitations of spike detectors
   on a low-power MCU system.}},

   headstage is suitable to conduct long terms in-vivo experiments with
   small freely moving transgenic rodents, and features two implantable
   LED-coupled optical fibers and two electrophysiological recording
   channels while being powered by a small Lithium-ion battery. The
   headstage can transmit the raw neuronal signals or only spike waveforms
   after applying on-the-fly spike detection, which reduces power
   consumption by up to 14.5\%. The headstage is entirely built using
   commercial off-the-shelf components, and the miniature design, using
   rigid-flex PCBs, results into a lightweight (7.4g) and compact device
   (25x20x15 mm). Low-power consumption is achieved by using on-the-fly
   spike detection alongside a real-time operating system which brings the
   headstage autonomy to 3h25 in full operation, including high-output
   power optical stimulation, micro-volts neuronal signal amplification and

Abstract = {{Extracting sparse representations with Dictionary Learning (DL) methods
   has led to interesting image and speech recognition results. DL has
   recently been extended to supervised learning (SDL) by using the
   dictionary for feature extraction and classification. One challenge with
   SDL is imposing diversity for extracting more discriminative features.
   To this end, we propose Incrementally Built Dictionary Learning (IBDL),
   a supervised multi-dictionary learning approach. Unlike existing
   methods, IBDL maximizes diversity by optimizing the between-class
   residual error distance. It can be easily parallelized since it learns
   the class-specific parameters independently. Moreover, we propose an
   incremental learning rule that improves the convergence guarantees of
   stochastic gradient descent under sparsity constraints. We evaluated our
   approach on benchmark digit and face recognition tasks, and obtained
   comparable performances to existing sparse representation and DL
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a locomotion interface for gait
   simulation and interaction with a virtual environment. The proposed
   mechanical interface is based on two planar two-degree-of-freedom
   belt-driven mechanisms which fully decouple the vertical and horizontal
   motion of two supporting footplates. Force sensors are mounted under the
   footplates in order to move the end effectors according to the user's
   intentions. The user's feet are rigidly attached to the footplates but a
   system of hinges allows an additional unactuated two-degree-of-freedom
   motion. A lag controller allows the user to move the end-effectors
   freely and a virtual floor based on a virtual spring and damper
   restrains the end-effectors' movements so that the user experiences an
   intuitive contact with the ground. Finally, preliminary experiments are
   reported in order to demonstrate the capability of the locomotion
   interface for gait simulation.}},

Abstract = {{We present an end-to-end framework for realizing fully automated gait
   learning for a complex underwater legged robot. Using this framework, we
   demonstrate that a hexapod flipper-propelled robot can learn
   task-specific control policies purely from experience data. Our method
   couples a state-of-the-art policy search technique with a family of
   periodic low-level controls that are well suited for underwater
   propulsion. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of tabula rasa
   learning, that is, learning without the use of any prior knowledge, of
   policies for a six-legged swimmer to carry out a variety of acrobatic
   maneuvers in three dimensional space. We also demonstrate informed
   learning that relies on simulated experience from a realistic simulator.
   In numerous cases, novel emergent gait behaviors have arisen from
   learning, such as the use of one stationary flipper to create drag while
   another oscillates to create thrust. Similar effective results have been
   demonstrated in under-actuated configurations, where as few as two
   flippers are used to maneuver the robot to a desired pose, or through an
   acrobatic motion such as a corkscrew. The success of our learning
   framework is assessed both in simulation and in the field using an
   underwater swimming robot.}},

   uses a novel approach for computing the quality of acquisition of a
   mobile sensor group in such environments. The quality of acquisition is
   based on a geometric model of a camera which allows accurate sensor
   models and simple occlusion computation. The proposed system combines
   this new metric with a global derivative-free optimization algorithm to
   find simultaneously the number of sensors and their configuration to
   sense accordingly the environment. The presented framework compares
   favourably with current techniques working in two-dimensional
   environments. Furthermore, simulation and experimental results
   demonstrate the ability of the system to cope with full
   three-dimensional environments, a domain still unexplored by previous

Abstract = {{SITELLE (installed in 2015 at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) and
   SpIOMM (a prototype attached to the Observatoire du Mont-Megantic) are
   the first Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometers (IFTS) capable of
   obtaining a hyperspectral data cube which samples a 12 arc minutes field
   of view into four millions of visible spectra. The result of each
   observation is made up of two interferometric data cubes which need to
   be merged, corrected, transformed and calibrated in order to get a
   spectral cube of the observed region ready to be analysed. ORBS is a
   fully automatic data reduction software that has been entirely designed
   for this purpose. The data size (up to 68 Gb for larger science cases)
   and the computational needs have been challenging and the highly
   parallelized object-oriented architecture of ORBS reflects the solutions
   adopted which made possible to process 68 Gb of raw data in less than 11
   hours using 8 cores and 22.6 Gb of RAM. It is based on a core framework
   (ORB) that has been designed to support the whole software suite for
   data analysis (ORCS and OACS), data simulation (ORUS) and data
   acquisition (IRIS). They all aim to provide a strong basis for the
   creation and development of specialized analysis modules that could
   benefit the scientific community working with SITELLE and SpIOMM.}},

Abstract = {{The first example of a documented electroforming process dates back to
   1837 when a layer of electrodeposited copper was found on the surface of
   a printing plate. Since then, it became a basic manufacturing process to
   produce delicate metallic components such as nickel thin foils for solar
   panels, perforated screen-printing cylinders used for fabric and carpet
   printings, digital recording devices, etc. Recently, electroforming is
   used for the fabrication of iron-based materials designed for
   cardiovascular stents. Electroformed iron shows a higher corrosion rate
   in simulated biological environment; this behaviour is supposed to be
   influenced by its microstructure which is finer than that of iron
   produced with traditional techniques. A high corrosion rate can be
   beneficial for cardiovascular stent applications: a complete stent
   dissolution in 12-18 months can effectively prevent both late thrombosis
   and further treatment of paediatric patients, usually requiring a
   continuous vessel remodelling. Faster corrosion rate of iron-based
   material is advantageous for cardiovascular stent application in order
   to avoid late stent thrombosis and arterial growth mismatch in young
   patients leading to a secondary revascularization procedure.
   Electroformed iron has mechanical properties comparable to those of
   stainless steel (stent reference metal) with the advantage of the total
   dissolution of the material after the accomplishment of its function:
   for this reason, this metal can be considered as a valid alternative to
   magnesium-based materials. Nevertheless, electroforming is influenced by
   parameters such as electrolyte bath composition, current density, pH,
   temperature, additives, cathode, etc. that have a significant effect on
   the structure of the produced materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we use the witness-functions to analyze cryptographic
   protocols for secrecy under nonempty equational theories. The
   witness-functions are safe metrics used to compute security. An analysis
   with a witness-function consists in making sure that the security of
   every atomic message does not decrease during its lifecycle in the
   protocol. The analysis gets more difficult under nonempty equational
   theories. Indeed, the intruder can take advantage of the algebraic
   properties of the cryptographic primitives to derive secrets. These
   properties arise from the use of mathematical functions, such as
   multiplication, addition, exclusive-or or modular exponentiation in the
   cryptosystems and the protocols. Here, we show how to use the
   witness-functions under nonempty equational theories and we run an
   analysis on the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol under the cipher
   homomorphism. This analysis reveals that although this protocol is
   proved secure under the perfect encryption assumption, its security
   collapses under the homomorphic primitives. We show how the
   witness-functions help to illustrate an attack scenario on it and we
   propose an amended version to fix it.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel fully integrated full-duplex data
   transceiver to support bidirectional high-data rate neural interfaces
   (electrical stimulation and neural recording). The transmitter (TX) and
   the receiver (RX) are designed to share a single implantable antenna.
   The TX generates IR-UWB based on edge combining, and the RX uses a novel
   ISM-2.4-GHz narrow-band OOK receiver. Separation between the TX and RX
   path is implemented by: 1) properly shaping the transmitted pulse, so
   its spectrum falls between 3.1 and 7 GHz UWB subband, and 2) carefully
   filtering the spectrum of the received waveform directly in the receiver
   low-noise amplifier (LNA), to avoid using a circulator or a diplexer
   (found in most full duplex systems). The receiver is designed to support
   downlink telemetry of neural stimulation applications with a data rate
   as high as 100 Mbps within a power budget of 5 mW. The transmitter is
   designed to support uplink back telemetry of neural recording
   applications with a data rate of up to 500 Mbps for power consumption of
   5.4 mW and 10.8 mW for OOK and BPSK modulations, respectively (10.8
   pJ/b). Measurement results obtained with biological tissues confirm full
   functionality of the fabricated full duplex transceiver. The total size
   of the chip is 0.8 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative networks are complex systems and consist of many factors
   with dependencies among them. Although the number of collaborative
   networks such as advanced supply chains or virtual
   organizations/laboratories/e-science is growing and their significance
   is increasing in the world, many of them are unsuccessful. In addition,
   very little attention has been paid to the risk analysis of
   collaborative networks by considering the dependencies among risk
   factors. So, the precise risks analysis associated with collaborative
   networks projects is crucial to attain a satisfactory performance. To
   address this, we are proposing an advanced decision support tool called
   ``Fuzzy Cognitive Maps{''} (FCM) which can deal with risks of such
   complicated systems by considering the interrelationships between
   factors. FCM states the behaviour of complex systems accurately and
   illustrate any complex environment based on the experts' perceptions and
   by graphical representations. It is able to consider uncertainties,
   imprecise information, the interactions between risk factors,
   Information scarcity, and several decision maker's opinions. FCM is not
   only able to evaluate risks more precisely in collaborative networks,
   but also it could be applied in different decision makings problems
   related to collaborative networks such as partner selection and
   forecasting behaviors, policy analysis, modeling collaboration
   preparedness assessment, etc. Hence, the proposed tool would help
   practitioners to manage collaborative network risks and decision making
   problems effectively and proactively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the optimal controller

   The main issue with multi-dof manipulators is that their dynamics are

   into account during the optimization process, thereby resulting in a
   stable controller with exceptionally high performance. Moreover, the
   coupled stability of the manipulator is assessed with an extended
   version of the concept of complementary stability which allows to
   overcome the passivity conditions. Although the optimization proposed
   here is based on three performance indices specific to bilateral
   amplification, it can be easily adapted to any type of bilateral
   interaction. The resulting performance and stability of the optimal
   controller are demonstrated on a seven-dof serial manipulator with
   impact tests on different contact surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this project are to quantify the dose reduction effect
   provided by a lead shield for patients with cardiac implantable
   electronic devices (CIED) during a clinically realistic radiation
   treatment on phantom and to provide a simple model of dose estimation to
   predict dose received by CIED in a wide range of situations. The shield
   used in this project is composed of a lead sheet wrapped in
   thermoplastic. Dose measurements were made with a plastic scintillation
   detector (PSD). The phantom was treated with ten different plans. Three
   of these cases were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy
   (IMRT) and the others received standard 3D conformal radiation therapy
   (3D CRT). Lateral dose measurement for photon fields was made to
   establish a dose prediction model. On average, the use of the lead
   shield reduced the dose to CIEDs by 19\% +/- 13\%. Dose reduction was
   most important for breast cases, with a mean reduction of 31\% +/- 15\%.
   In three cases, the total dose reduction was more than 25 cGy over the
   complete treatment. For the three IMRT cases, the mean dose reduction
   was 11\% +/- 9\%. On average, the difference between the TPS prediction
   and the measurement was 71\%, while it was only 14\% for the dose
   prediction model. It was demonstrated that a lead shield can be
   efficiently used for reducing doses to CIED with a wide range of
   clinical plans. In patients treated with IMRT modality treatment, the
   shielding should be used only for those with more than two anterior
   fields over seven fields. In the case of 3D CRT patients, the shielding
   should be used for those with a dose on the CIED higher than 50 cGy and
   with a reduction of dose higher than 10 cGy. The dose prediction model
   developed in this study can be an easy way to have a better estimation
   of the out-of-field dose than the TPS.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting a potential evapotranspiration formulation (PETF) for
   hydrological modeling is not a trivial task, so hydrologists often opt
   for a familiar formulation or one that is already available within the
   model they use. This article investigates the Soil and Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT) sensitivity to PETF, in terms of performance and behavior,
   in a contrasted climate context, for a Canadian catchment subject to
   spring freshet. For this matter, twenty PETFs are tested in addition to
   the three available in SWAT. The analysis consists of a Sobol' parameter
   sensitivity analysis and a shuffled complex evolution (SCE) calibration
   over four climatically contrasted periods. Results show that PETF
   affects SWAT's performance, particularly in a dry climate, but also

Abstract = {{Chipper-canters are used in primary wood industries for processing
   small-diameter logs. Knife geometry is one of the principal parameters
   significantly affecting the chip size and cant surface properties. This
   work studied the patterns of tool wear as edge recession (ER) in
   chipping and canting knives of a chipper-canter head. In addition,
   analytical investigation of wear mechanisms was carried out to better
   understand the ER phenomenon. The test head contained eight sets of
   separate chipping and canting knives. ER was measured after 0, 8, 16,
   32, 48, and 80 hours of machining. Microscopic measurements at intervals
   of 1 mm along the cutting edge were carried out to characterize ER from
   knife replicas. The ERs after 80 hours of machining were 544 and 549 jam
   for chipping and canting knives, respectively. There was no significant
   variation in ER between the types of knives at 0 and 80 hours of
   machining. However, significantly different ERs were found between the
   chipping and canting knives at the intermediate stages of machining.
   Scanning electron microscopic observation showed that apart from
   abrasion and chipping phenomenon, there were also deformation of
   chipping knives and cracking of canting knives.}},

Title = {{End of life aircrafts recovery and green supply chain (a conceptual
   framework for addressing opportunities and challenges)}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1098-1124}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to address the different aspects of
   end-of-life (EOL) aircraft problems and their effects on original
   manufacturer's supply chain. Aircraft manufacturers, in the greener
   aviation context, need to care about the footprint of planes at the EOL.
   Considering the challenges in EOL aircraft recovery, the reverse
   logistics and green supply chain solutions in the other industrial
   sections cannot be applied in the aerospace industry. A conceptual
   framework with four elements, supply chain competency, governance
   policy, relationship in supply chain and aerospace industry context,
   provides a basis for assessing the opportunities and challenges of the
   green supply chain in this industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The basic research method utilized in this
   paper is the literature review. The literature review is a research
   methodology that includes examining books, journals, conference
   proceedings and dissertations for available information on the area of
   research. The research area regarding EOL aircraft is new. A substantial
   amount of literature exists in the field of end-of-life vehicle, but the
   main content of literature about the aircraft recycling can be obtained
   via relatively few literature, technical reports, news and industrial
   experts' opinions. The literature is complete in some respects while
   inadequate in others. A considerable amount of information has been
   gathered through graduate student projects. The other information has
   been collected via contacts with professionals involved in an EOL
   aircraft recycling project. The basis for this methodological framework
   comes from a research process proposed by Mayring (2010) that emphasizes
   on four steps: material collection, descriptive analysis, category
   section and material evaluation.
   Findings - This paper addresses the opportunities and challenges of
   applying a green supply chain for aircraft manufacturers and analyzes
   the different aspects of aircraft at the EOL in the context of green
   supply chain.
   Research limitations/implications - This study enriches the literature
   by identifying EOL aircraft value chain analysis in the sustainable
   development context. It provides an introduction to a fresh research
   theme and sheds some light on green supply challenges in the aerospace
   industry.
   Practical implications - The proposed conceptual framework in this paper
   helps practitioners to realize the opportunities and challenges of
   aircraft manufacturers in applying long-term strategies with respect to
   EOL aircrafts. The proposed framework helps manufacturers to evaluate
   different perspectives of the EOL aircraft problem. Moreover, the
   current contribution of aircraft manufacturers into EOL projects is not
   in a systematic structure and performed through several managerial and
   professional meetings. The proposed framework in this study is a
   valuable tool to evaluate the different opportunities and challenges in
   an organized way.
   Originality/value - This work provides a valuable framework for future
   research related to green supply chains in the aerospace context. It
   also aids practitioners to realize the EOL aircraft problem in the
   context of the green supply chain, considering the opportunities and
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The development of magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications
   requires a detailed characterization of their magnetic properties, with
   relation not only to their chemical structure, but also their morphology
   and size. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM), thanks to its nanometric
   lateral resolution and its capability to detect weak magnetic fields,
   appears as a powerful tool for the characterization of the magnetic
   properties of single nanoparticles, together with their morphological
   characteristics. Nevertheless, the application of MFM to the
   quantitative measurements of magnetic properties at the nanoscale is
   still an open issue because of a certain incongruence between
   experimental data and existing theoretical models of the tip-sample
   magnetic interactions. In this work, MFM data acquired on different
   magnetic nanoparticles in different experimental conditions (magnetized
   and not magnetized probes, out-of-field and in-field measurements) are
   analyzed, with the aim of individuating the possible phenomena affecting
   MFM measurements. These include topography-induced artifacts resulting
   from the tip-sample capacitive coupling, which we propose here for the
   first time. In case of measurements performed in presence of an external
   magnetic field, much more intense MFM signals were detected as it
   produces the saturation of the magnetization of the nanoparticles, which
   is not completely obtained by the sole stray field produced by the tip.
   Nevertheless, even in in-field measurements, the results evidenced the
   presence of significant electrostatic effects in MFM images, which,
   therefore, appear as an important factor to be taken into account for
   the quantitative interpretation of MFM data.}},

Abstract = {{The study aims at investigating empirically the ability of a Quality
   Assurance Indicator (Qi), a metric that we proposed in a previous work,
   to predict different levels of unit testing effort of classes in
   object-oriented systems. To capture the unit testing effort of classes,
   we used four metrics to quantify various perspectives related to the
   code of corresponding unit test cases. Classes were classified,
   according to the involved unit testing effort, in five categories
   (levels). We collected data from two open source Java software systems
   (ANT and JFREECHART) for which JUnit test cases exist. In order to
   explore the ability of the Qi metric to predict different levels of the
   unit testing effort of classes, we decided to explore the possibility of
   using the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) method. The performance
   of the Qi metric has been compared to the performance of three
   well-known source code metrics related respectively to size, complexity
   and coupling. Results suggest that the MLR model based on the Qi metric
   is able to accurately predict different levels of the unit testing
   effort of classes. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

Abstract = {{Finding ways to improve the efficiency in water usage is one of the most
   important challenges in integrated water resources management. One of
   the most promising solutions is the use of scarcity-based pricing
   policies. This contribution presents a procedure to design efficient
   pricing policies based on the opportunity cost of water at the basin
   scale. Time series of the marginal value of water are obtained using a
   stochastic hydro-economic model. Those series are then post-processed to
   define step pricing policies, which depend on the state of the system at
   each time step. The case study of the Mijares River basin system (Spain)
   is used to illustrate the method. The results show that the application
   of scarcity-based pricing policies increases the economic efficiency of
   water use in the basin, allocating water to the highest-value uses and
   generating an incentive for water conservation during the scarcity
   periods. The resulting benefits are close to those obtained with the
   economically optimal decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Integer programming (IP) is one of the most successful approaches for
   combinatorial optimization problems. Many IP solvers make use of the
   linear relaxation, which removes the integrality requirement on the
   variables. The relaxed problem can then be solved using linear
   programming (LP), a very efficient optimization paradigm. Constraint
   programming (CP) can solve a much wider variety of problems, since it
   does not require the problem to be expressed in terms of linear
   equations. The cost of this versatility is that in CP there is no easy
   way to automatically derive a good bound on the objective. This paper
   presents an approach based on ideas from Lagrangian decomposition (LD)
   that establishes a general bounding scheme for any CP. We provide an
   implementation for optimization problems that can be formulated with
   knapsack and regular constraints, and we give comparisons with pure CP
   approaches. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our approach
   on these problems.}},

Abstract = {{In search theory, the goal of the Optimal Search Path (OSP) problem is
   to find a finite length path maximizing the probability that a searcher
   detects a lost wanderer on a graph. We propose to bound the probability
   of finding the wanderer in the remaining search time by relaxing the
   problem into a stochastic game of cop and robber from graph theory. We
   discuss the validity of this bound and demonstrate its effectiveness on
   a constraint programming model of the problem. Experimental results show
   how our novel bound compares favorably to the DMEAN bound from the
   literature, a state-of-the-art bound based on a relaxation of the OSP
   into a longest path problem.}},

Abstract = {{Hexagonally well-organized ZnCl2-OMA materials have been successfully
   synthesized by a one-pot approach using a sol-gel method at ambient
   temperature and pressure. These materials were prepared through
   simultaneous self-assembly process with F127 as directing agent combined
   with in situ impregnation of ZnCl2. The new approach was found to be
   compatible with various common aluminium precursors and carboxylic acids
   used as self-assembly interfacial protectors. The obtained ZnCl2-OMA
   materials were fully characterized using XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption,
   TEM, SEM, EDX, XPS and H-1 and Al-27 MAS-NMR techniques. These materials
   were compared with the zinc chloride-doped organized mesoporous alumina
   (ZnCl2-OMA) supports prepared through a conventional two steps process
   that includes OMA synthesis and then post-synthesis incorporation of
   ZnCl2. Thus, the one-pot synthesized materials were found to exhibit
   improved properties compared to the conventional ones, particularly
   larger BET surface area. The synthesized ZnCl2-OMA materials were then
   used as catalytic supports for methyltrioxorhenium (MTO), showing
   enhanced catalytic performance for methyl oleate self-metathesis,
   demonstrating better activity and selectivity towards desired metathesis
   products. These features are highly beneficial for large-scale materials
   synthesis through fast, simple, easy and low-cost introduction of
   functionalities on mesoporous materials surface without multi-step
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of azobenzene-containing polymer films are
   statistically measured by instrumented nanoindentation experiments in
   the dark and under illumination in the absorption band of the azobenzene
   molecules. The material is obtained from a commercial PMMA compound
   grafted with Disperse Red 1 (DR1) azobenzene derivative. In the dark,
   DR1 molecules remain in the stable trans isomer state while, under
   illumination, they undergo photoisomerisation cycling and form a
   photostationary equilibrium between cis and trans isomers. This material
   is known to exhibit light-induced deformation phenomena related to the
   photoisomerization cycling of the DR1 units. Statistical
   loading/unloading tests performed in the tens of mu N load range reveal
   a significant change in the mechanical properties of the film under
   light excitation. The material hardness and irreversible viscosity are
   seen to decrease, while the creep coefficient value increases,
   indicating a significant reinforcement of the viscoplastic response of
   the film under illumination. Moreover, creep experiments performed at a
   constant load show striking dissipative effects when light is turned on
   and also, surprisingly, when light is turned off. These features are
   supposedly related to the transient changes in the balance between the
   cis and trans isomer populations.}},

Journal = {{CELLULAR POLYMERS}},

Pages = {{299-337}},
Abstract = {{Thermoplastic foams have several advantages in comparison with unfoamed
   polymers such as lightweight, high strength to weight ratio, excellent
   insulation property high thermal stability, high impact strength and
   toughness, as well as high fatigue life. These outstanding properties
   lead cellular plastics to various industrial applications in packaging,
   automotive parts, absorbents, and sporting equipment. Nowadays,
   polypropylene (PP), because of its outstanding characteristics such as
   low material cost, high service temperature, high melting point, high
   tensile modulus, low density and excellent chemical resistance, is a
   major resin in the foaming industry. However, foaming of conventional PP
   is limited by its low melt strength leading to poor cell morphology cell
   rupture/coalescence and limited density reduction. To improve PP melt
   strength, several strategies including particle addition as nucleating
   agent, introduction of long chain branching, blending with high melt
   strength polymers and crosslinking have been proposed. In this review,
   these issues are discussed and analyzed in terms of mechanical, thermal,
   and rheological characterizations.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the combination of two different optimization
   paths (phase compatibilization and manufacturing process optimization)
   on the microstructure (fiber dimensions, matrix crystallinity and matrix
   molecular properties) and mechanical properties (flexural and tensile
   moduli, impact strength, and tensile stress at yield) of flax
   fiber/postconsumer recycled plastic composites. A two-step optimization
   methodology was adopted. First, the material composition was optimized
   by phase compatibilization using maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene
   (MAPP) and maleic anhydride grafted ethylene octene metallocene
   copolymer (EO-g-MAH) as additives. Then, the manufacturing process
   (extrusion followed by injection) was optimized in terms of temperature
   profile and screw speed for extrusion, as well as barrel temperature
   profile, mold temperature, injection speed, injection pressure,
   injection time and back pressure for injection. The results showed that,
   besides good fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, the combination of both
   optimization paths promoted an optimum balance between components
   degradation and composite homogeneity (good fiber and additives
   dispersion in the matrix), leading to better mechanical properties. It
   is shown that this optimization procedure was able to improve all the
   mechanical properties of the composites, as well as being effective in
   terms of performance and costs.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic speech recognition systems rely on feature extraction
   techniques to improve their performance. Static features obtained from
   each frame are usually enhanced with dynamical components using
   derivative operations (delta features). However, the susceptibility to
   noise of the derivative impacts on the accuracy of the recognition in
   noisy environments. We propose an alternative to the delta features by
   selecting coefficients from adjacent frames based on frequency. We
   noticed that consecutive samples were highly correlated at low frequency
   and more representative dynamics could be incorporated by looking
   farther away in time. The strategy we developed to perform this
   frequency-based selection was evaluated on the Aurora 2
   continuous-digits and connected-digits tasks using MFCC, PLPCC and LPCC
   standard features. The results of our experimentations show that our
   strategy achieved an average relative improvement of 32.10\% in
   accuracy, with most gains in very noisy environments where the
   traditional delta features have low recognition rates.}},

Abstract = {{The over-exploitation of fossil fuels means that research into
   alternative sustainable energy sources is crucial for the scientific
   community. The harvesting of solar energy via photocatalysis is a key
   approach to developing these alternatives. Furthermore, photocatalytic
   materials show great promise for degradation of pollutants. However,
   limitations in incident light utilization and charge separation are
   major drawbacks that restrict the activity of current artificial
   photosystems. Construction of hollow nano-sized photocatalysts is
   emerging as a promising approach to fabricating novel and effective
   materials, as hollow photocatalysts possess unique properties that may
   be exploited to overcome these challenges. This review gives a concise
   overview of the advantages of hollow structures for this purpose, the
   methodology used to prepare hollow photocatalysts, and the current
   state-of-the-art in the development of hollow structure photocatalysts
   for energy production and environmental applications.}},

Title = {{Comparative evaluation and optimization of off-the-shelf cationic
   polymers for gene delivery purposes}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{6325-6339}},
Abstract = {{Cationic polymers are amongst the most utilized non-viral vectors for
   gene transfer owing to their ability to condense and protect the genetic
   material within polyplexes and to ferry it into cells. Quite a number of
   parameters, both related to the features of the vectors themselves (e.g.
   degree of branching, molecular weight, polydispersity) and to polyplexes
   (e.g. nitrogen to phosphate ratio (N/P), dose of complexes delivered,
   complexation buffer, etc.), are known to affect transfection behaviour.
   Consequently, some substantial discrepancy found in raw materials and
   in-home protocols across laboratories account for some disagreement and
   conflicting data about their performance. Hereinafter we provide a
   thorough chemical-physical and in vitro biochemical characterization,
   comparison, and optimization of the most widely used, commercially
   sourced polymers used in transfection, namely linear polyethylenimines
   (lPEIs), branched PEIs (bPEIs), linear poly-L-lysines (lPLLs), and
   polyamidoamine dendrimers (dPAMAMs). By means of a stepwise approach, we
   pinpointed the most effective molecular weight and complexation
   conditions specific to each of them and correlated the physicochemical
   features of polyplexes with their transfection effectiveness. Besides,
   taking separately into account the effects on transfection of the
   plasmid dose delivered to cells, the cell seeding density and the volume
   of the culture medium, we highlited a range of optimal conditions
   roughly specific to each studied polymer. Finally, we coped with the
   effect of the variation of these three parameters at once on the
   transfection effectiveness of lPEI and bPEI and pinpointed an array of
   settings specifically optimized to attain truly superior performances.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the impact of the stretching temperature on the morphology
   of cellular polypropylene (PP) films, a series of PP films filled with
   spherical particles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and platy talc
   particles with weight concentrations varying from 15 to 35 wt\% were
   prepared by twin-screw extrusion then biaxially stretched at three
   temperatures (152, 155 and 158 degrees C). Their corresponding cellular
   morphology was analyzed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   micrographs. It was shown that film stretching at the lower temperature
   (152 degrees C) led to delamination of PP/CaCO3 or PP/talc interface,
   while it was not the case when these films were stretched at 158 degrees
   C. It was also observed that, when films were stretched at 152 degrees
   C, their corresponding developed cells had an average cell wall
   thickness t of around 3.6 mu m, an average cell height b of around 13.6
   mu m, and an average cell aspect ratio a/b of around 5.6, where a (mu m)
   is the average cell width. These values were within the aimed cell
   geometrical specifications needed for cellular piezoelectric films.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, pulsed phase thermography (PPT), principal component
   thermography (PCT), and partial least squares thermography (PLST)
   techniques were applied in order to detect the masonry texture, as well
   as to map the subsurface damages formed beneath three different mural
   paintings. The latter were inspected after the 2009 earthquake, i.e.,
   the seismic event that devastated L'Aquila City (Italy) and its
   surroundings. The mural supports explored by infrared thermography (IRT)
   are constituted by a single leaf, and the sides of the inspected
   paintings are confined by marble frames or by buried horizontal and
   vertical structures. Hence, the analyzed objects can be considered as
   monolithic structures. IRT can help to understand the masonry
   morphology, e.g. if there exist structural continuity between the
   arriccio layer (the first coat of plaster) and the support. In the
   present case, the heating phase was provided by lamps or propane gas and
   feature detection was enhanced by advanced signal processing. A
   comparison among the results is presented. Two of the three objects
   analyzed, painted by the art masters Serbucci and Avicola, are preserved
   inside Santa Maria della Croce di Roio Church in Roio Poggio (L'Aquila,
   Italy); they were executed on two masonries built in different periods.
   The last one was realized in Montorio al Vomano (Teramo, Italy) on the
   internal cloister of the Zoccolanti's Church (undated). The villages are
   separated by 50 km as the crow flies. Finally, near-infrared
   reflectography (NIRR) technique was also used to investigate the
   condition of the painting layer.}},

   attention for its low molecular weight, homogeneity and sulfur-free
   characteristics. The compounds were produced by batch mixing, and were
   compression molded. From these samples, morphological, tensile and
   thermal properties were studied. The results show that incorporation of
   different lignins into HDPE yielded materials of different tensile

Title = {{Polymer functionalization to enhance interface quality of mixed matrix
   membranes for high CO2/CH4 gas separation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{15202-15213}},
Abstract = {{Hydroxyl-functionalized homo-and co-polyimides 6FDA-(DAM)(x)-(HAB)(y)
   (with x : y molar ratio of 1 : 0; 2 : 1; 1 : 1; 1 : 2) and two
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-53(Al) were
   synthesized for preparation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). The MOF
   loadings were varied over the range of 10-20 wt\% for NH2-MIL-53(Al) and
   10-15 wt\% for MIL-53(Al). The incorporation of hydroxyl groups into the
   polyimide backbone is expected to improve the interfacial interaction
   between the polymer matrix and fillers, consequently, enhancing gas
   separation performance of MMMs. A big increase in glass transition
   temperature (T-g) for MMMs confirmed the polymer chain rigidification,
   which was caused by a strong interaction between the hydroxyl groups in
   the copolyimides and the amine groups in NH2-MIL-53(Al). Additionally,
   SEM results showed that the hydroxyl groups facilitated the particle
   dispersion in the MMMs, either was NH2-MIL-53(Al) or MIL-53 used as
   filler. Gas separation performances of MMMs were characterized by both
   CO2/CH4 pure gas and binary permeation measurements at 35 degrees C and
   150 psi. The incorporation of NH2-MIL-53(Al) in the
   hydroxyl-copolyimides was found to significantly improve the CO2/CH4
   separation factor while maintaining CO2 permeability of the MMMs as high
   as those of the neat corresponding copolyimides, therefore greatly
   enhancing the MMM separation performance. For example, the MMM prepared
   from 6FDA-DAM-HAB (1 : 1) copolyimide and 10 wt\% NH2-MIL-53(Al) showed
   a permeability/selectivity behavior approaching the 2008 Robeson's upper
   bound making it attractive for practical usage. The significant
   improvement in CO2/CH4 separation factor observed for the MMMs made of
   the hydroxyl-copolyimides and the amine-functionalized MOFs was due to
   (i) the enhanced polymer-filler compatibility originating from a mutual
   interaction between the polymer-functional moieties and the
   amine-functionalized MOF surface yielding defect-free MMMs and (ii) the
   high CO2/CH4 selective adsorption in the NH2-MIL-53(Al) framework.}},

Abstract = {{The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is a major insect pest of potato crops
   in many countries around the world. Chemical insecticides constitute the
   most widely used control method for this insect pest. To date, no
   registered chemical pest control product has proven effective at
   managing CPB on a long-term basis. Although biological control through
   manual release of natural enemies of CPB has been successful on a small
   scale, large-scale manual release of these predators is not realistic.
   The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of
   mechanical release of predator insects as a control method for CPB under
   real conditions in a potato field. The results show that the use of
   Podisus maculiventris second and third instar nymphs provided effective
   control of CPB populations throughout the growing season in Quebec,
   Canada. Moreover, mechanical release of these predator insects proved as
   efficient as manual release on potato plants. This points to the
   potential for using mechanical release of predator insects for
   biological control on a commercial scale. The tested approach based on
   mechanical release of beneficial insects holds promise for biological
   control of insect pests in many other row crops, such as eggplant,
   crucifers, cucurbits, onions, sweet corn, tomatoes, and strawberries.}},

Title = {{Unsteady RANS and scale adaptive simulations of a turbulent spray flame
   in a swirled-stabilized gas turbine model combustor using tabulated
   chemistry}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1064-1088}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to numerically investigate the
   three-dimensional (3D) reacting turbulent two-phase flow field of a
   scaled swirl-stabilized gas turbine combustor using the commercial
   computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software ANSYS FLUENT. The first scope
   of the study aims to explicitly compare the predictive capabilities of
   two turbulence models namely Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes
   and Scale Adaptive Simulation for a reasonable trade-off between
   accuracy of results and global computational cost when applied to
   simulate swirl-stabilized spray combustion. The second scope of the
   study is to couple chemical reactions to the turbulent flow using a
   realistic chemistry model and also to model the local chemical
   non-equilibrium(NEQ) effects caused by turbulent strain such as flame
   stretching.
   Design/methodology/approach - Standard Eulerian and Lagrangian
   formulations are used to describe both gaseous and liquid phases,
   respectively. The computing method includes a two-way coupling in which
   phase properties and spray source terms are interchanging between the
   two phases within each coupling time step. The fuel used is liquid
   jet-A1 which is injected in the form of a polydisperse spray and the
   droplet evaporation rate is calculated using the infinite conductivity
   model. One-component (n-decane) and two-component fuels (n-decane +
   toluene) are used as jet-A1 surrogates. The combustion model is based on
   the mean mixture fraction and its variance, and a presumed-probability
   density function is used to model turbulent-chemistry interactions. The
   instantaneous thermochemical state necessary for the chemistry
   tabulation is determined by using initially the equilibrium (EQ)
   assumption and thereafter, detailed NEQ calculations through the steady
   flamelets concept. The combustion chemistry of these surrogates is
   represented through a reduced chemical kinetic mechanism (CKM)
   comprising 1,045 reactions among 139 species, derived from the detailed
   jet-A1 surrogate model, JetSurf 2.0 using a sensitivity based method,
   Alternate Species Elimination.
   Findings - Numerical results of the gas velocity, the gas temperature
   and the species molar fractions are compared with their experimental
   counterparts obtained from a steady state flame available in the
   literature. It is observed that, SAS coupled to the tabulated
   flamelet-based chemistry, predicts reasonably the main flame trends,
   while URANS even provided with the same combustion model and computing
   resources, leads to a poor prediction of the global flame trends,
   emphasizing the asset of a proper resolution when simulating spray
   flames.
   Research limitations/implications - The steady flamelet model even
   coupled with a robust turbulence model does not reproduce accurately the
   trend of species with slow oxidation kinetics such as CO and H2, because
   of the restrictiveness of the solutions space of flamelet equations and
   the assumption of unity Lewis for all species.
   Practical implications - This work is adding a contribution for spray
   flame modeling and can be seen as an extension to the significant
   efforts for the modeling of gaseous flames using robust turbulence
   models coupled with the tabulated flamelet-based chemistry approach to
   considerably reduce computing cost. The exclusive use of a commercial
   CFD code widely used in the industry allows a direct application of this
   simulation approach to industrial configurations while keeping computing
   cost reasonable.
   Originality/value - This study is useful to engineers interested in
   designing combustors of gas turbines and others combustion systems fed
   with liquid fuels.}},

   order to detect internal anomalies in the material; whilst the last two
   (DSP and HI) corresponds to the optical imaging techniques which make
   use of visible light to measure the material response to an applied
   stress. Both techniques were applied using the active approach, i.e. an
   external stimulation is applied in order to produce a gradient in

Abstract = {{In the present research work a study was carried out evaluating the
   applicability of two NDT techniques, this of Transient Thermography (TT)
   and Ultrasonic Testing (UT) for the inspection of different types of
   composite materials (i.e. laminated CFRPs, laminated hybrid FRPs and
   sandwiched panels). The composite structures were consisted of a variety
   of artificial defects, while inspection was performed through different
   testing configurations. In particular, transient thermography was
   implemented through the monitoring of the surface transient cooling
   after flash heating the samples and ultrasonic testing was applied using
   both a conventional single element probe (immersion technique) and a
   linear phased array transducer consisted of 128 elements. The main
   objective of this work was to compare the applicability and
   effectiveness of the two techniques in aerospace composites inspection
   as well as to evaluate the accuracy produced regarding the quantitative
   characterisation of the detected features. The obtained results showed
   that all the defects were revealed by either transient thermography or
   ultrasonic testing, whilst thermographic inspection can display the
   acquired results in a more rapid manner. On the other hand UT testing
   can provide efficient results for deeper probing requiring however
   longer inspection times. In other words, the acquired data and the
   respective analyses highlighted the different capability of each testing
   configuration, to detect defects and to gain knowledge for the interior
   of the structures.}},

Abstract = {{3D Carbon fiber polymer matrix composites (3D CF PMCs) are increasingly

   to decrease these defects, but causes some new types of defects.
   Infrared NDT (non-destructive testing) and ultrasound NDT are used. In
   particular, a micro-laser line thermography technique (micro-LLT) and a
   micro-laser spot thermography (micro-LST) with locked-in technique are
   used to detect the micro-defects. In addition, a comparative study is
   conducted by using pulsed thermography (PT), vibrothermography (VT). In
   order to confirm the types of the defects, microscopic inspection is
   carried out before NDT work, after sectioning and polishing a small part

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion of wastewater from the fruit juice industry was
   carried out in a batch digester. To study the effect of the pH values as
   well as the nutrient medium on the fermentation process, different
   parameters were monitored under mesophilic temperature, such as
   cumulative biogas volume, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total sugar, and
   biomass growth. It was found that for all cases, the COD concentration
   decreased with time. The lowest value reached was obtained when the
   nutrient medium was added; it was about 110 g/L after 480 h. In such
   cases, the COD removal reached about 80\%; the highest cumulative biogas
   volume of about 5,515.8 NmL was reached after 480 h testing; and the
   lowest value reached was about 2,862.3 NmL in the case of
   peach-substrate containing sodium sulfite. The addition of nutrient
   medium improved the cumulative biogas production as well as the COD
   abatement. Measurement of the biogas composition highlighted three
   gaseous components, namely, methane (56.52\%), carbon dioxide (20.14\%),
   and hydrogen sulfide (23.34\%). The modified Gompertz equation and the
   first-order kinetic model were used to describe the cumulative biogas
   production and the organic matter removal, respectively. A good
   agreement was found between simulated and experimental data.}},

Title = {{Synthesis, characterization and insights into stable and well organized
   hexagonal mesoporous zinc-doped alumina as promising metathesis

Journal = {{DALTON TRANSACTIONS}},

Pages = {{9823-9838}},
Abstract = {{A series of highly ordered hexagonal mesoporous alumina and
   zinc-modified mesoporous alumina samples are synthesized via a sol-gel
   method through an evaporation-induced self-assembly process using
   Pluronic F127 as nonionic templating agent and several aluminum
   precursors. The process was mediated using several carboxylic acids
   along with hydrochloric acid in ethanol. Successful impregnation of
   ZnCl2 was achieved while maintaining the ordered structure. The surface
   and textural properties of the materials were investigated.
   N-2-physisorption analysis revealed a BET surface area of 394 m(2) g(-1)
   and a pore volume around 0.55 cm(3) g(-1). Moreover, small-angle XRD
   diffraction patterns highlighted the well-organized hexagonal structure
   even upon the incorporation of zinc chloride. The organized-structure
   arrangement was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) analysis. The Zn/Al composition of the final materials was
   confirmed by EDX and XPS analysis, and the zinc amount incorporated was
   analyzed by ICP. Furthermore, the surface modification with zinc
   chloride impregnation was analyzed by XPS, H-1 and Al-27 MAS-NMR and
   FTIR spectroscopic techniques. In addition, the effects of synthesis
   conditions and the mechanism of the mesostructure formation were
   explored. The catalytic activity of several methyltrioxorhenium
   (MTO)-based catalysts supported on these hexagonal mesoporous alumina
   materials was tested for methyl oleate self-metathesis. The results
   showed improved kinetics using hexagonal alumina in comparison to those
   using wormhole-like alumina counterparts. This behavior could be
   attributed to better mass transfer features of hexagonal mesoporous
   alumina. The prepared materials with desirable pore size and structure
   are suitable candidates as catalyst supports for metathesis of bulky
   functionalized olefins and other catalytic transformations due to their
   enhanced Lewis acidity and more uniform pore networks favoring enhanced
   and selective mass transfer phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this work was the non-destructive testing (NDT) of an
   ancient fresco (15th century) preserved in the Santa Maria di
   Collemaggio Church (L'Aquila, Italy) and damaged after the 2009
   earthquake. Active infrared thermography (IRT), near-infrared (NIR)
   reflectography and ultraviolet imaging (UV) were used. In addition, the
   state of the fresco prior to the earthquake was analyzed by electronic
   speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), digital speckle correlation
   (DSC), raking light, tap, and chemical NDT techniques. The use of these
   techniques was important for the monitoring of new damages and for a
   comparison between the results over the years. Square heating
   thermography (SHT) data were processed using principal component
   thermography (PCT) and pulsed phase thermography (PPT) algorithms, in
   order to improve the defects' signature and to reduce the impact of
   non-uniform heating and emissivity variations due to the painting's
   pigments. A multi-analysis approach, segmentation operators and a
   specific data correlation method emphasize the overall study of the
   fresco. Furthermore, the facade and the high altar area were inspected
   by passive thermography and ground-penetrating radar (GPR),
   respectively. In the present case, the combined use of NDT techniques
   was useful to fill in the gaps in the construction history of the
   building.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{60-79}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the electron
   Monte Carlo (eMC) dose calculation algorithm included in a commercial
   treatment planning system and compare its performance against an
   electron pencil beam algorithm. Several tests were performed to explore
   the system's behavior in simple geometries and in configurations
   encountered in clinical practice. The first series of tests were
   executed in a homogeneous water phantom, where experimental measurements
   and eMC-calculated dose distributions were compared for various
   combinations of energy and applicator. More specifically, we compared
   beam profiles and depth-dose curves at different source-to-surface
   distances (SSDs) and gantry angles, by using dose difference and
   distance to agreement. Also, we compared output factors, we studied the
   effects of algorithm input parameters, which are the random number
   generator seed, as well as the calculation grid size, and we performed a
   calculation time evaluation. Three different inhomogeneous solid
   phantoms were built, using high-and low-density materials inserts, to
   clinically simulate relevant heterogeneity conditions: a small air
   cylinder within a homogeneous phantom, a lung phantom, and a chest wall
   phantom. We also used an anthropomorphic phantom to perform comparison
   of eMC calculations to measurements. Finally, we proceeded with an
   evaluation of the eMC algorithm on a clinical case of nose cancer. In
   all mentioned cases, measurements, carried out by means of XV-2 films,
   radiographic films or EBT2 Gafchromic films. were used to compare eMC
   calculations with dose distributions obtained from an electron pencil
   beam algorithm. eMC calculations in the water phantom were accurate.
   Discrepancies for depth-dose curves and beam profiles were under 2.5\%
   and 2 mm. Dose calculations with eMC for the small air cylinder and the
   lung phantom agreed within 2\% and 4\%, respectively. eMC calculations
   for the chest wall phantom and the anthropomorphic phantom also showed a
   positive agreement with the measurements. The retrospective dosimetric
   comparison of a clinical case, which presented scatter perturbations by
   air cavities, showed a difference in dose of up to 20\% between pencil
   beam and eMC algorithms. When comparing to the pencil beam algorithm,
   eMC calculations are definitely more accurate at predicting large dose
   perturbations due to inhomogeneities.}},

Title = {{Molecular self-assemblies might discriminate the diffusion of chiral
   molecules}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4167-4172}},
Abstract = {{Biological tissue has many self-aligned anisotropic molecular
   organizations, which are able to undergo reversible orientational
   deformations and spatially transfer them. At the same time, the majority
   of drugs and many biologically important molecules contain chiral
   centers. It is therefore important to understand the factors affecting
   the diffusion of chiral molecules in such elastic environments. We
   experimentally study the diffusion of chiral molecules in a nematic
   liquid crystal host representing the model of biological tissue. The
   analogy of Cano's quantization effect is observed (due to the gradient
   of the chiral dopant) and used to estimate the corresponding diffusion
   coefficients. It is shown that thanks to the collective orientational
   correlation of host molecules the diffusion of chiral dopants is
   noticeably reduced (by a factor of approximate to 1.6) for the case of
   rigid alignment of host molecules compared to the case when the same
   matrix is free to adjust that alignment.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to improve knowledge on the integrated
   fixed-film-activated sludge (IFAS) system designed for nitrogen removal.
   Biofilm growth and its contribution to nitrification were monitored
   under various operating conditions in a semi-industrial pilot-scale
   plant. Nitrification rates were observed in biofilms developed on
   free-floating media and in activated sludge operated under a low sludge
   retention time (4 days) and at an ammonia loading rate of 45-70
   gNH(4)-N/kgMLVSS/d. Operational conditions, i.e. oxygen concentration,
   redox potential, suspended solids concentration, ammonium and nitrates,
   were monitored continuously in the reactors. High removal efficiencies
   were observed for carbon and ammonium at high-loading rate. The
   contribution of biofilm to nitrification was determined as 40-70\% of
   total NOx-N production under the operating conditions tested. Optimal
   conditions to optimize process compacity were determined. The tested
   configuration responds especially well to winter and summer
   nitrification conditions. These results help provide a deeper
   understanding of how autotrophic biomass evolves through environmental
   and operational conditions in IFAS systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a methodology for assessing the residence times of
   drinking water in distribution systems using a tracer. The injection of
   a tracer followed by an intensive sampling campaign was used to evaluate
   the residence times of water in Quebec City's main system, which is

   determine the hardness and conductivity of the water in order to
   identify interconnections with a neighbouring system supplied by the St
   Lawrence River, a source with different properties. To validate the
   assumptions of interconnectivity, a complementary conductivity campaign
   was carried out. The tracer campaign allowed us to obtain the mean
   residence times (MRTs) within the study area and to target areas with
   low and high MRTs between 6 and 33 h. The mixing zones between water
   from the various sources and with longer MRTs following a stay in a
   reservoir were also identified. Results of this study were used to
   develop strategies to minimise MRT in order to improve water quality.
   These strategies are presented in the `companion paper' (Part II) in

Abstract = {{Hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting using sunlight
   has enormous potential in solving the worldwide energy and environmental
   crisis. The key challenge in this process is to develop efficient
   photocatalysts which must satisfy several criteria such as high chemical
   and photochemical stability, effective charge separation and strong
   sunlight absorption. The combination of different semiconductors to
   create composite materials offers a promising way to achieve efficient
   photocatalysts because doing so can improve the charge separation, light
   absorption and stability of the photocatalysts. In this review article,
   we summarized the most recent studies on semiconductor composites for
   hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. After a general
   introduction about the photocatalysis phenomenon, typical
   heterojunctions of widely studied heterogeneous semiconductors,
   including titanium dioxide, cadmium sulfide and graphitic carbon nitride
   are discussed in detail.}},

Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{250-255}},
Abstract = {{Bacteria, viruses, fungus, and other biological components (toxins,
   membranes, spores) can spread in the air through various aerosolization
   processes (breathing, bubbling, explosion, evaporation) and travel until
   they reach a surface or a host. Nosocomial diseases are an example of
   illnesses caused by a human contact with such pathogen vectors in
   hospital settings. Very little is known about the aerosolization
   processes of viruses and bacteria and their potential to infect people
   after their passage in the airborne state and about the microbial burden
   carried by individual aerosol particles. Here we propose a novel
   approach to study the aerosolization mechanisms of bacteria in single
   particles using fluorescence spectroscopy and a homemade system allowing
   the control of the aerosolization and the impaction of bacteria on a
   black filter. We validated the concept using P. fluorescence and E.
   coli. The results show that independently of the amount of P.
   fluorescens and E. coli aerosolized the average distribution of cells
   impacted on a black filter is described by a Poisson fit with lambda
   similar to 0.6 +/- 0.2. This means that using this aerosolization
   process, an aerosol will present no bacterium, but when it does, the
   number of bacteria per particle in the distributions will more probably
   be one. We also observed that the aerosolization processes of these two
   bacterial species allow P. fluorescens to be preferentially aerosolized
   against E. coli. These results demonstrate that fluorescence
   spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study bioaerosols in single
   particles. This technique can be used to study several phenomena like
   preferential aerosolization.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1457-1467}},
Abstract = {{Many river basins throughout the world are increasingly under pressure
   as water demands keep rising due to population growth,
   industrialization, urbanization and rising living standards. In the
   past, the typical answer to meet those demands focused on the supply
   side and involved the construction of hydraulic infrastructures to
   capture more water from surface water bodies and from aquifers. As river
   basins have become more and more developed, downstream water users and
   ecosystems have become increasingly dependent on the management actions
   taken by upstream users. The increased interconnectedness between water
   users, aquatic ecosystems and the built environment is further
   compounded by climate change and its impact on the water cycle. Those
   pressures mean that it has become increasingly important to measure and
   account for changes in water fluxes and their corresponding economic
   value as they progress throughout the river system. Such basin water
   accounting should provide policy makers with important information
   regarding the relative contribution of each water user, infrastructure
   and management decision to the overall economic value of the river
   basin. This paper presents a dynamic water accounting approach whereby
   the entire river basin is considered as a value chain with multiple
   services including production and storage. Water users and reservoir
   operators are considered as economic agents who can exchange water with
   their hydraulic neighbors at a price corresponding to the marginal value
   of water. Effective water accounting is made possible by keeping track
   of all water fluxes and their corresponding hypothetical transactions
   using the results of a hydro-economic model. The proposed approach is
   illustrated with the Eastern Nile River basin in Africa.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{24399-24448}},
Abstract = {{Biogas is a renewable energy source like solar and wind energies and
   mostly produced from anaerobic digestion (AD). The production of biogas
   is a well-established technology, but its commercial utilization is
   limited because on-site purification is needed before its transport or
   use. Biogas composition varies with the biomass digested and contains
   mainly methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as traces of
   hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H-2), nitrogen (N-2),
   carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen (O-2). In some cases dust particles and
   siloxanes are present. Several purification processes including
   pressurized water scrubbing, amine swing absorption, pressure swing
   adsorption, temperature swing adsorption, cryogenic separation and
   membrane technologies have been developed. Nevertheless, membrane
   technology is a relatively recent but very promising technology. Also,
   hybrid processes where membranes are combined with other processes are
   believed to have lower investment and operation costs compared with
   other processes. In this report, a discussion on the different materials
   used to produce membranes for gas separation is given including
   inorganic, organic and mixed matrix membranes, as well as polymer of
   intrinsic microporosity (PIM). Advantages and limitations for each type
   are discussed and comparisons are made in terms of permeability and
   diffusivity for a range of operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An original idea is reviewed. When a molecule is pumped into a
   super-excited state, one of its decay channels is neutral dissociation.
   One or more of the neutral fragments will fluoresce. Hence, if a lower
   state of such fluorescing fragments was populated through other channels
   but with a lower probability, population inversion of the fluorescing
   fragments would be naturally realized. This idea seems to be validated,
   so far, by comparing published work on three hydrocarbon molecules, CH4,
   C2H2, C2H4, and water vapor, H2O. After super-excitation in a
   femtosecond laser filament in air mixed with these molecules, the
   fluorescence from the CH or OH fragments exhibits population inversion,
   i.e., amplified spontaneous emission was observed in the backscattering
   direction of the filament.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Abstract = {{The radioisotope palladium (Pd-103), encapsulated in millimetre-size
   seed implants, is widely used in prostate cancer brachytherapy. Gold
   nanoparticles (Au NPs) distributed in the vicinity of Pd-103 radioactive
   implants, strongly enhance the therapeutic dose of radioactive implants
   (radiosensitisation effect). A new strategy under development to replace
   millimetre-size implants, consist in injecting radioactive NPs in the
   affected tissues. The development of Pd-103@Au NPs distributed in the
   diseased tissue, could increase the uniformity of treatment (compared
   with massive seeds), while enhancing the radiotherapeutic dose to the
   cancer cells (through Au-mediated radiosensitisation effect). To achieve
   this goal, it is necessary to develop a rapid, efficient, one-pot and
   easy-to-automatise procedure, allowing the synthesis of core-shell Pd@Au
   NPs. The novel synthesis route proposed here enables the production of
   Pd@Au NPs in not more than 4 h, in aqueous media, with minimal
   manipulations, and relying on biocompatible and nontoxic molecules. This
   rapid multi-step process consists of the preparation of ultra-small Pd
   NPs by chemical reduction of an aqueous solution of H2PdCl4 supplemented
   with ascorbic acid (AA) as reducing agent and
   2,3-meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) as a capping agent. Pd
   conversion yields close to 87\% were found, indicating the efficiency of
   the reaction process. Then Pd NPs were used as seeds for the growth of a
   gold shell (Pd@Au), followed by grafting with polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   to ensure colloidal stability. Pd@Au-PEG (TEM: 20.2 +/- 12.1 nm) formed
   very stable colloids in saline solution as well as in cell culture
   medium. The physico-chemical properties of the particles were
   characterised by FTIR, XPS, and UV-vis. spectroscopies. The viability of
   PC3 human prostate cancer cells was not affected after a 24 h incubation
   cycle with Pd@Au-PEG NPs to concentrations up to 4.22 mM Au. Finally,
   suspensions of Pd@Au-PEG NPs measured in computed tomography (CT) are
   found to attenuate X-rays more efficiently than commercial Au NPs CT
   contrast media. A proof-of-concept was performed to demonstrate the
   possibility synthesise radioactive Pd-103: Pd@Au-PEG NPs. This study
   reveals the possibility to synthesise Pd@Au NPs rapidly (including
   radioactive Pd-103: Pd@Au-PEG NPs), and following a methodology that
   respects all the strict requirements underlying the production of NPs
   for radiotherapeutic use (rapidity, reaction yield, colloidal stability,
   NPs concentration, purification).}},

Abstract = {{Population balance models (PBMs) represent a powerful modelling
   framework for the description of the dynamics of properties that are
   characterised by distributions. This distribution of properties under
   transient conditions has been demonstrated in many chemical engineering
   applications. Modelling efforts of several current and future unit
   processes in wastewater treatment plants could potentially benefit from
   this framework, especially when distributed dynamics have a significant
   impact on the overall unit process performance. In these cases, current
   models that rely on average properties cannot sufficiently capture the
   true behaviour and even lead to completely wrong conclusions. Examples
   of distributed properties are bubble size, floc size, crystal size or
   granule size. In these cases, PBMs can be used to develop new knowledge
   that can be embedded in our current models to improve their predictive
   capability. Hence, PBMs should be regarded as a complementary modelling
   framework to biokinetic models. This paper provides an overview of
   current applications, future potential and limitations of PBMs in the
   field of wastewater treatment modelling, thereby looking over the fence
   to other scientific disciplines.}},

Title = {{Effect of sensor location on controller performance in a wastewater
   treatment plant}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{700-708}},
Abstract = {{Complete mixing is hard to achieve in large bioreactors in wastewater
   treatment plants. This often leads to a non-uniform distribution of
   components such as dissolved oxygen and, hence, the process rates depend
   on them. Furthermore, when these components are used as input for a
   controller, the location of the sensor can potentially affect the
   control action. In this contribution, the effect of sensor location and
   the choice of setpoint on the controller performance were examined for a
   non-homogeneously mixed pilot bioreactor described by a compartmental
   model. The impacts on effluent quality and aeration cost were evaluated.
   It was shown that a dissolved oxygen controller with a fixed setpoint
   performs differently as a function of the location of the sensor. When
   placed in a poorly mixed location, the controller increases the aeration
   intensity to its maximum capacity leading to higher aeration costs. When
   placed just above the aerated zone, the controller decreases the
   aeration rate resulting in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in the
   remainder of the system, compromising effluent quality. In addition to
   the location of the sensor, the selection of an appropriate setpoint
   also impacts controller behavior. This suggests that mixing behavior of
   bioreactors should be better quantified for proper sensor location and
   controller design.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of electro-activated (EA) aqueous solutions as well as
   the dynamics of their changes were considered in the current study using
   aqueous solutions of NaCl and NaHCO3. The concentrations of the salt
   solutions were 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.05 M. The tests were performed at
   the DC current densities of 25, 37.5, and 50 angstrom/m(2). The
   electro-activation reactor consisted of three individual cells assembled
   together and separated by anion-exchange (AEM) and cation-exchange (CEM)
   membranes. During the experiments, four configurations of the membrane
   placements and solutions concentrations were studied. The obtained
   results showed the dynamics of the electro-activation process that
   allows obtaining electro-activated solutions with targeted properties
   such as pH and oxydo-reduction potential (ORP). It was possible to
   obtain electro-activated solutions at the anodic side (acid anolyte)
   with pH of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 and ORP of +1100 +/- 15 mV when NaCl
   solution was used as electrolyte. Furthermore, several types of
   electro-activated solutions with high redox potential (ORP = +921 +/- 12
   mV) and neutral pH (6.48 +/- 0.05) were obtained on the anode side when
   sodium carbonate was used. At the same time, two types of solutions, one
   with acid pH (2.14 +/- 0.14) and the other one with alkaline pH (10.46
   +/- 10.03) with ORP = +689 +/- 10 and 110 21 my, respectively, were

Abstract = {{Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are being developed as drug
   delivery vectors. Biomedical imaging (MRI and PET) enables their
   tracking in vivo, provided their surface is adequately grafted with
   imaging probes (metal chelates). However, MSNs are characterized by huge
   specific surfaces, and high-quality metal chelate anchoring procedures
   must be developed and validated, to demonstrate that their detection in
   vivo is associated to the presence of nanoparticles and not to detached
   metal chelates. MCM-48 nanospheres (M48SNs, 150 nm diam., 3-D pore
   geometry) were synthesized and functionalized with
   diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). The strong grafting of DTPA
   was confirmed by Si-29 MAS-NMR, XPS, FTIR and TGA. The particles were
   labeled with paramagnetic ions Gd3+ (for MRI) as well as radioactive
   ions Cu-64(2+) (for PET; half-life: 12.7 h). Gd3+-DTPA-M48SNs formed a
   stable colloid in saline media for at least 6 months, without any sign
   of aggregation. The relaxometric properties were measured at various
   magnetic fields. The strength of DTPA binding at the surface of MSNs was
   also assessed in vivo, by injecting mice (i.v.) with
   Gd3+/Cu-64(2+)-DTPA-M48SNs. Vascular retention and urinary clearance
   were monitored by MRI, whereas the PET modality provided dynamic and
   quantitative assessment of biodistribution and blood/organ clearance. No
   significant Cu-64 activity was detectable in the bladder. The study
   confirmed the very limited detachment of DTPA from M48SNs cores once
   injected in vivo. The transit of MSNs through the liver and intestinal
   tract, does not lead to evidence of Gd3+/Cu-64(2+)-DTPA in the urine.
   This physico-chemical and biodistribution study confirms the quality of
   DTPA attachment at the surface of the particles, necessary to allow
   further development of PET/MRI-assisted MSN-vectorized drug delivery
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{A smoothed finite element method formulation for the resultant
   eight-node solid-shell element is presented in this paper for
   geometrical linear analysis. The smoothing process is successfully
   performed on the element mid-surface to deal with the membrane and
   bending effects of the stiffness matrix. The strain smoothing process
   allows replacing the Cartesian derivatives of shape functions by the
   product of shape functions with normal vectors to the element
   mid-surface boundaries. The present formulation remains competitive when
   compared to the classical finite element formulations since no inverse
   of the Jacobian matrix is calculated. The three dimensional resultant
   shell theory allows the element kinematics to be defined only with the
   displacement degrees of freedom. The assumed natural strain method is
   used not only to eliminate the transverse shear locking problem
   encountered in thin-walled structures, but also to reduce trapezoidal
   effects. The efficiency of the present element is presented and compared
   with that of standard solid-shell elements through various benchmark
   problems including some with highly distorted meshes.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrawideband (UWB) short-range communication systems have proved to be
   valuable in medical technology, particularly for implanted devices, due
   to their low-power consumption, low cost, small size, and high data
   rates. Neural activity monitoring in the brain requires high data rate
   (800 kb/s per neural sensor), and we target a system supporting a large
   number of sensors, in particular, aggregate transmission above 430 Mb/s
   (similar to 512 sensors). Knowledge of channel behavior is required to
   determine the maximum allowable power to 1) respect ANSI guidelines for
   avoiding tissue damage, and 2) respect FCC guidelines on unlicensed
   transmissions. We utilize a realistic model of the biological channel to
   inform the design of antennas for the implanted transmitter and the
   external receiver under these requirements. Antennas placement is
   examined under two scenarios having contrasting power constraints.
   Performance of the system within the biological tissues is examined via
   simulation and experiment. Our miniaturized antennas, 12 mm x 12 mm,
   need worst-case receiver sensitivities of -38 and -30.5 dBm for the
   first and second scenarios, respectively. These sensitivities allow us
   to successfully detect signals transmitted through tissues in the
   3.1-10.6-GHz UWB band.}},

Abstract = {{Weather predictions are uncertain by nature. This uncertainty is
   dynamically assessed by a finite set of trajectories, called ensemble
   members. Unfortunately, ensemble prediction systems underestimate the
   uncertainty and thus are unreliable. Statistical approaches are proposed
   to post-process ensemble forecasts, including Bayesian model averaging
   and the Bayesian processor of output. We develop a methodology, called
   the Bayesian processor of ensemble members, from a hierarchical model
   and combining the two aforementioned frameworks to calibrate ensemble
   forecasts. The Bayesian processor of ensemble members is compared with
   Bayesian model averaging and the Bayesian processor of output by
   calibrating surface temperature forecasting over eight stations in the
   province of Quebec (Canada). Results show that ensemble forecast skill
   is improved by the method developed.}},

Abstract = {{Surface heat treatment of wood improves its hydrophobic, antifungal, and
   anti-swelling properties, and strengthens its resistance to the vagaries

   solvothermal treatment of wood specimens impregnated with hydrophilic
   ({[}EMIM]{[}OTf]) and hydrophobic ({[}EMIM]{[}OTf]) ionic liquids which
   we compared to a conventional heat treatment under nitrogen atmosphere
   over the following treatment temperature and time ranges: {[}180 degrees
   C - 260 degrees C] and {[}30min - 4h]. The treated specimens were
   subjected to moisture adsorption, water absorption, swelling, and
   mechanical properties testing. The results revealed a notable decrease
   in ultimate moisture content and water uptake of the samples, provided
   they were impregnated with a hydrophobic ionic liquid before heat
   treatment at temperatures less than 200 degrees C. However, the
   mechanical properties testing showed that the elastic and rupture moduli
   of specimens decreased with increasing treatment temperature and time
   irrespective of using ionic liquids. However, the impregnated samples
   suffered in general increased breakability which was ascribed to partial
   solubilization of wood components in the ionic liquid.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of nanotechnology has inspired materials scientists to
   invent nanostructures with achievements in numerous practical

   In this Feature Article, we present the recent progress of our recent
   research and that of other groups in tailoring the assembly, interfaces,

   properties of the engineered nanostructures are discussed in relation to
   photocatalysis, with special emphasis on solar energy conversion,
   including water splitting, CO2 reduction, and organic
   photodecomposition. Considering their attributes of superior catalytic
   performance and long-term durability, the development of economical,
   active nanocatalysts opens up practical opportunities for endeavours in
   sustainable energy conversion and other applied fields. This review is

   It can process 32 neuronal signals in real-time with high compression

   detection and data compression in-situ. The presented headstage is small
   and lightweight rendering it suitable for conducting in-vivo experiments

   in-vivo experiments showing that the proposed wireless headstage can
   collect, detect and compress the microvolts amplitude neuronal signals
   evoked by light stimulation with a high averaged peak-signal-to-noise
   ratio of 22.4 dB and a high averaged signal-to-noise distortion ratio of

Abstract = {{We use machine learning to generate metamodels for sawing simulation.
   Simulation is widely used in the wood industry for decision making.
   These simulators are particular since their response for a given input
   is a structured object, i.e., a basket of lumbers. We demonstrate how we
   use simple machine learning algorithms (e.g., a tree) to obtain a good
   approximation of the simulator's response. The generated metamodels are
   guaranteed to output physically realistic baskets (i.e., there exists at
   least one log that can produce the basket). We also propose to use
   kernel ridge regression. While having the power to exploit the structure
   of a basket, it can predict previously unseen baskets. We finally
   evaluate the impact of possibly predicting unrealistic baskets using
   ridge regression jointly with a nearest neighbor approach in the output
   space. All metamodels are evaluated using standard machine learning
   metrics and novel metrics especially designed for the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Post-shutdown heat soak-back is a commonly known cause for engine
   deterioration. In gas turbine combustors the heat generated by hot parts
   as the rotating components of the engine (such as the compressor and the

   eventually to the surrounding air cavities. As this surplus heat reaches
   fuel wetted surfaces, coking becomes susceptible to occur, leaving solid
   deposition leading to a potential harm to the fuel delivery systems and
   to frequent overhauls. Numerical and experimental studies will be made
   in order to get a better understanding of the heat soak-back phenomenon,
   its potential effect on coking build-up, and to eventually seek

Title = {{A nearly optimal inspection policy for a two-component series system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{171+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine a nearly optimal
   inspection sequence for a series system consisting of two components
   subject to gradual deterioration and whose failures are not
   self-announcing and can be detected only through inspection.
   Design/methodology/approach - The problem is tackled in the context of
   condition-based maintenance (CBM) with a maintenance model in the class
   of the control-limit policies for which the maintenance decision is made
   following inspection by comparison of the deterioration level to
   critical thresholds. A mathematical model is developed to express the
   total expected cost per time unit as a function of the inspection
   instants.
   Findings - For any given series system composed of two components with
   known critical deterioration threshold levels, and for any given set of
   costs related to inspection, inactivity due to failure, and preventive
   and corrective replacements of each component, a nearly optimal
   inspection sequence of the system is derived such as the total expected
   cost is reduced.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the complexity of the cost
   model with the inspection instants (x1, x2, x3, ...) being the decision
   variables, it has not been possible to derive the optimal solution. A
   quasi-optimal sequence of inspection times is derived along with the
   corresponding total average cost per time unit.
   Practical implications - In many practical situations in which CBM is
   implemented, a tradeoff between inspection costs and inactivity and
   replacement costs has to be balanced when determining the intervals
   between successive inspections at which the degradation level of the
   components should be assessed and compared to predetermined critical
   threshold levels. Inspecting too often would increase inspection costs
   but in the same time it would also increase the probability to avoid a
   failure and end up with a preventive replacement, whereas not inspecting
   often enough would increase the probability to end up with a failure
   increasing replacement and inactivity costs.
   Originality/value - While the inspection problem has been largely
   treated for single component systems, inspection policies become much
   more complex when considering multi-component systems. A two-component
   series system is considered in this paper.}},

Title = {{Age replacement policies for two-component systems with stochastic
   dependence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{346+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate age replacement
   policies for two-component parallel system with stochastic dependence.
   The stochastic dependence considered, is modeled by a one-sided domino
   effect. The failure of component 1 at instant t may induce the failure
   of component 2 at instant t+tau with probability p1(-> 2). The time
   delay tau is a random variable with known probability density function
   h(p1)-> (2)(.). The system is considered in a failed state when both
   components are failed. The proposed replacement policies suggest to
   replace the system upon failure or at age T whichever occurs first.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the first policy, costs and durations
   associated withmaintenance activities are supposed to be constant. In
   the second replacement policy, the preventive replacement cost depends
   on the system's state and age. The expected cost per unit of time over
   an infinite span is derived and numerical examples are presented.
   Findings - In this paper and especially in the second policy, the
   authors find that the authors can get a more economical policy if the
   authors consider that the preventive replacement cost is not constant
   but depends on T.
   Originality/value - In this paper, the authors take into account of the
   stochastic dependence between system components. This dependence affects
   the global reliability of the system and replacement's periodicity. It
   can be used to measure the performance of the system et introduced into
   design phase of the system.}},

Title = {{From Jack to Double Jack Polynomials via the Supersymmetric Bridge}},
Journal = {{SYMMETRY INTEGRABILITY AND GEOMETRY-METHODS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Abstract = {{The Calogero Sutherland model occurs in a large number of physical
   contexts, either directly or via its eigenfunctions, the Jack
   polynomials. The supersymmetric counterpart of this model, although much
   less ubiquitous, has an equally rich structure. In particular, its
   eigenfunctions, the Jack superpolynomials, appear to share the very same
   remarkable combinatorial and structural properties as their
   non-supersymmetric version. These super-functions are parametrized by
   superpartitions with fixed bosonic and fermionic degrees. Now, a truly
   amazing feature pops out when the fermionic degree is sufficiently
   large: the Jack superpolynomials stabilize and factorize. Their
   stability is with respect to their expansion in terms of an elementary
   basis where, in the stable sector, the expansion coefficients become
   independent of the fermionic degree. Their factorization is seen when
   the fermionic variables are stripped off in a suitable way which results
   in a product of two ordinary Jack polynomials (somewhat modified by
   plethystic transformations), dubbed the double Jack polynomials. Here,
   in addition to spelling out these results, which were first obtained in
   the context of Macdonal superpolynomials, we provide a heuristic
   derivation of the Jack superpolynomial case by performing simple
   manipulations on the supersymmetric eigen-operators, rendering them
   independent of the number of particles and of the fermionic degree. In
   addition, we work out the expression of the Hamiltonian which
   characterizes the double Jacks. This Hamiltonian, which defines a new
   integrable system, involves not only the expected Calogero Sutherland
   pieces but also combinations of the generators of an underlying af fine
   (sl(2)) over cap algebra.}},

Abstract = {{Using beam and tetrahedron elements to simulate nanocrystalline
   cellulose (NCC), single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and polypropylene
   (PP), finite element method (FEM) is used to predict the mechanical
   properties of nano-composites. The bending, shear and torsion behaviors
   of nano-composites are especially investigated due to the limited amount
   of information in the present literature. First, mixed method (MM) and
   FEM are used to compare the bending stiffness of NCC/PP and SWCNT/PP
   composites. Second, based on mechanics of materials, the shear moduli of
   both types of nano-composites are obtained. Finally, fixing the number
   of fibers and for different volume contents, four NCC lengths are used
   to determine the mechanical properties of the composites. The bending
   and shearing performances are also compared between NCC and SWCNT based
   composites. In all cases, the elastic-plastic analyses are carried out
   and the stress or strain distributions for specific regions are also
   investigated. From all the results obtained, an economic analysis shows
   that NCC is more interesting than SWCNT to reinforce PP. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Given a set of players and the cost of each possible coalition, the
   question we address is which coalitions should be formed. We formulate
   mixed integer linear programming models for this problem, considering
   core stability and strong equilibrium. The objective function looks for
   minimizing the total cost allocated among the players. Concerned about
   the difficulties of managing large coalitions in practice, we also study
   the effect of a maximum cardinality constraint per coalition. We test
   the models in two applications. One is in collaborative forest
   transportation and the other one in inventory of spare parts for oil
   operations. In these situations, collaboration opportunities involving
   significant savings exist, but for several reasons, it may be better to
   group the players in different sub-coalitions rather than in the grand
   coalition. The models we propose are thus relevant for deciding how to
   partition the set of players. We also prove that if the strong
   equilibrium model is feasible, its optimal cost is equal to the optimal
   cost of the core stability model and, consequently, a coalition
   structure that solves one problem also solves the other problem. We
   present results that illustrate this property. We also present results
   where the core stability problem is feasible and the strong equilibrium
   problem is infeasible. Setting an upper bound on the maximum cardinality
   of the coalitions, allows us to study the marginal savings of enlarging
   the cardinality of the coalitions. We find that the marginal savings of
   allowing one more player significantly decreases as the bound increases.

Abstract = {{Countercurrent flooding limits in gas liquid structured packed bed
   columns were studied using a stability analysis of the solutions of a
   transient two zone two fluid hydrodynamic model around a uniform state.
   The model is based on the volume average mass and momentum balance
   equations and the double slit drag closures. The source terms in
   momentum balance equations refer to the total phase interaction and
   mechanical dispersion forces and the closure expression relating the gas
   and liquid pressures is given by capillary dispersion and gravity. The
   model predicts very well the flooding limits for air-water
   countercurrent flow through various Mellapak structured packings. The
   incidence on the column-limited flooding point of packing geometty
   (porosity and specific surface area), fluid throughputs and properties
   (viscosity, gas and liquid densities) and liquid spreading
   characteristics was discussed from the perspective of model simulated
   trends. Gravity was unveiled as the most important factor in the
   stabilization force which contributes to the attenuation of liquid waves
   inducing a tendency to make the flow more uniform. Its contribution was
   Factored in using a modified capillary pressure model. Beside gravity,
   this formulation indicated that the stabilizing role of capillary forces
   could not be disregarded, particularly for lower values of the gravity
   scaling factor in liquid-rich regions at relatively high liquid flow
   rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of CO2 removal by
   2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol (AHPD) + piperazine (Pz) aqueous
   blend, a membrane contactor (MC)-optimized absorption solution, in a
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hollow fiber MC was investigated.
   Experiments were conducted under various operational conditions: liquid
   flow rates, gas compositions and flow orientation (co- or
   counter-current). To assess the activator effect of Pz, CO2 absorption
   measurements using aqueous AHPD solutions was also performed. The
   absorption performance of AHPD-Pz blend, which has significant
   advantages compared to conventional amines, was found to be similar or
   better (depending on operational conditions) than that of conventional
   MEA aqueous solution, thus indicating the high industrial potential of
   this MC-optimized aqueous blend to separate CO2 from flue gas. The
   absorption performed in co- and counter-current flow circulation showed
   no significant difference. The mass transfer in the membrane contactor
   was described by a comprehensive two-scale isothermal steady-state model
   accounting for CO2 diffusion in the gas-filled membrane pores, CO2 and
   amines diffusion/reaction within the liquid-filled membrane pores and
   CO2 and amines diffusion/reaction in the liquid boundary layer. The
   calculated CO2 absorption flux agreed very well with the experimental
   data while considering partial pore wetting which induces a high
   resistance to mass transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Batch hydrogenolysis of concentrated glycerol has been conducted over
   different Cu/ZnO-based catalysts prepared by the coprecipitation method.
   The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, H-2
   temperature-programmed reduction, and the N2O titration technique of
   measurement of the metallic Cu surface area. Results show that the
   reaction system is affected by hydrogen pressure, temperature, glycerol
   concentration, and the surface area of metallic copper. Our results tend
   to show that the reaction scheme is more complicated than the commonly
   accepted dehydrationhydrogenation mechanism. Tests conducted with
   varying hydrogen pressure indicate that the mechanism may begin with the
   dehydrogenation of glycerol to glyceraldehyde. Tests conducted with
   varying water content tend to show that high water content favors
   ethylene glycol (EG) formation. The selectivity to 1,2-propanediol
   (12PG) versus ethylene glycol is a function of the relative reaction
   rates where the glyceraldehyde can react to either yield 12PG or go
   through a retro-Claisen route to yield EG. Finally, multiple catalytic
   tests conducted with a constant amount of copper surface area show that,
   according to the MadonBoudart criterion, the catalytic system is heavily
   hampered by transport phenomena limitations.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, pure forsterite (Mg2SiO4) powder was successfully
   synthesised via ball milling and subsequent heat treatment as an evident
   from X-ray diffraction analysis. The synthesised powder were formed by
   powder agglomerates that were made up of loosely packed fine particles.
   Then, the forsterite green bodies were sintered at 1200 and 1400 degrees
   C with two different ramp rates (2 and 10 degrees C per minute) via
   conventional pressureless sintering. No decomposition of forsterite
   phase was observed at both ramp rates. This study revealed that lower
   ramp rate (2 degrees C per minute) possessed minor improvement on the
   mechanical properties only at lower sintering temperature (1200 degrees
   C), whereas 10 degrees C per minute ramp rate gave a significant
   enhancement on the mechanical properties of forsterite at 1400 degrees
   C. A high fracture toughness of similar to 4.9 MPam(1/2) and Vickers
   hardness of similar to 7.1 GPa were obtained for forsterite samples
   sintered at 1400 degrees C with a ramp rate of 10 degrees C per minute.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of different ZrB2 content on various
   mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of ZrB2/Y-TZP
   composite. Composites with ZrB2 content of up to 20 wt-\% were
   particularly beneficial at the lower sintering temperature range by
   achieving greater densification and better hardness than Y-TZP monolith.
   In contrast to the trends estimated from rule of mixture, the increment
   of ZrB2 content did not result in any significant improvement in the
   elastic modulus and hardness of the zirconia composites. Nevertheless,
   all composites showed tremendous improvement in fracture toughness
   compared with monolithic Y-TZP and thus, suggested that other toughening
   mechanisms were operative besides transformation toughening of zirconia.
   Incorporation of ZrB2 up to mass fraction of 20 wt-\% into Y-TZP
   generally did not affect the tetragonal phase stability of zirconia.
   Significant reduction of electrical resistivity of the composites was
   achieved with ZrB2 content of 20 wt-\% and sintering temperature of 1400
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration process for damaged human bone may be performed using

   aims to characterise hydroxyapatite produced from the bovine bone at
   various temperatures from 400 to 700 degrees C. The microstructure and
   properties of a hydroxyapatite made by the sintering of bovine bone were
   examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The analyses
   indicated that the white sintered bone was hydroxyapatite and did not
   contain any organic components of the bone. X-ray diffraction patterns
   affirmed the phase condition and height of crystallinity level of the
   bovine hydroxyapatite obtained. Furthermore, phase transformation of the
   resulting hydroxyapatite to other calcium phosphate phases did not
   occur.}},

   employed to prepare biphasic calcium phosphate powder. The starting
   materials of calcium hydroxide and orthophosphoric acid were used in the
   titration process and the as-synthesised powder was subsequently doped
   with manganese oxide by wet milling. The X-ray diffraction analysis
   revealed that the phase present in the as-synthesised powder was
   predominantly hydroxyapatite. However, upon sintering, all the samples
   revealed the existence of biphasic calcium phosphate i. e. a mix phase
   comprising of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate. The highest
   relative density of 99.5\% was obtained for biphasic calcium phosphate
   doped with 0.3 wt\% MnO2 when sintered at 1400 degrees C. The results
   also revealed that 0.3 wt\% MnO2-doped biphasic calcium phosphate gave a

Abstract = {{A bifunctional CaO-Zr/Ni (13, 18, and 20.5 wt\% NiO) sorbent-catalyst
   was developed using the wet-mixing/sonication technique and applied for
   hydrogen production by sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming
   (SESMR), an intensified process that integrates hydrogen production with
   CO2 capture. The material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), and N-2 physisorption (BET). CO2 sorption efficiency of the
   developed materials was evaluated during 25 CO2 sorption/regeneration
   cycles. The prepared sorbent-catalysts were then applied in the SESMR
   during 10 reaction cycles. The results showed that the bifunctional

   activity. The H-2 yield of similar to 91\% at the end of the 10th SESMR
   cycle is considerably higher than equilibrium H-2 yield that could be
   obtained by traditional steam methane reforming. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Spatial interpolation methods are required for analysing the effects of
   soil hydraulic properties on irrigation management. This study was
   conducted to determine which interpolation methods are best suited to
   map these properties. During the summer of 2012 we mapped the spatial
   variability of soil physical properties, soil matric potential, water
   table depth and yield of two cranberry fields located near Quebec City,
   Canada. Three spatial interpolation methods, inverse distance weighting
   (IDW), thin plate splines (TPS) and kriging with external drift (KED),
   were compared by means of cross-validation. The best interpolation
   method for a given property was used to produce maps and perform HYDRUS
   1D simulations for the purpose of irrigation management. Results show
   that even in highly constructed fields, such as for cranberries, spatial
   patterns of soil hydraulic properties exist. The TPS method was the best
   interpolation method based on the cross-validation analyses and
   generated maps. Spatial variability of crop yield showed a strong
   relationship with soil hydraulic properties and simulations suggest that
   irrigation can be reduced by 75\% when accounting for the spatial
   variability of soil hydraulic properties. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper describes a dual-arm teleoperation (master-slave) system
   which has been developed to explore the effect of haptics in
   robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). This setup is
   capable of measuring forces in 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) and fully
   reflecting them to the operator through two 7-DOF haptic interfaces. An
   application of the test bed is in enabling the evaluation of the effect
   of replacing haptic feedback by other sensory cues such as visual
   representation of haptic information (sensory substitution). This paper
   discusses the design rationale, kinematic analysis and dynamic modeling
   of the robot manipulators, and the control system developed for the
   setup. Using the accurate model developed in this paper, a highly
   transparent haptics-enabled system can be achieved and used in
   robot-assisted telesurgery. Validation results obtained through
   experiments are presented and demonstrate the correctness and
   effectiveness of the developed models. The application of the setup for
   two RAMIS surgical tasks, a suture manipulation task and a tumor
   localization task, is described with different haptics modalities
   available through the developed haptics-enabled system for each
   application.}},

Abstract = {{We numerically study the displacement flow of two iso-viscous Newtonian
   fluids in an inclined two-dimensional channel, formed by two parallel
   plates. The results are complementary to our previous studies on
   displacement flows in pipes and channels. The heavier displacing fluid
   moves the lighter displaced fluid in the downward direction. Three
   dimensionless groups largely describe these flows: the densimetric
   Froude number (Fr), the Reynolds number (Re), and the duct inclination
   (beta). As a first order approximation, we are able to classify
   different flow regimes phenomenologically in a two-dimensional (Fr; Re
   cos beta/Fr)-plane and provide leading order expressions for the
   transitions between different regimes. The stabilizing and/or
   de-stabilizing effects of the imposed mean flow on buoyant exchange
   flows (zero imposed velocity) are described for a broad range of
   dimensionless parameters. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   the two-part segmentation algorithm, its accuracy is quantified by
   comparing the resulting binary images to manually segmented images. We
   then demonstrate the ability of our method to retrieve morphological
   data from CARS images of nerve tissue. Finally, we present the
   segmentation of a large mosaic of CARS images covering more than half
   the area of a mouse spinal cord cross section and show evidence of
   clusters of neurons with similar g-ratios throughout the spinal cord.

Abstract = {{The notion of recognition of a language by a finite semigroup can be
   generalized to recognition by finite groupoids, i.e. sets equipped with
   a binary operation `.' which is not necessarily associative. It is well
   known that L can be recognized by a groupoid iff Lis context-free.
   However it is also known that some subclasses of groupoids can only
   recognize regular languages.
   A groupoid His said to be conservative if a . b is an element of\{a, b\}
   for all a, b is an element of H. The first result of this paper is that
   conservative groupoids can only recognize regular languages. This class
   of groupoids is incomparable with the ones identified so far which share
   this property, so we are exhibiting a new way in which a groupoid can be
   too weak to recognize non-regular languages.
   We also study the class L-cons of regular languages that can be

Abstract = {{This paper presents practical design of a smart antenna system based on
   direction-of-arrival estimation and Dolph-Chebyshev beam forming.
   Direction-of-arrival estimation is based on the multiple signal
   classification algorithm for identifying the directions of the source
   signals incident on the sensor array comprising the smart antenna
   system. The smart antenna system design involves a hardware part, which
   provides real data measurements of the incident signals received by the
   sensor array. This paper presents the Dolph-Chebyshev method for the
   synthesis and design of antenna arrays with periodic element spacing. A
   Field-Programmable Gate Array implementation is presented for an antenna
   array application employing digital beamforming. The array comprises 10
   elements, equal in number receiving radio frequency and intermediate
   frequency components, as well as a Spartan-3E Field-Programmable Gate
   Array-based unit, which is responsible for the control of the array.
   Low-cost and switched-beam, and fully adaptive antenna array suitable
   for 2-GHz applications are proposed in this paper. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Phased antenna array design is one of the most important electromagnetic
   optimization problems. This research combined the Taguchi method and
   artificial intelligence methods, used them as the prediction tool in
   designing parameters for the communication system, and then constructed
   a set of the optimal parameter analysis flow and steps. In this paper,
   we present an application of artificial neural networks in the
   electromagnetic domain. We particularly look at the multilayer
   perceptron network, which has been the most used of artificial neural
   networks architectures both in the electromagnetic domain and in the
   Taguchi optimization technique and describes the Taguchi method to
   optimize the excitations elements of the linear array to produce a
   radiation pattern with minimum side lobe level and null placement
   control. This paper investigates how the implementation of the signal
   processing in hardware affects the performance of the adaptive array
   antenna. The investigation is confined to uplink or receive antenna
   array only. Results of a prototype of antenna array with feeding values
   designed using the proposed techniques are also presented. Copyright (c)

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of coordinated spare-part logistics and
   operations planning for third-party maintenance providers. Due to the
   multi-indenture structure of the equipment, different types of
   components might randomly fail to perform at different points of time.
   The spare part logistics literature has been focused on spare part
   inventory management in an in-house maintenance context. In this
   article, a mathematical programming model is first developed to
   formulate the problem in the context of a third-party maintenance
   provider who is faced with strict due dates for the delivery of repaired
   equipment. The model seeks the optimal number of maintenance jobs that
   can be completed to deliver at each period, as well as the order
   quantity of spare parts so as to minimize the procurement, inventory,
   and equipment late delivery costs, while taking into account the spare
   part supply lead-time. Next, we model the spare part demand uncertainty
   as a non-stationary stochastic process in each period in the planning
   horizon. The deterministic model is then reformulated as a multi-stage
   stochastic program with recourse. We also discuss the complexity of the
   stochastic model and propose a preprocessing approach to reduce its size
   for large instances. Numerical results demonstrate how the proposed
   model links the spare part logistics and equipment delivery decisions
   under spare part demand uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{233-255}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Energy consumption rises as mines extract ore from deeper levels. Rising
   energy costs, increased public scrutiny and enhanced awareness of carbon
   emissions are factors which can influence mining companies to examine
   and reduce their energy use.
   A comparison of best practice energy management initiatives of the
   1970's with more recent activities revealed that several measures
   reported for both periods were similar. After best practice measures
   have been adopted, the lack of reliable data will impede a continuous
   improvement approach.
   Mining companies routinely report on sustainability issues via corporate
   sustainability reports, for which several frameworks exist. An
   assessment of the energy-related reporting requirements of these
   guidelines determined that the development of transparent, standardized
   reporting on energy matters from the mining industry is essential to
   stimulate progress. Mining-specific energy data was also available from
   Statistics Canada, Natural Resources Canada and the Canadian Industrial
   Energy End-use Data and Analysis Centre, as well as in two Canadian and
   one U.S benchmarking studies. However, these resources were reviewed and
   found to be problematic.
   Examples of best practice as well as research and development
   initiatives in the mining industry are presented. A novel benchmarking
   approach, specific to mines, is proposed that could be used to
   demonstrate continuous improvement in energy efficiency within the
   mining industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe a simple spin-coating deposition technique for
   lead sulphide (PbS) and cadmium sulphide (CdS) films from a methanolic
   metal-thiourea complex. The characterization of the films by X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques revealed
   that pure cubic phase PbS and CdS layers were formed via this method. As
   shown by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
   results, both films were homogeneous and presented a smooth surface.
   Optical properties showed that the energy band gap of PbS and CdS films
   were around 1.65 and 2.5 eV, respectively. The PbS film is p-type in
   nature with an electrical conductivity of around 0.8 S/cm. The hole
   concentration and mobility were 2.35 x 10(18) cm(-3) and 2.16 x 10(-3)
   cm(2)/V/s, respectively, as determined from Hall measurement. Both films
   were used to develop a thin film solar cell device of
   graphite/PbS/CdS/ITO/glass. Device characterization showed the power
   conversion efficiency of around 0.24 \%. The corresponding open circuit
   voltage, short circuit current and fill factor were 0.570 V, 1.32
   mA/cm(2) and 0.32, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The potential and effectiveness of near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral
   imaging was investigated for rapid and nondestructive spectral-spatial

   sensor performance. Multivariate Image Analysis (MIA) was applied to NIR
   hyperspectral images of unprinted multilayer films with different
   compositions to distinguish them regarding absence/presence of
   particular layers. Since printing of commercial brands on the films may
   interfere with product inspection, the ability of MIA to detect the
   presence of the functional layer (barrier) in spite of film surface
   printing was also assessed. The results show that the proposed MIA

Abstract = {{The ubiquitous water-borne Gram-negative bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida
   subsp. salmonicida is the causative agent of furunculosis, a worldwide
   disease in fish farms. Plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes
   have already been described for this bacterium. The aim of the present
   study was to identify and characterize additional multidrug resistance
   plasmids in A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. We sequenced the plasmids
   present in two multiple antibiotic-resistant isolates using
   high-throughput technologies. We also investigated 19 other isolates
   with various multidrug resistance profiles by genotyping PCR and
   assessed their resistance to tetracycline. We identified variants of the
   pAB5S9 and pSN254 plasmids that carry several antibiotic resistance
   genes and that have been previously reported in bacteria other than A.
   salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, which suggests a high level of
   interspecies exchange. Genotyping analyses and the antibiotic resistance
   profiles of the 19 other isolates support the idea that multiple
   versions of pAB5S9 and pSN254 exist in A. salmonicida subsp.
   salmonicida. We also identified variants of the pRAS3 plasmid. The
   present study revealed that A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida harbors a
   wide variety of plasmids, which suggests that this ubiquitous bacterium
   may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The carbonation of chrysotile and nickel mining residues was studied
   under ambient laboratory conditions to assess their response under
   various potential field conditions (pore saturation, watering episodes,
   temperature, CO2 diffusion, and dissolved oxygen) and to a variety of
   natural and chemical enhancers (sulfide minerals, brucite, chelate
   ligands, ionic liquids, and carbonic anhydrase enzyme). Watering of the
   residues to achieve partial pore saturation was critical for optimal
   ambient CO2 sequestration by mediating magnesium leaching and CO2
   absorption, and by favouring diffusion of gaseous CO2 in pores deep
   inside the residues. Increasing temperature stimulated CO2 uptake
   whereas dissolved oxygen triggered undesirable oxidative precipitation
   and passivation by iron (III) hydroxides. The latter effect was
   attenuated through addition of depassivation chelates, which impeded
   iron precipitation and enhanced carbonation under ambient conditions.
   Pyrite and pyrrhotite, as natural acid generators, failed to improve
   ambient carbonation by fostering iron passivation to the detriment of
   mining residue dissolution whereas the use of carbonic anhydrase
   inhibited formation of magnesium carbonates. Ionic liquids were found
   suitable for magnesium extraction under alkaline conditions but
   inefficient for inducing carbonate precipitation. The lower rate of
   carbonation with hydrophobic ionic liquid-water mixtures was ascribed to
   a slower gas-liquid mass transfer of CO2 to the liquid, which primarily
   prompted a loss of gas-liquid interfacial area due to viscous effects
   and bubble coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics on networks is considered from the perspective of Markov
   stochastic processes. We partially describe the state of the system
   through network motifs and infer any missing data using the available
   information. This versatile approach is especially well adapted for
   modelling spreading processes and/or population dynamics. In particular,
   the generality of our framework and the fact that its assumptions are
   explicitly stated suggests that it could be used as a common ground for
   comparing existing epidemics models too complex for direct comparison,
   such as agent-based computer simulations. We provide many examples for
   the special cases of susceptible-infectious-susceptible and
   susceptible-infectious-removed dynamics (e.g., epidemics propagation)
   and we observe multiple situations where accurate results may be
   obtained at low computational cost. Our perspective reveals a subtle
   balance between the complex requirements of a realistic model and its
   basic assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical method for the generation of the microstructure of a binary
   aluminum copper alloy is presented. This method is based on the repeated
   addition of some basic grain shapes into a representative volume
   element. Depending of the orientation of adjacent grains, different type
   of grain boundaries can be formed. The primary and secondary phases are
   distinguishable in our model and have distinct properties, reflecting
   the heterogeneous nature of the microstructure. The digital
   microstructure was then transformed into a finite element model. Using
   the finite element software ABAQUS, the stress distribution inside our
   heterogeneous material model has been studied and its mechanical
   properties have been found. That also makes possible to study and to
   visualize the cracks generated during the loading of the material where
   the local stress was sufficiently high. As a result of these analyses,
   the elastic modulus of such a heterogeneous domain and the effect of
   crack formation on ductility were evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Porous nanocomposite films based on polypropylene (PP) and titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were prepared by melt extrusion followed by
   uniaxial stretching. The effects of drawing temperature, extension rate,
   stretching ratio and composition of the base films on the final
   properties and microstructure of the stretched films were studied. Water
   vapor permeability (WVP) results showed a significant decrease in
   permeability of the films stretched at temperatures higher than 60
   degrees C. Porosity, pore size and water vapor transmission rate in the
   porous nanocomposite films had a direct relation with nanoparticle
   content, extension rate and stretching ratio. Study of the morphology of
   the stretched films, using SEM, revealed that the pores form due to
   PP/TiO2 interfacial debonding at low stretching ratios. Higher
   stretching ratios cause an enlargement of the pores and the formation of
   a PP fibril structure parallel to the stretching direction.
   Quantification of dye adsorption revealed that the quantity of adsorbed
   dye increased with porosity and surface area of the pores. (c) 2014

   transfer. Based on the results obtained, the addition of 40 wt\% flax

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for the modeling and simulation of a
   pulsed thermography inspection of carbon fiber-reinforced composites. A
   thermal numerical model based on the 3D transient heat conduction
   equation for heterogeneous media is proposed to model the thermal
   response of the composite medium when a thermal pulse is applied to its
   surface. The solution of the model is developed using the finite volume
   method, in which the approximated equations are obtained by performing
   energy balances for each elementary volume. The experimental validation
   of the thermal numerical model consisted of a comparison of the thermal
   decay curves for defective areas obtained through numerical simulation
   and with a pulsed thermography inspection of a laminated composite
   specimen with simulated defects (Teflon inserts). A parametric study was
   carried out in order to analyze the influence of the irradiation power
   density, non-uniform heating and characteristics associated with the
   defects on quantitative variables such as the onset time and thermal
   contrast. Numerical results showed that the variable thermal contrast is
   highly sensitivity to changes in the defect thickness, aspect ratio and
   parameters related to the external stimulation. Furthermore, an increase
   in the detectability of defects especially those with lower aspect
   ratios can be achieved by increasing the irradiation power. (C) 2014

Title = {{Relevance of control theory to design and maintenance problems in
   time-variant reliability: The case of stochastic viability}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{250-260}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to show that time-variant
   reliability and a branch of control theory called stochastic viability
   address similar problems with different points of view, and (2) to
   demonstrate the relevance of concepts and methods from stochastic
   viability in reliability problems. On the one hand, reliability aims at
   evaluating the probability of failure of a system subjected to
   uncertainty and stochasticity. On the other hand, viability aims at
   maintaining a controlled dynamical system within a survival set. When
   the dynamical system is stochastic, this work shows that a viability
   problem belongs to a specific class of design and maintenance problems
   in time-variant reliability. Dynamic programming, which is used for
   solving Markovian stochastic viability problems, then yields the set of
   design states for which there exists a maintenance strategy which
   guarantees reliability with a confidence level beta for a given period
   of time T. Besides, it leads to a straightforward computation of the
   date of the first outcrossing, informing on when the system is most
   likely to fail. We illustrate this approach with a simple example of
   population dynamics, including a case where load increases with time.

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work reports on the properties of high density polyethylene based
   hybrid composites made with two natural fibers: agave and pine. The
   composites were produced by a combination of extrusion and injection
   molding. The effect of hybridization was analyzed via morphological,
   mechanical and water immersion tests for two total fiber contents, 20
   and 30 wt.\%, and different pine-agave fiber ratios (100-0, 80-20,
   60-40, 40-60 and 0-100). Moreover, the effect of coupling agent
   (maleated polyethylene) in the hybrid composite formulation was
   evaluated. The results showed that addition of agave fibers improves
   tensile, flexural and impact strength, while pine fibers decreases water
   uptake. As expected, the addition of a coupling agent improves
   substantially the quality of the polymer-fiber interface as well as the
   mechanical properties, but this effect was more important for composites
   produced with higher agave fibers content due to the their chemical
   composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{354-366}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a procedure for computing time-dependent ground
   response functions (G) of vertical ground exchangers in the presence of
   groundwater flow. The comprehensive methodology can account for
   multi-borehole fields and allows predicting accurately heat transfer
   over a large range of design parameters, ground properties and time
   scales. It combines two analytical models: infinite cylinder source
   (ICS) and moving finite line source (MFLS). A new mathematical
   development is introduced to enhance the computational efficiency of the
   G-functions with the MFLS model. The precision of the models as a
   function of time is verified with finite-element modeling. An
   application-oriented procedure allows expressing the G-functions as a
   function of all the variables by combining graphical tools and
   correlation fittings. This procedure is developed specifically to be
   easily implemented in borehole design methods. The G-functions obtained
   by this method are in good agreement (R-2 = 0.9934) with the analytical
   solution developed, over the prescribed range of variables. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the application of the Ensemble Kalman Filter
   (EnKF) for streamflow assimilation within an ensemble prediction system
   designed for short-term hydrological forecasting at the outlet of the au
   Saumon watershed. The EnKF updates three state variables of a
   distributed hydrological model (soil moisture in the intermediate layer,
   soil moisture in the deep layer, and land routing) to improve the
   initial conditions of the forecasts. A systematic method for the
   identification of the perturbation factors (ensemble generation) and for
   the selection of the ensemble size is discussed. EnKF results show a
   substantial improvement in performance and reliability over the
   open-loop estimates. Manual assimilation was also assessed and led to a
   performance similar to the EnKF; however, the EnKF forecasts are
   substantially more reliable. While an ensemble size of 1000 members was
   required to fully sample the hydrological and meteorological
   uncertainty, similar results are obtained in terms of skill when
   limiting the ensemble size to 50. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{362-369}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that the velocity of particles exiting the nozzle plays
   a central role on rebound and consolidation in the shotcrete placement
   process. With this in mind, the impact velocity distribution was
   investigated using a high-speed imaging system with a full-scale
   shotcrete spray generated using two dry-mix nozzles and one wet-mix
   nozzle. The incident velocity was found to be at its maximum in the
   central region around the spray axis and decrease toward the peripheral
   regions following a Gaussian-type function. Further analysis using
   normalized parameters shows that these velocity profiles, which were
   obtained experimentally, follow a similar function that can be used to
   compare the effect a given nozzle, or equipment, has on impact velocity
   distribution. In light of this work, innovative and unique
   characterization tools are proposed to further support equipment
   optimization and to improve the understanding of the overall shotcrete
   process, and especially rebound. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   studied by means of morphological and mechanical analyses. The results
   show that SEBS-NO2 is less effective than SEBS-NH2, the later displaying
   comparable compatibilizing efficiency to a commercial reactive
   compatibilizer based on maleated polyethylene. Overall,
   compatibilization was found to decrease lignin particle size. Addition
   of SEBS-NH2 varying between 1\% and 10\% improved the tensile strength
   of composites by up to 96\%, elongation at break by up to 64\%, and
   impact strength by up to 48\%. Finally, the crystallinity and density of
   the resulting composites were also studied. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Optical packet switching is the next-generation disruptive technology
   for massive cloud data centers. All-optical routers, supporting
   wavelength parallelism, accelerate the execution of applications and
   facilitate server virtualization. Despite the recent advances in optical
   technologies, the greatest challenge in the realization of optical
   routers is the lack of a mature solution for buffering optical signals.
   Fiber delay lines (FDLs) have been proposed to emulate electronic
   buffering by delaying contending optical packets for a fixed amount of
   time. However, the practical limitation on the number of FDLs in a
   router requires its ports to be run at low utilization, sacrificing a
   significant portion of network capacity. In this paper, we introduce a
   novel modular router architecture based on wavelength-division
   multiplexed (WDM) recirculation buffers as a solution to the problem of
   limited buffering capacity. We propose a load-balancing scheduler to
   maximize throughput. Our mathematical analysis and Monte Carlo
   simulations show that the consolidation of optical buffers in WDM FDLs
   accompanied with internal load balancing leads to a virtually lossless
   router, resilient to data center traffic anomalies. The load balancing
   further minimizes the number of packet recirculations, leading to
   negligible queueing latency. Our design supports physical layer
   scalability and is amenable to large-scale optical integration.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers are developing techniques to mass produce Sphagnum fibers
   (SF) on a sustainable basis since this material has properties that
   could benefit the growing-media industry. The objective of this study
   was to incorporate SF into peat-based substrates to enhance the value of
   brown Sphagnum peat and/or replace perlite in blond peat mixes. Nine
   substrates were prepared by mixing brown Sphagnum peat (BrSP) or sieved
   brown Sphagnum peat (sBrSP) with 0, 15 and 30\% of SF and substituting
   0, 50 and 100\% of the perlite in a 70\% blond Sphagnum peat (BSP) and
   30\% perlite mix with SF. The growth of Pelargonium was unaffected by
   the addition of SF, with the exception of above-ground biomass which was
   15\% lower in the BrSP substrate containing 15\% SF. In the case of
   Petunia, above-ground biomass increased with a 30\% SF addition to
   sBrSP, and below-ground biomass increased with a 30\% SF addition to
   BrSP and sBrSP. Adding SF to peat increased water retention and
   hydraulic conductivity, but either reduced or had no impact on
   air-filled porosity. Removing fine particles from BrSP and adding 30\%
   SF provided promising results, although the effect varied with plant
   species. Moreover, it is clear that SF can be used as a substitute for
   perlite in BSP mixes.}},

Abstract = {{Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease
   caused by plaque building up along the inner walls of coronary arteries
   which narrows the lumen and reduces blood flow. Stenting is the current
   standard procedure to treat the disease by opening the narrowed arteries
   and restoring the blood flow. Stenting has been revolutionary evolved
   from the use of bare metal stents made of corrosion resistant alloys to
   the incorporation of anti-proliferative drugs in the drug eluting
   stents. Despite the advantages and limitation of the current stent
   technology, the permanent presence of stents in the arteries is
   questionable, especially for some applications, including pediatric, in
   presence of collateral arteries, and others. Biodegradable stents,
   designed to support the arterial wall and disappear after its
   remodelling, therefore constitute an interesting choice, possibly
   representing the next revolutionary treatment of CAD. Magnesium, iron,
   zinc and their alloys are among metals have been proposed as
   biodegradable stent materials. These metals are designed to degrade in
   vivo through corrosion process without posing toxicity problems to the
   body and called as biodegradable metals. Stents made of magnesium and
   its alloys have been the most studied, developed and reached clinical
   trials in humans, followed by those made of iron which reached in vivo
   studies in animals. Meanwhile, zinc is just recently proposed with only
   few studies have been reported. This papers presents a focused review on
   the development of biodegradable metals for stents.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification of polymeric materials allows to improve the
   biomaterial surface properties, enabling the development of optimized
   materials that have mechanical and biological responses adapted or
   adaptable to the environment where they will be implanted. Chitosan is
   claimed as a biopolymer with biodegradable, biocompatible and
   antimicrobial properties making it particularly interesting for the
   development and application of new functionalized materials. However,
   its properties and applications strongly depend on its degree of
   deacetylation (DDA) and molecular weight (Mw). In this study, three
   types of chitosan were used and fully characterized according to their
   DDA and Mw by C-13 NMR, FTIR, potentiometric titration and SEC. Then,
   three linking arms were investigated in order to graft these three
   chitosan types on aminated PTFE surfaces: glutaric anhydride,
   poly(ethylene glycol) bis(carboxymethyl) ether and
   poly(ethylene-alt-maleic anhydride). The grafting efficiencies were
   evidenced by XPS, with an increase of chitosan characteristic bands in
   high resolution spectra, and by contact angle measurements, which
   indicated the hydrophilic character of the surfaces. Topographic changes
   after grafting were also observed by SEM with evidences of the grafting
   procedure influence. Results show the potential of conjugating plasma
   treatments with grafting techniques towards the development of optimized
   chitosan-based coatings for a wide range of applications in biomaterials
   and materials for health.}},

Abstract = {{Iron oxides are minerals resistant to chemical alteration and mechanical
   abrasion, and which have ferromagnetic properties and a range of
   chemical compositions. These characteristics are useful as indicator
   minerals in exploration, for example using till in glaciated terrains.
   Iron oxide proportions, grain size, and chemical composition of till
   samples collected near the Sue-Dianne Cu-Au-Ag IOCG deposit in the Great
   Bear magmatic zone (Northwest Territories, Canada) and magmatic Ni-Cu
   deposits in the Thompson Nickel Belt (Manitoba, Canada) show that
   subsamples containing c. 100 grains from the 0.25-1.0 mm grain size
   ferromagnetic fraction yield a representative mineralogical and
   compositional range of oxide grains from a till sample. Subsamples with
   less than 100 grains yield statistically less representative data. The
   1-2 mm grain size fraction typically contains too few iron oxide grains
   and thus using this fraction is not statistically representative.
   The composition of iron oxides from eight till and five bedrock samples
   was determined along transects up-and down-ice of the Cu-Au-Ag
   Sue-Dianne IOCG deposit. At, and immediately down-ice of, the deposit,
   hematite is the principal oxide and shows dominant BIF and IOCG chemical
   signatures in the Ca+Al+Mn v. Ti+V discriminant diagram. Up-ice and
   farther down-ice of the deposit, magnetite and titano-magnetite are the
   dominant oxides and magnetite shows dominant Kiruna and IOCG signatures.
   The composition of iron oxides from six till samples along a north-south
   transect and 11 till samples from a 180 km-long east-west transect,
   along the older and younger directions of ice-flow, respectively, was
   determined in the Thompson Nickel Belt (Manitoba, Canada). The
   proportion of magnetite in till with the signature of Ni-Cu deposits
   increases for at least 1 km south of the Pipe Ni-Cu deposit along the
   direction of the older southward ice flow, whereas the glacial dispersal
   of magnetite with a chemical signature typical of Ni-Cu deposits was
   limited during the younger westerly ice flow.}},

Abstract = {{Recent models that couple three-dimensional subsurface flow with
   two-dimensional overland flow are valuable tools for quantifying complex
   groundwater/stream interactions and for evaluating their influence on
   watershed processes. For the modeler who is used to defining streams as
   a boundary condition, the representation of channels in integrated
   models raises a number of conceptual and technical issues. These models
   are far more sensitive to channel topography than conventional
   groundwater models. On all spatial scales, both the topography of a
   channel and its connection with the floodplain are important. For
   example, the geometry of river banks influences bank storage and
   overbank flooding; the slope of the river is a primary control on the
   behavior of a catchment; and at the finer scale bedform characteristics
   affect hyporheic exchange. Accurate data on streambed topography,
   however, are seldom available, and the spatial resolution of digital
   elevation models is typically too coarse in river environments,
   resulting in unrealistic or undulating streambeds. Modelers therefore
   perform some kind of manual yet often cumbersome correction to the
   available topography. In this context, the paper identifies some common
   pitfalls, and provides guidance to overcome these. Both aspects of
   topographic representation and mesh discretization are addressed.
   Additionally, two tutorials are provided to illustrate: (1) the
   interpolation of channel cross-sectional data and (2) the refinement of
   a mesh along a stream in areas of high topographic variability.}},

Abstract = {{A general physically based method is presented to assess the
   vulnerability of groundwater to external pressures by numerical
   simulation of groundwater flow. The concept of groundwater vulnerability
   assessment considered here is based on the calculation of sensitivity
   coefficients for a user-defined groundwater state for which we propose
   several physically based indicators. Two sensitivity analysis methods
   are presented: the sensitivity equation method and the adjoint operator
   method. We show how careful selection of a method can significantly
   minimize the computational effort. An illustration of the general
   methodology is presented for the Herten aquifer analog (Germany). This
   application to a simple, yet insightful, case demonstrates the potential
   use of this general and physically based vulnerability assessment method
   to complex aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology and thermo-mechanical properties of recycled
   polystyrene-based materials (rPS) reinforced with 5 and 15\% lignin from
   kraft pulping of Eucalyptus nitens were studied. The lignin was modified
   through two esterification processes using either acetic or maleic
   anhydride, and changes in the structure of the esterified lignin
   functional groups were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. The lignin was then incorporated into rPS by melt mixing.
   Torque variation in the process was evaluated, and the values were
   compared to those of neat rPS and virgin PS. The results show a
   plasticizing effect of lignin with a reduction in the torque values. The
   morphology, studied through scanning electron microscopy, shows a
   particle size reduction of acetylated and maleated lignin and a more
   homogeneous dispersion at 5\%. The thermal behavior of the composites,
   studied through differential scanning calorimetry, does not show
   significant changes in the glass-transition temperature of rPS with the
   presence of lignin. The dynamic mechanical analysis shows an increasing
   storage modulus with increasing lignin content. Thermal stability,
   studied through thermogravimetric analysis, improved for composites
   containing 5\% esterified lignin. The flexural modulus also increased
   with lignin addition. These results suggest that the thermal and
   mechanical properties of post-consumer recycled polystyrene can be
   significantly improved with only 5\% esterified lignin.}},

Abstract = {{The use of optimization techniques is well established in forest
   short-term planning and decision-making. Yet, existing techniques may
   pose some limitations for tackling with stochastic factors impacting in
   the execution of forest operations, such as delays, equipment breakdowns
   and other unexpected events. This paper explores the potential of using
   optimization techniques in combination with discrete-event simulation
   (DES) models for planning harvesting and logistics operations
   acknowledging uncertainty. DES models may be useful for assessing the
   performance and identifying bottlenecks associated with the execution of
   the deterministic plans retrieved with optimization techniques, when
   such stochastic events occur. This paper further presents an approach
   for the combination of a heuristic and a DES model developed in SIMIO.
   This approach was used to solve the raw material reception problem
   (RMRP) at a Portuguese pulp mill. This paper concludes with the analysis
   of the performance of deterministic schedules for the wood trucks
   considering uncertainty in their arrival at the mill.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an integrated model for harvesting and logistic
   planning for tactical purposes over several years. The logistic planning
   includes both road upgrading and transportation between harvest areas
   and industries. The former is particularly important when dealing with
   problems when the accessibility of the road network is low due to, for
   example, thawing and heavy rains. The optimization model uses a detailed
   description of harvest areas including their spatial location, volume
   output of different assortment computations and net present value (NPV)
   for each year in the planning horizon. The model also uses a detailed
   description of the road network using the Swedish national road
   database. The model is very large and hard to solve, and hence, we are
   developing a solution approach based on an aggregation technique. An
   important part of the planning process is to select areas for the next 5
   years, for example, and we analyze three different approaches. One
   approach is based on maximizing the NPV of the forest value, that is,
   the value at roadside. The second one is based on minimizing the
   logistic cost, and the third one combines NPV of the forest value at
   roadside and logistic. We analyze differences in a case study with over
   6000 areas from the Swedish forest company Sveaskog. The results show
   that an integrated approach is necessary in order to avoid sub-optimal
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an adaptive modulation scheme for the multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-selective channels is investigated. We
   consider a scenario with precoded block-based transceivers over
   spatially correlated Rayleigh multipath MIMO channels. To eliminate the
   inter-block interference, the zero-padding is used. The receiver is
   equipped with a MIMO minimum-mean-squared-error decision feedback
   equalizer. The precoder aims to force each subchannel to have an
   identical signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To adjust the
   constellation size, the unbiased mean square error at the equalizer
   output is sent back to the transmitter. To simplify our analysis, the
   feedback channel is considered as instantaneous and error free. We first
   derive the probability density function of the overall SINR for flat
   fading and frequency-selective channels. On the basis of the probability
   density function of the upper bound of the SINR, we evaluate the system
   performance. We present accurate closed-form expressions of the average
   spectral efficiency, the average bit error rate and the outage
   probability. The derived expressions are compared with Monte Carlo
   simulation results. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the channel
   spatial correlation. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Early diagenetic silica is distributed unevenly in Phanerozoic
   sponge-spicule-rich carbonate mounds. In Paleozoic mounds, replacive
   silica occurs principally at the microscopic scale, whereas in Mesozoic
   strata, it is frequently present as nodular chert. This paper explores
   the possibility of advective-dispersive loss of dissolved pore-water
   silica for explaining the contrasting styles of silica cycling in
   mounds. Four examples of spicule-rich mounds were transcribed into
   hydrogeological conceptual models: two weakly silicified Paleozoic
   mounds with stromatactis (Silurian, Carboniferous), and two strongly
   silicified Jurassic mounds (one stromatactis mound, one sponge mound).
   Monte-Carlo fluid flow simulations utilized literature-derived ranges of
   effective porosity while hydraulic conductivity of component
   hydrostratigraphic units provided quantitative constraints.
   For the Paleozoic examples, the strata aggrade and prograde, which
   creates shallowing-upward trends. Mesozoic examples aggrade and
   retrograde, resulting in deepening-upward trends, and stratigraphic
   condensation and fluid baffling (interpreted from hardgrounds and black
   shale). For the Silurian and the Jurassic stromatactis-mound models,
   simulations of advective-dispersive silica mass transport were performed
   by applying different compaction-driven fluid fluxes (based on
   stratigraphic data). The Silurian mound displays vertical flushing, but
   high silica concentrations prevail in off-mound and flank deposits. The
   Jurassic case maintains a stratiform-like silica distribution over tens
   of thousands of years. The two other cases (Carboniferous, Jurassic)
   used an identical low fluid flux. The simulations which match field
   observations (silica-depleted mound versus stratiform chert) occur at
   different time scales, realistic for the Jurassic case but unrealistic
   for the Carboniferous case because it lacks the required degree of
   stratigraphic condensation to establish a silica-depleted mound.
   The results suggest that the variation of fluxes of dissolved pore-water
   silica in Phanerozoic spicule-rich mounds is controlled by mass
   accumulation or sediment burial rate. During the Paleozoic, mound
   formation is commonly associated with shallowing-upward trends (high to
   intermediate accumulation rates), whereas Mesozoic mound formation more
   commonly extended into condensed sections with low mass accumulation and
   respective low rates of compaction-driven fluid flow. The Mesozoic
   extension of spicule-rich carbonate mounds into the condensed section
   might be related to an intensification of benthic-pelagic coupling
   established during the Mesozoic marine revolution.}},

Abstract = {{Dry reforming of methane is gaining great interest owing to the fact
   that this process efficiently converts two greenhouse gases (CH4 and
   CO2) into synthesis gas (CO + H-2), which can be further processed into
   liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, a perovskite-derived nanostructured
   Ni/La2O3 material is reported as an efficient and stable catalyst for
   this reaction. High-surface-area LaNiO3 perovskite precursor is first
   synthesized by the method of nanocasting using ordered mesoporous silica
   SBA-15 as a hard template. The resulting nanostructured perovskite was
   found to possess high specific surface area as obtained from the BET
   method (150 m(2) g(-1)). The reduction behavior of the nanocast
   perovskite was monitored by performing the temperature-programmed
   reduction of hydrogen (TPR-H-2). It has been found that the complete
   destruction of perovskite structure occurs below 700 degrees C, leading
   to the formation of highly dispersed Ni-0 in La(2)O3, as observed in the
   XRD pattern of the material after reduction. Similar behavior was
   observed for the LaNiO3 perovskite synthesized using the conventional
   citrate process. However, the specific surface area of the former
   material was found to be much higher than that of the latter (50 m(2)
   g(-1)), which obviously resulted from the mesoporous architecture of the
   nanocast LaNiO3. It was found that the nanostructured Ni/La2O3 obtained
   from the reduction of the nanocast LaNiO3 exhibited high activity for
   the conversion of the reactant gases (CH4 and CO2) compared to the
   catalyst obtained from conventional perovskite, under the reaction
   conditions used in the present study. Particularly, no coke formation
   was observed for the mesoporous catalyst under the present conditions of
   operation, which in turn reflects the enhanced stability of the catalyst
   obtained from the nanocast LaNiO3. The improved performance of the
   nanostructured catalyst is attributed to the accessibility of the active
   sites resulting from the high specific surface area and the confinement
   effect leading to the stabilization of Ni nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriophages are present in every environment that supports bacterial
   growth, including manmade ecological niches. Virulent phages may even
   slow or, in more severe cases, interrupt bioprocesses driven by
   bacteria. Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used bacteria for
   large-scale bioprocesses; however, literature describing phage-host
   interactions in this industrial context is sparse. Here, we describe
   phage MED1 isolated from a failed industrial process. Phage MED1
   (Microviridae family, with a single-stranded DNA {[}ssDNA] genome) is
   highly similar to the archetypal phage phiX174, sharing >95\% identity
   between their genomic sequences. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of
   52 microvirus genomes from public databases revealed three genotypes
   (alpha3, G4, and phiX174). Phage MED1 belongs to the phiX174 group. We
   analyzed the distribution of single nucleotide variants in MED1 and 18
   other phiX174-like genomes and found that there are more missense
   mutations in genes G, B, and E than in the other genes of these genomes.
   Gene G encodes the spike protein, involved in host attachment. The
   evolution of this protein likely results from the selective pressure on
   phages to rapidly adapt to the molecular diversity found at the surface
   of their hosts.}},

Title = {{Dose perturbation due to catheter materials in high-dose-rate
   interstitial Ir-192 brachytherapy}},
Journal = {{BRACHYTHERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{627-631}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Catheters made of either metal or plastic are currently used in
   brachytherapy treatment to insert radiative sources into patients.
   However, the radiation dose perturbations due to catheter attenuation
   are not taken into account in treatment planning. The purpose of this
   work is to quantify the effects of catheter composition on dose
   distribution and study their impacts on the overall treatment with
   high-dose-rate Ir-192 sources.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose perturbations are first studied in a
   simplified case consisting of two parallel catheters. The catheter wall
   is either composed of stainless steel or polyoxymethylene. The
   attenuations are studied as the distance between the two catheters is
   varied from 5 to 30 mm. Dose perturbations resulting from irradiation
   are evaluated with a Monte Carlo GEANT4 dose calculation algorithm. The
   dose differences are further investigated with seven typical
   high-dose-rate prostate treatment plans involving 17 catheters.
   RESULTS: The dose differences compared with water in the simplified case
   reach -4.3 +/- 0.1\% for stainless steel and 1.7 +/- 0.5\% for
   polyoxymethylene at 10 mm above the source when the catheters are
   separated by a distance of 5 mm. Dose perturbations are reduced in real
   treatment plans because of the contributions of the many dwell
   positions. Stainless steel and polyoxymethylene catheters induce on an
   average a dose difference of -1.3 +/- 0.3\% and 0.1 +/- 0.2\%,
   respectively in the target.
   CONCLUSIONS: The dose differences reported in this work do not warrant
   any changes in the clinical procedures. (C) 2014 American Brachytherapy

Abstract = {{There are many instances in the literature of
   nanocellulose-thermoplastic composites, but there are few studies on
   coatings reinforced by cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The overall
   objective of this research was to develop organic
   nanoparticles-reinforced UV-water-based coatings for wood applications
   and to study the effect, mainly on wear properties, of the final
   composite coatings. CNC was mixed in the varnishes to improve the
   mechanical properties of the coatings. One of the key aspects in the
   technology of nanocomposites remains the dispersion of the nanoparticles
   within the matrix as well as its affinity with the matrix. To quantify
   the dispersion, efficient methods of characterization are needed in
   order to reveal the nanosized particles. In this article, a novel
   characterization method based on atomic force microscopy was employed to
   characterize such nanocomposite coatings, by measuring surface
   nanoroughness, which is clearly correlated with quality of dispersion
   and mechanical properties. CNC was modified by either alkyl quaternary
   ammonium bromides or acryloyl chloride. The mechanical properties
   (abrasion and scratch resistances, hardness and adhesion) were analyzed
   and compared to the reference varnish without nanoparticles. The
   modified CNC addition in UV-water-based coatings results in an
   approximately 30-40\% increase in wear resistance (abrasion and
   scratch), without any loss of appearance.}},

   kinematics fully understood, the analysis of the governing equations
   offers essential elements for nozzle optimization and new mix design
   investigations. This paper also addresses the necessity of broadening
   the investigation to the entire spray of particles exiting the nozzle

Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) and
   montmorillonite nanoclay on polymer chain dynamics is investigated
   around the percolation concentration for systems based on ethylene vinyl
   acetate (EVA) copolymer. Then, the results obtained are compared with
   literature data to determine if, regardless of particle characteristics,
   a universal rheological behavior can be detected at percolation. To do
   so, rheological analyses are performed under small amplitude oscillatory
   shear (SAOS), large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), and transient
   shear step. SAOS data showed that, while the dynamics related to the
   Rouse relaxation time (tau (R)) were not significantly influenced, the
   reptation relaxation time (tau (D)) was strongly increased by the
   presence of nanoparticles. In step shear transient tests, the critical
   shear rate for overshoot appearance was decreased due to chain
   confinement, and the formation of particle network strongly increased
   the level of stress overshoot. Particle networks increased significantly
   the nonlinear parameters (I (3)/I (1) and Q (0)) obtained under LAOS and
   quantified by FT-rheology. In all measurements, due to the higher
   surface area associated to its size and density as well as hollow
   structure, CNT showed stronger effects compared to clay. Moreover, while
   the percolation concentration was different for CNT and clay, both
   systems showed similar behavior at percolation: a 0.5 scaling for G'
   indicating a Rouse-dominated behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering appears as a promising option to create new heart
   valve substitutes able to overcome the serious drawbacks encountered
   with mechanical substitutes or tissue valves. The objective of this
   article is to present the construction method of a new entirely
   biological stentless aortic valve using the self-assembly method and
   also a first assessment of its behavior in a bioreactor when exposed to
   a pulsatile flow. A thick tissue was created by stacking several
   fibroblast sheets produced with the self-assembly technique. Different
   sets of custom-made templates were designed to confer to the thick
   tissue a three-dimensional (3D) shape similar to that of a native aortic
   valve. The construction of the valve was divided in two sequential
   steps. The first step was the installation of the thick tissue in a flat
   preshaping template followed by a 4-week maturation period. The second
   step was the actual cylindrical 3D forming of the valve. The microscopic
   tissue structure was assessed using histological cross sections stained
   with Masson's Trichrome and Picrosirius Red. The thick tissue remained
   uniformly populated with cells throughout the construction steps and the
   dense extracellular matrix presented corrugated fibers of collagen. This
   first prototype of tissue-engineered heart valve was installed in a
   bioreactor to assess its capacity to sustain a light pulsatile flow at a
   frequency of 0.5 Hz. Under the light pulsed flow, it was observed that
   the leaflets opened and closed according to the flow variations. This

Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a thermal pretreatment used to improve the
   physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic biomass prior to its
   thermochemical conversion. In this study, aspen wood imbued with a
   hydrophilic ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium
   trifluoromethanesulfonate) was torrefied, and the properties of the
   solid product were compared to those from conventional dry torrefaction.
   The solid products were characterized using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy X (XPS), photoelectron energy loss spectroscopy (ESCALOSS),
   and X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy X (XAES) in order to study
   the biomass surface modifications due to ionic-liquid torrefaction in
   comparison to dry torrefaction. The results obtained show that ionic
   liquids led to lignin degradation while dry torrefaction mostly affected
   the carbon-rich extractives. Lignin degradation was monitored using
   ESCALOSS and XAES techniques, which unveiled reduction in sp(2)
   hybridized carbon forms. Finally, ionic-liquid assisted torrefaction of
   the main biomass components, i.e., lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose,
   treated individually, showed a decrease in their O/C ratio in line with
   improved hydrophobicity and robustness against moisture uptake by the
   torrefied products. The diversity of trends revealed by our surface
   analysis study during the torrefaction of bare or
   ionic-liquid-impregnated wood, especially by means of ESCALOSS and XAES,
   requires the pursuit of research in order to describe more in-depth the
   physicochemical processes involved during torrefaction.

   La torrefaction est un procede de pretraitement servant a ameliorer les
   proprietes physicochimiques de la biomasse lignocellulosique precedant
   sa conversion thermochimique. Dans cette etude, des echantillons de bois
   du type peuplier faux-tremble ont ete torrefies selon deux modes : par
   torrefaction seche conventionnelle et par impregnation avec un liquide
   ionique hydrophile (1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium
   trifluoromethanesulfonate) suivie d'une torrefaction. Les produits
   solides de torrefaction ont ete caracterises au moyen de la
   spectroscopie des photoelectrons X, de la spectroscopie des pertes
   d'energie des photoelectrons (ESCALOSS) et de la spectrometrie des
   electrons Auger induits par rayons X (XAES) afin de determiner les
   modifications chimiques de surface induites par ces deux modes de
   torrefaction. Les resultats ont montre que la torrefaction des
   echantillons de bois dans un liquide ionique contribue a la degradation
   de la lignine alors que la torrefaction seche entraine la suppression
   partielle des extractibles riches en carbone. La degradation de la
   lignine a egalement ete suivie par ESCALOSS et XAES qui ont revele une
   diminution de la contribution de carbones hybrides sp(2). Enfin,
   l'utilisation de liquide ionique pour la torrefaction des principaux
   composants de bois (hemicellulose, cellulose et lignine), pris
   individuellement, a montre qu'il y a une diminution du rapport O/C
   suggerant que les produits solides torrefies dans les liquides ioniques
   sont aptes a developper un caractere hydrophobe et une robustesse contre
   la reprise d'humidite avantageux. La complexite des tendances observees
   exige d'affiner l'utilisation des techniques de surface pour mieux
   cerner l'origine des processus physicochimiques dans la torrefaction de
   la biomasse lignocellulosique.}},

Abstract = {{Blends of maleated polypropylene (MAPP) with high contents of waste
   rubber powder, namely ground tire rubber and waste ethylene propylene
   diene monomer (EPDM) powder, were used as impact modifiers for
   polypropylene (PP) based composites with different reinforcements (hemp,
   talc, and milled glass fiber). Adding reinforcements led to increase in
   modulus (tensile, flexural, and torsion moduli) of PP, while its impact
   strength decreased noticeably. Impact modification of PP-based
   composites was successfully performed via inclusion of MAPP/waste rubber
   compounds, especially compounds containing waste EPDM powder. Inclusion
   of such impact modifiers increased impact strength of composites over
   80\%. The effects of impact modification were more significant for
   hemp-and glass-filled composites compared to composites containing talc.
   However, slight decrease in tensile, flexural, and torsion moduli (up to
   30\%) of the composites was also observed after inclusion of impact
   modifiers. (C) 2014 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{During their development, human B lymphocytes migrate into various
   environments, each presenting important variations in their redox
   balance depending on oxygen availability. The modulation of the cells
   surroundings redox balance leads to the regulation of reactive oxygen
   species produced by the cell. These molecules are involved in the state
   of oxidation of the cytosol and affect many pathways involved in cell
   development, differentiation and protein secretion. B lymphocytes
   cultured in presence of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10 and under CD154
   stimulation, present increases in their intracellular levels of ROS.
   However, when N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, is added, STAT3
   phosphorylation is decreased. In this study, we show that in activated
   human memory B cells, NAC inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation on tyrosine
   705 but not on Serine 727. Moreover, higher concentrations of NAC
   decreased STAT3 synthesis. Two other antioxidants, a-tocopherol and
   Trolox, did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, two kinases
   involved in STAT3 activation, known as JAK2 and JAK3, appeared
   down-regulated in presence of NAC. In parallel, 3 h after antioxidants
   incubation, we have observed a decrease in SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein
   levels, which seems time-related to antioxidant treatment. The decrease
   in the phosphorylation ofJAK2 and JAK3, earlier in the process, could
   explain the downregulation of STAT3 and offer a hypothesis on the
   mechanism of action of NAC antioxidant properties which were confirmed
   by a decrease in the level of S-glutathionylation of proteins. The
   reduced expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 appears directly linked to the
   inhibition of this STAT3-regulated pathway. In summary, NAC appears as a
   potential regulator of the STAT3 pathway. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This article develops a game-theoretical model to deal with the
   protection of facilities, in the context of the capacitated fixed-charge
   location and capacity acquisition problem. A set of investment
   alternatives is available for direct protection of facilities.
   Furthermore, extra-capacity of neighbouring functional facilities can be
   used after attacks to avoid the backlog of demands and backorders. The
   proposed model considers a non-cooperative two-period game between the
   players, and an algorithm is presented to determine the equilibrium
   solution and the optimal defender strategy under capacity constraints. A
   method is developed to evaluate the utilities of the defender and the
   attacker. The benefit of the proposed approach is illustrated using a
   numerical example. The defence strategy of our model is compared to
   other strategies, and the obtained results clearly indicate the
   superiority of our model in finding the best trade-off between direct

   (tension and impact) were carried out to determine the effect of fiber
   and compatibilizer contents. The results showed that compatibilized
   composites have increased stiffness due to enhanced interfacial adhesion

Abstract = {{Electro-activation (EA) of a maple sap/syrup beverage was studied. The
   purpose of the study was to assess the product parameters, such as pH,
   ORP, transmittance and degree Brix, while minimizing energy consumption.
   The experiments were conducted using three different configurations of
   the reactor that differed by the position of the anion (AEM) and cation
   (CEM) exchange membrane relative to the electrodes as well as the nature
   of the electrolyte (NaCl vs. Na2CO3) in the central cell of the reactor.
   The results showed that the type of configuration, the electric current
   and the temperature influenced the parameters of the electro-activated
   beverage. At 23 degrees C, the beverage was acidified to pH 3.89 with a
   Redox potential (ORP) of 417.33 mV. At 55 degrees C and 150 mA, the
   minimum pH of 3.78 and an ORP of 329.67 mV were obtained. The electric
   resistance of the electro-activation reactor (EAR) decreased during
   electro-activation, indicating a gain of energy efficiency corresponding
   to an electric resistance of 266.76 Omega Moreover, the reactor
   configuration and electric current affected the presence or absence of a
   fouling of the ion exchange membrane at the anodic side. The beverages'
   transmittance increased slightly during EA without any effect on the
   degree Brix. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel resonance-based multicoil array structure to
   wirelessly charge or power up apparatus, like smart phones, computer
   mouses, smart animal research systems, or implanted medical devices. The
   proposed array consists of a novel multicoil inductive link, whose
   primary resonator is made of several identical coil elements connected
   in parallel and arranged in an array. Such a structure presents several
   key features compared to previous inductive coil arrays. The proposed
   approach can do the following: 1) deliver power with superior efficiency
   over longer separation distances; 2) naturally track the receiver
   position and localize transmitted power through nearby coil array
   elements without the need for complex control and detection circuitry;
   and 3) accommodate either short-or long-range power transmission
   applications simply by slightly modifying the receiver topology. The
   performance of the proposed structure is verified by measurement
   results. In a three-coil configuration, the prototype provides a power
   transfer efficiency (PTE) of 83.3\% and a power delivered to the load
   (PDL) of 3.87 W for a separation distance below 1 cm, while in a
   four-coil configuration, it provides a PTE of 76\% and a PDL of 115 mW
   for a separation distance of 4 cm.}},

Abstract = {{In enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the stability of polymeric systems in
   harsh reservoir conditions is significant. A proof of concept research
   on the application of supramolecular self-assembly for EOR is presented
   in this paper. The motivation was to acquire new insights on the
   effectiveness of these extended polymolecular assemblies with improved
   salinity and hardness tolerance and viscoelastic properties for EOR. The
   formation of these self-assemblies relies on noncovalent interactions
   that hold them together. The performance of two self-assembly systems
   derived from a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (SAP-HPAM) and
   xanthan gum (SAP-XG) for heavy oil recovery was established and compared
   to the performance of a commercial hydrophobically modified
   polyacrylamide (HMSPAM). The SAP-HPAM produced 20\% higher incremental
   heavy oil recovery than the baseline HPAM; while the SAP-XG does not
   show suitable propagation within the porous media. These experimental
   results provide new helpful insights for the technical and
   cost-effective optimization of these self-assembly compositions for EOR
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Highly stabilized mesoporous core shell-structured CaO-based spheriform
   CO2 sorbents are fabricated, for the first time, by a novel repeated
   impregnation coating process combined with the mesoscopic
   surfactant-templating method. By adopting our established wet-coating
   strategy along with a sol gel process, different mesoporous
   material-shelled sorbents with various shell thicknesses (1-5 mu m) and
   shell compositions (silica/zirconia or pure zirconia) are synthesized.
   Cyclic CO2 capture performance is tested in a thermogravimetric analyzer
   with the core shell pellet sorbents with a similar to 1 mu m mesoporous
   zirconia shell exhibiting an unprecedented CO2 uptake capacity of
   similar to 7.2 moles CO2 per kg decarbonated sorbent and the lowest
   activity loss of only 30.8\% after 20 cycles. This is attributed to the
   unique core shell coating strategy in which the thermally stable Zr
   species prevent the aggregation and overgrowth of CaO crystals and
   sorbent sintering. When comparing the core shell sorbents with
   Si-contained mesoporous shells, zirconia shelled ones exhibit
   significantly more outstanding performance. An attrition study using an
   air-jet apparatus under the standard test method reveals that the
   mesoporous zirconia shelled sorbent exhibits enhanced attrition
   resistance, which is also attributed to the novel core shell design,
   offering protection for the reactive core.}},

   equipment such as hydrocyclones or hydraulic classifiers a drop of
   recovery in the region of coarse particles is observed for spirals. This
   decrease of recovery of coarse particles is observed for the valuable

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{Data reconciliation is widely applied in mineral and metal processing
   plants to improve information quality. Imprecision, unreliability and
   incompleteness of measurements are common problems motivating the
   implementation of the technique. Current practices rely on mass and
   energy conservation constraints to estimate the underlying steady-state
   values of process variables. Typically, the Gaussian context is assumed
   and a Maximum-Likelihood estimator is selected. The performance of such
   an estimator depends on the covariance matrices used to characterize
   model and measurement uncertainties. In practice, determining these
   covariance matrices is a challenging task that is often overlooked.
   Using inappropriate uncertainty models, based on simplistic or improper
   hypotheses, can lead to unexpected underperformances. The objective of
   the paper is to illustrate the impact of correctly selecting uncertainty
   covariance matrices for steady-state data reconciliation. Different
   case-studies involving a combustion chamber, a hydrocyclone, a flotation
   circuit, and a separation unit are used for investigating the
   sensitivity of the algorithm to the structure of covariance matrices. An
   example based on Monte-Carlo simulations is presented to assess the
   importance of assigning right values to variance terms. Simulation
   results show that the adjustment of uncertainty covariance matrices has
   a significant influence on the precision of estimates and reveal that
   some common tuning practices can have detrimental effects. (C) 2014

Number = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have emerged as promising
   biomaterials for drug delivery and cell tracking applications, for which
   MRI is the medical imaging modality of choice. In this contribution, MRI
   contrast agents (DTPA-Gd) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are grafted
   selectively at the surface of MSNs, in order to achieve optimal
   relaxometric and drug loading performances. In fact, DTPA and PEG
   grafting procedures reported until now, have resulted in significant
   pore obstruction, which is detrimental to the drug delivery function of
   MSNs. This usually induces a dramatic decrease in surface area and pore
   volume, thus limiting drug loading capacity. Therefore, these molecules
   must be selectively grafted at the outer surface of MSNs. In this study,
   3D pore network MSNs (MCM-48-type) are synthesized and functionalized
   with a straightforward and efficient grafting procedure in which DTPA
   and PEG are selectively grafted at the outer surface of MSNs. No pore
   blocking is observed, and more than 90\% of surface area, pore volume
   and pore diameter are retained. The thus-treated particles are
   colloidally stable in SBF and cell culture media, they are not cytotoxic
   and they have high drug loading capacity. Upon labeling with Gd, the
   nanoparticle suspensions have strong relaxometric properties (r(2)/r(1)
   = 1.47, r(1) = 23.97 mM(-1) s(-1)), which confers a remarkable positive
   contrast enhancement potential to the compound. The particles could
   serve as efficient drug carriers, as demonstrated with a model of
   daunorubicin submitted to physiological conditions. The selective
   nanoparticle surface grafting procedures described in the present

   stability silica-based vectors with high drug loading capacity, which
   could provide novel theranostic nanocompounds.}},

Title = {{The use of tetrahedral mesh geometries in Monte Carlo simulation of

Abstract = {{Accounting for brachytherapy applicator attenuation is part of the
   recommendations from the recent report of AAPM Task Group 186. To do so,
   model based dose calculation algorithms require accurate modelling of
   the applicator geometry. This can be non-trivial in the case of
   irregularly shaped applicators such as the Fletcher Williamson
   gynaecological applicator or balloon applicators with possibly irregular
   shapes employed in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)
   performed using electronic brachytherapy sources (EBS). While many of
   these applicators can be modelled using constructive solid geometry
   (CSG), the latter may be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively,
   these complex geometries can be modelled using tessellated geometries
   such as tetrahedral meshes (mesh geometries (MG)). Recent versions of
   Monte Carlo (MC) codes Geant4 and MCNP6 allow for the use of MG. The
   goal of this work was to model a series of applicators relevant to
   brachytherapy using MG. Applicators designed for Ir-192 sources and 50
   kV EBS were studied; a shielded vaginal applicator, a shielded Fletcher
   Williamson applicator and an APBI balloon applicator.
   All applicators were modelled in Geant4 and MCNP6 using MG and CSG for
   dose calculations. CSG derived dose distributions were considered as
   reference and used to validate MG models by comparing dose distribution
   ratios.
   In general agreement within 1\% for the dose calculations was observed
   for all applicators between MG and CSG and between codes when
   considering volumes inside the 25\% isodose surface. When compared to
   CSG, MG required longer computation times by a factor of at least 2 for
   MC simulations using the same code. MCNP6 calculation times were more
   than ten times shorter than Geant4 in some cases.
   In conclusion we presented methods allowing for high fidelity modelling
   with results equivalent to CSG. To the best of our knowledge MG offers
   the most accurate representation of an irregular APBI balloon
   applicator.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{99}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Host immunity and demographics (the recruitment of susceptibles via
   birthrate) have been demonstrated to be a key determinant of the
   periodicity of measles, pertussis and dengue epidemics. However, not all
   epidemic cycles are from pathogens inducing sterilizing immunity or are
   driven by demographics. Many sexually transmitted infections are driven
   by sexual behaviour. We present a mathematical model of disease
   transmission where individuals can disconnect and reconnect depending on
   the infectious status of their contacts. We fit the model to historic
   syphilis (Treponema pallidum) and gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)
   incidence in the USA and explore potential intervention strategies
   against syphilis. We find that cycles in syphilis incidence can be
   driven solely by changing sexual behaviour in structured populations.
   Our model also explains the lack of similar cycles in gonorrhea
   incidence even if the two infections share the same propagation
   pathways. Our model similarly illustrates how sudden epidemic outbreaks
   can occur on time scales smaller than the characteristic demographic
   time scale of the population and that weaker infections can lead to more
   violent outbreaks. Behaviour also appears to be critical for control
   strategies as we found a bigger sensitivity to behavioural interventions
   than antibiotic treatment. Thus, behavioural interventions may play a
   larger role than previously thought, especially in the face of
   antibiotic resistance and low intervention efficacies.}},

Abstract = {{Hard anodising is used to produce relatively thick and adherent coatings
   in order to improve the hardness, abrasion and corrosion resistance of
   aluminium components. In typical industrial conditions, the local
   variation of anodic oxide film thickness is often significant and it
   affects the dimensional tolerances and reliability of coating thickness.
   Electrolyte stirring is a simple and effective way to improve the
   uniformity of the oxide layer thickness. However, very little practical
   information is available in the literature to guide industry in this
   regard. In this work, extruded A6061-T6 specimens were anodised in
   industrial conditions. To reduce the thickness variability of the
   coating, three methods of electrolyte stirring were studied and
   compared. Air bubble stirring showed the best coating thickness
   uniformity and improved control over anodising parameters. However it
   did not reduce the variability due to metal forming texture.}},

Abstract = {{Size and magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in fluids
   allow special remote control of fluid flow using appropriate externally
   applied magnetic fields, especially when submicronic mixing is critical,
   inter alia, for catalytic reactions, separation and drug delivery. This
   work explores MNPs as nanoscale devices to control mixing at microscale
   by submitting the system of interest to a rotating magnetic field (RMF).
   Magnetic nanoparticles are harnessed by RMF and converted into
   nanostirrers thereby generating MNP-pinned localized agitation in the
   liquid phase. Using this technique, self-diffusion coefficient of water
   in a static diffusion cell was intensified up to 200 folds. Also, axial
   dispersion of capillary Poiseuille flows under RMF underwent a reduction
   prompted by MNP-mediated intensification of lateral mixing relative to
   that in absence of magnetic field. Finally a multiphase flow case
   concerned gas-liquid mass transfer from oxygen Taylor bubbles to the
   liquid in capillaries where dilute MNP solutions led to measurable
   enhancement of ha under RMF. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The stability to thermal and oxidative degradation of five single amine

   mixed aqueous solution (AHPD + Pz), in the absence and the presence of

   results showed that the presence of O-2 and CO2 influenced significantly
   the degree of thermal degradation. The sterically hindered alkanolamines
   investigated (AMP and AHPD) were found more resistant to thermal
   degradation than conventional (unhindered) amines. However, in the
   absence of CO2, the oxygen degraded them more significantly. The
   addition of Pz to AHPD solution reduces the AHPD oxidative degradation.
   It was concluded that AHPD + Pz amine aqueous blend could be a
   potentially interesting absorbent to replace MEA for industrial CO2
   capture applications, especially using membrane contactors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Sunflower meal protein isolate (SMPI) is a promising food additive in
   different matrices. However, the uses of SMPI are limited because of the
   presence of antinutritional compounds like polyphenolic substances.
   Chlorogenic and caffeic acids are the dominants polyphenolics in the
   SMPI. These substances cause significant changes of the colour of the
   meal, proteins and food matrices during their extraction and use as food
   additives. Moreover, these substances lower the nutritional value of the
   end product due to their interaction with some amino acids such as
   lysine and methionine. Thus, the removal of these substances is
   important to enable the use of the SMPI and meal in general in a greater
   extent in food applications and replacing more expensive protein sources
   such as soy proteins. The aim of this work was to study the production
   of functional bread by supplementing wheat flour with sunflower meal
   protein isolate (SMPI). SMPI with low content of chlorogenic and caffeic
   acid was usefully produced following alkaline extraction and
   purification with succinic acid. Purified SMPI showed well balanced
   amino acid profile and was characterized by high water and fat
   absorption capacities. It was incorporated to dough formula at 8-12 \%
   of the total wheat flour. The results showed that production of bread
   supplemented with SMPI was technologically feasible. The supplemented
   bread had high mass volume and nutritional quality compared to the
   control bread. The optimal SMPI to incorporate into dough formula
   without significant alteration of the final bread colour was established
   at 10 \%. This study will be helpful to find economic ways to enhance
   the nutritional quality of wheat bread and to improve the profitability
   of sunflower meal residue.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the effect of seed orientation in postplanning dosimetry of
   low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Radioactive seed orientations are usually ignored in clinical
   brachytherapy dosimetry for prostate implants. Associated with the
   anisotropic dose distribution of seeds, these orientations could cause
   dose differences between the planning configurations and the clinical
   postplanning dosimetry. This study will quantify the impact of seed
   orientation on the dosimetry.
   Methods: 3D seed positions and theta and phi polar angles were obtained
   using five independent fluoroscopic images for 287 patients. Five dose
   calculation methods are compared: TG43-1D (1), TG43-2D parallel to
   implant axis (2) and with orientations (3), Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
   parallel (4), and MC simulations with orientations (5). GEANT4 v4.9.6 MC
   simulations were made in 1 mm(3) voxelized geometries based on the
   DICOM-RT information. Materials were assigned using thresholds based on
   the HU number, as recommended in TG186 reports. Seed voxels are
   overridden with prostatic materials and the layered mass geometry
   {[}Enger et al., Phys. Med. Biol. 57(19), 6269-6277 (2012)] allows
   subsequent placement of the source geometry. 500 million histories were
   used per patient. 3D dose and DVHs for each structure were calculated.
   Results: The various seed orientations do not result in statistically
   significant differences on the dose metrics for the clinical target
   volume (CTV) or the urethra, based on the Student t-test p-value.
   Difference as low as -0.238\% and 0.059\% has been seen on the CTV D90,
   respectively, for the MC and the TG43. The difference between parallel
   and oriented calculations for the organs at risk (OARs) can differ by
   2\% on average.
   Conclusions: Based on the results from this study, seed orientations
   have no significant impact of CTV and urethra dose metrics but can
   affect OARs that are external to the CTV. (C) 2014 American Association

Title = {{Inner structure of anchor ice and ice dams in steep channels}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT-NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic ice growth (composed primarily of anchor ice and ice dams) is
   the dominant process in steep (slope > 0.3\%) channels during winter.
   The ice growth (in all its manifestations) regulates water levels, flow
   resistance, bathymetry, flow rate, water quality and fish habitat
   Empirical models of the processes are available but in order to develop
   more physically-based models, more knowledge about the nature of ice in
   these channels is required. This paper presents original data from two
   channels of the Montmorency River watershed known for their intense
   anchor ice and ice dam development activity. The data include time-lapse
   photographs, underwater photographs, water level records, and water and
   air temperatures collected during winter 2012-2013. Moreover, anchor ice
   and ice dam samples were analyzed with thin sections and using computed
   axial tomography (CAT) scan technology. This study aims at understanding
   the development processes of both anchor ice accumulations and ice dams
   by investigating their crystal types and sizes, their growth mechanisms,
   patterns, and orientation, and their porosity.
   Two main types of ice crystals were observed: columnar ice crystals and
   fixed-frazil ice crystals. Relatively large columnar ice crystals grew
   upwards (away from the bed) perpendicularly to the local flow surface
   and were only observed in ice dam samples. Fixed-frazil crystals
   originated from the deposition and/or interception of drifting frazil
   particles that became ``fixed{''} to the bed and to existing ice
   accumulations. The data suggest that in-situ growth of fixed-frazil ice
   crystals was the dominant process (accounted for the most ice
   development) for both anchor ice and ice dams. Fixed-frazil ice consists
   of a bonded mass of interlocking plate shaped crystals demonstrating a
   preference to be perpendicular to the bed and water surfaces. The mass
   displays some variability in porosity (mean value 41\%). When analyzed
   using CAT scan slices, the interlocking plates appear as a tree-like or
   dendritic structure. The average size of resulting crystal segments and
   the maximum size of individual whole crystals within fixed-frazil ice
   structures were significantly more important for ice dam samples than
   for anchor ice samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates thermography and shearography couplings, using
   feasibility trials and numerical simulations, for non-destructive
   control evaluations of bonding of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer plates
   glued over concrete structures. Those are well-known methods in
   non-destructive testing (NDT) applied to civil engineering, but in this
   context, they are seen as paired because they use the same excitation
   source: square-pulsed optical heating. Furthermore, because both methods
   are based on different properties, the detection of defects is optimised
   regardless of its nature or type. The combination of the methods allows
   the measurement of a thermal as well as a thermomechanical response from
   the structure at the same time. A quick review of those methods and
   their respective advantage and inconvenient is mentioned. An in-depth
   study of the interpretation of the thermal and mechanical responses is
   carried out in relation to the thermal excitation. Then, the thought
   process behind the conception of the finite element model and its
   limitation is discussed. The experimental setup, used for feasibility
   testing, is described as well as a thorough analysis of the experimental
   and simulated results. Finally, the pairing of both methods is discussed
   regarding the evaluation of the bond quality, as well as the similitude
   of the sample and its numerical model.}},

   A critical review}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{188-201}},

Abstract = {{This paper makes a critical review of the available techniques for
   analysing, completing and generating influent data for WWTP modelling.
   The solutions found in literature are classified according to three
   different situations from engineering practice: 1) completing an
   incomplete dataset about the quantity and quality of the influent
   wastewater; 2) translating the common quality measurements (COD, TSS,
   TKN, etc.) into the ASM family components (fractionation problem); 3)
   characterising the uncertainty in the quality and quantity of the
   influent wastewater. In the first case (Situation 1), generators based
   on Fourier models are very useful to describe the daily and weekly
   wastewater patterns. Another specially promising solution is related to
   the construction of phenomenological models that provide wastewater
   influent profiles in accordance with data about the catchment properties
   (number of inhabitant equivalents, sewer network, type of industries,
   rainfall and temperature profiles, etc.). This option has the advantage
   that using hypothetical catchment characteristics (other climate, sewer
   network, etc.) the modeller is able to extrapolate and generate influent
   data for WWTPs in other scenarios. With a much lower modelling effort,
   the generators based on the use of databases can provide realistic
   influent profiles based on the patterns observed. With regard to the
   influent characterisation (Situation 2), the WWTP modelling protocols
   summarise well established methodologies to translate the common
   measurements (COD, TSS, TKN, etc.) into ASM family components. Finally,
   some statistical models based on autoregressive functions are suitable
   to represent the uncertainty involved in influent data profiles
   (Situation 3). However, more fundamental research should be carried out
   to model the uncertainty involved in the underlying mechanisms related
   to the wastewater generation (rainfall profiles, household and
   industries pollutant discharges, assumed daily and weekly patterns,
   etc.). (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the singularity-free zones in the workspace of
   general 6-U(P) under barS parallel mechanisms. The emphasis is placed on
   obtaining the maximum volume ellipsoid or sphere in the singularity-free
   subregions, while taking into account the actuator strokes. The proposed
   algorithms are based on the convex optimization and have several
   advantages over the existing methods such as Lagrange multipliers
   approach, which makes it appropriate for other applicable optimization
   problems. For determining the maximal singularity-free zones, in order
   to find the maximum volume ellipsoid, a judicious iterative procedure,
   referred to as Improved Lower Bound Semidefinite Programming, is
   proposed. Additionally, different reformulations of the problem are
   proposed in order to solve other interesting problems in the robotics
   community such as obtaining the maximum volume sphere. Furthermore, an
   approach based on the sum of squares method is proposed to solve this
   problem for a general Gough-Stewart platform with any arbitrary
   geometric parameter which is conducive to a polynomial optimization
   problem. The computational time for the proposed algorithms are
   considerably low compared to other methods proposed in the literature
   for obtaining the singularity-free workspace which opens an avenue to
   use them as systematic algorithms for on-line purposes. (C) 2014

Title = {{Magnetite composition in Ni-Cu-PGE deposits worldwide: application to
   mineral exploration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{64-81}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of trace elements in magnetite is determined primarily
   by the geological environment at the time of its formation, which makes
   magnetite a useful indicator mineral in the exploration of ore deposits.
   Magnetite is a common accessory mineral in magmatic Ni-Cu-Platinum-Group
   Element (PGE) sulfide deposits forming primary grains in massive sulfide
   ore and/or secondary grains during alteration of sulfide ore and host
   rock. We report magnetite composition from massive and disseminated
   sulfide samples (n=94), representative of 13 major Ni-Cu-PGE deposits,
   worldwide, and from a range of geological environments and formation
   ages (Archean to Permo-Triassic). The samples are divided into 6
   different types according to the composition of the parental host magma:
   (1) komatiite, (2) ferropicrite, (3) picrite-tholeiite, (4)
   anorthosite-troctolite, (5) flood basalt and (6) impact melt. The minor
   and trace element composition of magnetite was measured by electron
   probe micro-analysis and a subset of samples (n = 61) by laser
   ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.
   The composition of all primary magnetite, crystallized from an
   immiscible sulfide liquid, plots on a trend in Ti vs. Cr and V vs. Cr.
   However, primary magnetite trace element content is controlled by
   element partitioning during sulfide liquid differentiation, from
   early-forming Fe-rich monosulfide solid solution (MSS) to Cu-rich
   intermediate solid solution (ISS). The concentration of most lithophile
   elements (Cr, Ti, V, Al, Sc, Nb, Ga, Ta, Hf and Zr) is highest in the
   early-forming magnetite, which crystallized with Fe-rich MSS. The
   fractionated Cu-rich liquid was depleted in lithophile elements so that
   late-forming magnetite, which crystallized with the Cu-rich ISS, has a
   low concentration of these elements. Compatible chalcophile elements
   partitioning into magnetite depends largely on the co-crystallizing
   sulfide mineral. Elements such as Ni partition preferentially in Fe-rich
   sulfide minerals (pyrrhotite or pentlandite) such that coprecipitated
   magnetite is depleted in chalcophile elements compatible with the
   sulfides. In contrast, magnetite co-crystallized with Cu-rich ISS is
   enriched in Ni because Ni is not compatible with the co-crystallizing Cu
   sulfides. Magnetite composition is also dependent on parental magma
   composition. Magnetite in massive sulfides from ultramafic parental
   magmas is most similar in compositions to primitive magnetite from
   Fe-rich sulfides in fractionated intermediate to mafic hosted orebodies.
   Two types of secondary magnetite are distinguished from the
   komatiite-hosted Thompson Ni-deposit (Manitoba, Canada): (1) magnetite
   formed by replacement of pyrrhotite and (2) magnetite formed during the
   serpentinization of the ultramafichost rocks. Secondarymagnetite is
   depleted inmost trace elements (Ni, Mn, V, Ti, V, Al, Cr), with the
   exception of Si and Mg, which are enriched.
   To be useful as a tool for mineral exploration, primary and secondary
   magnetite should not have the same minor and trace element composition.
   Primary magnetite from all 13 major Ni-Cu deposits plot in the field for
   Ni-Cu sulfide deposits in the Ni + Cr vs. Si + Mg discrimination
   diagram. Secondary magnetite plot outside of the field for Ni-Cu
   deposits. Therefore using this diagram, we can discriminate between
   primary and secondary magnetite using the low Ni + Cr content of
   secondary magnetite. Magnetite is resistant to surficial weathering and
   destruction during mechanical transport, such that it is a useful
   indicator mineral in exploration that can be used to detect eroded
   Ni-Cu-PGE deposits in surficial sediments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Alley cropping is an agroforestry practice whereby crops are grown
   between hedgerows of trees planted at wide spacings. The local climate
   and the physiological adaptation mechanisms of the trees are key factors
   in the growth and survival of the trees and intercrops, because they
   directly affect the soil moisture distribution. In order to evaluate the
   long-term hydrological impact of climate change in an alley cropping
   system in eastern Canada, we developed a framework that combines local
   soil moisture data with local projections of climate change and a model
   of soil water movement, root uptake and evapotranspiration. Forty-five
   frequency domain reflectometers (FDR) along a transect perpendicular to
   the tree rows generated a two-year dataset that we used for the
   parameterization and evaluation of the model. An impact study with
   simulations based on local projections of three global and one regional
   climate simulation suggest that the soil becomes drier overall in the
   period between 2041 and 2070, while the number of critically wet periods
   with a length of one day increases slightly with respect to the
   reference period between 1967 and 1996. Hydrological simulations based
   on a fourth climate scenario however point toward wetter conditions. In
   all cases the changes are minor. Although our simulations indicate that
   the experimental alley cropping system will possibly suffer drier
   conditions in response to higher temperatures and increased evaporative
   demand, these conditions are not necessarily critical for vegetation
   during the snow-free season. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Replicating the microbial community and water quality performance of
   full-scale slow sand filters in laboratory-scale filters}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{141-151}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Previous laboratory-scale studies to characterise the functional
   microbial ecology of slow sand filters have suffered from methodological
   limitations that could compromise their relevance to full-scale systems.
   Therefore, to ascertain if laboratory-scale slow sand filters (L-SSFs)
   can replicate the microbial community and water quality production of
   industrially operated full-scale slow sand filters (I-SSFs), eight
   cylindrical L-SSFs were constructed and were used to treat water from
   the same source as the I-SSFs. Half of the L-SSFs sand beds were
   composed of sterilized sand (sterile) from the industrial filters and
   the other half with sand taken directly from the same industrial filter
   (non-sterile). All filters were operated for 10 weeks, with the
   microbial community and water quality parameters sampled and analysed
   weekly. To characterize the microbial community phyla-specific qPCR
   assays and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were used in
   conjunction with an array of statistical techniques. The results
   demonstrate that it is possible to mimic both the water quality
   production and the structure of the microbial community of full-scale
   filters in the laboratory - at all levels of taxonomic classification
   except OTU - thus allowing comparison of LSSF experiments with
   full-scale units. Further, it was found that the sand type composing the
   filter bed (non-sterile or sterile), the water quality produced, the age
   of the filters and the depth of sand samples were all significant
   factors in explaining observed differences in the structure of the
   microbial consortia. This study is the first to the authors knowledge
   that demonstrates that scaled-down slow sand filters can accurately
   reproduce the water quality and microbial consortia of full-scale slow
   sand filters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   introducing backfill as amultiphase porous material for which the
   effects of physical parameters, such as degree of saturation, porosity,
   and thermal conductivity of solid particles, are studied. The results of
   this research help to better understand the thermal interaction of

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) were initially developed for
   large-scale biomass production. Today, several machinery manufacturers
   offer large woody crop headers adapted to self-propelled forage
   harvesters (SPFH) with reported wet matter (WM) capacities of 40 to 120
   t WM/h, depending on engine power (from 300 to over 600 kW). Over the
   last 20 years, SR WC have often been developed on small plantations, 1
   to 5 ha, because of market uncertainty for biomass value and small-scale
   opportunities such as phytoremediation, riparian buffers, wastewater
   treatment, and modest use of cultivated biomass for heating energy in
   rural areas. Few machines are available to harvest SR WC efficiently, in
   the form of wood chips, over small areas. This article presents the
   development and evaluation of a novel ``willow{''} header adapted to a
   commercial medium-size pull-type forage harvester (PTFH, Dion model F41,
   Boisbriand, QC, Canada). The prototype header includes two 0.6 m
   diameter saws, two vertical paddle axes, and a central pallet conveyor
   to rotate and push cut stems to the forage harvester feed rolls. In
   field trials, the prototype processed SRWC at an average rate of 30 t
   WM/h (continuously, excluding time loss) when operated with a 224 kW
   tractor, in high yielding willow (17 to 42 t DM/ha), including more than
   80,000 stems/ha and average diameters from 17 to 30 mm at the point of
   cut (10 cm above the ground or D10). The prototype also successfully
   harvested larger diameter poplar (D10 averaged 53 mm; maximum of 97 mm)
   at a slower rate (average of 15 t WM/h), possibly also because of a low
   yield (6,800 stems/ha, 8 I DM/ha). When using a smaller tractor (118
   kW), power was a limiting factor and average harvest rate was lower (I I
   t WM/h). Components and assembly costs for the header represented about
   \$30,000 (excluding spare and oversized parts); retail cost of a future
   commercial header could range between \$60,000 and \$80,000, in addition
   to the PTFH (about \$35,000) and tractor. The availability of such a
   header could stimulate the development of SR WC and biomass production
   on numerous fields currently abandoned or of limited value to
   agricultural production.}},

Abstract = {{Strategies to enhance the expansion of umbilical cord blood
   hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are crucial to enable
   their widespread application to adults and to overcome important
   limitations, such as delayed engraftment. Osteoblasts regulate HSPCs
   under steady-state and also under stress conditions, when HSPCs undergo
   numerous cycles of expansion. We hypothesized that osteoblasts could
   provide better stimulation for the expansion of multipotent HSPCs and
   subsequent hematopoietic recovery than mesenchymal stromal cells. Hence,
   we assessed the growth and engraftment modulatory activities of
   mesenchymal stromal cell-derived osteoblasts (M-OSTs) on hematopoietic
   progenitors. Mesenchymal stromal cells and M-OSTs favored the
   maintenance of CD34(+) cells. The expansion of cord blood CD34(+) cells
   and myeloid progenitors was highest in cultures supplemented with
   unfiltered M-OST-conditioned medium (M-OST CM). In addition, increased
   expression of cell surface receptors important for the homing of
   progenitors to the bone marrow, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 and
   lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, was observed in CM-based
   cultures. Additionally, M-OST CM positively modulated the engraftment
   properties of expanded progenitors. Most notably, although human
   platelet levels remained steady in the first 2 weeks in mice
   transplanted with HSPCs expanded in standard medium, levels in mice
   transplanted with M-OST CM HSPCs rose continuously. Consistent with
   this, short-term human progenitor reconstitution was consistently
   greater in M-OST recipients. Finally, cytokine array-based profiling
   revealed increases in insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2,
   chemokines, and myeloid stimulating cytokines in M-OST CM. In
   conclusion, this study suggests that M-OSTs represent a new
   underappreciated source of feeder cells for the expansion of HSPCs with
   enhanced thrombopoietic activity. (C) 2014 ISEH - International Society

Abstract = {{The use of oscillating foils to develop turbines to extract energy from
   an oncoming flow has recently been found competitive with rotor blade
   designs. Moreover, the rectangular extraction plane of the
   oscillating-foil turbine presents clear advantages in the field of
   hydrokinetic turbines. The present study, based on two-dimensional
   unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes numerical simulations, focuses
   on the range of operating parameters maximizing power extracted by a
   single oscillating foil for small-scale application Reynolds number. The
   power-extraction efficiency is mapped in parametric spaces associated
   with different motion amplitudes. Efficiency maxima reach about 43\% in
   all the parametric spaces considered, but for different values of
   pitching amplitude and frequency. It is found that the best parametric
   zones in all cases exhibit similar characteristics with regards to the
   effective angle of attack. Indeed, they are all associated with a
   maximum effective angle of attack of about 33 deg and a maximum
   (normalized) rate of change of the latter of 0.55. It is further
   observed that, contrary to laminar results previously published, the
   occurrence of leading-edge vortex shedding is not necessarily observed
   in optimal cases at these higher Reynolds number conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The Golden Code (GC) is a full-rate and full-diversity, space-time code
   for 2 x 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with
   non-vanishing minimum determinant. Thanks to its algebraic construction,
   the GC achieves diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off and preserves the
   mutual information. The zero-forcing (ZF) detection is one of the
   simplest detection techniques that has a low computational complexity
   and provides a suboptimal performance. The purpose of this work is to
   investigate the effect of channel estimation error on the performance of
   the MIMO-ZF receiver for golden coded systems in spatio-temporally
   correlated Rayleigh fading channels. An upper and a lower bounds of the
   error probability are delivered and compared to the Monte Carlo
   simulation results. We quantify the capacity reduction due to the
   channel estimation error and to the spatio-temporally correlation. A
   tight lower bound of the ergodic capacity is provided. Numerical results
   show an excellent agreement between analytic bounds and Monte Carlo
   simulation curves. Moreover, the performances of the GC, in terms of bit
   error rate (BER) and channel capacity, are compared with those of the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the coordination mechanism in the forestry
   supply chain between strategic forest management and tactical production
   planning. We first formulate an integrated model to establish a
   theoretical benchmark for performance of the entire supply chain. It is
   a mixed integer programming model that involves harvesting, bucking,
   transportation, production, and sales decisions for both tactical and
   strategic planning levels. We then present two sequential approaches S-A
   and S-B where the coordination is done through internal pricing. S-A is
   the approach currently used in practice where harvesting in the forest
   is the main driver of the supply chain activities and internal pricing
   is introduced to control bucking decision in a separate stage. In
   contrast, S-B takes downstream demand information into consideration and
   internal pricing directly influences harvesting decision in the first
   stage. In order to find the appropriate setting of internal pricing that
   leads to the system optimum, we suggest two heuristics H-I and H-II. The
   internal pricing in H-I is based on dual values and in H-II, it is
   derived from a Lagrangian decomposition. A real-life case study in the
   Chilean forestry industry is used to compare the results of different
   approaches. It is shown that the new sequential approach S-B generates
   as good feasible solution as that obtained from the integrated approach
   but in much less time. Both heuristics H-I and H-II bring about
   near-optimal feasible solutions. H-II also provides optimistic bound of
   the optimal objective function value, which can be used as a measure of
   the solution quality.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical formulation and rheological properties of a novel
   self-assembling polymer (SAP) network system were investigated for
   potential application in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The inclusion
   complexes formed by surfactant (S) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) can
   associate with hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (HPAM) in aqueous solution,
   and subsequently establish the SAP network, which exhibits advanced
   viscoelasticity at the optimum molar ratio (S: beta-CD = 2: 1).
   Furthermore, this system presents enhanced surface activity and superior
   mechanical and thermal stability, as well as tolerance to elevated brine
   salinity and hardness due to the network ``interlocking effect{''}.
   Sandpack flood tests suggest the excellent mobility control ability of
   this system during polymer flooding, and also a moderate permeability
   reduction capacity, which makes it more cost effective in oil fields
   than the currently used HPAM. Regarding EOR performance, this polymeric
   system (SAP) produced approximately 19\% more incremental oil than the
   baseline HPAM under the same experimental conditions. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Zirconium diboride (ZrB2) as an ultrahigh temperature ceramic (UHTC)
   with excellent electrical conductivity is a potential candidate for
   harsh-environment devices. Fabrication of ZrB2-based materials however

   to depletion of boron. We report a simple technique to prevent
   degradation during pressureless sintering of zirconia-matrix composites
   of ZrB2. The composites prepared using this method reach the percolation
   threshold at similar to 10 wt\% ZrB2 and metal-like conductivity

Abstract = {{Oleic acid (OA)-capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals (NCs) have
   been synthesized via a new high-scale route. X-ray diffraction and
   transmission electron microscopy confirmed that rod-like hexagonal
   (wurtzite) CdSe NCs with an average size of 10 nm were obtained via this
   new route. The obtained CdSe NCs were treated individually with pyridine
   and tert-butylamine (t-BA) for ligand exchange. Fourier transform
   infrared spectra of the as-synthesized and treated CdSe NCs confirmed
   the removal of OA ligands from the surface of CdSe NCs after treatments
   with pyridine and t-BA. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices
   were prepared using untreated and surface treated CdSe NCs blended with
   poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) polymer. BHJ solar cell devices
   made from P3HT:(surface treated CdSe NCs) blends showed greater
   improvement in photovoltaic performances compared to P3HT:(untreated
   CdSe NCs) blend. The improvement in photovoltaic performances was due to
   the increase of electron mobility in P3HT:(CdSe NCs) blends after
   surface treatment of CdSe NCs.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is focused on two topics. The former is a mathematical
   model useful to understand the deformation of paintings, which uses
   straining devices, adjustable and micrometrically controlled through a
   pin implanted in a hollow cylinder. Strains were analyzed by holographic
   interferometry (HI) technique using an appropriate frame. The latter
   concerns the need to improve the conservator's knowledge about the
   defect's detection and defect's propagation in acrylic painting
   characterized by underdrawings and pentimenti. To accomplish this task,
   a sample was manufactured to clarify the several uncertainties inherent
   the influence of external factors on their conservation. Subsurface
   anomalies were also retrieved by near-infrared reflectography and
   transmittography techniques, using LED lamps and several narrow-band
   filters mounted on a CMOS camera, working at different wavelengths and
   in combination with UV imaging. In addition, a sponge glued on the rear
   side of the canvas was impregnated with a precise amount of water by
   means of a syringe to verify the stretcher effect by digital speckle
   photography (DSP) technique (using MatPIV). The same effect also affects
   the sharp transition of the canvas at the stretcher's edge. In this
   case, the direct mechanical contact between stretcher and canvas was
   investigated by HI technique. Finally, advanced algorithms were
   successfully applied to the square pulse thermography data to detect
   three Mylar inserts simulating different types of defects. These
   fabricated defects were also identified by optical techniques: DSP and
   laser speckle imaging.}},

Abstract = {{In order to accurately predict the mechanical behaviour of paste during
   forming process, the friction law between the carbon paste and the mould
   wall is an important parameter to be determined. This paper presents the
   tribological behaviour of the lubricated paste/steel interface subjected
   to high stress conditions at the anode forming temperature of 150
   degrees C A method to characterize the tribological behaviour has been
   developed and an apparatus was built. The method is based on the
   comparison of two successive experiments. In the first experiment, the
   paste is in contact with the friction plate. In the second one, a layer
   of Teflon is placed under the paste in order to excite another parameter
   thereby allowing the identification of the friction coefficient between
   the paste and steel wall. These experiments were performed with a paste
   under different normal loads. The static and kinetic friction
   coefficients of the Teflon/steel, steel/steel and paste/steel interfaces
   have been estimated. The static and kinetic friction coefficients of the
   Teflon/steel are respectively 0.17 and 0.13. The steel/steel friction
   coefficients were evaluated twice which gave a static coefficient that
   varies between 0.22 and 0.30. The kinetic coefficient varies between
   0.18 and 0.25. The static and kinetic paste/steel friction coefficients
   obtained from both experiments are clearly similar. Their values are
   0.15 and 0.13 respectively.}},

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{64-79}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In parallel cable-driven mechanisms (PCDMs), the unilaterality of force
   transmission requires a minimum level of tension in the cables in order
   to preserve their geometry. As a result, the driving electrical motors
   need to produce continuous torques to keep the cables taut. We propose
   to use nonlinear springs to generate these minimum torques, while
   altering as little as possible the PCDM neutral equilibrium over its
   workspace. The design of the required nonlinear springs couples a
   four-bar linkage with commercially available springs. By our approach,
   the electrical motors only need to produce additional forces, i.e.,
   those forces needed to generate accelerations and balance external
   forces applied to the end effector. This paper reports the method used
   to choose the optimum tension profile and the design of the ensuing
   nonlinear spring. An experimental verification is also performed, where
   the external forces that must be applied on the end effector to move it
   across the workspace are measured and compared with those predicted by
   the kinetostatic model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic face recognition is an area with immense practical potential
   which includes a wide range of commercial and law enforcement
   applications. Hence it is unsurprising that it continues to be one of
   the most active research areas of computer vision. Even after over three
   decades of intense research, the state-of-the-art in face recognition
   continues to improve, benefitting from advances in a range of different
   research fields such as image processing, pattern recognition, computer
   graphics, and physiology. Systems based on visible spectrum images, the
   most researched face recognition modality, have reached a significant
   level of maturity with some practical success. However, they continue to
   face challenges in the presence of illumination, pose and expression
   changes, as well as facial disguises, all of which can significantly
   decrease recognition accuracy. Amongst various approaches which have
   been proposed in an attempt to overcome these limitations, the use of
   infrared (IR) imaging has emerged as a particularly promising research
   direction. This paper presents a comprehensive and timely review of the
   literature on this subject. Our key contributions are (i) a summary of
   the inherent properties of infrared imaging which makes this modality
   promising in the context of face recognition; (ii) a systematic review
   of the most influential approaches, with a focus on emerging common
   trends as well as key differences between alternative methodologies;
   (iii) a description of the main databases of infrared facial images
   available to the researcher; and lastly (iv) a discussion of the most
   promising avenues for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4877-4895}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Attempts to reduce the number of parameters in distributed
   rainfall-runoff models have not yet resulted in a model that is accurate
   for both natural and anthropogenic hillslopes. We take on the challenge
   by proposing a distributed model for overland flow and channel flow
   based on a combination of a linear response time distribution and the
   hillslope geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH), which can
   be calculated with only a digital elevation model and a map with field
   boundaries and channel network as input. The spatial domain is
   subdivided into representative elementary hillslopes (REHs) for each of
   which we define geometric and flow velocity parameters and compute the
   GIUH. The catchment GIUH is given by the sum of all REH responses. While
   most distributed models only perform well on natural hillslopes, the
   advantage of our approach is that it can also be applied to modified
   hillslopes with for example a rectangular drainage network and terrace
   cultivation. Tests show that the REH-GIUH approach performs better than
   classical routing functions (exponential and gamma). Simulations of four
   virtual hillslopes suggest that peak flow at the catchment outlet is
   directly related to drainage density. By combining the distributed flow
   routing model with a lumped-parameter infiltration model, we were also
   able to demonstrate that terrace cultivation delays the response time
   and reduces peak flow in comparison to the same hillslope, but with a
   natural stream network. The REH-GIUH approach is a first step in the
   process of coupling distributed hydrological models to erosion and water
   quality models at the REH (associated with agricultural management) and
   at the catchment scale (associated with the evaluation of the
   environmental impact of human activities). It furthermore provides a
   basis for the development of models for large catchments and urban or
   peri-urban catchments. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We examine simulations of isolated galaxies to analyse the effects of
   localized feedback on the formation and evolution of molecular clouds.
   Feedback contributes to turbulence and the destruction of clouds,
   leading to a population of clouds that is younger, less massive, and
   with more retrograde rotation. We investigate the evolution of clouds as
   they interact with each other and the diffuse interstellar medium, and
   determine that the role of cloud interactions differs strongly with the
   presence of feedback: in models without feedback, scattering events
   dramatically increase the retrograde fraction, but in models with
   feedback, mergers between clouds may slightly increase the prograde
   fraction. We also produce an estimate of the viscous time-scale due to
   cloud-cloud collisions, which increases with increasing strength of
   feedback (t(nu) similar to 20 Gyr versus t(nu) similar to 10 Gyr), but
   is still much smaller than previous estimates (t(nu) similar to 1000
   Gyr); although collisions become more frequent with feedback, less
   energy is lost in each collision than in the models without feedback.}},

Abstract = {{A statistic-stochastic multi-fractal downscaling technique was evaluated
   from a hydrologic point of view. Ensemble hydrologic forecasts with a
   time step of 3 h were performed for original and disaggregated ensemble
   rainfall forecasts issued by the Canadian Global Ensemble Prediction
   System in its 2009 operational version. This hydro-meteorological
   operational forecasting chain was conducted using the hydrological model
   SWMM5. The model was implemented on a small 6-km(2) urban catchment
   located in the Quebec City region. The hydrological evaluation was based
   on the comparison of forecasted flows to the observed ones, calculating
   several deterministic and probabilistic scores, and drawing rank
   histograms and reliability diagrams. Disaggregated products led to a
   better representation of the ensemble members' dispersion. This
   disaggregation technique represents an interesting way of bridging the
   gap between the meteorological models' resolution and the high degree of
   spatial precision sometimes required by hydrological models in their
   precipitation representation. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{We report a new method for the growth of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on
   the 316L alloy of stainless steel (SS) and its relevance for biomedical
   applications. We demonstrate that electrochemical etching increases the
   concentration of metallic species on the surface and enables the growth
   of rGO. This result is supported through a combination of Raman
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations and static water contact angle measurements.
   Raman spectroscopy identifies the G and D bands for oxidized species of
   graphene at 1595 cm(-1) and 1350 cm(-1), respectively, and gives an
   I-D/I-G ratio of 1.2, indicating a moderate degree of oxidation. XPS
   shows -OH and -COOH groups in the rGO stoichiometry and static contact
   angle measurements confirm the wettability of rGO. SEM and AFM
   measurements were performed on different substrates before and after
   coronene treatment to confirm rGO growth. Cell viability studies reveal
   that these rGO coatings do not have toxic effects on mammalian cells,
   making this material suitable for biomedical and biotechnological
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a longitudinally resolved measurement of plasma density

   spectroscopy. By applying a needlelike high-voltage direct current (DC)
   electric field on the laser filament and scanning it along filament, the
   longitudinal evolution of amplified THz emission has been demonstrated.
   The peak frequency of the DC electric field biased THz emission is
   proportional to the plasma density inside the laser filament. This
   latter phenomenon was used to characterize the plasma density.
   Longitudinal distribution of plasma density of similar to 10(15) cm(-3)
   along laser filament has been experimentally recorded. The technique
   demonstrated is very simple and helpful for understanding the THz
   generation process through laser filamentation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Long-term field experiments on phosphorus (P) fertilization were
   originally designed to study crop needs in different soil types by
   analyzing the effects of several rates of P fertilization on yields,
   their P concentrations and dynamics of plant-available soil P. The
   objective of this study was to test a computer-based model to simulate
   the P dynamics at the field scale using plant database and analyzing for
   plant-available P by a hierarchical process-based approach. It predicts
   both the concentration (C-P) of phosphate ions (Pi) in soil solution and
   the associated Pi amounts that in time equilibrate with Pi in solution.
   Five experiments, representative of contrasting soil types, land-use,
   and climates were selected. Our model equilibrates the change in
   plant-available P in the upper soil layer to the P budget between annual
   P inputs and outputs. Rates of P fertilization affected simulations
   following the same expected pattern across sites. Field-observed and
   simulated values are in good agreements in all sites. The field-observed
   variations of C-P per unit of P budget ranged from 0.007 to 2.49 (mu g P
   L-1) (kg P ha(-1))(-1). The predictions are of the same order of
   magnitude. Predictions were compared with empirical long-term data and
   mismatches were discussed. This investigation highlights the scientific
   interest of long-term field P experiments to test and validate models
   describing P dynamics at the scale of the agricultural fields under
   different agricultural management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Tests on two-way reinforced concrete slab-column connections with
   simulated delamination are reported. The experimental results are
   compared with test results of companion specimens to investigate the
   effects of significant delamination on the punching and postpunching
   responses of the specimens, as well as the effects of structural
   integrity reinforcement on the postpunching behavior of delaminated
   specimens. The results are also compared with predictions of punching
   shear resistance and postpunching shear resistance predictions.
   Significant delamination of the top reinforcement caused decreases in
   prepunching stiffness, punching shear resistance, and postpunching shear
   resistance of the specimens. The provision of structural integrity
   reinforcement allowed for the development of a postpunching shear
   resisting mechanism, increasing the postpunching shear resistances and
   ultimate deflections. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   sensors with directional probabilistic sensing. The performance of this
   approach is compared with two other black box optimization methods over

Abstract = {{A chamber was designed and built to study the long-term effects of
   environmental conditions on air-borne microorganisms. The system
   consists of a 55.5-L cylindrical chamber, which can rotate at variable
   speeds on its axis. The chamber is placed within an insulated
   temperature controlled enclosure which can be either cooled or heated
   with piezoelectric units. A germicidal light located at the chamber
   center irradiates at a 360 degrees angle. Access ports are located on
   the stationary sections on both ends of the chamber. Relative humidity
   (RH) is controlled by passing the aerosol through meshed tubes
   surrounded by desiccant. Validation assay indicates that the interior
   temperature is stable with less than 0.5 degrees C in variation when set
   between 18 and 30 degrees C with the UV light having no effect of
   temperature during operation. RH levels set at 20\%, 50\% and 80\%
   varied by 2.2\%, 3.3\% and 3.3\%, respectively, over a 14-h period. The
   remaining fraction of particles after 18 h of suspension was 8.8\% at 1
   rotation per minute (rpm) and 2.6\% at 0 rpm with the mass median
   aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) changing from 1.21 +/- 0.04 mu m to 1.30 +/-
   0.02 mu m at 1 rpm and from 1.21 +/- 0.04 mu m to 0.91 +/- 0.01 mu m at
   0 rpm within the same time period. This chamber can be used to increase
   the time of particle suspension in an aerosol cloud and control the
   temperature, RH and UV exposure; the design facilitates stationary
   sampling to be performed while the chamber is rotating.}},

Title = {{Novel, full 3D scintillation dosimetry using a static plenoptic camera}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{449-461}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Patient-specific quality assurance (QA) of dynamic radiotherapy
   delivery would gain from being performed using a 3D dosimeter. However,
   3D dosimeters, such as gels, have many disadvantages limiting to quality
   assurance, such as tedious read-out procedures and poor reproducibility.
   The purpose of this work is to develop and validate a novel type of high
   resolution 3D dosimeter based on the real-time light acquisition of a
   plastic scintillator volume using a plenoptic camera. This dosimeter
   would allow for the QA of dynamic radiation therapy techniques such as
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc
   therapy (VMAT).
   Methods: A Raytrix R5 plenoptic camera was used to image a 10 x 10 x 10
   cm(3) EJ-260 plastic scintillator embedded inside an acrylic phantom at
   a rate of one acquisition per second. The scintillator volume was
   irradiated with both an IMRT and VMAT treatment plan on a Clinac iX
   linear accelerator. The 3D light distribution emitted by the
   scintillator volume was reconstructed at a 2 mm resolution in all
   dimensions by back-projecting the light collected by each pixel of the
   light-field camera using an iterative reconstruction algorithm. The
   latter was constrained by a beam's eye view projection of the incident
   dose acquired using the portal imager integrated with the linac and by
   physical consideration of the dose behavior as a function of depth in
   the phantom.
   Results: The absolute dose difference between the reconstructed 3D dose
   and the expected dose calculated using the treatment planning software
   Pinnacle(3) was on average below 1.5\% of the maximum dose for both
   integrated IMRT and VMAT deliveries, and below 3\% for each individual
   IMRT incidences. Dose agreement between the reconstructed 3D dose and a
   radiochromic film acquisition in the same experimental phantom was on
   average within 2.1\% and 1.2\% of the maximum recorded dose for the IMRT
   and VMAT delivery, respectively.
   Conclusions: Using plenoptic camera technology, the authors were able to
   perform millimeter resolution, water-equivalent dosimetry of an IMRT and
   VMAT plan over a whole 3D volume. Since no moving parts are required in
   the dosimeter, the incident dose distribution can be acquired as a
   function of time, thus enabling the validation of static and dynamic
   radiation delivery with photons, electrons, and heavier ions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Three series of composite proton exchange membranes containing SiO2 as

   was carried out under equilibrium conditions at long diffusion time with
   pre-defined water and TEOS contents as a given ratio per -SO3H group.
   The study of electro-physical properties of composite membranes showed
   that the dielectric permittivity, measured using a simple probing device
   in different locations of a composite film, may be used not only for
   structural and electro-physical characterization of the materials but
   also as a parameter allowing to estimate homogeneity and spatial

   influential parameters with respect to: (a) tile-drain flow and (b)
   edge-of-field flow of the Bras d'Henri, an agricultural micro-watershed
   (Quebec, Canada). Of the 24 parameters evaluated using the Morris
   method, nine and eight parameters, being the most influential on the two
   output variables, respectively, were used for analysis by the FAST99 and
   Sobol2002 approaches. The results indicate that the lateral saturated
   hydraulic conductivity of the layers underlying the tile drainage
   systems is the most influential parameter with respect to both output
   variables. Thus, characterization of soil anisotropy should not be

Abstract = {{Lactococcus lactis, a Gram(+) lactic acid-producing bacterium used for
   the manufacture of several fermented dairy products, is subject to
   infection by diverse virulent tailed phages, leading to industrial
   fermentation failures. This constant viral risk has led to a sustained
   interest in the study of their biology, diversity, and evolution.
   Lactococcal phages now constitute a wide ensemble of at least 10
   distinct genotypes within the Caudovirales order, many of them belonging
   to the Siphoviridae family. Lactococcal siphophage 1358, currently the
   only member of its group, displays a noticeably high genomic similarity
   to some Listeria phages as well as a host range limited to a few L.
   lactis strains. These genomic and functional characteristics stimulated
   our interest in this phage. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy
   structure of the complete 1358 virion. Phage 1358 exhibits noteworthy
   features, such as a capsid with dextro handedness and protruding
   decorations on its capsid and tail. Observations of the baseplate of
   virion particles revealed at least two conformations, a closed and an
   open, activated form. Functional assays uncovered that the adsorption of
   phage 1358 to its host is Ca2+ independent, but this cation is necessary
   to complete its lytic cycle. Taken together, our results provide the
   complete structural picture of a unique lactococcal phage and expand our
   knowledge on the complex baseplate of phages of the Siphoviridae family.}},

Abstract = {{When evaluating the reliability of an ensemble prediction system, it is
   common to compare the root-mean-square error of the ensemble mean to the
   average ensemble spread. While this is indeed good practice, two
   different and inconsistent methodologies have been used over the last
   few years in the meteorology and hydrology literature to compute the
   average ensemble spread. In some cases, the square root of average
   ensemble variance is used, and in other cases, the average of ensemble
   standard deviation is computed instead. The second option is incorrect.
   To avoid the perpetuation of practices that are not supported by
   probability theory, the correct equation for computing the average
   ensemble spread is obtained and the impact of using the wrong equation
   is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to study and develop an innovative,
   clean, and environmentally friendly process for lactulose synthesis by
   electroactivation of lactose. In this work, the electrode material (type
   304 stainless steel, titanium, and copper), dimensionless
   interelectrode-membrane distance at the cathodic compartment (0.36,
   0.68, and 1), and the membrane:electrode surface area ratio (0.23, 0.06,
   and 0.015) were considered to be the factors that could affect the
   kinetic conversion of lactose into lactulose. The reactions were
   conducted under an initial lactose concentration of 0.15 mol/L at 10
   degrees C, Froude number (mixing speed) of 2.05 x 10(-2), and electric
   current intensity of 300 mA for 30 mm. The highest lactulose formation
   yield of 32.50\% (0.05 mol/L) was obtained by using a copper electrode,
   interelectrode-membrane distance of 0.36, and membrane:electrode surface
   area ratio of 0.23. The 2-parameter Langmuir, Freundlich; and Temkin
   isotherm models were used for the prediction of the lactose
   isomerization kinetics as well as the 3-parameter Langmuir-Freundlich
   isotherm model. It was shown that the lactose isomerization kinetics
   into lactulose followed the Temkin and Langmuir-Freundlich models with
   coefficients of determination of 0.99 and 0.90 and a relative error of
   1.42 to 1.56\% and 4.27 to 4.37\%, respectively.}},

   process intensification technology that has immense potential for
   implementation on industrial TBR. In this paper, we have summarized and

Abstract = {{Geometric mean decomposition (GMD) has emerged as an alternative method
   to design multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers. The
   MIMO-GMD scheme decouples the MIMO channel into multiple independent
   links with identical gains. The GMD-based system with zero-forcing
   decision feedback equalizer (ZF-DFE) is known to minimize the bit error
   rate (BER) for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In addition, adaptive
   modulation has been widely used to enhance the average spectral
   efficiency (ASE) while maintaining a target BER and transmit power. In
   this paper, we present an analytic study of the adaptive modulation for
   GMD-ZF-DFE systems under Rayleigh flat fading correlated channels. In
   order to adjust the constellation size, the SNR at the equalizer output
   is sent back to the transmitter. The SNR at the DFE output is a function
   of the determinant of a Wishart complex matrix. The complementary
   cumulative distribution function (CCDF) is then an important key to our
   analysis. To evaluate the performance of the considered system, we use
   some bounds on the CCDF of the determinant and the trace of a Wishart
   matrix. Closed-form expressions of the BER, the ASE and the outage
   probability are derived and compared to Monte Carlo simulation results.
   Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the channel spatial correlation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates an optimal design model for assembly/disassembly

   The buffers are also characterized by their total cost of ownership

   assembly/disassembly network performance, a decomposition-type

   combinatorial optimization one in which the derision variables are

Abstract = {{Nosocomial infections (Nis) are a major concern for public health. As
   more and more of the pathogens responsible for these infections are
   antibiotic resistant, finding new ways to overcome them is a major
   challenge for biomedical research. We present a method to reduce Nis
   spreading by hindering bacterial adhesion in its very early stage. This
   is achieved by reducing the contact interface area between the bacterium
   and the surface by nanoengineering the surface topography. In
   particular, we studied the Escheria Coli adhesion on titanium surfaces
   exhibiting different morphologies, that were obtained by a combination
   of mechanical polishing and chemical etching. Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) characterization
   revealed that the titanium surface is modified at both micro- and
   nano-scale. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the
   surfaces have the same composition before and after piranha treatment,
   consisting mainly of TiO2. Adhesion tests showed a significant reduction
   in bacterial accumulation on nanostructured surfaces that had the lowest
   roughness over large areas. SEM images acquired after bacterial culture
   on different titanium substrates confirmed that the polished titanium
   surface treated one hour in a piranha solution at a temperature of 25
   degrees C has the lowest bacterial accumulation among all the surfaces
   tested. This suggests that the difference observed in bacterial adhesion
   between the different surfaces is due primarily to surface topography.

   subwavelength grating couplers for ultra-broadband silicon photonics
   optical interfaces. With implementation of waveguide dispersion
   engineered subwavelength structures, an ultra-wide 1-dB bandwidth of
   over 100 nm (largest reported to date) near 1550 nm is experimentally
   achieved for transverse-electric polarized light. By tapering the
   subwavelength structures, back reflection is effectively suppressed and
   grating coupling efficiency is increased to -4.7 dB. A compact device
   footprint of 40 mu m x 20 mu m is realized by curving the gratings in a
   focusing scheme. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Considering the effects of globalisation, the increase of production and
   energy costs, and the introduction of advanced technologies, companies
   need to change their way of doing business if they want to stay
   competitive. One way of doing this is to establish collaborations with
   suppliers, distributors and retailers, in order to exchange products
   efficiently and create value for customers. Nevertheless, the structure
   of the collaboration must be designed carefully and some coordination
   mechanisms must be implemented to support this way of doing business. In
   this article, we first analyse: why companies work together, how they
   should build their partnership, and which strategies they can implement
   to facilitate coordination of supply chain activities. We then report a
   case study of collaboration in the forest industry that shows the
   benefits of implementing coordination mechanisms as well as the
   necessity of using incentives to better share these benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Team1 (vB\_SauM\_Team1) is a polyvalent staphylococcal phage belonging
   to the Myoviridae family. Phage Team1 was propagated on a Staphylococcus
   aureus strain and a non-pathogenic Staphylococcus xylosus strain used in
   industrial meat fermentation. The two Team1 preparations were compared
   with respect to their microbiological and genomic properties. The burst
   sizes, latent periods, and host ranges of the two derivatives were
   identical as were their genome sequences. Phage Team1 has 140,903 bp of
   double stranded DNA encoding for 217 open reading frames and 4 tRNAs.
   Comparative genomic analysis revealed similarities to staphylococcal
   phages ISP (97\%) and G1 (97\%). The host range of Team1 was compared to
   the well-known polyvalent staphylococcal phages phi812 and K using a
   panel of 57 S. aureus strains collected from various sources. These
   bacterial strains were found to represent 18 sequence types (MLST) and
   14 clonal complexes (eBURST). Altogether, the three phages propagated on
   S. xylosus lysed 52 out of 57 distinct strains of S. aureus. The
   identification of phage-insensitive strains underlines the importance of
   designing phage cocktails with broadly varying and overlapping host
   ranges. Taken altogether, our study suggests that some staphylococcal
   phages can be propagated on food-grade bacteria for biocontrol and
   safety purposes.}},

Title = {{Turnover of protein phosphorylation evolving under stabilizing selection}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Most proteins are regulated by posttranslational modifications and
   changes in these modifications contribute to evolutionary changes as
   well as to human diseases. Phosphorylation of serines, threonines, and
   tyrosines are the most common modifications identified to date in
   eukaryotic proteomes. While the mode of action and the function of most
   phosphorylation sites remain unknown, functional studies have shown that
   phosphorylation affects protein stability, localization and ability to
   interact. Two broad modes of action have been described for protein
   phosphorylation. The first mode corresponds to the canonical and
   qualitative view whereby single phosphorylation sites act as molecular
   switches that either turn on or off specific protein functions through
   direct or allosteric effects. The second mode is more akin to a rheostat
   than a switch. In this case, a group of phosphorylation sites in a given
   protein region contributes collectively to the modification of the
   protein, irrespective of the precise position of individual sites,
   through an aggregate property. Here we discuss these two types of
   regulation and examine how they affect the rate and patterns of protein
   phosphorylation evolution. We describe how the evolution of clusters of
   phosphorylation sites can be studied under the framework of complex
   traits evolution and stabilizing selection.}},

Title = {{Removal of selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products and

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{487}},
Pages = {{801-812}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{A sewage lagoon serving the small municipality of Lakefield in Ontario,
   Canada was monitored in the summer, fall and winter to determine
   removals of carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen,
   gemfibrozil, triclosan, sucralose, HHCB and AHTN. Concentrations of
   these compounds in untreated and treated wastewater were estimated by
   deploying POCIS and SPMD passive samplers in the sewage lagoon. Passive
   samplers were also deployed at several points upstream and downstream of
   the point of discharge from the lagoon into the Otonabee River. LC-MS/MS
   and GC-MS were utilized to determine the concentrations of
   pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and sucralose, an
   artificial sweetener. Among PPCPs sampled by POCIS, the highest
   estimated concentration in untreated wastewater was ibuprofen sampled
   during the fall, at an estimated concentration of 60.3 ng/L. The
   estimated average concentration of sucralose was 13.6 ng/L in the
   untreated wastewaters. Triclosan, HHCB and AHTN in SPMDs were highest
   during fall season, at 30, 1677 and 109 ng/L, respectively. For all
   compounds except gemfibrozil, carbamazepine and sucralose, removals were
   highest in the summer (83.0 to 98.8\%) relative to removals in the fall
   (48.4 to 91.4\%) and winter (14.0 to 78.3\%). Finally, the estimated
   concentrations of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan and HHCB
   were compared with predicted values obtained through application of the
   WEST (R) modeling tool, with a new model based on the River Water
   Quality Model No. I and extended with dynamic mass balances describing
   the fate of chemicals of emerging concern subject to a variety of
   removal pathways. The model was able to adequately predict the fate of
   these four compounds in the lagoon in summer and winter, but the model
   overestimated removals of three of the four test compounds in the fall
   sampling period. This lagoon was as effective at removing PPCPs as many
   conventional WWTPs, but removals were better during the summer. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We used the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SpectromStre Imageur
   de l'Observatoire du Mont-M,gantic (SpIOMM) to obtain hyperspectral
   cubes of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). The cubes
   contain over 5000 spatially resolved spectra covering the spectral range
   6480-7050 <remove>. We first investigate the slow-moving N-rich
   quasi-stationary flocculi by measuring their radial velocity as well as
   the {[}N ii] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio. No correlation between their
   radial velocity and {[}N ii] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio with their
   location has been found. We used multi-epoch observations from the
   Hubble Space Telescope to create a proper motion map, showing the
   displacement of several filaments over the most part of Cas A. Combining
   data from SpIOMM and Hubble, we re-evaluate the distance to Cas A and
   obtained 3.33 +/- A 0.10 kpc, which is in good agreement with previous
   estimates. Finally, we obtain a three-dimensional spatial view of the
   {[}S ii] lambda lambda 6716, 6731 emissions showing their location,
   expansion velocity and the {[}S ii] doublet line ratio for multiple
   locations in the remnant. The velocity asymmetry reported by previous
   analyses is clearly visible. Also, the {[}S ii] doublet ratio (with a
   mean value of 0.5 +/- A 0.2) indicates a very high and variable
   electronic density throughout the remnant.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of pavement engineering, the need to rapidly and
   economically obtain properties of soils and materials has given rise to
   the development of many non-destructive techniques. Portable
   light-weight deflectometers (PLWD) are relatively new deflection-based
   tools. As a consequence, the main factors influencing the quality of the
   results obtained using such a tool are still being investigated.
   Therefore, through finite element modelling and experimental
   measurements, this research focussed on the stress distribution and
   stress variability under a PLWD loading plate and how it is influenced
   by stress level, plate diameter, rubber mat use and rubber hardness. It
   was shown that the stress distribution factor used for the calculation
   of elastic modulus from deflection testing is significantly influenced
   by the loading plate diameter. Moreover, the use of a harder rubber mat
   was found to be better, but no significant effect was observed for
   bonded rubber mat conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations on ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) with varying
   cross-link densities and carbon black contents, as well as commercial
   EPDM waste ground rubber (WGR), have been performed to improve
   characterization. The aim is to provide additional quality-control
   methods in the field of rubber recycling, as WGR is transformed and
   reused in the form of rubber mats mainly for playground, agricultural,
   sport, and automobile applications. Inductively coupled plasma optical
   emission spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrometry, and elemental
   (CHNS) analyses were used to determine the content of various chemical
   elements. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the
   amount of carbon black and inorganic material in the sample. Mass loss
   at 400 degrees C was related to cross-link density. TGA coupled with
   mass spectrometry showed that this mass loss corresponds to the loss of
   SO2 as cross-links are destroyed during heating. Melt point and glass
   transition temperatures determined by differential scanning calorimetry
   are mainly proportional to the ethylene/propylene weight ratio.}},

   phages}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and
   their associated cas genes serve as a prokaryotic `adaptive' immune
   system, protecting against foreign DNA elements such as bacteriophages.
   CRISPR-Cas systems function by incorporating short DNA `spacers',
   homologous to invading DNA sequences, into a CRISPR array (adaptation).
   The array is then transcribed and matured into RNA molecules
   (maturation) that target homologous DNA for cleavage (interference). It
   is unclear how these three stages could occur quickly enough in a naive
   phage-infected cell to interfere with phage replication before this cell
   would be irrevocably damaged by the infection. Here we demonstrate that
   cells can acquire spacers from defective phages at a rate directly
   proportional to the quantity of replication-deficient phages to which
   the cells are exposed. This process is reminiscent of immunization in
   humans by vaccination with inactivated viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a genetically encoded
   pathological protein (mutant huntingtin {[}mHtt]), which is thought to
   exert its effects in a cell-autonomous manner. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that mHtt is capable of spreading within cerebral tissue by
   examining genetically unrelated fetal neural allografts within the
   brains of patients with advancing HD.
   Methods: The presence of mHtt aggregates within the grafted tissue was
   confirmed using 3 different types of microscopy (bright-field,
   fluorescence, and electron), 2 additional techniques consisting of
   Western immunoblotting and infrared spectroscopy, and 4 distinct
   antibodies targeting different epitopes of mHtt aggregates.
   Results: We describe the presence of mHtt aggregates within
   intracerebral allografts of striatal tissue in 3 HD patients who
   received their transplants approximately 1 decade earlier and then died
   secondary to the progression of their disease. The mHtt(+) aggregates
   were observed in the extracellular matrix of the transplanted tissue,
   whereas in the host brain they were seen in neurons, neuropil,
   extracellular matrix, and blood vessels.
   Interpretation: This is the first demonstration of the presence of mHtt
   in genetically normal and unrelated allografted neural tissue
   transplanted into the brain of affected HD patients. These observations
   raise questions on protein spread in monogenic neurodegenerative
   disorders of the central nervous system characterized by the formation
   of mutant protein oligomers/aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes can tailor transcriptional responses to diverse environmental
   challenges despite having streamlined genomes and a limited number of
   regulators. Here, we present data-driven models that capture the dynamic
   interplay of the environment and genome-encoded regulatory programs of
   two types of prokaryotes: Escherichia coli (a bacterium) and
   Halobacterium salinarum (an archaeon). The models reveal how the
   genome-wide distributions of cis-acting gene regulatory elements and the
   conditional influences of transcription factors at each of those
   elements encode programs for eliciting a wide array of
   environment-specific responses. We demonstrate how these programs
   partition transcriptional regulation of genes within regulons and
   operons to re-organize gene-gene functional associations in each
   environment. The models capture fitness-relevant co-regulation by
   different transcriptional control mechanisms acting across the entire
   genome, to define a generalized, system-level organizing principle for
   prokaryotic gene regulatory networks that goes well beyond existing
   paradigms of gene regulation. An online resource
   (http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net) has been developed to facilitate
   multiscale exploration of conditional gene regulation in the two
   prokaryotes.}},

Abstract = {{CRISPR-Cas systems are small RNA-based immune systems that protect
   prokaryotes from invaders such as viruses and plasmids. We have
   investigated the features and biogenesis of the CRISPR (cr)RNAs in
   Streptococcus thermophilus (Sth) strain DGCC7710, which possesses four
   different CRISPR-Cas systems including representatives from the three
   major types of CRISPR-Cas systems. Our results indicate that the crRNAs
   from each CRISPR locus are specifically processed into divergent crRNA
   species by Cas proteins (and non-coding RNAs) associated with the
   respective locus. We find that the Csm Type III-A and Cse Type I-E
   crRNAs are specifically processed by Cas6 and Cse3 (Cas6e),
   respectively, and retain an 8-nucleotide CRISPR repeat sequence tag 5'
   of the invader-targeting sequence. The Cse Type I-E crRNAs also retain a
   21-nucleotide 3' repeat tag. The crRNAs from the two Csn Type II-A
   systems in Sth consist of a 5'-truncated targeting sequence and a 3'
   tag; however, these are distinct in size between the two. Moreover, the
   Csn1 (Cas9) protein associated with one Csn locus functions specifically
   in the production of crRNAs from that locus. Our findings indicate that
   multiple CRISPR-Cas systems can function independently in crRNA
   biogenesis within a given organism - an important consideration in
   engineering coexisting CRISPRCas pathways.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Five Bacteriophages as Models for Viral Aerosol Studies}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriophages are perceived to be good models for the study of airborne
   viruses because they are safe to use, some of them display structural
   features similar to those of human and animal viruses, and they are
   relatively easy to produce in large quantities. Yet, only a few studies
   have investigated them as models. It has previously been demonstrated
   that aerosolization, environmental conditions, and sampling conditions
   affect viral infectivity, but viral infectivity is virus dependent.
   Thus, several virus models are likely needed to study their general
   behavior in aerosols. The aim of this study was to compare the effects
   of aerosolization and sampling on the infectivity of five tail-less
   bacteriophages and two pathogenic viruses: MS2 (a single-stranded RNA
   {[}ssRNA] phage of the Leviviridae family), Phi 6 (a segmented
   double-stranded RNA {[}dsRNA] phage of the Cystoviridae family), Phi
   X174 (a single-stranded DNA {[}ssDNA] phage of the Microviridae family),
   PM2 (a double-stranded DNA {[}dsDNA] phage of the Corticoviridae
   family), PR772 (a dsDNA phage of the Tectiviridae family), human
   influenza A virus H1N1 (an ssRNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family),
   and the poultry virus Newcastle disease virus (NDV; an ssRNA virus of
   the Paramyxoviridae family). Three nebulizers and two nebulization salt
   buffers (with or without organic fluid) were tested, as were two aerosol
   sampling devices, a liquid cyclone (SKC BioSampler) and a dry cyclone
   (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health two-stage cyclone
   bioaerosol sampler). The presence of viruses in collected air samples
   was detected by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results showed
   that these selected five phages behave differently when aerosolized and
   sampled. RNA phage MS2 and ssDNA phage Phi X174 were the most resistant
   to aerosolization and sampling. The presence of organic fluid in the
   nebulization buffer protected phages PR772 and Phi 6 throughout the
   aerosolization and sampling with dry cyclones. In this experimental
   setup, the behavior of the influenza virus resembled that of phages
   PR772 and Phi 6, while the behavior of NDV was closer to that of phages
   MS2 and Phi X174. These results provide critical information for the
   selection of appropriate phage models to mimic the behavior of specific
   human and animal viruses in aerosols.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage practices have become increasingly common in recent
   years to reduce soil erosion, improve water conservation, and increase
   soil organic matter. Research suggests that conservation tillage can
   stratify soil test phosphorus (P), but little is known about the effects
   on soil organic P. This study was conducted to assess the long-term
   effects of tillage practices (no-till {[} NT] and mouldboard plowing)
   and P fertilization (0 and 35 kg P ha(-1)) on the distribution of P
   species in the soil profile. Soil samples from a long-term corn-soybean
   rotation experiment in Quebec, Canada, were collected from three depths
   (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm). These samples were analyzed for total P (TP),
   total C (TC), total N (TN), pH, and Mehlich-3 P (PM3); P forms were
   characterized with solution phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (P-31-NMR). Results showed a stratification of TP, TC, TN,
   pH, PM3, and Mehlich-3-extractable aluminum and magnesium under NT
   management. The PM3 and orthophosphate concentrations were greater at
   the soil surface (0-5 cm) of the NT-P-35 (soil treatment with 35 kg P
   ha(-1)) treatment. Organic P forms (orthophosphate monoesters,
   especially scyllo-IP6, and nucleotides) had accumulated in the deep
   layer of NT treatment possibly due to preferential movement. We found
   evidence that the NT system and P fertilization changed the distribution
   of P forms along the soil profile, potentially increasing soluble
   inorganic P loss in surface runoff and organic P in drainage and
   decreasing bioavailability of inorganic and organic P in deeper soil
   layers.}},

   discrete element method}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{154-160}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Packing density is an important quality parameter of calcined cokes used
   in aluminum industry to produce carbon anodes. Vibrated bulk density
   (VBD) test is a well established method to measure the packing density
   of coke samples. In the present work, Discrete Element Method (DEM) is
   coupled with a three-dimensional imaging technique to investigate the
   possibility of using DEM to simulate the packing behavior of calcined
   cokes. As the method verified, effects of shape, friction coefficient,
   size and size distribution of the particles on the VBD of cokes are also
   investigated. DEM simulations, in accordance with the experiments, show
   that vibrated bulk density of coke samples decreases as the content of
   coarse particles in the mixture increases. Moreover, it is shown that
   friction coefficient has a negative effect on the VBD value and this
   effect is more pronounced for the samples with lower sphericity. High
   friction coefficient restricts the movement and rearrangements of the
   particles and thus vibrational forces cannot effectively rearrange the
   particles and fill the porosities. Lower sphericity of coke samples not
   only induces a higher initial porosity level in the samples but it also
   increases the chance of formation of locks and particle bridges which
   result in lower VBD. Results also show that sphericity and friction
   coefficient have a synergic effect on the VBD of coke so that for the
   samples with lower average sphericity the rate of decrease in VBD is
   higher with increasing the friction coefficient. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This work presents the chemical formulation and rheological properties
   of a novel self-assembling polymer (SAP) system derived from a
   hydrophobically modified sulfonated polyacrylamide (HMSPAM). This
   polymeric association was established through complexation between the
   pendant hydrophobic groups contained in HMSPAM and -cyclodextrin
   molecules. The new SAP system offers improved viscoelastic properties
   because of the interlocking effect of the hydrophobic groups into
   -cyclodextrin cavities. It also provides suitable reformability upon
   mechanical shear when compared to the base HMSPAM. Furthermore, SAP
   exhibits superior tolerance to elevate brine salinity and hardness, as
   well as high reservoir temperature. Sandpack flooding tests conducted at
   simulated reservoir conditions (Pelican Lake reservoir, Alberta, Canada)
   indicate that this system shows superior mobility control (resistance
   factor) compared to HMSPAM. It also shows potential as in situ
   permeability modifier, which makes this polymeric system particularly
   suitable for heavy oil recovery applications. For instance, the newly
   developed SAP produced 20\% more incremental heavy oil recovery if
   compared to the performance of the commonly used partially hydrolyzed
   polyacrylamide and 7\% more incremental oil recovery than the baseline
   HMSPAM at the same experimental conditions. Overall, this new
   self-assembly system shows potential for applications in heavy oil
   recovery. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Effects of tank cross-section on dynamic fluid slosh loads and roll
   stability of a partly-filled tank truck}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model of a partly-filled tank of arbitrary cross-section
   is developed for predicting transient lateral slosh force and
   overturning moment using linear slosh theory. Slosh frequencies and mode
   shapes are initially estimated using the variational method, which is
   applied to the linearized free-surface boundary condition. The resulting
   truncated system of linear ordinary differential equations is
   subsequently solved numerically to determine the fluid velocity
   potentials followed by hydrodynamic force and moment. The validity of
   the model is examined through comparisons with available analytical
   solutions and experimental data. The slosh force and roll moment are
   obtained for four different tank cross-sections, namely, circular,
   elliptical, modified-oval and Reuleaux-triangle. It is shown that the
   magnitudes of the slosh force and overturning moment are strongly
   dependent upon the tank cross-section. The slosh model is subsequently
   integrated to a roll plane model of an articulated tank-semitrailer
   vehicle to study the effect of dynamic liquid slosh as well as the tank
   cross-section on the steady-turning roll stability limit of the vehicle
   under constant and variable cargo load conditions. The results suggest
   that a tank cross-section with lower overall center of mass and lower
   critical slosh length yields an enhanced roll stability limit under
   medium- and high-fill conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{A device to measure pulp electrical conductivity in an industrial
   environment has been developed. It is based on a variable oscillator
   circuit whose output period of oscillation is proportional to the sample
   conductivity. This circuit requires a single point for its calibration,
   which facilitates its use in an industrial environment. A Nexys2 FPGA
   (Field Programmable Gate Array) is used to measure the oscillation
   period, display the data on a LCD screen, communicate the information to
   a computer by RS-232 and manage the switching of sample probes for
   multiple measurements. Results have confirmed a linear relationship
   between frequency and resistance over a wide operational range, between
   0.1 mS/cm and 10 mS/cm. Its application in an industrial flotation
   process in order to estimate froth depth and gas hold-up without prior
   calibration under certain conditions is also explained and validated.

Abstract = {{In this study, four CO2 carriers were examined through 31
   carbonation-calcination cycles. The carriers included one natural
   limestone (Cadomin) and three modified calcium oxide-based sorbents,
   Cadomin-calcium aluminate cement pellets (CD-CA-14), Cadomin-silica-sol
   pellets (CD-Si), and Cadomin-mesostructured silica core/shell pellets
   (CD-CS). The modified sorbents were not only prepared using two
   different binders (calcium aluminate cement, CA-14, and silica-sol,
   HS-40), but the CD-CS sample was provided with a protective porous shell
   (using a mesoporous silica layer). Natural Cadomin limestone was the
   base common to the modified sorbents. The surface morphology and
   porosity of these sorbents before and after different cycles were
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen
   physisorption (BET/BJH). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also used to
   identify the crystal phase composition of the sorbents before and after
   calcination. The results showed that the presence of the Mayenite phase
   (Ca12Al14O33) in the CD-CA-14 pellets led to slower decay in sorbent
   activity with increased number of cycles. Although the CD-CS pellets
   showed the best performance in the retention of CO2 uptake activity over
   31 cycles, with an activity loss of only 46\%, the pellet shells
   experienced severe disintegration during the first few cycles. (C) 2013

Title = {{Implementation of an automatic calibration procedure for HYDROTEL based

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3947-3961}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Efficiency of hydrological models mostly depends on the quality of the
   calibration performed prior to use. In this paper, an automatic
   calibration framework for the distributed hydrological model HYDROTEL is
   proposed. The calibration procedure was performed for three watersheds
   characterized with different hydroclimatological conditions: the
   Sassandra located in Ivory Coast, Africa, and the Montmorency and
   Beaurivage watersheds located in Quebec (Canada). Results of one-a-time
   (OAT) sensitivity analysis showed that the order of the most sensitive
   parameters differs for each watershed. Thus, the sensitivity depends on
   the hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics of the watersheds.
   Co-linearity indices showed that all model parameters were identifiable,
   that is, none of the studied parameters could be explained by a
   combination of the other parameters. Following these findings, an
   automatic calibration was run. Results indicated there was good
   agreement between simulated and measured streamflows at the outlet of
   each watershed; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) ranging between 0.77 and
   0.92 and R2 ranging from 0.87 to 0.97. When comparing NSE and R2 values
   obtained using a process-oriented, multiple-objective, manual
   calibration strategy, a slight increase in model efficiency was reached
   with the automatic calibration procedure (4.15\% for NSE and 2.95\% for
   R2) improving predictions of peak flows for the Montmorency and
   Beaurivage watersheds (temperate climate conditions) and flows beyond
   the rainfall season in the Sassandra watershed. The proposed automatic
   calibration procedure introduced in this paper may be applied to other
   distributed hydrological model. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Compacted materials are fundamentally unsaturated soils whose behaviour
   can be expansive or collapsible depending upon changes in water content
   or stresses. Their behaviour is strongly dependent upon matric suction,
   water content, and stress history.
   This paper presents a methodology for investigating the stress/strain,
   and suction/water content paths during one dimensional compaction of
   unsaturated soils. It focuses on anisotropic behaviour. The testing
   programme was carried out in a new automated oedometer apparatus that
   allows measurement of axial strain, radial and axial stresses, suction,
   and water content during tests.
   The laboratory component used in this study involves kaolin compacted
   with different water contents. After compaction, the soil was subjected
   to wetting while the volumetric changes and stress paths were being
   examined. The results were interpreted within an anisotropic
   elasto-plastic framework. The proposed methodology provides new insights
   into the behaviour of unsaturated soils during compaction and wetting.

Abstract = {{Since triolein is the main constituent of most oils such as olive and
   high oleic sunflower oils, self-metathesis of this triacylglycerol at
   mild reaction conditions was investigated via a heterogeneous approach,
   in the presence of ZnCl2-modified mesoporous alumina supported
   methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) as a catalyst. Both intra and intermolecular
   metathesis reactions were observed. While, 9-octadecene, dimers and
   trimers of the triacylglycerol were isolated, intermolecular cyclization
   metathesis products were also obtained. The MTO-based catalyst was found
   to be highly chemoselective affording only desired metathesis product
   formation. In contrast, more than 50\% of triolein was converted to
   undesired solid product in the presence of the homogeneous Grubbs 2nd
   generation catalyst. Triolein metathesis products were effectively
   separated by chromatographic techniques and identified using mass
   spectrometric and NMR analyses. The reported results show that
   3\%MTO/ZnCl2-Al2O3-meso is an efficient and selective heterogeneous
   catalyst for bulky functionalized olefins metathesis such as
   triacylglycerols and edible oils, avoiding the use of costly homogeneous
   catalysts, or the use other rhenium-based catalysts with toxic promoters
   such as R4Sn. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is defined as ``an interdisciplinary field that
   applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the
   development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve
   tissue function.{''} The biological substitutes can be developed with
   the help of natural or synthetic materials. Polymeric materials are
   primarily used, because of the high variability in mechanical, physical,
   and chemical properties. Biodegradable polymers are object of the
   majority of studies, because of the ability to be degraded by the host
   organism, avoiding late stent thrombosis unlike permanent grafts.
   Poly-L-lactide acid (PLLA) is one of the most used polymers in research.
   In order to improve the material's bioactivity, in this work, PLLA
   surface was modified by grafted arginine-glycine-glutamine (RGD), a
   fibronectin derived adhesion motif, and
   serine-isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (SIKVAV), a laminin
   derived motif, and rat cardiac (H9C2) and mouse (C2C12) myoblasts
   proliferation and differentiation on modified PLLA were evaluated. In
   order to verify the surface modification, x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy analysis was performed. After seeding, cells' viability was
   confirmed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
   bromide assay while proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression was
   used to investigate cell proliferation. Myf5, Myogenin and Myosin heavy
   chain were used to analyze cell differentiation. Moreover, RGD peptide
   slightly inhibited rat myoblast (H9C2) proliferation, whereas less
   strong effect was observed on C2C12. However, both cell lines showed to
   enhance the contractile phenotype in the presence of SIKVAV peptides.
   These results suggest that bioactive molecules grafting could be useful
   on polymeric scaffolds for guiding cell phenotype expression, and, to
   ultimately maintain adequate biological characteristics suitable for the
   tissue functional regeneration. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Title = {{On the long term antibacterial features of silver-doped diamondlike
   carbon coatings deposited via a hybrid plasma process}},
Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},

Abstract = {{Environmental surfaces are increasingly recognized as important sources
   of transmission of hospital-acquired infections. The use of
   antibacterial surface coatings may constitute an effective solution to
   reduce the spread of contamination in healthcare settings, provided that
   they exhibit sufficient stability and a long-term antibacterial effect.
   In this study, silver-incorporated diamondlike carbon films (Ag-DLC)
   were prepared in a continuous, single-step plasma process using a
   hybrid, inductively coupled plasma reactor combined with a
   very-low-frequency sputtering setup. The average Ag concentration in the
   films, ranging from 0 to 2.4 at. \%, was controlled by varying the
   sputtering bias on the silver target. The authors found that the
   activity of Escherichia coli was reduced by 2.5 orders of magnitude,
   compared with the control surface, after a 4-h contact with a 2.4 at. \%
   Ag-DLC coating. The coatings displayed slow release kinetics, with a
   total silver ion release in the sub-ppb range after 4 h in solution, as
   measured by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy. This was
   confirmed by Kirby-Bauer diffusion tests, which showed limited diffusion
   of biocidal silver with a localized antibacterial effect. As a slow and
   continuous release is mandatory to ensure a lasting antibacterial
   effect, the newly developed Ag-DLC coatings appears as promising
   materials for environmental hospital surfaces. (C) 2014 American Vacuum

Title = {{Falling weight deflectometer analysis of flexible pavement structure

Abstract = {{Through past decades of research, water has been acknowledged as one of
   the main parameters influencing the long-term performance of flexible
   pavements. The effect of water is a factor considered when designing
   structural and geometrical pavements. However, it unavoidably
   infiltrates pavement layered structures through various mechanisms. As a
   result, additional drainage layers, such as geocomposites, are
   considered among the solutions available to manage excess water in
   flexible pavement structures. This paper presents the analysis of
   drainage and structural behaviour of full scale experimental pavements
   built with various geocomposite drainage configurations. The tests were
   conducted at an outdoor research facility, the Laval University
   Experimental Pavement Site. Following an increase of the water table in
   controlled drainage conditions, the drainage and structural response of
   the experimental pavement sections were measured using volumetric water
   content transducers and a falling weight deflectometer during ten days.
   The overall results suggest that a lateral vertical drain is the best
   performing drainage configuration. Nevertheless, several observations on
   the effect of various drainage configurations according to their
   transversal and vertical position in the pavement were made using the
   collected experimental data.}},

Title = {{Planck intermediate results XVII. Emission of dust in the diffuse
   interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{566}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The dust-HI correlation is used to characterize the emission properties
   of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) from far infrared
   wavelengths to microwave frequencies. The field of this investigation
   encompasses the part of the southern sky best suited to study the cosmic
   infrared and microwave backgrounds. We cross-correlate sky maps from
   Planck, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the diffuse
   infrared background experiment (DIRBE), at 17 frequencies from 23 to
   3000 GHz, with the Parkes survey of the 21 cm line emission of neutral
   atomic hydrogen, over a contiguous area of 7500 deg(2) centred on the
   southern Galactic pole. We present a general methodology to study the
   dust-H I correlation over the sky, including simulations to quantify
   uncertainties. Our analysis yields four specific results. (1) We map the
   temperature, submillimetre emissivity, and opacity of the dust per
   H-atom. The dust temperature is observed to be anti-correlated with the
   dust emissivity and opacity. We interpret this result as evidence of
   dust evolution within the diffuse ISM. The mean dust opacity is measured
   to be (7.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(-27) cm(2) H-1 x (nu/353 GHz)(1.53 +/- 0.03)
   for 100 <= nu <= 353 GHz. This is a reference value to estimate hydrogen
   column densities from dust emission at submillimetre and millimetre
   wavelengths. (2) We map the spectral index beta(mm) of dust emission at
   millimetre wavelengths (defined here as nu <= 353GHz), and find it to be
   remarkably constant at beta(mm) = 1.51 +/- 0.13. We compare it with the
   far infrared spectral index beta(FIR) derived from greybody fits at
   higher frequencies, and find a systematic difference, beta(mm) -
   beta(FIR) = -0.15, which suggests that the dust spectral energy
   distribution (SED) flattens at nu <= 353 GHz. (3) We present spectral
   fits of the microwave emission correlated with Hi from 23 to 353 GHz,
   which separate dust and anomalous microwave emission (AME). We show that
   the flattening of the dust SED can be accounted for with an additional
   component with a blackbody spectrum. This additional component, which
   accounts for (26 +/- 6)\% of the dust emission at 100GHz, could
   represent magnetic dipole emission. Alternatively, it could account for
   an increasing contribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the
   emissivity of amorphous silicates, at millimetre wavelengths. These
   interpretations make different predictions for the dust polarization
   SED. (4) We analyse the residuals of the dust-Hi correlation. We
   identify a Galactic contribution to these residuals, which we model with
   variations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of
   our correlation analysis. This model of the residuals is used to
   quantify uncertainties of the CIB power spectrum in a companion Planck
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Failure of bridges due to local scour in the vicinity of bridge
   abutments is a common occurrence. In this study, experiments under two
   different channel conditions were conducted to assess the impacts of
   vegetation on channel banks on local scour around a wing-wall abutment
   with circular edges. Some experiments were conducted in channel with
   vegetation on channel banks, and other experiments in channel without
   vegetation on channel.. bank. The flow velocity and Reynolds stress
   distributions in scour holes around a wing-wall abutment with circular
   edges were compared under these 2 different channel conditions. Results
   reveal that the vegetated-banks can reduce the time for achieving the
   equilibrium condition from 17 h to 9 h. Also, vegetated-bank channels
   can result in a significant decrease in the maximum scour depth from
   0.084 m (for bare channel bank) to 0.00032 m. Additionally, around the
   abutment, vegetated-banks play a significant role in diminishing the
   Reynolds stress (RS) near the bed and removing negative values in RS
   distribution by weakening unfavorable pressure gradient and down-flow in
   the upstream of abutment.}},

Abstract = {{An Au/TiO2 nanostructure was constructed to obtain a highly efficient
   visible-light-driven photocatalyst. The design was based on a
   three-dimensional ordered assembly of thin-shell Au/TiO2 hollow
   nanospheres (Au/TiO2-3DHNSs). The designed photocatalysts exhibit not
   only a very high surface area but also photonic behavior and multiple
   light scattering, which significantly enhances visible-light absorption.
   Thus Au/TiO2-3DHNSs exhibit a visible-light-driven photocatalytic
   activity that is several times higher than conventional Au/TiO2
   nanopowders.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIOs) with
   diameters <5 nm hold great promise as T-1-positive contrast agents for
   in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. However, control of the surface
   chemistry of USPIOs to ensure individual colloidal USPIOs with a ligand
   monolayer and to impart biocompatibility and enhanced colloidal
   stability is essential for successful clinical applications. Herein, an
   effective and versatile strategy enabling the development of aqueous
   colloidal USPIOs stabilized with well-defined multidentate block
   copolymers (MDBCs) is reported. The multifunctional MDBCs are designed
   to consist of an anchoring block possessing pendant carboxylates as
   multidentate anchoring groups strongly bound to USPIO surfaces and a
   hydrophilic block having pendant hydrophilic oligo(ethylene oxide)
   chains to confer water dispersibility and biocompatibility. The surface
   of USPIOs is saturated with multiple anchoring groups of MDBCs, thus
   exhibiting excellent long-term colloidal stability as well as enhanced
   colloidal stability at biologically relevant electrolyte, pH, and
   temperature conditions. Furthermore, relaxometric properties as well as
   in vitro and in vivo MR imaging results demonstrate that the
   MDBC-stabilized USPIO colloids hold great potential as an effective T-1
   contrast agent.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends synchrophasor algorithms approximating C37.118.1
   filtering requirements to provide phasor measurement units (PMUs) with
   the capability of accurately tracking single-phase harmonic phasors
   subject to varying nominal frequency and out-of band interharmonic
   interference. The fastest solution is built on a Kalman filter (KF) bank
   responding with notches at harmonic frequencies, while the most accurate
   solution relies on a five-cycle finite-impulse-response filter with more
   than 80-dB harmonic rejection. Highly distorted standardized test
   signals following WECC and Hydro-Quebec experiences for stressed
   transmission systems and IEC recommendations for medium-and low-voltage
   system distortions are used to demonstrate the good performance of the
   two algorithms in tracking nonstationary fundamental and harmonics
   quantities. The two schemes are compared advantageously in terms of
   computation speed and performance with a four-cycle short-time fast
   Fourier transform algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of harmonic
   phasors-enabled PMUs is demonstrated on a generation-rich microgrid
   subjected to a severe fault, followed by an offnominal frequency
   operation in islanded mode and subsequent grid re-synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two trajectory-planning approaches for the
   point-to-point motion of planar two-degree-of-freedom (dof)
   cable-suspended parallel mechanisms. The proposed techniques can be used
   to plan trajectories that extend beyond the static workspace of the
   mechanism. Trajectories are specified as a list of target points that
   must be reached in sequence, with a zero velocity at each of the target
   points. In the first technnique, polynomial trajectories are designed to
   connect the target points, while the second approach uses trigonometric
   functions. Both techniques ensure continuity of the accelerations. Based
   on the dynamic model of the robot, algebraic inequalities are obtained
   that represent the constraints on cable tensions. These inequalities are
   used to determine the feasibility of the planned trajectories.
   Polynomial trajectories must be discretized in order to verify
   feasibility, while trajectories that are based on trigonometric
   functions can be verified globally, based on a set of simple algebraic
   equations. Example trajectories are given in order to illustrate the
   approach. An experimental validation is also presented using a two-dof
   prototype, and two video extensions are provided to demonstrate the
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis is used for the
   production of cheeses and other fermented dairy products. Accidental
   infection of L. lactis cells by virulent lactococcal tailed phages is
   one of the major risks of fermentation failures in industrial dairy
   factories. Lactococcal phage 1358 possesses a host range limited to a
   few L. lactis strains and strong genomic similarities to Listeria
   phages. We report here the X-ray structures of phage 1358 receptor
   binding protein (RBP) in complex with monosaccharides. Each monomer of
   its trimeric RBP is formed of two domains: a ``shoulder{''} domain
   linking the RBP to the rest of the phage and a jelly roll fold
   ``head/host recognition{''} domain. This domain harbors a saccharide
   binding crevice located in the middle of a monomer. Crystal structures
   identified two sites at the RBP surface, similar to 8 angstrom from each
   other, one accommodating a GlcNAc monosaccharide and the other
   accommodating a GlcNAc or a glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) monosaccharide.
   GlcNAc and GlcNAc1P are components of the polysaccharide pellicle that
   we identified at the cell surface of L. lactis SMQ-388, the host of
   phage 1358. We therefore modeled a galactofuranose (Galf) sugar bridging
   the two GlcNAc saccharides, suggesting that the trisaccharidic motif
   GlcNAc-Galf-GlcNAc (or Glc1P) might be common to receptors of
   genetically distinct lactococcal phages p2, TP091-1, and 1358. Strain
   specificity might therefore be elicited by steric clashes induced by the
   remaining components of the pellicle hexasaccharide. Taken together,
   these results provide a first insight into the molecular mechanism of
   host receptor recognition by lactococcal phages.}},

   investigated. Electrochemical corrosion experiments using the

   is significantly dependent on the process parameters, such as the CO2
   loading and the presence of oxygen. In addition, the value of the
   corrosion rate is sensitive to the type of ionic liquid added. Moreover,
   the results show that ionic liquids possess the ability of suppressing
   severe operational problems of corrosion in typical CO2 capture plants

Abstract = {{Wood has been routinely employed in decorative arts, as well as in
   sculptures and paintings (support) during the Middle Ages, because of
   its unique aesthetic virtues. It may safely be assumed that wood, as a
   material for monumental sculpture, was much more commonly employed in
   the mediaeval period than existing examples would seem to indicate
   (Bulletin of the metropolitan Museum of Art, 2013). Wood is easily
   obtainable; it could be carved and put in place with less difficulty
   than stone, it is chemically stable when dry, and its surface offers a
   compatible substrate for paint application. However, the use of wood is
   not without pitfalls, and requires an understanding of its anisotropic
   and hygroscopic nature. It is also dimensionally unstable and subject to
   deterioration by fungi and insects. Moisture-related dimensional changes
   are certainly among the most challenging problems in painting
   conservation. With the purpose of preventing important damages, the use
   of non-or microdestructive testing (NDT) techniques is undoubtedly of
   paramount interest for painted wooden statues of great value. This work
   has a threefold purpose: (1) to validate the effectiveness of an
   integrated approach using near-infrared (NIR) reflectography, square
   pulse thermography (SPT), and holographic interferometry (HI) techniques
   for discovering old repairs and/or inclusions of foreign materials in a
   wooden structure, (2) to confirm and approximately date the restoration
   carried out by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and
   energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (that is assembled with a
   scanning electron microscopy-SEM) techniques, and (3) to combine into a
   multidisciplinary approach two quantitative NDT results coming from
   optical and thermographic methods. The subject of the present study was
   a statue named ``Virgin with her Child{''} (XIV century), whose origins
   are mysterious and not properly documented.}},

Abstract = {{Present soil P cycling models and the related ecosystem services such as
   P retention deny the special properties of compositional data resulting
   from closure and leading to methodological inconsistencies and
   pathological behavior. Our objective was to elaborate and interpret a
   hierarchy of supervised balances between components of the soil P cycle
   computed as isometric log ratios (ilr) to avoid biases when assessing P
   risk in managed terrestrial ecosystems. Fourty-one acid sandy soils, 56
   acid to neutral loamy to clayey soils and 41 acid organic soils (10
   fibric or hemic peat and 31 sapric `moorsh' or `muck' materials) were
   collected in Quebec, Canada, analyzed for resin-P, NaHCO3-P, NaOH-P and
   residual P fractions, arranged into a hierarchy of sound balances and
   classified for the risk of P leaching. Pathological behavior was shown
   by spurious correlations between P fractions varying in magnitude, sign
   and significance depending on what was considered as the ``whole{''}
   (e.g. total P or soil dry matter). Discriminant analysis across unbiased
   balances showed that the balances related to soil genesis dominated P
   biogeochemistry. Soils at low or high P risk for P leaching showed
   contrasting degrees of P-o and P-i loads. Low-and high-P risk loamy and
   clayey soils differed significantly for balances relating labile to
   slowly available Pi, as well as those relating P-i to P-o Low-and high-P
   risk sandy soils were contrasted by the balance relating
   oxalate-extractable Al and Fe. Peat and `moorsh' materials differed in
   most ilrs. As soils loose ecosystem services provided by soil P
   geochemical and biological pools in terms of P-fractions balances,
   terrestrial ecosystems become less sustainable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{883}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although it provides a relatively good picture of the nucleons, the
   Skyrme Model is unable to reproduce the small binding energy in nuclei.
   This suggests that Skyrme-like models that nearly saturate the
   Bogomol'nyi bound may be more appropriate since their mass is roughly
   proportional to the baryon number A. For that purpose, we propose a
   near-BPS Skyrme Model. It consists of terms up to order six in
   derivatives of the pion fields, including the nonlinear and Skyrme terms
   which are assumed to be relatively small. For our special choice of mass
   term, we obtain well-behaved analytical BPS-type solutions with constant
   baryon density configurations, as opposed to the more complex shell-like
   configurations found in most extensions of the Skyrme Model. Fitting the
   four model parameters, we find a remarkable agreement for the binding
   energy per nucleon B/A with respect to experimental data. These results
   support the idea that nuclei could be near-BPS Skyrmions. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Research in the field of bioengineered skin substitutes is motivated by
   the need to find new dressings for people affected by skin injuries
   (burns, diabetic ulcers), and to develop adequate skin models to test
   new formulations developed in vitro. Thanks to advances in tissue
   engineering, it is now possible to produce human skin substitutes
   without any exogenous material, using the self-assembly method developed
   by the Laboratoire d'Organogenese Experimentale. These human skin
   substitutes consist of a dermis and a stratified epidermis (stratum
   corneum and living epidermis). Raman microspectroscopy has been used to
   characterize and compare the molecular organization of skin substitutes
   with normal human skin. Our results confirm that the stratum corneum is
   a layer rich in lipids which are well ordered (trans conformers) in both
   substitutes and normal human skin. The amount of lipids decreases and
   more gauche conformers appear in the living epidermis in both cases.
   However, the results also show that there are fewer lipids in the
   substitutes and that the lipids are more organized in the normal human
   skin. Concerning the secondary structure of proteins and protein
   content, the data show that they are similar in the substitutes and in
   the normal human skin. In fact, the epidermis is rich in a-keratin,
   whereas the dermis contains mainly type I collagen. (C) 2014 Acta

Abstract = {{Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen that can cause
   septicemia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Also recognized as an emerging
   zoonotic agent, it is responsible for outbreaks of human infections in
   Asian countries. Serotype 2 is the predominant isolate from diseased
   animals and humans. The aerosolization of S. suis in the air of swine
   confinement buildings (SCB) was studied. The presence of S. suis in
   bioaerosols was monitored in SCB where cases of infection had been
   reported and in healthy SCB without reported infections. Using a
   quantitative-PCR (qPCR) method, we determined the total number of
   bacteria (1 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(8) airborne/m(3)), total number of S. suis
   bacteria (4 x 10(5) to 10 x 10(5) airborne/m(3)), and number of S. suis
   serotype 2 and 1/2 bacteria (1 x 10(3) to 30 x 10(3) airborne/m(3))
   present in the air. S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 were detected in the air
   of all growing/finishing SCB that had documented cases of S. suis
   infection and in 50\% of healthy SCB. The total number of bacteria and
   total numbers of S. suis and S. suis serotype 2 and 1/2 bacteria were
   monitored in one positive SCB during a 5-week period, and it was shown
   that the aerosolized S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 remain airborne for a
   prolonged period. When the effect of aerosolization on S. suis was
   observed, the percentage of intact S. suis bacteria (showing cell
   membrane integrity) in the air might have been up to 13\%. Finally S.
   suis was found in nasal swabs from 14 out of 21 healthy finishing-SCB
   workers, suggesting significant exposure to the pathogen. This report
   provides a better understanding of the aerosolization, prevalence, and
   persistence of S. suis in SCB.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of tightening of environmental legislation, there is a
   renewed interest in the technology of alkali activated concrete also
   known as geopolymer concrete (GPC). Yet, for GPC to assume its own niche
   in the construction market, it must display equal or better properties
   at elevated temperatures than Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete.
   Currently there is sufficient evidence that GPC has a better resistance
   to fire; however not all of its behavioural aspects at high temperatures
   have been investigated. The aim of this research therefore is to
   investigate its deformational behaviour, in particular the existence or
   lack of transient creep, which OPC is known to undergo under first time
   heating when subject to compressive stresses. It was found that not only
   GPC undergoes transient creep, but also exhibits both expansive and
   contractive volume changes during heating. It was also found that GPC
   maintains its structural integrity at 1000 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Common probabilistic scores are used to evaluate the performance and

   The kriging variance is used jointly with the best linear unbiased
   estimator at the interpolation sites to render an ensemble of rainfall

   uncertainty of the interpolated field. Tests are conducted with rainfall
   data, extending from June 1, 2000, to October 31, 2005, from 50 stations
   located in the Saint Lawrence Valley, Canada. Three categories of
   variograms are examined: automated variograms that change at each time
   step; variable variograms that associate an average variogram to a
   specific interval of mean areal rainfall; and unique variograms, which
   are averages over the whole series. Simple, ordinary, and universal
   kriging are also examined. Rainfall scenarios constructed from automated
   variograms, simple kriging, and 30 neighboring stations presented
   acceptable sharpness and overall performance, including reliable
   exceedance probability and confidence intervals. An optimal choice of
   neighborhood is critical to performance and reliability.}},

Title = {{Comparison of the direct burst pressure and the ring tensile test
   methods for mechanical characterization of tissue-engineered vascular

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering provides a promising alternative for small diameter
   vascular grafts, especially with the self-assembly method. It is crucial
   that these grafts possess mechanical properties that allow them to
   withstand physiological flow and pressure without being damaged.
   Therefore, an accurate assessment of their mechanical properties,
   especially the burst pressure, is essential prior to clinical release.
   In this study, the burst pressure of self-assembled tissue-engineered
   vascular substitutes was first measured by the direct method, which
   consists in pressurizing the construct with fluid until tissue failure.
   It was then compared to the burst pressure estimated by Laplace's law
   using data from a ring tensile test. The major advantage of this last
   method is that it requires a significantly smaller tissue sample.
   However, it has been reported as overestimating the burst pressure
   compared to a direct measurement. In the present report, it was found
   that an accurate estimation of the burst pressure may be obtained from a
   ring tensile test when failure internal diameter is used as the diameter
   parameter in Laplace's law. Overestimation occurs with the method
   previously reported, i.e. when the unloaded internal diameter is used
   for calculations. The estimation of other mechanical properties was also
   investigated. It was demonstrated that data from a ring tensile test
   provide an accurate estimate of the failure strain and the stiffness of
   the constructs when compared to measurements with the direct method. (C)

Abstract = {{Observations (e. g. Phillips, Heckman et al., Martin) have revealed cold
   gas with large velocity dispersions (approximate to 300 km s(-1)) within
   the hot outflows of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). This gas
   may trace its origin to the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) fragmentation of a
   super-bubble or may arise on smaller scales. We model a ULIRG outflow at
   two scales to recreate this gas in three-dimensional hydrodynamic
   simulations using FLASH. Although resolution is limited, these models
   successfully produce cold gas in outflows with large velocity
   dispersions. Our small-scale models produce this cold gas through RT
   fragmentation of the super-bubble wall, but the large-scale models
   produce the cold gas after hot bubbles fragment the disc's gas into cold
   clouds which are then accelerated by thermal pressure, and supplemented
   by cooling within the outflow. We produce simple mock spectra to compare
   these simulations to observed absorption spectra and find line-widths of
   approximate to 250 km s(-1), agreeing with the lower end of
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{The mineral carbonation of five different ultramafic mining residues was
   studied experimentally, namely chrysotile (Black Lake mine {[}B1] and
   Asbestos mine {[}Asb]), nickel (Ni-Cu Dumont mine project {[}Du] and
   Raglan Ni-Cu-EGP mine {[}Rg1]) and diamond mine residues (Renard mine
   project {[}Rnd]). The CO2 uptake, gas volume and mining residue physical
   and chemical characteristics were monitored in a fixed-bed diffusion
   cell to determine their potential for direct ambient carbon dioxide
   capture and to identify specific parameters influencing their
   reactivity. The various samples exhibited different behavior when
   reacted with gaseous CO2. Brucite- and (fibrous serpentine)
   chrysotile-containing residues exhibited higher pore-water pH,
   carbonation rate and yield with brucite content broadly dictating the
   reaction progress. Massive serpentines such as
   lizardite/antigorite-containing residues were found to weakly dissolve
   which significantly reduced their carbonation rate. The Mg-bru/Mg-tot
   ratio (brucitic Mg-total Mg atom ratio) and the percentage of fibers
   were thus the key parameters controlling the direct carbonation of
   alkaline mining residues. Recourse to alkaline and alkaline-earth metal
   contents to assess mining residue carbonation capacity may lead to
   inaccurate estimates as the residue Mg/Si and Mg/Fe ratios were found to
   greatly control the carbonation capacity through silica gel coating
   (high Si content) or/and iron (III) hydroxide passivation (high Fe
   content). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Non-destructive testing (NDT) plays a critical role in controlling the
   structural integrity (therefore the quality) of aeronautical parts,
   during fabrication as well as during maintenance. Eddy current (EC)
   testing is one of the most used NDT techniques in the aerospace
   industry. However, EC testing is still mainly performed by human
   operators and reliability as well as repeatability is not always
   guaranteed. To solve these issues, automating this NOT technique with a
   robotic system is investigated. In this paper, an EC probe equipped with
   a passive compliant system is assumed to be attached to the end-effector
   of a 6-DOF manipulator arm to carry on the inspection. Then, assuming
   that a 3D model of the inspected part is known a priori, a coverage path
   planning method using a zigzag (or rastering) pattern adapted to EC
   testing on aeronautical structures with a complex geometry is proposed.
   To reach this objective, the approach adopted in this work is to adapt
   existing coverage path planning techniques based on a
   ``divideand-conquer{''} strategy used for spraying applications to EC
   inspection. More precisely, three successive segmentations are applied
   to the surface to be inspected so that consistent rastering paths can be
   generated. Simulation results are shown for a complex part of an
   aeronautical structure to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Potential role of bacteria packaging by protozoa in the persistence and
   transmission of pathogenic bacteria}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Many pathogenic bacteria live in close association with protozoa. These
   unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms are ubiquitous in various
   environments. A number of protozoa such as amoebae and ciliates ingest
   pathogenic bacteria, package them usually in membrane structures, and
   then release them into the environment. Packaged bacteria are more
   resistant to various stresses and are more apt to survive than free
   bacteria. New evidence indicates that protozoa and not bacteria control
   the packaging process. It is possible that packaging is more common than
   suspected and may play a major role in the persistence and transmission
   of pathogenic bacteria. To confirm the role of packaging in the
   propagation of infections, it is vital that the molecular mechanisms
   governing the packaging of bacteria by protozoa be identified as well as
   elements related to the ecology of this process in order to determine
   whether packaging acts as a Trojan Horse.}},

   steadier focus, faster volume scans, and simpler stereoscopic imaging}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Two-photon microscopy has revolutionized functional cellular imaging in
   tissue, but although the highly confined depth of field (DOE) of
   standard set-ups yields great optical sectioning, it also limits imaging
   speed in volume samples and ease of use. For this reason, we recently
   presented a simple and retrofittable modification to the two-photon
   laser-scanning microscope which extends the DOE through the use of an
   axicon (conical lens). Here we demonstrate three significant benefits of
   this technique using biological samples commonly employed in the field
   of neuroscience. First, we use a sample of neurons grown in culture and
   move it along the z-axis, showing that a more stable focus is achieved
   without compromise on transverse resolution. Second, we monitor 3D
   population dynamics in an acute slice of live mouse cortex,
   demonstrating that faster volumetric scans can be conducted. Third, we
   acquire a stereoscopic image of neurons and their dendrites in a fixed
   sample of mouse cortex, using only two scans instead of the complete
   stack and calculations required by standard systems. Taken together,
   these advantages, combined with the ease of integration into
   pre-existing systems, make the extended depth-of-field imaging based on
   Bessel beams a strong asset for the field of microscopy and life
   sciences in general.}},

Abstract = {{Osmotic dehydration of whole seabuckthorn berries, followed by

   pretreatment to maximize dehydration rate and to increase sugar gain
   during osmotic dehydration. An evaluation of moisture loss and sugar
   gain kinetics during osmotic dehydration of seabuckthorn fruits
   pretreated with liquid nitrogen, followed by vacuum or hot-air drying,
   was then performed. Loss of nutritional compounds due to processing was
   also measured. Sugar intake and partial dehydration of seabuckthorn
   samples increased with osmosis time and reached an equilibrium value
   after 4h treatment. The finish drying methods (vacuum or convective)
   applied after OD showed a marked impact on the remaining moisture
   content of seabuckthorn samples. Concentration of some nutritional
   compounds was, however, dramatically reduced after the combined osmotic

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to study the kinetics and required operation
   conditions for the formation of various manganese oxides using the
   SO2/O-2 gas mixture as the oxidant agent. This promising approach
   presents some obvious economical advantages over traditional

   increasing the temperature of the reaction allows modifying the
   oxidation potential, thus facilitating the oxidation product synthesis.
   However, at 25 degrees C by varying the SO2/O-2 ratio and the gas
   mixture flow rate, it was not possible to modify this potential. It was
   also observed that manganese dioxide (MnO2) is formed between 20 and 50
   degrees C (activation energy (E-a) = 14.33 kJ/mol), oxyhydroxide of
   manganese (MnO center dot OH) is obtained between 55 and 65 degrees C
   (E-a = 25.14 kJ/mol), and manganese(II, III) oxide (Mn3O4) is produced

Abstract = {{Using a large N-body cosmological simulation combined with a subgrid
   treatment of galaxy formation, merging, and tidal destruction, we study
   the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a
   comoving volume (100 Mpc)(3) in a.CDM universe. At z = 0, our
   computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass M-cl > 1.1x10(12)
   M-circle dot, including 18 massive clusters with M-cl > 10(14) M-circle
   dot. It also contains 1,088,797 galaxies with mass M-gal >= 2 x 10(9)
   M-circle dot and luminosity L > 9.5 x 10(5) L-circle dot. For each
   cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We then
   computed two separate statistics: the fraction f(BNC) of clusters in
   which the BCG is not the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in
   projection, and the ratio Delta upsilon/sigma, where Delta upsilon is
   the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the whole cluster
   and sigma is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. We found
   that f(BNC) increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M-cl similar to
   10(12) M-circle dot) to 0.5 for high-mass clusters (M-cl > 10(14) M
   circle dot) with very little dependence on cluster redshift. Most of
   this result turns out to be a projection effect and when we consider
   three-dimensional distances instead of projected distances, f(BNC)
   increases only to 0.2 at high-cluster mass. The values of Delta
   upsilon/sigma vary from 0 to 1.8, with median values in the range
   0.03-0.15 when considering all clusters, and 0.12-0.31 when considering
   only massive clusters. These results are consistent with previous
   observational studies and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm,
   which states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the
   cluster, is usually valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored.
   We built merger trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the
   simulation. Analysis of these trees reveal that 16 of these clusters
   have experienced 1 or several major or semi-major mergers in the past.
   These mergers leave each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but
   eventually the cluster settles into an equilibrium configuration, unless
   it is disturbed by another major or semi-major merger. We found evidence
   that these mergers are responsible for the off-center positions and
   peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the
   merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merging of
   smaller groups in which the galaxies have already formed, including the
   galaxy destined to become the BCG. Finally, we argue that f(BNC) is not
   a very robust statistics, as it is very sensitive to projection and
   selection effects, but that Delta upsilon/sigma is more robust. Still,
   both statistics exhibit a signature of major mergers between clusters of
   galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{The equations that govern the various transport phenomena occurring in a
   polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) were formulated and
   implemented in a commercial finite element software, in order to predict
   the fuel cell current density with respect to the operating conditions.
   The numerical model showed polarization curves in accordance with
   literature. The catalyst utilization was then improved by optimizing the
   platinum distribution (design variable) in the fuel cell, so as to
   maximize current density (objective function) for a fixed total amount
   of platinum (constraint). The first analysis showed that, for equal
   anode and cathode catalyst layer thicknesses, maximal current density
   was achieved by placing more catalyst in the cathode than in the anode.
   The second analysis showed that, for equal anode and cathode catalyst
   layer density, maximal current density was achieved by using a catalyst
   layer that is thicker on the cathode side than that on the anode side.
   Finally, a topological optimization of the platinum density within the
   cathode catalyst layer was performed with a gradient based algorithm,
   and the results showed that at a high stoichiometric ratio, the best
   design has most of its platinum placed where the reaction rate is the
   highest, i.e., close to the membrane layer. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{While most waste foundry sands (WFSs) are not hazardous, regulatory
   agencies are often reluctant to permit their beneficial use in
   agricultural and geotechnical applications due to concerns over metal
   leaching. The objective of this study was to quantify total and Toxicity
   Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) metals in 16 waste sands from
   Brazilian ferrous foundries then assess their potential to leach to
   ground-water using a probabilistic model. Total and TCLP metal
   concentrations in the non-hazardous sands fell within ranges as reported
   in the literature, although some of the leachate concentrations were
   found to exceed drinking water and groundwater maximum contaminant
   levels (MCLs). Leachate values above the MCLs were then used in the
   model to estimate groundwater concentrations at hypothetical wells up to
   400m downgradient from a land application unit. A conservative scenario
   of 1 ha of land applied WFS, and high annual rainfall totals (low
   evaporation) suggested that groundwater concentrations of Ba, Hg, Mn,
   Ni, and Pb could potentially exceed health-based MCLs at most wells.
   While a wet climate can exacerbate the transport of metals, land
   application of WFSs in areas with moderate rainfall totals or high
   rainfall, high evaporation was predicted to be protective of groundwater
   quality and human health.}},

Abstract = {{A novel physical layer authentication scheme is proposed in this paper
   by exploiting the time-varying carrier frequency offset (CFO) associated
   with each pair of wireless communications devices. In realistic
   scenarios, radio frequency oscillators in each transmitter-and-receiver
   pair always present device-dependent biases to the nominal oscillating
   frequency. The combination of these biases and mobility-induced Doppler
   shift, characterized as a time-varying CFO, can be used as a radiometric
   signature for wireless device authentication. In the proposed
   authentication scheme, the variable CFO values at different
   communication times are first estimated. Kalman filtering is then
   employed to predict the current value by tracking the past CFO
   variation, which is modeled as an autoregressive random process. To
   achieve the proposed authentication, the current CFO estimate is
   compared with the Kalman predicted CFO using hypothesis testing to
   determine whether the signal has followed a consistent CFO pattern. An
   adaptive CFO variation threshold is derived for device discrimination
   according to the signal-to-noise ratio and the Kalman prediction error.
   In addition, a software-defined radio (SDR) based prototype platform has
   been developed to validate the feasibility of using CFO for
   authentication. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of
   the proposed scheme in multipath fading channels.}},

   to monitor the surface properties of DSA specimens. Potentiodynamic and

Abstract = {{To counter environmental threats to the water resources polluted by
   NH4+, which is common in wastewaters and agricultural runoff, adsorption
   using mesoporous functional materials represents a promising alternative
   to existing treatment methods. In this study, adsorption of NH4+ ions
   from aqueous solutions was investigated on arene-and propylsulfonic acid
   functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica materials. The adsorbents were
   synthesized via co-condensation and post-synthesis grafting procedures.
   Adsorbents were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, N-2
   physisorption, titration, and elemental analyses. The effects of pH,
   NH4+ initial concentration, temperature, adsorbent loading, organosilane
   molar ratio, and presence of competitive species on the performance of
   the adsorbent materials were examined. All the adsorbents having an
   organosilane/silica molar ratio of 1:5 displayed maximum adsorption
   capacity around approximately 25 mg g(-1) NH4+ at the lowest temperature
   investigated, 5 degrees C. This capacity decreased with increasing
   temperature. For a given initial NH4+ concentration, the removal
   efficiency (W) increased with increasing adsorbent loading. For
   instance, W increased from 24 to 59\% when the adsorbent loading was
   increased from 2 to 10 g L-1 at 25 degrees C. The adsorption isotherms
   were well described by a Langmuir model equation. Adsorption capacity

Abstract = {{Increasing water scarcity in humid regions requires that food production
   increase its water use efficiency. Because the hydraulic characteristics
   of Histosols are different from those of mineral soils, water management
   for vegetable production must be adapted accordingly. The objective of
   this research was to determine the optimal soil water potential for
   irrigating onion (Allium cepa L.), celery (Apium graveolens L.), and
   spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) crops in muck soils. Onion and celery
   were subjected to three irrigation treatments scheduled when tensiometer
   readings reached -10 or -20 kPa for onion and -30 or -50 kPa (2008) and
   -15 or -30 kPa (2009) for celery compared with drier control treatments
   for both crops. For spinach, two irrigation treatments (-10 and -20 kPa)
   and a control (drier) were tested. Optimal onion marketable yields and
   jumbo size were obtained from irrigation at potentials above -20 kPa at
   the bulbing stage. Celery had the best yields with the treatments of
   2009 relative to the drier control. The highest spinach germination rate
   and yield were obtained at -10 kPa. Reliable estimates of the optimal
   thresholds were consistent with calculations performed using a simple
   analytical solution to Richards equation and soil characteristics.
   Irrigation thresholds for matric potential in a muck soil were shown to
   be crop specific and could be derived from a model and basic soil
   hydraulic characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The falling weight deflectometer is a pavement analysis tool that is now
   widely used in the pavement engineering field. Using the backcalculation

   approach proposes to bypass the necessity of the backcalculation by
   allowing a direct estimation of the vertical strain at the top of the
   subgrade using the deflection basin. A model based on a finite element
   theoretical pavement analysis is proposed for this purpose. The
   estimation model revisited existing deflection based index and adapted
   modifications were proposed to consider thicker pavement structures. The
   proposed model to estimate the vertical strain at the top of the
   subgrade is validated and calibrated using data obtained on two
   instrumented experimental sites.}},

Abstract = {{Among the several issues to be considered during fresco's restoration,
   the understanding of the effectiveness of the intervention, the
   identification of the main chemical elements used in previous
   restorations and the attention to weak areas of the building structure,
   adjacent to frescoes, are of paramount importance. This work describes
   an integrated, non-destructive testing approach focusing on these three
   main issues. In particular, two frescoes of Giacomo Farelli are analyzed
   herein. These artworks were affected by a strong earthquake in 2009,
   which had a heavy impact on several cultural heritage objects in
   L'Aquila (Italy), including on the Santa Maria della Croce di Roio
   Church (1625), where these two frescoes are located. One of the
   frescoes, which underwent a restoring before the quake, was previously
   tested by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) before and
   after the restoration. These previous results are compared with new
   measurements carried out after the 2009 earthquake using infrared
   thermography (IRT). The combined approach, ESPI-IRT, clearly highlighted
   that the structure of the frescoes was significantly affected by the
   earthquake, since the old subsurface cracks, restored before 2009, were
   once again evident after the earthquake. In addition, the presence of a
   subsurface niche containing an ancient statue, also detected by means of
   IRT, might contribute to increase the severity of the damages. Finally,
   the joint examination of these frescoes using near-infrared
   reflectography and X-ray diffractometry was crucial to confirm the
   presence of a radioactive chemical element in the wall painting.}},

   assesses the influence of a variation in the DFN model input parameters'
   values on the rock mass peak properties - uniaxial compressive strength,
   Young modulus and Poisson ratio. The results not only highlight the
   possibilities associated with DFN-DEM modeling in characterizing rock
   mass properties at the engineering scale, they also provide a systematic
   way to assess the critical structural parameters controlling the rock

Abstract = {{The products of thermal transformation of MOF-253 (Al-containing MOF)
   and its Pt-based derivative, into carbon-black-based electrocatalyst
   were studied using ac impedance spectroscopy. The thermolysis was
   carried out at 700-1050 degrees C under an inert atmosphere. The
   resulting products were found to possess diverse electrical properties,
   revealed through very different impedance responses. Assynthesized MOF
   material was an insulator with a conductivity of sigma = 1.3 X 10(-11) S
   cm(-1). Products obtained at 700-800 degrees C behaved as semiconductors
   with low room temperature conductivity of ca. sigma approximate to
   10(-6)-10(-5) S cm(-1) and strong thermal dependence (sigma approximate
   to 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 200 degrees C). They exhibited complex impedance
   responses, which may be interpreted as mixed conduction, where
   semiconducting behavior was accompanied by ionic charge transfer. The
   final product obtained at 1050 C exhibited a particular metal-like
   conductance with positive but weak temperature dependence and ambiance
   conductivity of sigma = 9.0 X 10(-2) S cm(-1). The properties of
   Pt/carbon-based material obtained at 950 degrees C seem to be transient
   between the latter two conduction states. Thermolysis of initial MOF-253
   is less hindered and occurs at lower temperatures. The conductivity of
   the final product of pyrolysis at 1050 degrees C of initial MOF-253 was
   inferior to that of Pt-MOF with sigma(25) (degrees)c = 1.0 x 10(-2) S

Abstract = {{The anode electrodes in electrolytic production of aluminum are composed

   initial key publications as well as the latest progress regarding such
   microspheres and their potential use as biological sensors. We cover
   recent work on fluorescent microspheres and their integration in
   microfluidic devices, while addressing the limitations and practical
   requirements of such biodiagnostics. Our aim in this paper is to appeal
   to both biologists and physicists, even if new to this field. We
   conclude by briefly suggesting ways of integrating dielectric
   microspheres and biosensing into college and university courses in both
   physics and in biology. (C) 2014 American Association of Physics

Abstract = {{Background: Early detection of cystic fibrosis (CF) by newborn screening
   (NBS) reduces the rate of avoidable complications. NBS protocols vary by
   jurisdiction and the cost effectiveness of these different protocols is
   debated.
   Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of various CF NBS options.
   Methods: A Markov model was built to simulate the cost effectiveness of
   various CF-NBS options for a hypothetical CF-NBS program over a 5-year
   time horizon assuming its integration into an existing universal NBS
   program. NBS simulated options were based on a combination of tests
   between the two commonly used immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) cutoffs
   (96th percentile and 99.5th percentile) as first tier tests, and, as a
   second tier test, either a second IRT, pancreatic-associated protein
   (PAP) or CFTR mutation panels. CFTR mutation panels were also considered
   as an eventual third tier test. Data input parameters used were
   retrieved from a thorough literature search. Outcomes considered were
   the direct costs borne by the Quebec public health care system and the
   number of cases of CF detected through each strategy, including the
   absence of screening option.
   Results: IRT PAP with an IRT cutoff at the 96th percentile is the most
   favorable option with a ratio of CAD\$28,432 per CF case detected. The
   next most favorable alternative is the IRT1-IRT2 option with an IRT1
   cutoff at the 96th percentile. The no-screening option is dominated by
   all NBS screening protocols considered. Results were robust in
   sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that NBS for cystic fibrosis is a
   cost-effective strategy compared to the absence of NBS. The IRT PAP
   newborn screening algorithm with an IRT cutoff at the 96th percentile is
   the most cost effective NBS approach for Quebec. (C) 2013 European

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{127-139}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of concrete produced with effective
   microorganisms (EM)-based bioplasticizer are investigated by means of
   statistical nanoindentation, and compared to the nanomechanical
   properties of concrete produced with ordinary superplasticizer (SP). The
   resort to nanoindentation enables to survey the elasticity, hardness and
   long-term logarithmic relaxation behavior of calcium silicate hydrates
   (C-S-H) after few minutes only. For each material, a cluster analysis of
   the experimental results yields groupings of indents likely performed on
   C-S-H with distinct packing densities. It is found that the addition of
   EM-based bioplasticizer improves the strength of C-S-H by enhancing the
   cohesion and friction of solid nanograins, and decreases the absolute
   rate of long-term relaxation. The statistical analysis of indentation
   results also suggests that EM-based bioplasticizer inhibits the
   precipitation of C-S-H of higher density. The findings of this work
   corroborate the results of a previous study which attributed an increase
   of homogeneity and a refinement of the crystalline structure of silicate
   phases to the effect of a biomodifier similar to EM-based
   bioplasticizer. The improvement of strength properties of C-S-H is also
   shown to coincide with a gain of compressive strength measured at the
   macroscale of EM-based concrete. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The dynamic evolution of CO2 sequestration using nickel mining residue
   (NiMR) was studied using a specially-designed dual-compartment
   differential fixed-bed diffusion-carbonation cell. Reactivity of NiMR
   material in terms of carbonation uptake was monitored as a function of
   time, initial CO2 composition and liquid saturation. Dynamic tests
   exposed a positive correlation between CO2 breakthrough time across the
   NiMR layer and liquid saturation. Low carbonation rates were observed
   under both dry and completely saturated conditions. The latter suffered
   from slow CO2 diffusion in water whereas the former, despite the
   facilitated transport of gaseous CO2 across NiMR samples, lacked a
   sufficient supply of leached magnesium and dissolved CO2. However, the
   CO2 uptake was substantially stimulated when partially saturated NiMR
   layers were carbonated. The carbonation kinetics was rationalized in
   terms of reaction medium and CO2 dissolved species. Under partially
   saturated conditions, rapid gaseous CO2 diffusion and dissolution in
   interstitial water along with leaching of magnesium were key processes
   in carbonation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use anisotropic complex wavelet transforms to make a multiscale
   analysis of the distribution of fluctuations of dust emission at 250 mu
   m from the Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey of the Herschel Space
   Observatory. By reproducing the Fourier power spectrum with complex
   wavelet transforms we show that different power distributions at each
   scale can have a significant effect on the measured power law. Moreover,
   with an iterative algorithm we separate the Gaussian and non-Gaussian
   part of wavelet coefficient distributions in each scale and azimuthal
   direction. The reconstructed map of non-Gaussian fluctuations is well
   correlated to small-scale structures of the (CO)-C-13 emission map as
   well as its power spectrum which has a power-law index of -2.3. The
   Gaussian part of the map shows more diffuse structures with a steeper
   power law of -3.1. Non-Gaussian coefficients are almost undetectable at
   scales greater than similar to 0.15 arcmin(-1) (similar to 4-26 pc).
   This characteristic scale could be associated with the size of the
   larger molecular cloud in the region. We also demonstrate that
   exponentiated Gaussian random field cannot reproduce the flatter power
   law of the non-Gaussian component observed in the thermal dust emission,
   which seems to be a property of interstellar clouds.}},

   background. These spots propagated with low divergence, significantly
   lower than that given by the nonlinear propagation of a laser beam with

   extraction process that is based on spatial localization of vegetation
   in fields. Features from the weed leaf area distribution are extracted
   from the cultivation inter-rows, then features from the crop are
   inferred from the mixture model equation. Those extracted features are
   then passed to a naive bayesian classifier and a gaussian mixture
   clustering algorithm to discriminate weed from crop plant. The presented
   technique correctly classifies an average of 94 \% of corn and soybean

Abstract = {{Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide. It can be obtained from lactose
   by chemical, enzymatic or by electro-activation synthesis. This review
   provides the comprehension of lactulose production and its application
   in medical, pharmaceutical and functional food applications. Lactulose
   can be used in medical and pharmaceutical applications for the treatment
   of diseases such as chronic constipation, therapy of portal systemic
   encephalopathy, inflammatory bowel disease, reducing blood ammonia
   levels, colon carcinogenesis, tumour prevention and immunology, mineral
   absorption and for the inhibition of the secondary bile acid formation.
   However, with the growing interest in functional foods, the use of

Abstract = {{After reclamation, organic soils tend to shift from net N immobilization
   to net N mineralization. The N amounts mineralized annually can be
   sufficient to cover the N needs of the crop, reducing the need for
   supplemental N fertilization. The objective of this study was to assess
   N budgets and to infer the apparent N mineralization in fertilized and
   unfertilized carrot (Daucus carota L.) crops in an organic soil in
   southwestern Quebec. Five pre-plant N fertilization treatments (0, 25,
   50, 75, and a split 25 + 25 kg N ha(-1)) were applied over a 3-yr period
   to non-irrigated carrots. Crop yield and plant and soil N contents were
   measured. Apparent net N mineralization was an important source of N,
   averaging 117 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Crop yield was not affected by the N
   fertilization rate, by splitting of the fertilizer application or by the
   previous year's crop. Increasing the N fertilizer rate increased the
   soil nitrate content below the root zone (similar to 40 cm below the
   surface), enhancing the risk of nitrate leaching. Thus, because soil N
   mineralization was sufficient for the carrots' requirements in this
   organic soil, supplemental N fertilization was found to be unnecessary
   and could exacerbate the environmental risk of nitrate leaching.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, Al-stabilized CaO-Ni hybrid sorbent-catalysts integrated
   in a single particle with various nickel loadings (12, 18 and 25 wt\%
   NiO) were developed and tested in cyclic hydrogen production by
   sorptionenhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) process. A simple
   wet-mixing technique based on limestone acidification and two-step
   calcination was employed to produce hybrid materials with different
   nickel loadings. All developed materials were characterized by BET, XRD,
   SEM and TEM and studied during 25 CO2 sorption/ regeneration cycles as
   well as for 10 SESMR cycles. Based on both CO2 sorption and SESMR
   results, it was concluded that the proposed hybrid sorbent-catalyst with
   NiO loading of 25 wt\% led to the best performances: (i) CaO molar
   conversion is 41.2\% at the end of the 25th sorption cycle and (ii)
   average CH4 conversion and H-2 production efficiency during 10 SESMR
   cycles are remarkable (99.1\% and 96.1\%, respectively). For the most
   efficient hybrid sorbent-catalyst (25 wt\% NiO), the influence of CH4
   flow rate and steam to carbon ratio (S/C) was also investigated, as well
   as its behavior during long-term cyclic operation of SESMR (30 cycles),
   where the H-2 production time was just limited to pre-breakthrough
   period. The very efficient performance (average of H-2 yield 97.3\%) of
   the proposed hybrid sorbent-catalyst material in long-term operation
   confirmed its high potential for use in SESMR process. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{511}},
Pages = {{82-91}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Control of stormwater basins can be a competitive measure to improve the
   ecohydraulics of urban rivers by increasing the removal efficiency of
   particles and agglomerated contaminants like heavy metals and by
   decreasing hydraulic peak flows. In this paper, we present a simulation
   study that evaluates the potential of ecohydraulic-driven real-time
   control of stormwater basins to improve water quality and decrease
   hydraulic stress in the receiving water body. Nine different static and
   dynamic control scenarios were analysed based on a detailed hydraulic
   and quality model of an existing small urban catchment equipped with a
   stormwater basin at its outlet. Under dynamic control, an outlet valve
   was manipulated to increase retention time. The removal efficiency for
   suspended solids could be significantly increased by all control
   strategies and the hydraulic peaks were reduced by at least 50\%. At the
   same time, overflow of the basin is avoided to prevent flooding. The
   developed dynamic control strategies proved to be advantageous as they
   provide significantly higher removal efficiency for suspended solids and
   a possible flexible adaptation to future demands. The findings of this
   study have been confirmed by field experiments. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Maleated polyethylene (MAPE)/Ground tire rubber (GTR) thermoplastic
   elastomer with 50 vol \% GTR was reinforced by incorporation of talc
   powder and wood flour. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that
   maleated polyethylene (MAPE) has good compatibility with wood flour, but
   the adhesion with talc particles is weak. Tensile moduli of MAPE/GTR
   increase more significantly after inclusion of talc particles compared
   to wood flour. Prediction of the tensile modulus of hybrid
   MAPE/GTR/particle composites is successfully performed using a
   combination of Kerner and Halpin-Tsai models. Elastic moduli are shown
   to depend strongly on both aspect ratio and level of particle dispersion
   in the matrix. Measurement of compression sets shows that elastic
   recovery of the compounds decreases after addition of solid particles.
   Samples having better particles/matrix compatibility show higher elastic
   recovery. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that inclusion of wood flour
   decreases thermal stability of compounds. Density and hardness of
   MAPE/GTR are also shown to increase after inclusion of particulate

Abstract = {{Success or failure of any stage of reproduction is generally related to
   maternal characteristics and environmental influences. In addition,
   postreproductive body condition of females should be a function of
   effort allocated to reproduction. Using data on > 800 female
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) harvested during 4 years on
   Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), we investigated factors affecting
   reproductive status, from ovulation to weaning, and measured the
   resulting effect on female body condition. The probability of ovulation
   (single or double) increased with female age, but weaning success was
   unrelated to age. Female reproduction was determined by climatic
   conditions in each season and the availability of preferred habitat, but
   high density only affected young primiparous females. More specifically,
   snowy autumns decreased ovulation rate, dry springs disfavored the
   production of twins, and cold and snowy winters decreased weaning
   success. Habitat with high summer plant biomass favored both 1st
   ovulation and weaning success. We suggest that restricted forage
   conditions encountered during their 1st year of life selected for
   higher-quality females, that is, females with fewer reproductive pauses
   and higher weaning success. Reproductive effort generally decreased
   female body condition, which was lower in lactating than nonlactating
   females. We suggest that twin production occurred in higher-quality
   females because, although females conceiving twins had reduced fat
   reserves, they maintained larger body size and higher muscular mass than
   mothers of singletons. Our results demonstrate that females adjusted
   reproductive effort according to seasonal environmental conditions,
   probably to minimize the consequences of reproduction on body condition,
   a proxy of reproductive cost.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of how the microenvironment, or niche, regulates stem
   cell activity is central to understanding stem cell biology and to
   developing strategies for the therapeutic manipulation of stem cells(1).
   Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is commonly thought to be a shared niche
   characteristic in maintaining quiescence in multiple stem cell
   types(2-4). However, support for the existence of a hypoxic niche has
   largely come from indirect evidence such as proteomic analysis(5),
   expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha) and related
   genes(6), and staining with surrogate hypoxic markers (for example,
   pimonidazole)(6-8). Here we perform direct in vivo measurements of local
   oxygen tension (p(O2)) in the bone marrow of live mice. Using two-photon
   phosphorescence lifetime microscopy, we determined the absolute p(O2) of
   the bone marrow to be quite low (<32 mm Hg) despite very high vascular
   density. We further uncovered heterogeneities in local p(O2), with the
   lowest p(O2) (similar to 9.9 mm Hg, or 1.3\%) found in deeper
   peri-sinusoidal regions. The endosteal region, by contrast, is less
   hypoxic as it is perfused with small arteries that are often positive
   for the marker nestin. These p(O2) values change markedly after

Abstract = {{A Taylor-Aris dispersion in laminar capillary flows of magnetic
   nanofluids submitted to transverse rotating magnetic fields (RMFs) was
   analyzed with a simple phenomenological mixing approach. The nanofluid
   residence time distributions (RTDs) measured under RMFs were used to
   quantify the deviations, with respect to field-free Poiseuille flows, of
   the axial dispersion induced by the rotating magnetic nanoparticles
   (MNPs) as a function of MNPs concentration and diameter, and RMF
   frequency and strength. The attenuation of axial dispersion due to the
   magnetic field was ascribed to an enhanced transverse diffusion
   coefficient that thrust tracer radial transport, owing to nanoconvective
   streams in the nanoparticle neighborhoods, beyond molecular diffusion
   capability. To estimate the enhanced transverse diffusion coefficient, a
   semiempirical model was developed in which the nanofluid domain was
   viewed as an array of identical cells each containing a magnetic
   nanoparticle at its center. Owing to the nanoparticle rotation in the
   magnetic field, each cell consisted of an inscribed perfectly mixed core
   confined in a stagnant shell where molecular diffusion prevailed. Two-
   and three-dimensional diffusion simulations of the two-zone cell were
   used to quantify, and link, the size of the mixed core to the measured
   axial dispersion coefficients under various experimental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties and flow behavior in porous media of three
   different polymer systems including a hydrophobically modified
   acrylamide-based copolymer (HMSPAM), a partially hydrolyzed
   polyacrylamide (HPAM), and a polysaccharide (xanthan gum) were evaluated
   to establish their functional differentiation as mobility control agents
   in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The rheological properties of the
   polymers were described by the power-law model to investigate their
   non-Newtonian behavior. The first normal stress difference (N-1) and
   Weissenberg number (W-e) were also used to compare their elastic
   properties. The experimental results showed that, at comparable shear
   viscosity, HMSPAM exhibited significant elasticity compared to HPAM and
   xanthan gum. Shear resistance tests indicated that all of the polymers
   experienced an extra stress when converging into a capillary tube due to
   the ``entrance effect.{''} Xanthan gum was the most mechanically stable
   polymer. Moreover, HMSPAM showed the superior reformability which was
   quantified by the regained viscosity with relaxation time. This could be
   explained by the rapid re-association of the hydrophobic interactions.
   Sandpack flood tests indicated that HMSPAM rendered extremely high
   mobility control ability during polymer flooding suggesting its
   potential in EOR. However, this polymer also experienced significant
   retention within the porous media (potential injectivity and plugging
   problems), which may be attributed to the formation of bulky associative
   polymer networks. In this work, UV spectrometry was employed to monitor
   the concentration of the produced polymer solutions and quantify the
   polymer retention within porous media. This analytical approach offers
   great reliability and simplicity. It was concluded that the use of a
   particular polymer system depends on the oil reservoir conditions and
   the target EOR application.}},

   the evolution of the water quality in the basin. The developed model
   describes the behaviour of pollution associated with particles,
   accounting for the distribution of particle settling velocities. After
   detailing the model, simulation results of an experiment representing
   settling under quiescent hydraulic conditions, are presented to validate
   the developed model's concepts. The dynamic behaviour of a pollution

Abstract = {{The development of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) based
   bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells provides an alternative way to
   harvest sunlight for energy conversion. BHJ solar cells attract
   significant interest due to their simple fabrication, low cost and high
   performance. Among all the inorganic NCs, Pb and Cd chalcogenide (PbX
   and CdX, X=S, Se or Te) NCs as electron acceptor materials theoretically
   improve the performance of BHJ solar cells due to their enhanced
   absorption and multiple exciton generation (MEG). However, their
   performance in BHJ solar cell devices still does not match with the BHJ
   solar cell devices made from phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
   (PCBM). The initial part of this review introduces the concept,
   materials, structure, device fabrication, working principles and
   characterization of BHJ solar cells. Then, the different solution
   processed approaches and details on reported BHJ solar cell devices
   based on Pb and Cd chalcogenide NCs are summarized. Finally, critical
   factors limiting the performance of BHJ solar cell devices are discussed
   and strategies for the improvement of the power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) are demonstrated by presenting recent examples from literature.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the design and experimental development of
   planar programmable inertia generators. An inertia generator is a
   hand-held haptic device that has a programmable inertia. By moving
   internal masses in reaction to accelerations induced by the user, the
   effective inertia of the device is modified in order to render a
   prescribed inertia. In this paper, a one-degree-of-freedom device with
   one internal moving mass is first proposed. The corresponding dynamic
   model is developed and the rendering capabilities of the device are
   investigated. Then, a controller is designed to produce the appropriate
   motion of the internal mass in reaction to the acceleration induced by
   the user. A prototype is presented and experimental results are
   discussed. A mechanical architecture is then proposed for the design of
   a planar three-degree-of-freedom inertia generator. The corresponding
   dynamic model is derived, and it is shown that the generalized inertia
   matrix of the proposed mechanism is always of full rank. The rendering
   capabilities of the device are also investigated. Finally, simulation
   results obtained with the three-degree-of-freedom inertia generator are
   reported and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The exploration of dangerous environments such as underwater coral reefs
   and shipwrecks is a difficult and potentially life-threatening task for
   humans, which naturally makes the use of an autonomous robotic system
   very appealing. This paper presents such an autonomous system, which is
   capable of autonomous exploration, and shows its use in a series of
   experiments to collect image data in challenging underwater marine
   environments. We present novel contributions on three fronts. First, we
   present an online topic-modeling-based technique to describe what is
   being observed using a low-dimensional semantic descriptor. This
   descriptor attempts to be invariant to observations of different corals
   belonging to the same species, or observations of similar types of rocks
   observed from different viewpoints. Second, we use the topic descriptor
   to compute the surprise score of the current observation. This is done
   by maintaining an online summary of observations thus far, and then
   computing the surprise score as the distance of the current observation
   from the summary in the topic space. Finally, we present a novel control
   strategy for an underwater robot that allows for intelligent traversal,
   hovering over surprising observations, and swimming quickly over
   previously seen corals and rocks.}},

Abstract = {{To study the variation of the mechanical behavior of binary aluminum
   copper alloys with respect to their microstructure, a numerical
   simulation of their granular structure was carried out. The
   microstructures are created by a repeated inclusion of some predefined
   basic grain shapes into a representative volume element until reaching a
   given volume percentage of the a-phase. Depending on the grain
   orientations, the coalescence of the grains can be performed. Different
   granular microstructures are created by using different basic grain
   shapes. Selecting a suitable set of basic grain shapes, the modeled
   microstructure exhibits a realistic aluminum alloy microstructure which
   can be adapted to a particular cooling condition. Our granular models
   are automatically converted to a finite element model. The effect of
   grain shapes and sizes on the variation of elastic modulus and
   plasticity of such a heterogeneous domain was investigated. Our results
   show that for a given a-phase fraction having different grain shapes and
   sizes, the elastic moduli and yield stresses are almost the same but the
   ultimate stress and elongation are more affected. Besides, we realized
   that the distribution of the. phases inside the a phases is more
   important than the grain shape itself.}},

   Visualizations through inverted microscopy revealed that a decrease in
   particle size leads to early inception of a high interaction flow regime
   whereas changing capillary shape from circular to square had no effect
   on flow regime changeover. The effect of particle size on the wetting
   pattern hysteresis in square micro-packed beds was also investigated in
   both imbibition and drainage paths. It was found that wetting pattern
   hysteresis decreases with a decrease in particle size. Finally, the
   transient behavior of micro-fixed beds of circular and square geometries
   packed with particles of two different sizes were studied by monitoring
   the bed pressure drop variations upon step changes in liquid flow rate
   at iso-G conditions. Larger particle sizes and square geometry showed
   shorter transient times as compared to smaller particle sizes and

Abstract = {{Excellent thermal conductivity and lower density make Al-Si alloys a
   suitable alternative for cast iron in the fabrication of engine
   components. The increase in the maximum operation temperature and
   pressure of engines necessitates improving the thermomechanical fatigue
   performance of Al-Si alloys. This paper has two major parts focussing on
   the use of Al-Si based alloys in cylinder heads and engine blocks.
   In the first part, the structural stress-strain and material property
   requirements of cylinder heads are discussed. In addition, the physical
   and mechanical properties of different competing materials used in the
   manufacture of engine components are reviewed. The physical metallurgy,
   solidification sequence and thermal conductivity of Al-Si based alloys
   are reviewed. Also discussed is the effect of microstructural features
   on thermomechanical fatigue lifetime. This part also includes an
   overview of the strengthening mechanisms of cast Al-Si alloys, by
   dispersed phases and heat treatment.
   Demands to improve fuel, economy and reduce emissions necessitate
   modifications in the materials and design of engine blocks. Wear
   resistance and low friction coefficient are the major characteristics
   required for engine block materials. In the second part, the most
   promising alternative approaches to manufacturing liner-less Al-Si alloy
   cylinder blocks are elaborated.}},

Title = {{Using all seismic arrivals in shallow seismic investigations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{31-42}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Near surface seismic investigations are expensive and time-consuming.
   Moreover, seismic processing usually focuses on one particular type of
   wave and wastes much of the information contained in seismic records
   that could be used to make near surface seismic surveys more valuable
   and cost effective. A workflow is proposed herein that combines seismic
   refraction tomography, multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW),
   and seismic reflection using P-waves and SV-waves, which takes advantage
   of P-wave first arrivals, Rayleigh waves, and P-wave and SV similar to
   wave reflections, respectively. The use of the proposed methodology is
   shown through three case studies carried out in the Outaouais region,
   Quebec, Canada, using a 24-channel seismograph, vertical geophones, and
   a sledgehammer. The results show that it is possible to acquire
   SV-reflections at sites where a strong velocity reversal is present at
   the surface using only vertical geophones. Under that condition, or more
   generally when two component geophones are used, the proposed workflow
   leads to two complementary stacked sections: 1) an SV-wave section that
   has a high resolution even at shallow depths but can lack coherency and
   2) a P-wave section that has better coherency but is blind at shallow
   depths. Two velocity models are also produced: an SV-wave model that
   combines the results from MASW and SV-wave reflections and a P-wave
   model that combines the results from seismic refraction and P-wave
   reflections. The workflow uses the frequency variant linear move-out
   (FV-LMO) surface wave filter, which is much more efficient than band
   pass or f-k filters to process SV waves. The value of many near surface
   seismic surveys can thus be enhanced by processing all propagation
   modes, especially when SV-wave reflections are present due to their high
   resolution.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{How reserve selection is affected by preferences in Swedish boreal
   forests}},
Journal = {{FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is important to consider the preferences of the various stakeholders
   involved when evaluating effective reserve selection, since it is
   largely their preferences that determine which of a given set of
   potential reserve networks that actually is ``the best{''}. We
   interviewed eight conservation planners working at the county
   administrative boards in each of the eight administrative counties
   covering boreal Sweden to establish weightings for different structural
   biodiversity indicators by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).
   The subjective weightings were applied in a reserve selection model
   based on a goal programming (GP) approach. The structural indicators
   were derived from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) and used
   as proxy for biodiversity potential. A biodiversity indicator score,
   based on the values of those indicators, was maximized. The model
   adjusted this score ensuring that all indicators were represented in the
   selection, and further also adjusted the influence of the indicators
   based on the subjective weightings. We evaluated the GP approach by
   comparing it to a simple linear programming (LP) formulation, only
   maximizing the indicator richness. In all cases the model was limited
   either by a budget or an area. The biodiversity potential in young
   forests are often neglected within present conservation policies,
   however, the proportion of selected forest under 15 years was relatively
   high in all our cost-effective cases, varying between 32\% and 60\%
   using the individual planners subjective weightings, compared to 80\%
   when using a simple LP model. The proportion of selected forest over 100
   years varied between 69\% and 85\% in the area-effective cases using the
   subjective weightings, compared to 80\% when using a simple LP model.
   Middle-aged forest was not favored in any of the selections, although
   they make up a substantial part of the total area. We conclude that
   there are differences in how conservation planners prioritize the
   indicators, and depending on how specific biodiversity indicators are
   weighted the age distribution of the selected reserves differs. This
   demonstrates the importance of considering how to establish appropriate
   weightings. It is also important to consider the, at least in our case,
   substantial difference in how common the different indicators are to
   ensure that the weightings get their intended impact on the selections.

Abstract = {{In recent years, autonomous robots have increasingly been deployed in
   unknown environments and required to manipulate or categorize unknown
   objects. In order to cope with these unfamiliar situations, improvements
   must be made both in sensing technologies and in the capability to
   autonomously train perception models. In this paper, we explore this
   problem in the context of tactile surface identification and
   categorization. Using a highly-discriminant tactile probe based upon
   large bandwidth, triple axis accelerometer that is sensitive to surface
   texture and material properties, we demonstrate that unsupervised
   learning for surface identification with this tactile probe is feasible.
   To this end, we derived a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on
   Pitman-Yor processes to model power-law distributions, an extension of
   our previous work using Dirichlet processes Dallaire et al. (2011). When
   tested against a large collection of surfaces and without providing the
   actual number of surfaces, the tactile probe combined with our proposed
   approach demonstrated near-perfect recognition in many cases and
   achieved perfect recognition given the right conditions. We consider
   that our combined improvements demonstrate the feasibility of effective
   autonomous tactile perception systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A geosystems approach to permafrost investigations for engineering
   applications, an example from a road stabilization experiment, Beaver
   Creek, Yukon, Canada}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{20-35}},

Abstract = {{The Alaska Highway crosses numerous terrain units underlined by warm and
   ice-rich discontinuous permafrost highly susceptible to thermal
   degradation. For years, this infrastructure, which is essential to
   transportation in northwestern Canada and Alaska, has been showing signs
   of road damage induced by permafrost degradation. In 2008, Yukon
   Highways and Public Works, and its international collaborators,
   implemented a road experimental site near Beaver Creek (Yukon) to test
   mitigation techniques aiming to control permafrost degradation.
   Permafrost investigations were done accordingly to a geosystem approach
   based on the hypothesis that permafrost has a distinctive sensitivity to
   climate and terrain conditions at a local scale and that changes
   (dynamics) in the system must be integrated in the analysis to obtain a
   holistic understanding of permafrost conditions and consequences of
   potential changes through time. Therefore, permafrost assessment at
   BC-RES came along with other components assessment such as local
   climate, natural terrain and embankment conditions.
   Four main units identified were typically ice-rich, with the exception
   of one shallow sub-unit (2B) that was ice-poor, but which contained the
   top of inactive ice-wedges, and Unit 3 at depth. The extent of the
   syngenetic ice wedges was not encountered, but reached at least a depth
   of 10.7 m. Units I and 2 (likely eolian periglacial deposits) were
   fine-grained soils characterized by a potential to liquefy, if soils
   thaw and maintain their natural moisture content, and to differential
   thaw-settlement Unit 3 (likely interglacial deposit) was mainly made of
   peat, while Unit 4 (likely glacial deposit) was a diamicton with a
   fine-grained matrix containing abundant excess ice. Impact from road
   embankment was measured at many locations in permafrost below the
   infrastructure. Isothermal profile under the road and embankment
   subsidence, assessed from core-drilling combination with GPR and ground
   temperatures, reflected the thermal impact of embankment and its
   interaction with other geosystem components (e.g. snow, groundwater) on
   the underlying ice-rich cryostratigraphic units. Thaw depth below
   embankment sideslopes had mostly reached sub-unit 2B, exposing now
   excess ground ice from the underlying very ice-rich sub-unit 2C and ice
   wedge to melting. In this context, an increase in permafrost degradation
   is expected in the near future, regardless of the mitigation technique
   performance.
   Application of the geosystem approach for road infrastructure in
   permafrost regions was beneficial at the BC-RES to identify the
   comprehensive critical engineering conditions that should be considered
   at the infrastructure spatial scale for road sustainability through
   timescale of its life. This approach emphasized the importance of
   changes in properties and processes, including their variability and
   dynamic related to interactions within the system. Overall, engineering
   studies in permafrost regions, which are typically sensitive to changes
   in conditions, would clearly benefit from applications of the geosystem
   approach, which can be adapted to spatial and time scales of these
   studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence between the Indian plate and the southern margin of the
   Eurasian continent created an active continental margin from Late
   Jurassic until about 40 Ma ago, which then evolved to form the Himalaya
   and the Tibetan Plateau during the continental collision stage.
   Post-collisional magmatism in southern Tibet, north of the Yarlung
   Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ) has been active since 45 Ma and is related to
   normal faulting and extensional tectonism. To date no such magmatism was
   reported within the YZSZ itself. This paper reports on the discovery of
   Miocene shoshonites within the YZSZ. They are significant because the
   magma traveled, at least in part, through oceanic crust, thus limiting
   interaction with the continental crust to the mid-crustal level and
   which affected the post-collisional magmatic rocks occurring in the
   northern part of the subduction system. In addition, xenoliths and
   xenocrysts of crustal origin in these rocks constrain the nature of
   metamorphic rocks underlying the YZSZ at mid-crustal level. The
   geochemical signatures of the shoshonitic rocks, including Nd and Sr
   isotope systematics, indicate derivation from a garnet-bearing middle
   continental crustal source. Crustal imprint complicates modeling of the
   petrogenetic processes which occurred prior to mid-crustal ponding of
   the magma which took place between 11 and 17 Ma at depths of 40 to 50
   km. The significant role of crustal contamination raises serious
   concerns about models proposed for similar magmatic activity elsewhere
   in the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2013 International

   construction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{211-219}},

Abstract = {{The slip resistance of high strength bolted connections depends on the
   surface condition of the connected parts, also known as the faying
   surfaces. Metalizing and galvanizing are two commonly used corrosion
   protection solutions in steel bridge construction, providing physical
   barrier as well as sacrificial protection. Practical situations exist
   where galvanized secondary structural components are joined to primary
   elements that are metalized in a slip-critical connection. Contemporary
   bridge design standards, such as the Canadian Highway Bridge Design
   Code, CAN/CSA S6-06, and the American Institute of Steel Construction
   (AISC) specifications, ANSI-AISC 3602010, however do not specify slip
   coefficient for slip-resistant connections with one faying surface
   metalized and the other face galvanized. Steel bridge fabricators are
   therefore compelled to mask off all connection faying surfaces before
   metalizing. This exercise is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
   costly. In this investigation, the resistance of slip-critical joints
   having metalized-galvanized faying surfaces is characterized in view of
   the current North American design standards. The mean slip coefficient,
   determined from short-duration tension and compression test regimes,
   revealed slip resistance greater than the typical faying surface with
   roughened hot-dip galvanized finish, and in the majority of cases,
   greater than the typical uncoated blast-cleaned faying surfaces. (C)

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites based on isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and titanium

   an anhydride-modified polypropylene as a compatibilizer on dispersion of
   TiO2 nanoparticles was assessed using SEM. TGA and DSC analysis were
   performed to study the thermal properties of the nanocomposites.
   Crystalline structures of iPP in the presence of TiO2 were analyzed by
   XRD. Mechanical properties of the nanoparticles were measured and a
   micromechanical analysis was applied to quantify interface interaction
   between the polymer and particle. SEM results revealed improvement of
   TiO2 particle dispersion by adding the compatibilizer. It was shown that
   the thermal stability and crystalline structure of the nanocomposite are
   significantly affected by the state of particle dispersion. TiO2
   nanoparticles were shown to be strong -nucleating agents for iPP,
   especially at concentrations less than 5 vol\%. Presence of the
   -structure crystals reduced the elastic modulus and yield strength of
   the nanocomposites. Micromechanical analysis showed enhanced interaction

Abstract = {{The effect of cobble concentration and vegetated banks on the mean flow

   concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 cobbles/m(2) were tested by this

   show that cobble concentration affects the mean velocity and turbulence
   intensity profiles close to the vegetated bank, especially near the bed,
   but does not influence the RS distribution. This experimental study
   reveals a Z-shaped Reynolds stress (RS) distribution near the vegetated
   bank without any negative values, but a convex distribution at the
   centre of flume with negative values near the water surface. Negative RS
   values are associated with dominant effects of the inward and outward
   events near the water surface. The effect of cobble concentration on the

Abstract = {{Filament-induced amplified spontaneous emission, ASE, in
   air-hydrocarbons (similar to 2\%) gas mixture, CH4, C2H2, and C2H4, was
   investigated by detecting fluorescence emitted from CH fragments
   prepared in the electronically excited A(2)Delta state in the filament.
   The fluorescence signal recorded from the side direction of the filament
   was linearly proportional to the length of the filament, while the
   fluorescence signal emitted in the backward direction of the laser
   propagation increased nonlinearly with the filament length. This
   difference showing that the filament acted as a gain medium in which the
   spontaneous emission from CH was amplified (ASE). This process realized
   by a small amount of hydrocarbon molecular species in air can be applied
   to remote sensing of pollutants in air. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Evaluating fluxes in Histosols for water management in lettuce: A
   comparison of mass balance, evapotranspiration and lysimeter methods}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of downward water fluxes in Histosols is critical for
   water budget and irrigation studies in natural and cultivated wetlands.
   By analyzing water fluxes in cultivated organic soils, our study aimed
   to (i) compare drainage water fluxes measured using in situ lysimeters
   to fluxes estimated by three indirect methods, specifically, a
   simplified water balance, a water balance including soil water storage
   changes, and a method based on the Buckingham-Darcy law; and (ii)
   investigate water flux mechanisms using a bromide tracer in the same
   lysimeters. In 2008-2009, three sites were each set up with four
   drainage lysimeters equipped with water content probes and tensiometers.
   Bromide was applied over each lysimeter at the beginning of the lettuce
   growing cycle. Daily outflow water volumes were measured and solute
   samples were collected. The results showed that measured cumulative
   drainage was very low (0-40.2 mm) compared to water input (30-128 mm). A
   rupture point in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at matric
   potentials around -4.5 to -6 kPa, combined with the stratified profile
   of the organic layers, may in part explain these observations. The
   measured water fluxes were also significantly lower (by 1.2 to 1255.3
   times) than the estimations made with the three indirect methods.
   Finally, the analyses of soil and outflow bromide concentrations
   confirmed the low fluxes through the lysimeters and revealed an
   accumulation at the surface layer interface (at a depth of about 0.3 m),
   indicating that water perched in the profile and suggesting that
   preferential flow occurred, leading to episodic solute leaching. Direct
   evaluation of water and solute fluxes are needed in such soils, as all
   three methods presented important biases. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   changing the functional groups on rings A and E. Each analogue was
   screened for their effects on inhibition of cap-dependent translation,

Abstract = {{Insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells in response to glucose or
   other secretagogues is tightly coupled to membrane potential. Various
   studies have highlighted the prospect of enhancing insulin secretion in
   a glucose-dependent manner by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels
   (K-v) and calcium-activated potassium channels (K-Ca). Such strategy is
   expected to present a lower risk for hypoglycemic events compared to
   K-ATP channel blockers. Our group recently reported the discovery of a
   new insulinotropic agent, cardiotoxin-I (CTX-I), from the Naja kaouthia
   snake venom. In the present study, we report the design and synthesis of
   {[}Lys(52)]CTX-I41-60 via structure-guided modification, a truncated,
   equipotent analogue of CTX-I, and demonstrate, using various
   pharmacological inhibitors, that this derivative probably exerts its
   action through K-v channels. This new analogue could represent a useful
   pharmacological tool to study beta-cell physiology or even open a new
   therapeutic avenue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D) irregular and unstructured pore network was
   built using local topological and geometrical properties of an isometric
   bead pack imaged by means of a high-resolution X-ray computed
   micro-tomography technique. A pore network model was developed to
   analyze the 3D laminar/inertial (non-Darcy) flows at the mesoscopic
   (pore level) and macroscopic (after ensemble-averaging) levels. The
   non-linear laminar flow signatures were captured at the mesoscale on the
   basis of analogies with contraction and expansion friction losses. The
   model provided remarkably good predictions of macroscopic frictional
   loss gradient in Darcy and non-Darcy regimes with clear-cut demarcation
   using channel-based Reynolds number statistics. It was also able to
   differentiate contributions due to pore and channel linear losses, and
   contraction/expansion quadratic losses. Macroscopic mechanical
   dispersion was analyzed in terms of retroflow channels, and transverse
   and longitudinal Peclet numbers. The model qualitatively retrieved the
   Peclet-Reynolds scaling law expected for heterogeneous networks with
   predominance of mechanical dispersion. Advocated in watermark is the
   potential of pore network modeling to build a posteriori constitutive
   relations for the closures of the more conventional macroscopic Euler
   approaches to capture more realistically single-phase flow phenomena in
   fixed-bed reactor applications in chemical engineering. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A detailed study of the sensitivity of mineral carbonation to

   of carbonation was noticed along with elevated carbonation temperatures.
   A temperature rise from 10 to 40 degrees was accompanied by a ten-fold
   increase in initial reaction rate and was corroborated by a
   corresponding stimulated release of magnesium in pore water as evidenced
   by residue leaching experiments. Furthermore, significant heat was
   generated during reaction progress which led to a rise in temperature up
   to 4.9 degrees C at a 10 degrees C carbonation temperature. The rate of
   carbonation was found to be reduced by the increase of iron (III)
   content in the pore water fostered by the presence of dissolved oxygen.
   Formation of iron hydroxides induced pore water acidification which
   stimulated carbonation. This was counterbalanced by the ensuing
   precipitation of iron (III) hydroxide as a thin coating which slowed the
   progress of carbonation. Using weakly concentrated CDTA-chelating
   ligands helped curb iron (III) precipitation which ensured higher
   carbonation rates under an oxic environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Application of multi-level coded modulation (MLCM) for 16-ary
   constellations in coherent systems is studied. An MLCM system with
   Reed-Solomon component codes and multi-stage decoder is considered. A
   systematic numerical method for finding set-partitioning and optimal
   code rates is presented. The method only requires the probability
   density function of received samples and can be applied to any
   constellation regardless of irregularity or lack of symmetry.
   Performance of the designed MLCM system is verified in presence of
   nonlinear phase noise and normal phase noise. For nonlinear phase noise
   limited system, it is shown that the block error rate (BLER) of the
   system can be improved using our approach for set-partitioning. For
   phase noise limited system, both BLER and bit error rate (BER) are
   studied for a phase noise optimized and square 16-quadrature amplitude
   modulation (16QAM). Post forward-error correction (FEC) BER performance
   of the optimized constellation over square 16QAM is studied for
   different levels of phase noise. It is shown that the optimized
   constellation along with MLCM system decreases the required
   signal-to-noise ratio by several dB at high phase noise regime and low
   post FEC BER.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor nanocomposites, which are composed of titanium dioxide
   (TiO2) nanorods, cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles (NPs), and Ni
   clusters, were synthesized. The following steps were adopted: (i)
   surfactant-capped TiO2 nanorods with controlled length were synthesized
   in an autoclave using oleic acid and amino hexanoic acid as surfactants.
   By using a ligand-exchange procedure, in which nitrosonium
   tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4) was used to replace the original surfactants,
   hydrophilic NOBF4-TiO2 nanorods were obtained; (ii) the resulting
   nanorods were deposited with CdS NPs and (iii) then deposited
   selectively with Ni clusters (as cocatalyst) on the nanocomposite
   surface. Under visible-light illumination of the nanocomposite, the
   generated electrons from the conduction band of CdS are transferred to
   TiO2 via TiO2/CdS interface, then to metallic Ni cluster. As a result,
   the electron hole separation was highly enhanced, leading to a
   Ni-TiO2/CdS nanocomposite with high photocatalytic performance for the
   production of hydrogen (H-2).}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that small to medium level concentrators could
   be used as cost-competitive replacements for tracked solar panels. The
   objective is to design a system that can reach a good level of sun
   concentration with only one sun-tracking axis and is cheap to fabricate.
   As the most critical parameter for all concentrator designs, optical
   efficiency needed improvement to reduce the cost of power produced by
   our system. By using a graded-index planar waveguide with an index
   profile similar to SELFOC fiber, the ray's path can be controlled. Also,
   the concentrator can be fabricated in a single block, which reduces
   Fresnel reflections. Overall, the optical efficiency can be improved by
   as much as 33\% compared to the same system made with a homogeneous
   waveguide. Furthermore, the ability to cost-effectively fabricate the
   concentrator by molding can be preserved, making it possible to reduce
   the cost of the solar power produced. (C)2014 Optical Society of America}},

   We also define operators that sum up the content of rows and columns.
   These share many properties with the relational domain and codomain
   operators returning a subidentity corresponding to the domain and
   codomain of a relation. Finally, we use the linear algebra operators to
   write axioms defining direct sums and direct products and we show that
   there are other solutions in addition to the traditional - in the

Abstract = {{The application of industrial residuals in agriculture may raise
   concerns about soil and crop metal accumulation. A complete study using
   a fractionation scheme would reveal build-up in metal pools occurring
   after material addition and predict the transformation of metals in soil
   between the different forms and potential metal release into the
   environment. An experimental study was conducted from 2000 to 2008 on a
   loamy soil at Yamachiche, Quebec, Canada, to evaluate the effects of
   repeated annual addition of combined paper mill biosolids when applied
   alone or with several liming by-products on soil Cu, Zn, and Cd
   fractions. Wet paper mill biosolids at 0, 30, 60, or 90 Mg ha(-1) and
   calcitic lime, lime mud, or wood ash, each at 3 Mg ha(-1) with 30 Mg
   paper mill biosolids ha(-1), were surface applied after seeding. The
   soils were sampled after 6 (soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.]) and 9
   {[}corn (Zea mays L.)] crop years and analyzed using the Tessier
   fractionation procedure. Results indicated that biosolids addition
   increased exchangeable Zn and Cd, carbonate-bound Cd, Fe-Mn oxide-bound
   Zn and Cd, organically bound Cu and Zn, and total Zn and Cd fractions
   but decreased Fe-Mn oxide-bound Cu in the uppermost 30-cm layer. With
   liming by-products, there was a shift from exchangeable to
   carbonate-bound forms. Even with very small metals addition, paper mill
   and liming materials increased the mobility of soil Zn and Cd after 9 yr
   of application, and this metal redistribution resulted into higher crop
   grain concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer accounting for about 2\% of
   cancer deaths. Its diagnosis is based on a combination of criteria,
   which are not always easily measurable. Flow cytometry now allows
   multiplex analysis of intracellular signaling at the single cell level.
   We investigated the feasibility of using intracellular protein
   phosphorylation analysis by flow cytometry on primary plasma cells from
   bone marrow and its usefulness in MM diagnosis.
   Methods
   Cells from frozen bone marrow of five MM patients and four normal donors
   were stimulated with LPS, IL-6, IL-21, IFN alpha and TNF alpha. Cells
   were stained by fluorescent cell barcoding to allow multiplex analysis.
   Staining with antibodies against phosphorylated NFkB-p65, Stat1, Stat3,
   and p38 were used to identify cellular responses following stimulation.
   Results
   Activation profiles of MM and normal plasma cells have been established.
   MM cells showed heterogeneous response profiles while normal cells
   responses were homogeneous between donors. We also noticed that many MM
   samples seemed to show elevated basal level of Stat3 phosphorylation.
   These results suggest that different response profiles in primary MM
   cells might correspond to different subtypes of the disease. Thus, we
   provide an example of how these results may be used as a criterion for
   MM subtypes classification.
   Conclusions
   We demonstrate that flow cytometry can be used to study signaling
   pathways in primary MM cells. The heterogeneity observed in MM cells
   from different patients can prove valuable for MM characterization and
   represents an interesting avenue for future research in MM diagnosis.

Abstract = {{The quality of anode electrodes is an important issue in aluminum
   production plants. Therefore, not only raw material conditions but also
   the conditions of different production steps could affect the anode
   quality. Analyzed in this paper is the die compaction of some anode
   paste samples with specified compositions. Portions of fine coke and
   coarse coke particles were mixed and some coal tar pitch was added to
   this mixture in order to make the anode paste sample. The Blaine number
   of the fine coke portion and the pitch content were selected as two
   variables to make different anode paste samples. Thereafter, each sample
   was compacted in a rigid die while applying a uniaxial stress up to 60
   MPa. The compaction behavior of different samples was studied and an
   analytical relationship between the green relative density and the axial
   pressure applied in the die was suggested. After having identified the
   parameters of the suggested expression for each sample, the contribution
   of the rearrangement phenomenon to the material densification was
   studied. Regarding the good agreement between the suggested relationship
   and the experimental results, it would be possible to predict the
   compactability of different anode pastes based on the analytical
   equation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of Misalignment on Pulloff Test Results: Numerical and

Abstract = {{The successful application of a concrete repair system is often
   evaluated through pulloff testing. For such in-place quality control
   (QC) testing, the inherent risk of misalignment might affect the
   recorded value and eventually make a difference in the acceptance of the
   work The issue of eccentricity in pulloff testing has been ignored in
   field practice because it is seen as an academic issue. This paper
   presents the results of a project intended to quantify the effect of
   misalignment on pulloff tensile strength evaluation and provide a basis
   for improving QC specifications if necessary. The test program consisted
   first of an analytical evaluation of the problem through two-dimensional
   finite element modeling simulations and, in a second phase, in
   laboratory experiments in which the test variables were the misalignment
   angle (0, 2, and 4 degrees) and the coring depth (15 and 30 mm {[}0.6
   and 1.2 in.]). It was found that calculations provide a conservative,
   but realistic, lower bound limit for evaluating the influence of
   misalignment upon pulloff test results: a 2-degree misalignment can be
   expected to yield a pulloff strength reduction of 7 to 9\% for 15 and 30
   mm (0.6 and 1.2 in.) coring depths, respectively, and the corresponding
   decrease resulting from a 4-degree misalignment reaches between 13 and
   16\%. From a practical standpoint, the results generated in this study
   indicate that when specifying a pulloff strength limit in the field, the
   value should be increased (probable order of magnitude: 15\%) to take
   into account the potential reduction due to testing misalignment.}},

Abstract = {{Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is a major fish pathogen.
   Molecular tools are required to study the virulence and genomic
   stability of this bacterium. An efficient electroporation-mediated
   transformation protocol for A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida would make
   genetic studies faster and easier. In the present study, we designed the
   4.1-kb pSDD1 plasmid as a tool for optimizing an electroporation
   protocol for A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. We systematically tested
   the electroporation conditions to develop a protocol that generates the
   maximum number of transformants. Under these optimal conditions (25
   kV/cm, 200 Omega, 25 mu F), we achieved an electroporation efficiency of
   up to 1 x 10(5) CFU/mu g DNA. The electroporation protocol was also
   tested using another plasmid of 10.6-kb and three different strains of
   A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. The strains displayed significant
   differences in their electro-transformation competencies. Strain 01-B526
   was the easiest to electroporate, especially with the pSDD1 plasmid.
   This plasmid was stably maintained in the 01-B526 transformants, as were
   the native plasmids, but could be easily cured by removing the selection
   conditions. This is the first efficient electroporation protocol
   reported for A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and offers new
   possibilities for studying this bacterium. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Torrefaction of woody biomass is a thermal treatment often used to
   increase biomass energy density prior to its thermochemical conversion.
   The feasibility of integrated torrefaction, where the energy required
   for torrefaction is provided from the burning of its self-released
   volatiles, while the resulting carbon dioxide is subsequently captured
   in a permanent sink, is an original avenue, which was investigated in
   this study from the point of view of mining residue valorization. The
   use of abundant, cheap, and comminuted minerals as solid oxygen carriers
   for chemical looping combustion (CLC) and as carbon sinks for mineral
   carbonation in combination with torrefaction of woody biomass was
   studied. The mining residue consisted of iron-rich (17.3 wt \%)
   post-nickel recovery chrysotile/lizardite silicate minerals. Air
   pre-calcination of the mineral at 700 degrees C helped boost the
   extra-framework iron fraction up to 66\%, mainly in the form of
   hematite, as evidenced from Mossbauer spectroscopy. Such a calcined
   oxygen carrier was then tested in airless torrefaction-CLC tied
   configuration under gas recirculation over the temperature range of
   500-700 degrees C to burn the volatiles released during the torrefaction
   of birch at 260-300 degrees C. Up to 96\% of the carbon released from
   the torrefied birch as volatiles was converted in the CLC bed into CO2,
   highlighting the ability of the residue for burning torrefaction
   volatiles. The residue was finally tested in a
   torrefaction-CLC-carbonation configuration under gas recirculation for
   burning the torrefaction volatiles and capturing the produced carbon
   dioxide for various torrefaction, CLC, and carbonation temperatures. Up
   to 20\% of produced CO2 was sequestrated using this concept at the
   optimal carbonation bed temperature of 50 degrees C.}},

Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{211-221}},

Abstract = {{Several image processing techniques are employed in Infrared
   Non-Destructive Testing (IRNDT) to enhance defect detectability. To
   date, there is no adequate global measurement that objectively assesses
   defect visibility in processed frames. In this work, a Global Signal to
   Noise Ratio (GSNR) that comprehensively evaluates defect detectability
   in processed infrared (IR) images is proposed, as well as a defect
   visibility measure named Infrared Image Quality Index (IRIQI) that
   compares the structural information of defective and sound areas. In
   addition, GSNR and IRIQI are validated by using the area under ROC curve
   (AUC). AUC quantitatively assesses defect visibility by comparing the
   outcomes of processing techniques to human judgements. The remarkable
   benefit of this global approach is that it allows one to determine the
   frame at which processing techniques reveals the majority of the defects
   by evaluating the times at which AUC curves reach their maxima. The test
   pieces were a Carbon-Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) sample containing
   delaminations and a honeycomb specimen with delaminations, skin unbonds,

Abstract = {{Seedlings are rejected every year in forest nurseries because of
   insufficient root development and root plug cohesion. Adequate substrate
   bulk density and aeration properties are of critical importance for root
   growth and water and nutrient uptake. The quality norms for nursery
   substrates, based in part on the ratio of coarse to fine particle sizes,
   have recently been questioned with respect to substrate performance. We
   conducted experiments in 2008 and 2009 under commercial nursery
   conditions to determine the effects of substrate physicochemical
   properties on seedling growth and nutrition. Seedlings were grown in 13
   different substrates composed of coarse and fine peat particles
   (threshold size: 0.5 mm), perlite, and vermiculite, covering a broad
   range of physical properties with adequate available water and various
   coarse/fine particle ratios and aeration properties. Substrate
   properties had significant effects on growth parameters in both years.
   Seedling growth was affected by water stress in 2008 and low gas
   diffusivity in 2009. This study emphasizes the importance of management
   on substrate performance, indicating that short periods of moderate
   water stress (matric potential lower than -10 kPa) may hinder seedling
   growth. It also suggests that when irrigated substrates are maintained
   within the 0 to -5 kPa matric potential range, gas diffusivity should
   not be lower than 0.003 to 0.005 cm(2) s cm(-2) s(-1), in agreement with
   the modeled O-2 profiles in root plugs. Hence, when designing and using
   substrates at the nursery scale, more attention should be paid to
   aeration properties after potting and to the management rather than to
   the coarse/fine particle ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Following three decades of rather low investment in dams, many regions
   throughout the world are now seeking to further develop new storage
   capacity to meet exploding demands for water and to hedge against the
   risk posed by climate change. Storage capacity is often perceived as a
   key element of climate change adaptation strategies, while at the same
   time contributing to socioeconomic development through irrigation,
   energy generation, fish production, and municipal and industrial water
   supply. The benefits provided by dams must be balanced with the
   associated environmental and social costs, which can take various forms,
   such as the degradation of ecosystems because of altered flow regimes
   and the relocation of people from the impoundment area. The benefits of
   storage essentially come from the ability to move water in time, making
   it available during the low-flow season when it becomes more valuable.
   As river basins develop and new dams are constructed, it may be
   important for planning and operational purposes to assess the individual
   contribution of each reservoir to the benefits of storage. This paper
   presents a methodology to determine the economic value of storage in
   multireservoir systems based on the marginal net benefit functions of
   storage and on hydroeconomic modeling. A cascade of reservoirs in the
   Euphrates river basin is used to illustrate the methodology.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{72-78}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This experimental work on sphalerite flotation investigated the effect
   on flotation performance of three particle size fractions, namely,
   coarse (d(80) = 100 mu m), medium (d(80) = 39 mu m) and fine (d(80) = 15
   mu m), bubble size distribution, superficial air velocity, and collector
   dosage. Bubble size distributions were characterized with the image
   analysis technique. The two-phase (liquid-gas) centrifugal pump and
   frother addition (MIBC, 5-30 ppm) allowed generating bubble diameters
   between 150 and 1050 mu m, and air holdup ranging from 0.2\% and 1.3\%.
   Main results showed that each particle-size distribution required an
   optimal bubble-size profile, and that sphalerite recovery proceeded from
   mechanisms involving true flotation (when J(g) = 0.04 cm/s and 1.9 x
   10(-4) M SIPX). However, cluster-flotation occurs at high collector
   dosage (when J(g)= 0.04 cm/s and d(32) between 285 and 1030 mu m), and
   requiring further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The increasing efforts in reducing the emission of micropollutants (MP)
   into the natural aquatic environment require the development of
   modelling tools to support the decision making process. This article
   presents a library of dynamic modelling tools for estimating MP fluxes
   within Integrated Urban Wastewater and Stormwater system (IUWS -
   including drainage network, stormwater treatment units, wastewater
   treatment plants, sludge treatment, and the receiving water body). The
   models are developed by considering the high temporal variability of the
   processes taking place in the IUWS, providing a basis for the
   elaboration of pollution control strategies (including both source
   control and treatment options) at the small spatial scale of urban
   areas. Existing and well-established water quality models for the
   different parts of the IUWS (e.g. ASM models) are extended by adding MP
   fate processes. These are modelled by using substance inherent
   properties, following an approach commonly used in large-scale MP
   multimedia fate and transport models. The chosen level of complexity
   ensures a low data requirement and minimizes the need for field
   measurements. Next to a synthesis of model applications, a didactic
   example is presented to illustrate the potential of the use of the
   developed model library for developing, evaluating and comparing
   strategies for reduction of MP emissions from urban areas. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Microstructure, electrical conductivity, and rheological properties of
   nanocomposites based on isotactic polypropylene (iPP) containing
   semiconductor nanoparticles of TiO2 were studied. Compatibilized and
   uncompatibilized nanocomposites containing a wide range of TiO2
   concentrations (up to 15 vol\%) were prepared by melt compounding in a
   twin-screw extruder via a masterbatch method. An anhydride-modified PP
   (AMPP) was used as the compatibilizer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and image analysis techniques were
   utilized to study the morphology evolution in the samples. Analyzing the
   results of direct current (DC) electrical conductivity measurements
   showed a lower percolation threshold for the uncompatibilized samples,
   compared to the compatibilized ones. In order to estimate the
   percolation threshold, linear and nonlinear melt-state viscoelastic
   properties of the samples were studied. Liquid-solid transition and
   nonterminal behavior of the uncompatibilized samples were observed at
   relatively lower range of TiO2 loading, compared to the compatibilized
   samples. It was an indication of lower rheological percolation threshold
   in the uncompatibilized nanocomposites which was in agreement with the
   electrical percolation threshold. Scaling analysis of strain sweep tests
   above the percolation thresholds of the nanocomposites resulted in a
   lower fractal dimension for the uncompatibilized samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with ionic species migration based on classical mass
   balance equations in conjunction with a charge balance equation and the
   electroneutrality condition. Two new methods are proposed to apply the
   electroneutrality condition, avoiding the elimination of one of the
   conservation equations of chemical species and permitting to explicitly
   apply boundary conditions on all species. The first method is based on
   variational principles and the second on a Lagrange multiplier. It is
   shown that the new methods are analytically equivalent to the more
   standard method in which one conservation equation is eliminated without
   any other consideration. The variational method is more complex to
   implement than the Lagrange multiplier method. The new methods were
   applied to a multi-ionic problem together with the charge conservation
   equation without capacitive effects. Different kinds of boundary
   conditions were applied: Neumann, Dirichlet and a nonlinear case based
   on Butler-Volmer kinetics. All methods gave the same results for
   non-complex problems. In the case of complex problems including chemical
   equilibrium between each ionic species, it was found that more
   investigations are necessary even for more conventional methods.}},

   properties of polypropylene based composites}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{653-663}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Finite element method (FEM) is used to predict the tensile and
   compressive stress-strain curves of single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT)
   reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. The numerical simulations,
   using shell and tetrahedron elements, are first carried out to
   investigate the effect of SWCNT orientation on the mechanical properties
   of the nano-composites. Second, the Grunfest-Young constitutive equation
   is selected to determine the effect of strain rate and solve the finite
   element program to analyze the mechanical behavior of the
   nano-composites. Third, the effect of SWCNT volume fraction is studied.
   In all cases, the shear and normal stresses distribution along the
   nanotube axis are investigated and compared with the macroscopic tensile
   or compressive stresses on the composites. At the same time, the
   stresses of the interface between SWCNT and the matrix along the loading
   direction are analyzed. Finally, the effects of SWCNT orientation,
   content and strain rate on the strength of the nano-composites are
   studied. From the results obtained, it was shown that strain rate can
   substantially affect the tensile and shear stresses of the composites,
   but do not significantly influence the initial tensile or compressive
   elastic moduli. This is especially the case for SWCNT orientation angles
   less than 30 degrees and volume fractions higher than 0.74\%. Crown

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{45-54}},

Abstract = {{The major objective in developing a robust digital watermarking
   algorithm is to obtain the highest possible robustness without losing
   the visual imperceptibility. To achieve this objective, we proposed in
   this paper an optimal image watermarking scheme using multi-objective
   particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and singular value decomposition
   (SVD) in wavelet domain. Having decomposed the original image into ten
   sub-bands, singular value decomposition is applied to a chosen detail
   sub-band. Then, the singular values of the chosen sub-band are modified
   by multiple scaling factors (MSF) to embed the singular values of
   watermark image. Various combinations of multiple scaling factors are
   possible, and it is difficult to obtain optimal solutions. Thus, in
   order to achieve the highest possible robustness and imperceptibility,
   multi-objective optimization of the multiple scaling factors is
   necessary. This work employs particle swarm optimization to obtain
   optimum multiple scaling factors. Experimental results of the proposed
   approach show both the significant improvement in term of
   imperceptibility and robustness under various attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial cellulose (BC), a three-dimensional fibril, is a natural
   polymer that can be used for many applications. BC effectiveness may be
   improved by enhancing surface characteristics contributing to a better
   Physiologic interaction with human and animal cells and to intrinsically
   present antimicrobial agents. In the present study, gentamicin-activated
   BC membranes were obtained by chemically grafting RGDC peptides (R:
   arginine; G: glycine; D: aspartic acid; C: cysteine) using coupling
   agent 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) followed by covalent
   attachment of gentamicin onto the surface of the BC. membrane network.
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses showed that the BC-APTES
   contained 0.7\% of silicon in terms of elemental composition,
   corresponding to a grafting ratio of 1:12. The presence of silicon and
   nitrogen in the BC-APTES confirmed the surface functionalization of the
   BC membrane. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analyses show the
   formation of the secondary amide as supported by the valence bond C=O
   (nu(C=O)), a characteristic vibrational transition at 1650 cm(-1) which
   is particularly intense with the BC-RGDC-gentamicin membrane.
   Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses showed a low level of carbon and
   nitrogen (C + N) in pure BC but a high level of (C + N) in
   BC-RGDC-gentamicin confirming the surface modification of the BC
   membrane by RGDC and gentamicin enrichment. Of great interest, the
   gentamicin-RGDC-grafted BC membranes are bactericidal against
   Streptococcus mutans but nontoxic to human dermal fibroblasts and thus
   may be useful for multiple applications such as improved wound healing
   and drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{The degenerate Whittaker vector of the superconformal algebra can be
   represented in terms of Jack superpolynomials. However, in this

   product with respect to which the Jack superpolynomials are not
   orthogonal. In this note, we point out that this defect can be cured at
   c = 3/2 by means of a trick specific to the supersymmetric case. At c =
   3/2, we thus end up with a closed-form expression for the norm of the
   degenerate super-Whittaker vector. Granting the super-version of the AGT
   conjecture, this closed-form expression should be equal to the
   Z(2)-symmetric SU(2) pure-gauge instanton partition function-the
   corresponding equality taking the form of a rather nontrivial

   introduced the concept of observability transitions: the percolationlike
   emergence of a macroscopic observable component in graphs in which the
   state of a fraction of the nodes, and of their first neighbors, is
   monitored. We show how their concept of depth-L percolation-where the
   state of nodes up to a distance L of monitored nodes is known-can be
   mapped onto multitype random graphs, and use this mapping to exactly
   solve the observability problem for arbitrary L. We then demonstrate a
   nontrivial coexistence of an observable and of a nonobservable extensive
   component. This coexistence suggests that monitoring a macroscopic
   portion of a graph does not prevent a macroscopic event to occur
   unbeknown to the observer. We also show that real complex systems behave
   quite differently with regard to observability depending on whether they
   are geographically constrained or not.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{41-47}},

Abstract = {{Many commercial sanitizers and disinfectants have been used over the
   years to control microbial contamination but their efficacy on phages is
   often unknown. Here, 23 commercial chemical products, including 21
   food-grade sanitizers were tested against virulent dairy phages. These
   food-grade chemicals included oxidizing agents, halogenated agents,
   alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, anionic acids, iodine-based
   acids, and an amphoteric chemical. Phage P008 was first exposed to each
   sanitizer for 2 and 15 min at room temperature and at two different
   concentrations, namely the lowest and highest no-rinse sanitizing
   concentrations. Organic matter (whey or milk) was also added to the
   testing solutions. At the end of the exposure period, the test solution
   was neutralized and the number of infectious phages was determined by
   plaque assays. The five most efficient sanitizers against phage P008 (<4
   log of inactivation) were then tested against virulent lactococcal
   phages P008, CB13, AF6, P1532 of the 936 group, P001 (c2), Q54, and 1358
   as well as Lactobacillus plantarum phage B1 and Streptococcus
   thermophilus phage 2972 using the same protocol. The oxidizing agents
   and the quaternary ammonium compounds were the most efficient against
   all phages although phages CB13 and P1532 were less sensitive to these
   chemicals than the other phages. This study may help in the selection of
   appropriate chemicals for controlling phage contamination in industrial
   factories and research laboratories. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Increased Prevalence of Methanosphaera stadtmanae in Inflammatory Bowel
   Diseases}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The gut microbiota is associated with the modulation of
   mucosal immunity and the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
   Previous studies focused on the impact of bacterial species on IBD but
   seldom suspected archaea, which can be a major constituent of intestinal
   microbiota, to be implicated in the diseases. Recent evidence supports
   that two main archaeal species found in the digestive system of humans,
   Methanobrevibacter smithii (MBS) and Methanosphaera stadtmanae (MSS) can
   have differential immunogenic properties in lungs of mice; with MSS but
   not MBS being a strong inducer of the inflammatory response. We thus
   aimed at documenting the immunogenic potential of MBS and MSS in humans
   and to explore their association with IBD.
   Methods: To validate the immunogenicity of MBS and MSS in humans,
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects were stimulated
   with these two microorganisms and the production of inflammatory
   cytokine TNF was measured by ELISA. To verify MBS and MSS prevalence in
   IBD, stool samples from 29 healthy control subjects and 29 patients
   suffering from IBD were collected for DNA extraction. Plasma was also
   collected from these subjects to measure antigen-specific IgGs by ELISA.
   Quantitative PCR was used for bacteria, methanogens, MBS and MSS
   quantification.
   Results: Mononuclear cells stimulated with MSS produced higher
   concentrations of TNF (39.5 ng/ml) compared to MBS stimulation (9.1
   ng/ml). Bacterial concentrations and frequency of MBS-containing stools
   were similar in both groups. However, the number of stool samples
   positive for the inflammatory archaea MSS was higher in patients than in
   controls (47\% vs 20\%). Importantly, only IBD patients developed a
   significant anti-MSS IgG response.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of MSS is increased in IBD patients and is
   associated with an antigen-specific IgG response.}},

Abstract = {{High-quality streaming potential coupling coefficient measurements have
   been carried out using a newly designed cell with both a steady state
   methodology and a new pressure transient approach. The pressure
   transient approach has shown itself to be particularly good at providing
   high-quality streaming potential coefficient measurements as each
   transient increase or decrease allows thousands of measurements to be
   made at different pressures to which a good linear regression can be
   fitted. Nevertheless, the transient method can be up to 5 times as fast
   as the conventional measurement approaches because data from all flow
   rates are taken in the same transient measurement rather than
   separately. Test measurements have been made on samples of Berea and
   Boise sandstone as a function of salinity (approximately 18 salinities
   between 10(-5) mol/dm(3) and 2 mol/dm(3)). The data have also been
   inverted to obtain the zeta potential. The streaming potential
   coefficient becomes greater (more negative) for fluids with lower
   salinities, which is consistent with existing measurements. Our
   measurements are also consistent with the high-salinity streaming
   potential coefficient measurements made by Vinogradov et al. (2010).
   Both the streaming potential coefficient and the zeta potential have
   also been modeled using the theoretical approach of Glover (2012). This
   modeling allows the microstructural, electrochemical, and fluid
   properties of the saturated rock to be taken into account in order to
   provide a relationship that is unique to each particular rock sample. In
   all cases, we found that the experimental data were a good match to the
   theoretical model.}},

Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{757-768}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of modelling the mechanical behaviour of carbon anode
   paste, compression tests within a rigid mould were performed on
   different recipes of carbon paste containing 32 to 44 wt.\% binder. The
   compression was performed by applying a series of loading/unloading
   cycles. The maximum load was incrementally increased at each cycle. Test
   results showed that a softening behaviour occurs after the hardening of
   the anode paste during compaction cycles. This paper attempts to explain
   the mechanism of this peculiar behaviour. For comparison, two cokes with
   different shape factors were used to prepare the paste recipes. It was
   observed that round particles result in less resistance to local shear
   stress than do the angular ones. Binder, which consists of coal tar
   pitch and fine coke particles, acts as a lubricant enhancing the
   compaction of the paste. The breakage and slippage of particles during
   loading were monitored using an acoustic measurement system. A creep
   test, performed on a carbon paste and dry aggregates, corroborates that
   the time-dependency, or creep, of the paste is mainly governed by the
   solid skeleton. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide (PLA) is a class of promising biomaterials that hold great
   promise for various biological and biomedical applications, particularly
   in the field of vascular tissue engineering where it can be used as a
   fibrous mesh to coat the inside of vascular prostheses. However, its
   hydrophobic surface providing nonspecific interactions and its limited
   ability to further modifications are challenges that need to be
   overcome. Here, the development of new air-spun PLA nanofibers modified
   with hydrophilic surfaces exhibiting reduction response is reported.
   Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization allows for
   grafting pendant oligo(ethylene oxide)-containing polymethacrylate
   (POEOMA) from PLA air-spun fibers labeled with disulfide linkages. The
   resulting PLA-ss-POEOMA fibers exhibit enhanced thermal stability and
   improved surface properties, as well as thiol-responsive shedding of
   hydrophilic POEOMA by the cleavage of its disulfide linkages in response
   to reductive reactions, thus tuning the surface properties.}},

Abstract = {{The study presented here focuses on the use of monolayer covers for
   reclaiming two acid-generating tailings sites located in Quebec, Canada.
   One of these covers is made of non-acid-generating tailings, and the
   other is made of a silty sand (till). The covers are part of the closure
   plans that aim at controlling acidmine (rock) drainage at these two
   sites. Reactive tailings and cover material samples were collected in
   situ and characterised in the laboratory. Large-size columns (230 cm in
   height) were set up to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical
   response of the tailings and cover systems. Monthly wetting and drying
   cycles were repeated over nearly 2 years to simulate climatic
   conditions. Water content, suction, and oxygen concentrations were
   monitored, and chemical analyses were performed on the leachate
   collected at the base during each cycle to follow the evolution of water
   quality, in terms of pH and concentrations of sulfates and metals. In
   addition, small columns (45 cm in height) were also set up, with a
   similar testing program, to assess the hydrogeochemical behaviour of
   exposed tailings. The specific objective of this experimental program
   was to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical behaviour of the
   tailings-cover systems under controlled conditions. The results indicate
   that, for the imposed conditions, the monolayer covers became
   significantly desaturated, thus insufficiently limiting the oxygen
   diffusion flux. Consequently, these covers do not efficiently prevent
   sulfide oxidation within the tailings. The implications of these results
   are also discussed.}},

Title = {{Dosimetric analysis of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, Rafinesque,

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the dosimetry of Ra-226 in a two-year chronic
   ingestion study in laboratory maintained fathead minnow fed
   environmentally relevant levels of the isotope known to occur in gut
   contents of fish from a uranium mining area.
   Methods: Fish were established on reconstituted commercial fish food
   containing 10 mBq-10 Bq Ra-226. g(-1) dry food. The fish were sampled at
   1, 6, 18 and 24 months and the Ra-226 levels in the whole fish were
   directly determined using measurement performed using inorganic mass
   spectrometry. Pilot experiments using higher doses were also done during
   development of a liquid scintillation detection system which support
   some data.
   Results: The data show that after 1 month the levels of accumulation in
   the fish were below detection. At 6 months there was an activity
   dependent accumulation which was relatively higher in the low activity
   groups. By 18 and 24 months the radium was very low in all groups - well
   below 6 month levels suggesting considerable loss of radium from the
   fish. These data were confirmed in a small and shorter study using
   higher dietary activities. The highest dose calculated for any
   measurement point was 16 mu Gy. h(-1) in the 6-month-old fish fed the
   diet containing 10 Bq.g(-1)
   Conclusions: We conclude that environmentally relevant levels of Ra-226
   have a maximum impact at early time-points when the fish are still
   growing. After that they appear to depurate accumulated radium. In terms
   of environmental impact, the maximum accumulation peaks at the age where
   fish could be spawning but is extremely low leading to mGy.year(-1)
   doses even after exposure to the high activity diets.}},

   perform a multiple linear regression analysis to highlight the
   relationship between nanofibre diameter and the air spinning parameters.
   Polymer solution concentration was deemed as the most significant
   parameter to control fibre diameter during the spinning process, despite

Abstract = {{Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is a valuable tool to support the use
   of mathematical models that characterise technical or natural systems.
   In the field of wastewater modelling, most of the recent applications of
   GSA use either regression-based methods, which require close to linear
   relationships between the model outputs and model factors, or screening
   methods, which only yield qualitative results. However, due to the
   characteristics of membrane bioreactors (MBR) (non-linear kinetics,
   complexity, etc.) there is an interest to adequately quantify the
   effects of non-linearity and interactions. This can be achieved with
   variance-based sensitivity analysis methods. In this paper, the Extended
   Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (Extended-FAST) method is applied
   to an integrated activated sludge model (ASM2d) for an MBR system
   including microbial product formation and physical separation processes.
   Twenty-one model outputs located throughout the different sections of
   the bioreactor and 79 model factors are considered. Significant
   interactions among the model factors are found. Contrary to previous GSA
   studies for ASM models, we find the relationship between variables and
   factors to be non-linear and non-additive. By analysing the pattern of
   the variance decomposition along the plant, the model factors having the
   highest variance contributions were identified. This study demonstrates
   the usefulness of variance-based methods in membrane bioreactor
   modelling where, due to the presence of membranes and different
   operating conditions than those typically found in conventional
   activated sludge systems, several highly non-linear effects are present.
   Further, the obtained results highlight the relevant role played by the
   modelling approach for MBR taking into account simultaneously biological
   and physical processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An activated sludge model for greenhouse gases no. 1 was calibrated with
   data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) without control systems
   and validated with data from three similar plants equipped with control
   systems. Special about the calibration/validation approach adopted in
   this paper is that the data are obtained from simulations with a
   mathematical model that is widely accepted to describe effluent quality
   and operating costs of actual WWTPs, the Benchmark Simulation Model No.
   2 (BSM2). The calibration also aimed at fitting the model to typical
   observed nitrous oxide (N2O) emission data, i.e., a yearly average of
   0.5 \% of the influent total nitrogen load emitted as N2O-N. Model
   validation was performed by challenging the model in configurations with
   different control strategies. The kinetic term describing the dissolved
   oxygen effect on the denitrification by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)
   was modified into a Haldane term. Both original and Haldane-modified
   models passed calibration and validation. Even though their yearly
   averaged values were similar, the two models presented different dynamic
   N2O emissions under cold temperature conditions and control. Therefore,
   data collected in such situations can potentially permit model
   discrimination. Observed seasonal trends in N2O emissions are simulated
   well with both original and Haldane-modified models. A mechanistic
   explanation based on the temperature-dependent interaction between
   heterotrophic and autotrophic N2O pathways was provided. Finally, while
   adding the AOB denitrification pathway to a model with only
   heterotrophic N2O production showed little impact on effluent quality
   and operating cost criteria, it clearly affected N2O emission
   productions.}},

Abstract = {{A wastewater biofiltration model is used to assess its capacity to
   reproduce the treatment behaviour of a plant-sized tertiary nitrifying
   biofilter unit. It is calibrated on two different types of datasets
   collected at the Seine-Aval biofiltration plant (AchSres, France): grab
   samples at several heights inside the media bed and a long-term daily
   plant monitoring over a 1-year period. The model parameters are first
   calibrated to fit the dynamics observed in the media bed, after which
   the model is compared to the second dataset. Further parameter changes
   are then made if necessary and the model is once again compared to both
   datasets to ensure its ability to predict the treatment behaviour on
   both size scales. The calibrated model provides correct predictions for
   most observed nutrient variables for both datasets. An overestimation of
   the oxygen transfer under a summer, low ammonia load period however
   leads to a slight underestimation of the nitrifying efficiency of the
   biofilters. Statistical score computation corroborates the model
   accuracy as the mean error scores usually remain low. They also point to
   a certain weakness of the model regarding the suspended solids
   filtration. Both datasets are overall correctly modelled using a single
   parameter set. Most of this parameter set is close to or contained in
   value ranges found in the literature. The parameters related to
   aeration, however, seem to be slightly higher than what is reported
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, 2-amino-1,3-propanediol (Serinol) aqueous solutions were
   characterized through density, viscosity, surface tension and CO2
   solubility measurements in order to evaluate the potential use of this
   alkanolamine for CO2 removal from different gas mixtures. Density and
   viscosity were measured from temperature T = (293.2 to 313.2) K and for
   amine concentrations from molality in = (0.953 to 4.693) mol.kg(-1).
   Surface tension data were measured for the same solution concentrations
   but at T = (298.2 and 313.2) K. CO2 solubility in Serinol solutions from
   in = (0.953 to 4.704) mol.kg(-1) was determined at T = 313.15 K and at T
   = (343.15 and 373.15) K for the in = 4.704 mol.kg(-1) solution. CO2
   loading capacities were compared to literature data for monoethanolamine
   (MEA) and those obtained for (2.712 + 1.161) mol.kg(-1)
   2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol (AHPD) + piperazine (Pz)
   solution at T = (313.15 and 373.15) K. It was found that Serinol
   solutions have higher surface tensions compared to conventional
   absorbents, making them very suitable for CO2 removal using membrane
   contactors. Solubility measurements showed that Serinol carbamates
   formed by the reaction with CO2 can be more easily regenerated in

Title = {{Threshold response of mesophyll CO2 conductance to leaf hydraulics in

Abstract = {{Mesophyll conductance (g(m)) has been shown to impose significant
   limitations to net CO2 assimilation (A) in various species during water
   stress. Net CO2 assimilation is also limited by stomatal conductance to
   water (g(sw)), both having been shown to co-vary with leaf hydraulic
   conductance (K-leaf). Lately, several studies have suggested a close
   functional link between K-leaf, g(sw), and g(m). However, such
   relationships could only be circumstantial since a recent study has
   shown that the response of g(m) to drought could merely be an
   artefactual consequence of a reduced intercellular CO2 mole fraction
   (C-i). Experiments were conducted on 8-week-old hybrid poplar cuttings
   to determine the relationship between K-leaf, g(sw), and g(m) in clones
   of contrasting drought tolerance. It was hypothesized that changes in
   g(sw) and K-leaf in response to drought would not impact on g(m) over
   most of its range. The results show that K-leaf decreased in concert
   with g(sw) as drought proceeded, whereas g(m) measured at a normalized
   C-i remained relatively constant up to a g(sw) threshold of similar to
   0.15mol m(2) s(1). This delayed g(m) response prevented a substantial
   decline in A at the early stage of the drought, thereby enhancing water
   use efficiency. Reducing the stomatal limitation of droughted plants by
   diminishing the ambient CO2 concentration of the air did not modify g(m)
   or K-leaf. The relationship between gas exchange and leaf hydraulics was
   similar in both drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive clones despite
   their contrasting vulnerability to stem cavitation and stomatal response
   to soil drying. The results support the hypothesis of a partial
   hydraulic isolation of the mesophyll from the main transpiration
   pathway.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Flooded underground mines are attractive for groundwater heat pump
   systems, as the voids created during mining operations enhance the
   subsurface permeability and storage capacity, which allows the
   extraction of significant volumes of groundwater without requiring
   extensive drilling. Heat exchange at a flooded mine is, however,
   difficult to predict because of the complex geometry of the underground
   network of tunnels. A case study is presented here to demonstrate that
   numerical simulations of groundwater flow and heat transfer can help
   assess production temperatures required to optimize the design of a heat
   pump system that uses mine water. A 3D numerical model was developed for
   the Gasp, Mines located in Murdochville, Canada, where a district
   heating and cooling system is being studied. The underground mining
   tunnels and shafts are represented in the model with 1D elements whose
   flow and heat transfer contributions are superimposed to those of the 3D
   porous medium. The numerical model is calibrated to simultaneously
   reproduce the groundwater rebound that occurred when the mine closed and
   the drawdown measured during a pumping test conducted in a former mining
   shaft. Predictive simulations over a period of 50 years are subsequently
   performed to minimize pumping rate and determine maximum heat extraction
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of a new molecular shell, G 126.1-0.8-14, using
   available multiwavelength Galactic plane surveys and optical Gemini
   observations. A well-defined shell-like structure is observed in the
   CO(1-0) line emission at (l,b) = (126.degrees 1, -0.degrees 8), in the
   velocity range -10.5 to -15.5 km s(-1). The HI emission shows a region
   of low emissivity inside G 126.1-0.8-14, while radio continuum
   observations reveal faint non-thermal emission possibly related to this
   shell. Optical spectra obtained with Gemini South show the existence of
   B-type stars likely to be associated with G 126.1-0.8-14. An estimate of
   the stellar wind energy injected by these stars shows that they alone
   cannot be able to create such a structure. On the other hand, one
   supernova explosion would provide enough energy to generate the shell.
   Using the MSX, IRAS and WISE point source catalogues we have found about
   30 young stellar object candidates, whose birth could have been
   triggered by the expansion of G 126.1-0.8-14. In this context, Sh2-187
   could be a consequence of the action on its surroundings of the most
   massive (and thus most evolve) of the stars formed by the expanding
   molecular shell.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an integrated tunable optical delay line in
   grating-assisted contradirectional couplers using a CMOS-compatible
   photonic technology. The input signal is delayed through dispersive
   Bragg gratings and distributedly coupled to the drop port of the coupler
   without backreflections. This add-drop design enables monolithic
   integration of grating-based delay lines without using optical
   circulators. The gratings are formed by slab perturbations in rib
   waveguides, with the index chirping realized by linearly tapering the
   rib widths. Both the pitch and size of the gratings are constant through
   the entire coupler, for a higher tolerance to fabrication errors.
   Continuous tuning of the optical group delay of up to 96 ps has been
   obtained, with a low insertion loss of less than 2 dB and a negative
   chromatic dispersion of -11 ps/nm that allows for bit rates of up to
   almost 100 Gb/s at the maximal delay. The device has a small footprint
   of 0.015 mm(2), and can be used for on-chip optical buffering,
   dispersion compensation, and pulse compression. (C) 2014 Optical Society

   Mechanism}},

Abstract = {{A novel two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) cable-loop slider-driven parallel
   mechanism is introduced in this paper. The novelty of the mechanism lies
   in the fact that no passive rigid-link mechanism or springs are needed
   to support the end-effector (only cables are connected to the
   end-effector) while at the same time there is no actuation redundancy in
   the mechanism. Sliders located on the edges of the workspace are used
   and actuation redundancy is eliminated while providing force closure
   everywhere in the workspace. It is shown that the two degrees of freedom
   of the mechanism are decoupled and only two actuators are needed to
   control the motion. There are two cable loops for each direction of
   motion: one acts as the actuating loop while the other is the constraint
   loop. Due to the simple geometric design, the kinematic and static
   equations of the mechanism are very compact. The stiffness of the
   mechanism is also analyzed in the paper. It can be observed that the
   mechanism's stiffness is much higher than the stiffness of the cables.
   The proposed mechanism's workspace is essentially equal to its footprint
   and there are no singularities.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of real-time giga-Baud optical coherent systems for
   single-carrier higher-level modulation format such as 64-quadrature
   amplitude modulation (QAM) depends heavily on phase tracking. For
   offline digital signal processing, decisiondirected phase recovery is
   performed at symbol rate with the best performance and the least
   computational effort compared among other best-known algorithms.
   However, in real-time systems, hardware parallelization and pipelining
   delay on feedback path pose stringer requirement on the linewidth, or
   the frequency noise spectral level of laser sources. This leads to the
   paucity of experiments demonstrating real-time phase tracking for 64-or
   higher QAM. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the impact of
   optically-filtered lasers on parallel and pipelined phase tracking in a
   single-carrier 5 Gbaud 64-QAM back-to-back coherent system. For
   parallelization levels higher than 24, the optically-filtered laser
   shows more than 2 dB improvement in optical signal-to-noise ratio
   penalty compared to that of the same laser without optical filtering.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently developed an in vitro culture model enabling the
   large-scale expansion of switched-memory B lymphocytes, producing a
   polyclonal human IgG repertoire. Given the importance of glycosylation
   for the functions of immunoglobulins, we analyzed the N-glycosylation
   profiles of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) in this model. Switched-memory B
   cells were cultured for 38 days and, using liquid chromatography mass
   spectrometry, we analyzed IgGs' glycosylation profiles which were then
   compared to the glycosylation patterns of commercial intravenous
   immunoglobulin (IVIG). We observed a reproducible proliferation rate,
   high viability through the cultures as well as a good maintenance of the
   switched-memory B cells repertoire. The glycosylation pattern analyses
   revealed a variety of the typical biantennary N-glycan structures with
   diverse terminal monosaccharides. While many similarities were detected
   in comparison to the glycosylation profile of IVIG, in vitro-produced
   polyclonal IgGs were bearing higher levels of bisecting GIcNAc known to
   affect the effector functions of therapeutic antibodies. This data
   highlights the need for monitoring of the glycoform distribution in
   antibodies produced in vitro. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A complete factorial experimental design was used to study the effect of

   Analysis of variance of data showed a high significance of these factors

   Optimum electro-isomerization conditions were obtained with a reactor
   configuration comprising a MC-40 cation exchange membrane separating the
   central compartment from the cathodic compartment in which the
   electro-isomerization reaction took place. According to the optimized
   conditions, lactose was converted into lactulose at a level of 30.19 +/-
   1.37\% after 30 min of electro-activation at both 10 degrees C and 0
   degrees C; galactose did not exceed 6\% of the total product. The
   formation of galactose decreased when the electro-isomerization
   temperature was lowered to 0 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy and

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a method for designing vertical ground heat
   exchangers and heat pump systems, by minimizing the total cost of the
   project. The total cost includes an initial cost composed of drilling,
   excavation, heat pump and piping network. An operational cost is also
   included to account for the energy consumed for heating/cooling a
   building. The procedure allows determining the optimal number of
   boreholes, their depth and spacing, and the optimal size of the heat
   pump. The method is tested for different ground conductivity and heat
   demands. The method can also be used to determine the economical
   viability of a TRT. For tested cases, results show that the excess cost
   due to uncertainty on ground thermal conductivity increases with the
   number of boreholes. Also, a cost sensibility analysis shows that the
   most influential parameters are the number of boreholes and their depth.

Abstract = {{Ice processes that occur in steep (gravel bed) channels are completely
   different from those occurring in mild-gradient rivers. As such, the
   impact of ice on water level and discharge in steep streams is different
   than what is usually found documented for large channels. Whereas in
   large mild rivers, the development of a surface ice cover generates a
   nominal increase in stage in the order of 30\%, in steep channels, the
   formation of series of ice dams caused the water level to rise by up to
   500\%. The increase in stage caused a maximum estimated ice-induced
   discharge depression of 50\%. The ice-dam stage may represent the
   highest level of the year whereas the freezeup discharge may temporarily
   drop to its annual minimum. Ice formations significantly alter local
   channel hydraulic conditions (bed elevations, cross-sectional area,
   riffle-pool sequences, etc.) and both stage and discharge vary
   drastically in a short time.
   `Dynamic' ice processes (particularly the formation of ice dams) in
   steep channels depend on morphology and are driven by heat fluxes into
   and out of the system. Based on the authors observations of many steep
   channels over many winters, the inter-relationships (synchronicity)
   between air temperature fall (and rise), ice dam formation (and
   breaching), water level rise (and drop) and discharge depletion (and
   increase) are documented here. This paper presents air and water
   temperatures, water stages, discharges, and ice processes taking place
   on an hourly basis in four channels of increasing Strahler order. The
   data and hydro-crologic continuum analyses presented significantly
   improve our understanding and hence our ability to interpret freezeup
   water level signals. The paper also discusses how hydrographers may use
   this understanding and additional data to provide better estimates of
   discharge in steep channels at freezeup. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Barium vanadophosphate glasses, having composition 50BaO-xV(2)O(5)-(50 -
   x)P2O5, (x = 0-50 mol\%), were prepared by conventional melt quench
   method. Density, molar volume and glass transition temperature (T-g)
   were measured as a function of V2O5 content. Structural investigation
   was done using XPS and FTIR spectroscopy. First, substitution of the
   P2O5 by the V2O5 in the metaphosphate 50BaO-50P(2)O(5) glass increases
   the density and T-g and decreases the molar volume. When the amount of
   V2O5 increases, all these properties show a reverse trend. XPS
   measurement found in the O1s, P2p, and V2p core level spectra indicate
   the presence of primarily P-O-P, P-O-V and V-O-V structural bonds, the
   asymmetry in the P 2p spectra indeed arises from the spin-orbit
   splitting of P 2p core level, and more than one valence state of V ions
   being present. IR spectroscopy reveals the depolymerization of the
   phosphate glass network by systematic conversion of metaphosphate chains
   into pyrophosphate groups and then orthophosphate groups. Even though
   metaphosphate to pyrophosphate conversion is taking place due to
   breaking of P-O-P linkages, formation of P-O-V and P-O-Ba linkages
   provide cross linking between short P-structural units, which make the
   glass network more rigid. Above 10-20 mol\% V2O5 content, network is

Abstract = {{An analytical model is developed to study the transient lateral sloshing
   in horizontal cylindrical containers assuming inviscid, incompressible
   and irrotational flows. The model is derived by implementing the
   linearized free-surface boundary condition and bipolar coordinate
   transformation, resulting in a truncated system of linear ordinary
   differential equations, which is numerically solved to determine the
   fluid velocity potentials followed by the hydrodynamic forces and
   moment. The model results are compared with those obtained from the
   multimodal solution. The free-surface elevation and hydrodynamic
   coefficients are also compared with the reported experimental and
   analytical data as well as numerical simulations to establish validity
   of the model. The capability of the model for predicting non-resonant
   slosh is also evaluated using the critical free-surface amplitude. The
   model validity is further illustrated by comparing the transient liquid
   slosh responses of a partially filled tank subject to steady lateral
   acceleration characterizing a vehicle turning maneuver with those
   obtained from fully nonlinear CFD simulations and pendulum models. It is
   shown that the linear slosh model yields more accurate prediction of
   dynamic slosh than the pendulum models and it is significantly more
   computationally efficient than the nonlinear CFD model. The slosh model
   is subsequently applied to roll plane model of a suspended tank vehicle
   to study the effect of dynamic liquid slosh on steady-turning roll
   stability limit of the vehicle under constant and variable axle load
   conditions. The results suggest that the roll moment arising from the
   dynamic fluid slosh yields considerably lower roll stability limit of
   the partly-filled tank vehicle compared to that predicted from the
   widely reported quasi-static fluid slosh model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Invented in 1991, friction stir welding (FSW) is a new solid state
   joining technique. This process has many advantages over fusion welding
   techniques including absence of filler material, shielding gas, fumes
   and intensive light, solid state joining, better microstructure, better
   strength and fatigue life, and etc. The difficulty with FSW is in the
   high forces involved especially in axial direction which requires use of
   robust fixturing and very stiff FSW machines. Reduction of FSW force
   would simplify implementation of the process on less stiff CNC machines
   and industrial robots. In this paper axial welding force reduction is
   investigated by use of tool design and welding parameters in FSW of 3.07
   mm thick AA6061-T6 sheets at right angle. Attempt is made to reduce the
   required axial force while having acceptable ultimate tensile strength
   (UTS). It is found that shoulder working diameter and shoulder angle are
   the most important parameters in the axial force determination yet pin
   angle has minor effect. According to the developed artificial neural
   network (ANN) model, proper selection of shoulder diameter and angle can
   lead to approximately 40\% force reduction with acceptable UTS. Regions
   of tool design and welding parameters are found which result in reduced
   axial force along with acceptable UTS.}},

Abstract = {{A challenge in the design of rate-compatible (RC) low-density
   parity-check (LDPC) codes is how to maximize the range of code rates. In
   this paper, we propose a class of RC LDPC codes with a very wide range
   of code rates. To ensure linear encoding, dual-diagonal form for the
   parity part of the mother parity-check matrix is used. Constructed from
   shifted identity matrices, the proposed codes are particularly
   well-suited for the high-speed implementation of parallel encoders and
   parallel decoders. To widen the range of code rates, we have proposed an
   optimal transmission scheme, which keeps the optimal degree distribution
   unchanged for the mother code and all daughter codes. Thus, the proposed
   technique pushes the upper bound of code rates to 0.96, which is the
   highest rate in RC LDPC codes in the world, based on our best knowledge.
   The implementation results into field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   devices indicate that a parallel encoder (decoder) for the proposed RC
   LDPC codes is capable of reaching a throughput of 7.2 (1.8) Gigabits per
   second using a clock frequency of 150 MHz.}},

   channels, thanks to its small implementation area and its low-power
   consumption. This proposed AFE includes a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and
   a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) which employ fully differential
   folded cascode current-reuse structures leading to decreased power
   consumption and silicon area. Moreover, the proposed AFE presents
   improved output swing compared to previous current-reuse topologies by
   employing different common mode feedback circuits for LNA and PGA. A
   4-channel system implemented in a CMOS 0.18-mu m technology is presented
   as a proof-of-concept. Post-layout simulation results are reported to
   verify its performance. The total power consumption of one channel
   including a low-noise amplifier and a variable gain stage is 8.2 mu W
   (4.1 mu w for LNA and 4.1 mu w for PGA), for an input referred noise of
   3.28 mu V. The entire AFE presents four selectable gains of 45.2 dB,

Abstract = {{Time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP) is a well-studied problem in
   robotics and manufacturing, which involves the minimization of the time
   required for the operation point of a mechanism to follow a path,
   subject to a set of constraints. A TOTP technique, designed for
   fully-specified paths that include abrupt changes in direction, was
   previously introduced by the first author of this paper: an incremental
   approach called minimum-time trajectory shaping (MTTS) was used. In the
   current paper; MTTS is adapted for use with cable-driven parallel
   robots, which exhibit the additional constraint that all cable tensions
   remain positive along a path to be followed. For many applications,
   cable tensions along a path are verified after trajectory generation,
   rather than imposed during trajectory generation. For the technique
   proposed in this paper, the minimum-tension constraint is imposed
   directly and is fully integrated with MTTS, during trajectory
   generation, thus maintaining a time-optimal solution. This approach is
   relevant for cable-driven mechanism applications that involve high
   accelerations, particularly in the vertical direction.}},

Abstract = {{Safety is the most important issue that should be considered when
   designing collaborative robots that are intended to physically interact
   with humans. This paper investigates the force capabilities of
   two-degree-of-freedom planar parallel mechanisms that are equipped with
   torque limiters (safety clutches). Joint torque limiting devices are
   used in these mechanisms in order to limit the forces that the robot can
   apply to its environment. Such devices aim at ensuring the safety of the
   human beings interacting with the robot. However, because the
   torque-limiting devices are mounted at the joints of the robot, the
   end-effector force capabilities induced by these devices are dependent
   on the pose (Jacobian matrix) of the robot. Therefore, the
   characteristics of the torque limiting devices must be determined at the
   design stage in order to ensure safety and maximize effectiveness in all
   possible poses of the robot. Two types of planar two-degree-of-freedom
   parallel mechanisms are considered in this paper Their architecture is
   first described. Then, the force capabilities are studied based on the
   Jacobian matrices. The maximum force that can be applied at the
   end-effector for given torque limits (safety index) is determined
   together with the maximum isotropic force (effectiveness) that can be
   produced. The ratio between these two forces, referred to as the force
   efficiency, can be considered as a performance index. Finally, some
   numerical results are proposed which can provide insight into the design
   of cooperation robots based on parallel architectures.}},

   platform. It has been revealed in the literature that a kinematically
   redundant PM has fewer Type II kinematic singular configurations (also
   called forward kinematic singular configurations, static singular
   configurations or parallel singular configurations) and/or constraint
   singular configurations than its non-redundant counterparts. However,
   kinematically redundant PMs have not been fully explored, and the type
   synthesis of kinematically redundant PMs is one of the open issues. This
   paper deals with the type synthesis of kinematically redundant 3T1R PMs
   (also called SCARA PMs or Schoenflies motion generators), in which the
   moving platform has four DOF with respect to the base. At first, the
   virtual-chain approach to the type synthesis of kinematically redundant
   parallel mechanisms is recalled. Using this approach, kinematically
   redundant 3T1R PMs are constructed using several compositional units
   with very few mathematical derivations. The type synthesis of 5-DOF 3T1R
   PMs composed of only revolute joints is then dealt with systematically.
   This work provides a solid foundation for further research on
   kinematically redundant 3T1R PMs.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation aids rely mostly on (audio)visual cues when it comes to
   communication with the user An alternative and more intuitive
   communication modality may be provided by means of haptic guidance
   generated by a portable mechatronic device. Especially visually impaired
   and blind people may benefit from a device that generates the illusion
   of an external force; it may possibly eliminate the need for a guide
   dog. This paper investigates constant-velocity crank-driven mechanisms
   which are able to generate such a force illusion by means of a
   reciprocating mass. The focus of this paper is on the generation of the
   illusion itself rather than manipulating the direction of this force.
   The force illusion is a result of successive positive and negative
   reaction forces with unequal amplitude, generated by a reciprocating
   mass. The acceleration ratio of the mass is selected as the main
   evaluation criterion for comparing different types of candidate
   mechanisms. Because the input is a simple motor rotating at a constant
   velocity, the synthesis of the mechanism is key to generating proper
   acceleration profiles. A brute-force approach is used for the synthesis
   procedure, i.e., characteristic distances and link lengths are varied
   with steps of 1mm for each of the candidate mechanisms, thereby
   generating very large numbers of variants. Kinematic performance reveal
   typical acceleration ratios in the range of] to 19; where a ratio of one
   does not result in a force illusion while a ratio of 19 might be
   demanding on the physical design. An objective evaluation leads to
   selecting the Square Recti-Linear mechanism as the overall most
   promising candidate mechanism. A prototype of this mechanism is then
   presented to demonstrate the working principle. The shape of the
   prototype's force profile over time is measured experimentally and is
   shown to be very similar to the profile obtained by simulation. The
   reciprocating mass accounts for almost one fifth of the total mass of
   the prototype, resulting in a strong force illusion in comparison with
   gravitational forces.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic balancing generally involves the static balancing of a mechanism
   using countermasses followed by the dynamic balancing of the inertia
   using counter-rotations. This approach requires that the statically
   balanced mechanism have a constant inertia for any configuration. Two of
   the main drawbacks of dynamic balancing are a significant increase in
   mass and actuation inertia. In this paper, static balancing strategies
   are optimized regarding the addition of mass and actuation inertia using
   Lagrange multipliers. The results are optimal mass-inertia curves which
   are akin to Pareto curves. Optimal static balancing rules are obtained
   and a comparison of balancing strategies shows that relaxing the
   constant inertia constraint may significantly reduce the total mass and
   actuation inertia. Then, a counter-mechanism is introduced in order to
   dynamically balance a mechanism with variable inertia. The conditions
   for which the counter-mechanism matches the inertia of the main
   mechanism for any configuration are derived. The significant influence
   of the radius of gyration of the counter-inertias on the optimal
   mass-inertia curves is revealed. Additionally, the advantages of
   counter-mechanisms over counter-rotations are demonstrated. Finally,
   examples of dynamically balanced mechanisms and a prototype are
   presented in order to illustrate the concepts.}},

Abstract = {{A large eddy simulation (LES) of a turbulent swirl stabilized jet-A1
   flame is presented. The scope of the study is to incorporate a reduced
   chemistry model, as well as, coupling the turbulent flow characteristics
   to the chemical reactions and at the same time model the local chemical
   non-equilibrium due to the turbulent strain. Standard Eulerian and
   Lagrangian approaches are used to describe both gas and liquid phases,
   respectively. A joint presumed probability density function (PDF) is
   used to model turbulent-chemistry interactions in swirling jet-A1 spray
   flames. A one-component fuel, n-decane, is used as a surrogate for
   jet-Al. The combustion chemistry of the one component is represented
   through a reduced chemical kinetic mechanism (CKM) which comprises 139
   species and 1 045 reactions, derived from the detailed jet fuel
   surrogate model, JetSurf 2.0. Numerical results of the gas velocity, the
   gas temperature and the species mole fractions are compared with a set
   of published experimental data of a steady flame. In addition to the
   overall reasonable agreement obtained with the experimental data, it is
   observed that, by combining a sufficiently realistic chemistry model
   with LES to simulate a jet-Al spray flame, the prediction of major
   species is significantly improved while pollutants such as carbon
   monoxide (CO) and other species involved in slow reactions, are under
   predicted for reasons discussed in the paper.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-71}},
Abstract = {{Polymer-liquid crystal (LC) composite materials provide cost-effective
   ways to achieve enhanced electro-optic functionalities. Corresponding
   bulk-dispersed and phase-separated (of various degrees) morphologies
   were intensively studied in the past and are shortly described in this
   work. In addition, we consider the specific case when the polymer-LC
   structures are formed near to the cell substrates. To achieve this,
   partially cured and oriented polymer coatings are used as alignment
   layers for dual frequency chiral LC. The partial curing is intended to
   allow a partial interpenetration between the LC and the polymer
   molecules to form surface-stabilized polymer networks. After a short
   interpenetration period (between the polymer coatings and the bulk LC),
   a positive dielectric torque is applied and UV exposition is used to
   definitely cure the material system. Our electro-optical, spectroscopic
   and microscopic studies show that the pre-curing duration plays a
   crucial role in the behavior of the cell. It is shown that the molecular
   interdiffusion generates defects of LC alignment around polymer
   aggregates on the cell's internal surfaces. The obtained out-of-plane
   alignment and small polymer aggregates are at the origin of formation of
   controllable light scattering. Among others, some linear defects are
   formed by the positive torque, which are, however, eliminated when a
   negative dielectric torque is applied.}},

Abstract = {{Softwood and hardwood Kraft lignins have been precipitated by carbon
   dioxide using black liquor from two pulp mills in Quebec (Domtar Windsor
   and Kruger Wayagamack) following a procedure inspired by the LignoBoost
   protocol (using CO2 to decrease the pH). Commercial Kraft lignin
   (Indulin AT) was also tested for comparison. The valorization of Kraft
   lignin co-products is an example of the integrated forest biorefinery
   concept and contributes to CO2 sequestration. The studied Kraft lignins
   were esterified with butyric anhydride, maleic anhydride, or stearoyl
   chloride to improve their compatibility with hydrophobic high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) and to test their applicability as coupling agents.
   The properties of HDPE composites containing non-modified and esterified
   Kraft lignins as coupling agents between the matrix and the bark fibres
   were examined in comparison to maleated polyethylene (MAPE). The
   chemical compositions of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and black
   spruce (Picea mariana) bark fibres were determined. The thermal,
   mechanical (flexural and tensile properties), swelling, and wettability
   (contact angle) properties of the composites containing non-extracted
   and extracted bark fibres and Kraft lignins in HDPE were compared.
   Overall, water extraction of bark fibres does not seem to have a
   significant effect on the tensile properties of biocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a reprogrammable low-voltage power-supply integrated
   circuit for low resistive load down to 180 Omega. The achieved chip is
   dedicated for biomedical lab-on-chip (LoC) platforms. The proposed
   system includes two positive and two negative fully independent output
   voltage channels. Each positive and negative channel provides a
   reprogrammable DC output which varies from 14.23 mV to 1.42 V and -1.54
   V to 0 V, respectively. Each channel is controlled through a
   reprogrammable reference voltage circuit with an 8-bit digital to analog
   converter (DAC). A wireless real-time control of output signals
   amplitude is performed with LabVIEW and FPGA-based interface. The
   proposed architecture is implemented with 0.18 mu m 3.3 V 1-poly 6-metal
   CMOS technology. The chip area is 1.5 mm(2). Post-layout simulations
   show that the minimum voltage step is 12.21 mV. The accuracy of output
   voltage is 5 mV and the measured power consumption is 35 mW.}},

Abstract = {{SPIRou is a near-TB. echelle spectropolarimeter and high-precision
   velocimeter under construction as a next-generation instrurrient for the
   Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope. It is designed to cover a very wide
   simultaneous near-IR spectral range (0.98-2.35 mu m) at a resolving
   power of 73.5 K, providing unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass
   stars at a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m/s. The main science
   goals of SPIRou are the detection of habitable super-Earths around
   low-mass stars and the study of how critically magnetic fields impact
   star / planet formation. Following a successful final design review in
   Spring 2014, SPIRou is now under construction and is scheduled to see
   first light in late 2017. We present an overview of key aspects of
   SPIRou's optical and mechanical design.}},

Abstract = {{Young people often have biased and pre-conceived ideas about scientists
   and engineers that can dissuade them from considering a career in
   optics. This situation is compounded by the fact that existing resources
   on careers in optics are not suitable since they mostly focus on more
   general occupations such as a physicist and an electrical engineer. In
   addition, the linguistic register is not adapted for students, and many
   of these resources are only available to guidance counselors. To create
   appropriate resources that will inform high school students on different
   career opportunities in optics and photonics, we sought the
   collaboration of our local optics community. We selected seven specific
   occupations: entrepreneur in optics, university professor, teacher,
   technician, research and development engineer, sales representative and
   graduate student in optics. For each career, a list of daily tasks was
   created from the existing documentation by a guidance counselor and was
   validated by an expert working in the field of optics. Following a
   process of validation, we built surveys in which professionals were
   asked to select the tasks that best represented their occupation. The
   surveys were also used to gather other information such as level of
   education and advice for young people wishing to pursue careers in
   optics. Over 175 professionals answered the surveys. With these results,
   we created a leaflet and career cards that are available online and
   depict the activities of people working in optics and photonics. We hope
   that these resources will help counter the negative bias against
   scientific careers and inform teenagers and young adults on making
   career choices that are better suited to their preferences and
   aspirations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the performances of MIMO channel, signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) and noise covariance estimation in the presence of correlated
   noise. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the estimated parameters
   are evaluated. The CRLB of the channel matrix estimation is minimized
   with respect to the training sequence. When the noise covariance matrix
   is available, the minimum variance and unbiased estimator (MVUE) of the
   channel matrix corresponds to the generalized least squares (GLS)
   estimator. When the covariance matrix is unknown, we propose to use the
   feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) technique. We prove that this
   two-step procedure is asymptotically equivalent to the GLS algorithm.
   The analytic analysis is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Radar based microwave imaging (MI) has been widely studied for breast
   cancer detection in recent times. Sensing dielectric property
   differences of tissues over a wide frequency band has been made possible
   by ultra-wideband (UWB) techniques. In this paper, a flexible, compact
   monopole antenna on a 100 mu m Kapton polyimide is designed, using a
   high frequency structure simulator (HFSS), to be in contact with
   biological breast tissues over the 2-5GHz frequency range. The antenna
   parameters are optimized to obtain a good impedance match over the
   required frequency range. The designed antenna size is 18mm x 18mm.
   Further, a flexible conformal 4 x 4 ultra-wideband antenna array, in a
   format similar to that of a bra, was developed for a radar-based breast

Abstract = {{Ultra wide-band (UWB) short-range communication systems are valuable in
   medical technology, particularly for implanted devices, due to their
   low-power consumption, low cost, small size and high data rates.
   Monitoring of neural responses in the brain requires high data rate if
   we target a system supporting a large number of sensors. In this work,
   we are interested in the evaluation of the capacity of the ultra
   wide-band (UWB) channel that we could exploit using a realistic model of
   the biological channel. The channel characteristics are examined under
   two scenarios that are related to TX antenna placements. Using optimal
   power spectrum allocation (OPSA) at the transmitter side, we have
   computed this capacity by taking into account the fading characteristics
   of the channel. The results show the pertinence of the optimal power
   spectrum allocation for this type of channel. An improvement by a factor
   of 2 to 3 over a uniform power spectrum allocation (UPSA) when the SNR <
   0 dB was obtained. When the SNR is > 40 dB, both approaches give similar
   results. Antennas placement is examined under two scenarios having
   contrasting power constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Thoroughly studying the brain activity of freely moving subjects
   requires miniature data acquisition systems to measure and wirelessly
   transmit neural signals in real time. In this application, it is
   mandatory to simultaneously record the bioelectrical activity of a large
   number of neurons to gain a better knowledge of brain functions.
   However, due to limitations in transferring the entire raw data to a
   remote base station, employing dedicated data reduction techniques to
   extract the relevant part of neural signals is critical to decrease the
   amount of data to transfer. In this work, we present a new dual-band
   neural amplifier to separate the neuronal spike signals (SPK) and the
   local field potential (LFP) simultaneously in the analog domain,
   immediately after the pre-amplification stage. By separating these two
   bands right after the pre-amplification stage, it is possible to process
   LFP and SPK separately. As a result, the required dynamic range of the
   entire channel, which is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio of the
   SPK signal of larger bandwidth, can be relaxed. In this design, a new
   current-reuse low-power low-noise amplifier and a new dual-band filter
   that separates SPK and LFP while saving capacitors and pseudo resistors.
   A four-channel dual-band (SPK, LFP) analog front-end capable of
   simultaneously separating SPK and LFP is implemented in a TSMC 0.18 mu m
   technology. Simulation results present a total power consumption per
   channel of 3.1 mu w for an input referred noise of 3.28 mu V and a NEF
   for 2.07. The cutoff frequency of the LFP band is f(c)=280 Hz, and
   f(L)=725 Hz and f(L)=11.2 KHz for SPK, with 36 dB gain for LFP band 46
   dB gain for SPK band.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an investigation on the thermal effects of
   dielectrophoresis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It highlights the
   temperature propagation in CSF according to applied voltage and
   generated electrical field in a limited area of the brain. Through the
   described study, the temperature increase is considerable in the close
   surrounding area of electrodes where applied voltage goes up to 20 V-rms
   in order to generate dielectrophoretic forces for CSF sampling. Matlab
   simulations detailed in this work are based on the assumption that the
   propagation of temperature in CSF is linear. The objective of this
   research is to study the thermal side effects of direct measurements and
   manipulations of neurotransmitters in the brain versus in-channel
   measurement of neurotransmitter concentration. Indeed, according to
   simulation results, if the temperature in the top of electrodes is 46.85
   degrees C then it will decrease only to 45.35 degrees C at 1 mm away

Abstract = {{Inspection and exploration of complex underwater structures requires the
   development of agile and easy to program platforms. In this paper, we
   describe a system that enables the deployment of an autonomous
   underwater vehicle in 3D environments proximal to the ocean bottom.
   Unlike many previous approaches, our solution: uses oscillating
   hydrofoil propulsion; allows for stable control of the robot's motion
   and sensor directions; allows human operators to specify detailed
   trajectories in a natural fashion; and has been successfully
   demonstrated as a holistic system in the open ocean near both coral
   reefs and a sunken cargo ship. A key component of our system is the 3D
   control of a hexapod swimming robot, which can move the vehicle through
   agile sequences of orientations despite challenging marine conditions.
   We present two methods to easily generate robot trajectories appropriate
   for deployments in close proximity to challenging contours of the sea
   floor. Both offline recording of trajectories using augmented reality
   and online placement of fiducial tags in the marine environment are
   shown to have desirable properties, with complementary strengths and
   weaknesses. Finally, qualitative and quantitative results of the 3D
   control system are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We used the FRAC3Dvs numerical model (Therrien and Sudicky 1996) to
   compare the dual-porosity (DP), equivalent porous medium (EPM), and
   discrete fracture matrix diffusion (DFMD) conceptual models to predict
   field-scale contaminant transport in a fractured clayey till aquitard.
   The simulations show that the DP, EPM, and DFMD models could be equally
   well calibrated to reproduce contaminant breakthrough in the till
   aquitard for a base case. In contrast, when groundwater velocity and
   degradation rates are modified with respect to the base case, the DP
   method simulated contaminant concentrations up to three orders of
   magnitude different from those calculated by the DFMD model. In previous
   simulations of well-characterized column experiments, the DFMD method
   reproduced observed changes in solute transport for a range of flow and
   transport conditions comparable to those of the field-scale simulations,
   while the DP and EPM models required extensive recalibration to avoid
   high magnitude errors in predicted mass transport. The lack of
   robustness with respect to variable flow and transport conditions
   suggests that DP models and effective porosity EPM models have
   limitations for predicting cause-effect relationships in environmental
   planning. The study underlines the importance of obtaining
   well-characterized experimental data for further studies and evaluation
   of model key process descriptions and model suitability.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion is an established technology to convert biowaste
   into renewable energy and nutrient-rich digestates. Nutrient recovery
   from these digestates as renewable fertilizers with high-nutrient use
   efficiency or as P-poor alternative fertilizers has gained increased
   attention in order to meet both regulatory drivers and market demands,
   while producing an internal revenue source. However, until now, this
   opportunity has been difficult to realize due to obstacles and
   inconsistencies in legislative systems, and lack of insights into the
   composition and properties of these products, as well as in their impact
   on crop yield and soil quality. The aim of this review is to prove the
   effectiveness of fertilization strategies using biodigestion waste
   derivatives as compared to conventional practices using animal manure
   and chemical fertilizers. As adequate field-scale data are lacking in
   the literature, a ground-breaking three-year field trial has been
   performed. The value and impact of these biobased fertilizers are
   demonstrated by the use of high-level performance indicators measuring
   farming pressure on the environment and how that pressure is changing
   over time. Bottlenecks for marketing and legislative constraints are
   discussed. An economic and ecological evaluation is also assessed. The
   proof of concept provided in this chapter should help to better classify
   these biobased products into fertilizer and environmental legislations
   and serve as a support to stimulate their use in the farming community.
   Moreover, this review should stimulate and provide guidance for further
   field research on biobased fertilizers, which is highly essential in the
   development and implementation of more effective and environmentally
   friendly farming strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Humanitarian water treatment interventions vary from package bulk `kits'
   to household (point-of-use) options. Whereas the former can be perceived
   to be too complex to operate, the latter, whilst relatively simple and
   effective, has logistical requirements that may hinder its application
   during relief operations. This study evaluates the potential of a
   semi-decentralised water treatment approach for humanitarian
   emergencies. Its performance was evaluated against the relevant water
   quality treatment objectives (The Sphere Project) under controlled
   laboratory conditions using a synthetic test water. Results revealed
   that whilst the recommended minimum free chlorine residual levels were
   not attained (possibly due to high chlorine demand of test water), all
   other treatment objectives were within desired values, namely: < 1
   colony-forming unit (cfu)/100 mL with regards to thermotolerant (faecal)
   coliforms and < 5 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units) for treated water
   turbidity. Given the performance of the semi-decentralised approach
   tested here, it could be expected to attain all treatment objectives
   when tested in natural surface waters. It has the potential to bridge
   the gap between centralised (i.e. bulk water treatment kits) and fully
   decentralised (i.e. household) water supply strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A measurement campaign using unsteady wall pressure sensors on a bulb
   turbine draft tube was performed over the power and efficiency break off
   range of a N-11 curve. This study is part of the BulbT project,
   undertaken by the Consortium on hydraulic machines and the LAMH
   (Hydraulic Machine Laboratory of Laval University). The chosen operating
   points include the best efficiency point for a high runner blade angle
   and a high N11. Three other points, with the same N11, have been
   selected in the break off zone of the efficiency curve. Flow conditions
   have been set using the guide vanes while the runner blade angle
   remained constant. The pressure sensors were developed from small
   piezoresistive chips with high frequency response. The calibration gave
   an instrumental error lower than 0 3\% of the measurement range. The
   unsteady wall pressure was measured simultaneously at 13 locations
   inside the first part of the draft tube, which is conical, and at 16
   locations in the circular to rectangular transition part just
   downstream. It was also measured at 11 locations along a streamwise line
   path at the bottom left part of the draft tube, where flow separation
   occurs, covering the whole streamwise extent of the draft tube. For
   seven radial-azimuthal planes, four sensors were distributed
   azimuthally.
   As confirmed by tuft visualizations, the break off phenomenon is
   correlated to the presence of flow separation inside the diffuser at the
   wall. The break off is linked to the appearance of a large recirculation
   in the draft tube. The efficiency drop increases with the size of the
   separated region. Analysis of the draft tube pressure coefficients
   confirms that the break off is related to diffuser losses. The
   streamwise evolution of the mean pressure coefficient is analyzed for
   the different operating conditions. An azimuthal dissymmetry of the mean
   pressure produced by the separation is detected. The pressure signals
   have been analyzed and used to track the separation zone depending on
   the operating conditions. Spectral analysis of these signals reveals a
   low frequency unsteadiness generated by the flow separation.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of the BulbT project launched by the Consortium on
   Hydraulic Machines and the LAMH (Hydraulic Machine Laboratory of Laval
   University) in 2011, an intensive campaign to identify flow phenomena in
   the draft tube of a model bulb turbine has been done. A special focus
   was put on the draft tube component since it has a particular importance
   for recuperation in low head turbines. Particular operating points were
   chosen to analyse flow phenomena in this component. For each of these
   operating points, power, efficiency and pressure were measured following
   the IEC 60193 standard. Visualizations, unsteady wall pressure and
   efficiency measurements were performed in this component. The unsteady
   wall pressure was monitored at seven locations in the draft tube. The
   frequency content of each pressure signal was analyzed in order to
   characterize the flow phenomena across the efficiency hill chart.
   Visualizations were recorded with a high speed camera using tufts and
   cavitation bubbles as markers. The predominant detected phenomena were
   mapped and categorized in relation to the efficiency hill charts
   obtained for three runner blade openings. At partial load, the vortex
   rope was detected and characterized. An inflection in the partial load
   efficiency curves was found to be related to complex vortex rope
   instabilities. For overload conditions, the efficiency curves present a
   sharp drop after the best efficiency point, corresponding to an
   inflection on the power curves. This break off is more severe towards
   the highest blade openings. It is correlated to a flow separation at the
   wall of the draft tube. Also, due to the separation occurring in these
   conditions, a hysteresis effect was observed on the efficiency curves.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the BulbT project, led by the Consortium on Hydraulic
   Machines and the LAMH (Hydraulic Machine Laboratory of Laval
   University), the efficiency and power break off in a bulb turbine has
   been investigated. Previous investigations correlated the break off to
   draft tube losses. Tuft visualizations confirmed the emergence of a flow
   separation zone at the wall of the diffuser. Opening the guide vanes
   tends to extend the recirculation zone. The flow separations were
   investigated with two-dimensional and two-component particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) measurements designed based on the information
   collected from tuft visualizations. Investigations were done for a high
   opening blade angle with a N11 of 170 rpm, at best efficiency point and
   at two points with a higher Q11. The second operating point is inside
   the efficiency curve break off and the last operating point corresponds
   to a lower efficiency and a larger recirculation region in the draft
   tube. The PIV measurements were made near the wall with two cameras in
   order to capture two measurement planes simultaneously. The
   instantaneous velocity fields were acquired at eight different planes.
   Two planes located near the bottom wall were parallel to the generatrix
   of the conical part of the diffuser, while two other bottom planes
   diverged more from the draft tube axis than the cone generatrix. The
   last four planes were located on the draft tube side and diverged more
   from the draft tube axis than the cone generatrix. By combining the
   results from the various planes, the separation zone is characterized
   using pseudo-streamlines of the mean velocity fields, maps of the
   Reynolds stresses and maps of the reverse-flow parameter. The analysis
   provides an estimation of the separation zone size, shape and unsteady
   character, and their evolution with the guide vanes opening.}},

Abstract = {{In the BulbT project framework, a bulb turbine model was studied with a
   strongly diverging draft tube. At high discharge, flow separation occurs
   in the draft tube correlated to significant efficiency and power drops.
   In this context, a focus was put on the draft tube inlet flow
   conditions. Actually, a precise inlet flow velocity field is required
   for comparison and validation purposes with CFD simulation. This paper
   presents different laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements at the
   draft tube inlet and their analysis. The LDV was setup to measure the
   axial and circumferential velocity on a radius under the runner and a
   diameter under the hub. A method was developed to perform indirect
   measurement of the mean radial velocity component. Five operating
   conditions were studied to correlate the inlet flow to the separation in
   the draft tube. Mean velocities, fluctuations and frequencies allowed
   characterizing the flow. Using this experimental database, the flow
   structure was characterized. Phase averaged velocities based on the
   runner position allowed detecting the runner blade wakes. The velocity
   gradients induced by the blade tip vortices were captured. The guide
   vane wakes was also detected at the draft tube inlet. The recirculation
   in the hub wake was observed.}},

Title = {{Effect of Rotating Electrode on Magnetohydrodynamic Flow and Heat

Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{A transient three-dimensional (3D) coupled mathematical model has been
   developed to explore the effect of the rotating electrode on the
   electromagnetic, flow, temperature fields as well as solidification in
   the electroslag remelting (ESR) process. Maxwell's equations are solved
   by the finite volume formulation. The Joule heating and electromagnetic
   force (EMF), which are the source terms in the energy and momentum
   equations, are recalculated at each iteration as a function of the phase
   distribution. The movement of metal droplets is described by the volume
   of fluid (VOF) approach. Additionally, the solidification of the metal
   is modeled by an enthalpy-based technique, in which the mushy zone is
   treated as a porous medium with porosity equal to the liquid fraction.
   The rotation speed of the electrode is imposed on the inlet, and the
   melt rate changes with time proportionally to the Joule heating. The
   present work is the first attempt to investigate the innovative
   technology of ESR process with rotating electrode by a transient 3D
   comprehensive mathematical model. The metal droplets are thrown out by
   the centrifugal force without enough time to grow up in the process with
   rotating electrode. The melting rate increases because of the enhanced
   heat transfer in the vicinity of the electrode tip. With a 800A current,
   the melt rate increases from 0.0078 kg/s to 0,0114 kg/s, while the
   rotation speed ranges from 120 rpm to 160 rpm. Besides, the metal pool
   not only keeps the same depth, but also becomes wider in spite of a
   higher melting rate.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional particle size analysis of chopped forage is done by
   mechanical sieving, thereby providing mass distribution of one
   dimension. Recent studies have shown that long and narrow particles can
   tip during shaking and slide through holes smaller than the longest
   particle dimension. Meanwhile, well calibrated image analysis is
   definitely more accurate than screening in measuring true dimensions of
   chopped particles. An experiment was carried out with chopped alfalfa
   and corn harvested at three theoretical lengths of cut (TLOC = 4.8, 9.5,
   and 11.1 mm). Particles were initially sorted by the ASABE standard
   screening method. Particles within each screen were spread on a flat
   surface and photographed. Pictures were processed with the Image
   Analysis Toolbox in MATLAB, providing total pixel area, vector length (
   greatest distance between two points on the periphery), and an estimate
   of width for individual particles. All particles per picture were
   weighed, providing an estimate of volume and the third dimension (
   thickness). The ASABE standard method underestimated particle length as
   measured by image analysis by an average of 31\%. Width was not
   significantly different for alfalfa particles at three TLOC, as
   expected, but it increased for corn as TLOC increased, indicating
   breakage in two dimensions ( length and width) due to the bulky nature
   of corn. Image analysis and mass measurements provided detailed
   information on total outer surface area per unit mass, with an average
   of 218 cm(2) g(-1) dry matter (DM) for alfalfa particles and 133 cm(2)
   g(-1) DM for corn particles. Combining image analysis and mechanical
   sieving improved the estimation of mass and dimensional parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, different concentrations (0, 35, 50 and 65\%wt.) of
   recycled rubber (ethylene-propylene diene, EPDM) were blended with
   virgin polypropylene (PP) to produce thermoplastic elastomer resins via
   twin-screw extrusion. Then, the samples were pelletized and foamed by
   injection molding using a chemical blowing agent (azodicarbonamide,
   ADC). In particular, the molding process was optimized to determine the
   effect of processing parameters like blowing agent content, mold
   temperature, and injection conditions (pressure, velocity etc.). From
   the samples obtained, a complete morphological (skin thickness, cell
   size and cell density) and mechanical characterization was performed
   including density and hardness. The results obtained showed that it is
   more difficult to produce a good foam structure with increasing recycled
   rubber content.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of work has accumulated over the years in the study of the
   optical properties of single and coupled microcavities for a variety of
   applications, ranging from filters to sensors and lasers. The focus has
   been mostly on the geometry of individual resonators and/or on their
   combination in arrangements often referred to as photonic molecules
   (PMs).
   Our primary concern will be the lasing properties of PMs as ideal
   candidates for the fabrication of integrated microlasers, photonic
   molecule lasers. Whereas most calculations on PM lasers have been based
   on cold-cavity (passive) modes, i.e. quasi-bound states, a recently
   formulated steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) offers the
   possibility to take into account the spectral properties of the
   underlying gain transition, its position and linewidth, as well as
   incorporating an arbitrary pump profile. We will combine two theoretical
   approaches to characterize the lasing properties of PM lasers: for
   two-dimensional systems, the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory will obtain
   the resonant modes of the coupled molecules in an active medium
   described by SALT. Not only is then the theoretical description more
   complete, the use of an active medium provides additional parameters to
   control, engineer and harness the lasing properties of PM lasers for
   ultra-low threshold and directional single-mode emission.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are interested in evaluating the capacity of an
   underground mine channel in the millimeter wave band. Using a vector
   network analyzer (VNA) and three carefully chosen antennas, one omni and
   two horn antennas, we performed measurements at 40 m and 70 m levels in
   the CANMET mine located in Val-d'Or, Canada. This mine has tunnels with
   a width varying between 2.5 and 4 m and a height varying between 3 and 4
   m. Our work uses data for propagation in an underground mine obtained
   using a different setup from what was used previously. With both uniform
   and optimal power spectrum allocation (UPSA, OPSA) at the transmitter
   side, we have computed the capacity of the channel based on the
   measurements. By using optimal power allocation, we take into account
   the fading characteristics of the channel. The results prove that the
   capacity gain depends on the multipath characteristics. Also, they show
   the pertinence of the optimal power spectrum allocation for this type of
   channel.}},

Abstract = {{TSI and SAF methodologies have been applied to 6 tunnels located in
   Spain, Iran and Chile to estimate the regional tectonic in-situ stress
   (K) and the increment of the principal horizontal stress over the
   regional horizontal stress in a particular tunnel section (SAF). For
   high values of SAF, deformations in the tunnel sections were much higher
   than those expected in the design. The increment of the principal
   horizontal stress over the mean regional horizontal stress, due to local
   geological and geomechanical anisotropies have ranged from 1.1 to 2.9.
   In-situ stress tunnel zoning in terms of the variation of SAF values is

   evidenced with an excitation wavelength of 366 nm. No evidence of cell
   toxicity was found for human endothelial cells incubated with
   CMP-nanoDMS, at concentrations up to 100 mu g mL(-1) and for 48 h. No

Abstract = {{This article describes the development of a procedure for the bulk
   separation and determination of rare earth elements in soils by
   combining alkaline fusion, cloud point extraction, and inorganic mass
   spectrometry. The proposed cloud point extraction method uses a
   diglycolamide derivative as the chelating agent, which has a
   well-established affinity for rare earth elements. The method integrates
   bromine shielding to achieve efficient phase separation at highly acidic
   pH values. The methodology led to very low detection limits (0.2 to 30
   ng L (-1)), quantitative extraction (>97\%) for soils, and a high
   preconcentration factor ( up to 140). Decontamination factors were
   assessed for the most abundant elements, including trivalent ions such
   as Al3+ and Fe3+. A reduction in concentration of up to 180-fold was
   measured for some elements. Quantitative recoveries for most rare earth
   elements in highly acidic conditions were achieved and validated using
   sediment reference material (NIST-2709a). There was excellent agreement
   between the expected and measured concentrations for all 16 rare earth
   elements evaluated. The superior analytical figures of merit enabled
   rare earth elements determination at ultra-trace levels in environmental
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of data acquisition systems has emerged in recent years
   through the development of communication technologies. These systems
   make use of geographically distributed devices that generate large
   amounts of data. Several models of spatiotemporal patterns have been
   proposed to help users take advantage of such data. However, most of
   current approaches rely on query languages which are not easily
   manipulated by end-users. Because of their limited expressiveness, such
   approaches do not allow for reasoning about spatiotemporal phenomena
   that are so common in the real world. In this context, we propose a new
   definition of a spatiotemporal pattern. We use conceptual graphs to
   allow for a qualitative representation of patterns and we integrate
   contextual information in the definition of patterns to improve the
   reasoning ability of software agents. We propose an approach to help
   users manage spatiotemporal situations and illustrate it with a case
   study in the domain of power utilities.}},

Abstract = {{Camera calibration is essential for any optical system used to obtain 3D
   measurements from images. The precision of the 3D depth estimation
   relies on an appropriate camera model and the accurate estimation of
   model parameters. These parameters are sensitive to environmental
   conditions and it is well established that a vision system should be
   calibrated in operating conditions. This is not always possible since
   the calibration process is often tedious and time-consuming.
   Unfortunately, the use of poorly estimated calibration parameters for 3D
   reconstruction and measurements may lead to suboptimal performance of
   the system and inaccurate depth estimation.
   This paper presents a technique using an existing camera model and
   optical design software to perform calibration simulations. This virtual
   calibration technique allows for a study of the impact of environmental
   conditions on the calibration parameters. Using this procedure, it is
   also possible to predict the statistical behavior of the calibration
   parameters considering the chosen fabrication processes and tolerances.
   It can assist vision scientists in the choice of the optical system that
   best meets the requested precision of the 3D reconstruction. This
   technique could eventually be integrated in the lens design process to
   create more reliable optical systems that could be calibrated and used
   in a range of environmental conditions with a very small variation of
   their calibration parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Supplemental lighting is required during the October-March period in
   northern latitudes to harvest vegetables on a year-round basis and meet
   the consumer demand for healthy organic food produced locally. Hence,
   interlighting with light emitting diode (LED) modules is a promising
   approach to improve greenhouse crop productivity and profitability. A
   randomised complete block (n=3) experiment was performed in a greenhouse
   to determine the effects of using supplemental 3-D LED interlighting on
   photosynthesis, plant growth, yield and fruit quality. Tomato seedlings
   (Solanum lycopersicum `Trust' grafted on `Beaufort') were transplanted
   in 28 L containers filled with organic soil (2 plants/container; 12
   containers/plot) and grown under natural light supplemented with 16-h
   LED lighting per day. Five m long LED lighting modules, which provided a
   photon flux density (PFD) of similar to 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at a 30 cm
   distance, were installed at mid-canopy. Measurements of PFD near leaves
   located i) 30 cm above, ii) 30 cm below, and iii) at the height of the
   LED modules showed higher light levels over three specific wavelength
   spectra (345-500, 400-700 and 700-800 nm) than in control plots.
   Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were similar to 50\% higher in
   leaves sampled close to the LED lamps and 30 cm below compared with
   leaves in the control treatment, but were similar between treatments at
   30 cm above the LED fixtures. Total fruit yield per plant was higher
   (similar to 24\%; P= 0.091) in plots with supplementary LED lighting
   (5.2 kg plant(-1)) than in control plots (4.2 kg plant(-1)) after three
   months of LED interlighting. There was no difference in the number of
   fruit per plant between treatments, but tomatoes were significantly
   larger in the LED treatment (181 g) compared with controls (161 g).
   Growth parameters did not differ significantly between treatments. Under
   northern low light conditions, higher leaf photosynthesis and crop yield
   may be achieved by providing supplementary LED lighting within the plant
   canopy.}},

Abstract = {{Core-shell structured porous materials combining the functionalities of
   the core and shell have great application potential in various fields.
   Here, we report the synthesis of superparamagnetic core-shell structured
   microspheres which possess a core of nonporous silica-protected
   magnetite particle and an outer shell of ordered mesoporous silica with
   large pores. The synthesis adopts a co-surfactant templating approach
   under acidic conditions, with triblock-copolymer Pluronic P123 as a
   primary surfactant and a trace amount of cationic surfactant CTAB as an
   assistant template. The obtained magnetic mesoporous silica microspheres
   have uniform large pore size (4.5 nm), tuneable shell thickness (15-50
   nm), high specific surface area (190-250 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume
   (0.17-0.38 cm(3) g(-1)) and high magnetization (29.3 emu g(-1)). By
   using the obtained microspheres as an advanced magnetic absorbent, a
   fast, convenient, and efficient removal of large-size toxic microcystins
   in water solution was achieved in 60 seconds. The superparamagnetic
   properties and unique nanostructure enable the core-shell microspheres
   to be not only a novel absorbent for large size molecules, but also an
   ideal carrier for nanocatalysts like noble metallic nanoparticles and
   tools for peptide purification.}},

   electron-beam technique. We have analyzed the transmission spectra of
   thin films of the same nominal composition, obtained under identical
   conditions, but with four different thicknesses varying from 1 to 7
   micrometers. All fabricated films were annealed for 1h at 300 degrees C
   (below the glass transition temperature of this glass). As a result, we
   observed a thickness dependent blue-shift of about 100 nm of their
   transmission edge. We have calculated the optical band gap of those
   annealed thin films and we have observed that the slope of absorption
   edge becomes less abrupt and the band gap decreases when their thickness
   increases. Furthermore, this band gap decrease is accompanied with a
   broadening of the tails and localized states, which indicates an
   increase of the degree of disorder in the vitreous network. This could
   be explained by the higher density of defects and dangling bonds in the
   thinner films since the amount of deposited material is smaller. This
   implies therefore an increase of both the degree of disorder and the
   concentration of defects, and consequently the decrease of the optical
   gap.}},

Abstract = {{Norms for manufacturing substrates were derived about 4 decades ago and
   were based on substrate properties related to the retention of air and
   water (air-filled porosity and available water) for specific container
   and bed configurations, with limited information on water use for their
   irrigation. Since then, such norms have been implemented and used
   commercially at a large scale. However, regulations regarding water use,
   technological development and expansion of soilless culture to new crops
   have resulted in changes in production technologies operating
   dynamically under new constraints. Such constraints include key physical
   properties like aeration and water availability. Meanwhile, there has
   been a gradual shift of conventional biomass (peat and bark) to
   byproducts (greenwaste, sawdust) evolving themselves in quality and
   stability. Recent research results also indicated need for additional
   parameters to guide the manufacturing of the next generations of
   substrates with old and new sources of organic components being used in
   our evolving industrial world. These latter norms should be dynamic ones
   that are related to flux, gradient and consumption, as storage
   parameters (air-filled porosity and available water) are incomplete.
   Such norms should evolve toward gas diffusivity, respiration rate and
   saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity among others and take
   into account the context of application. This paper compares different
   studies results to show the relevance of including dynamic parameters
   controlling supply of water and air to plant roots among substrate
   manufacturing guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of recycled styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) powder with

   temperature (160-220 degrees C), rotor speed (30-120 rpm),
   homogenization time (3-9 min), components introduction order, surface
   treatment of SBR powder with a PS/tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, and
   addition of a coupling agent (styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene, SEBS)
   were studied. The compounds were then compression moulded and samples
   were prepared to measure their hardness, tensile properties (modulus,
   strength and elongation at break) and impact strength. Morphological
   analysis via scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) on selected samples
   was also performed to determine the interfacial state between the
   components. From all the results obtained, an optimisation procedure is
   proposed allowing the best compound to be determined as a function of
   final application.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to characterize the stormwater runoff
   for a residential catchment, evaluate the present detention pond removal
   efficiency for different pollutants, and evaluate how its efficiency can
   be increased by controlling the pond stormwater retention time. The
   analysed pollutants were total suspended solids (TSS), total metals and
   ammonia. Runoff pollutant concentrations were generally found to agree
   with literature for the small residential catchment. The design of the
   original pond was such that low retention times of most analysed
   pollutants occurred, causing a lower than expected removal efficiency
   when compared to similar types of ponds. The retrofitting of the pond
   consisted of adding a sluice gate at the outlet in order to retain
   stormwater for longer periods of time. The retrofit allowed drastic
   improvement of the removal efficiency for TSS, NH3-N and zinc, from 39
   to 90\%, 10 to 84\%, and 20 to 42\%, respectively.}},

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{210-222}},
Abstract = {{Woodwaste produces large volumes of leachate, which often contains high
   concentrations of phenolic compounds. These compounds are environmental
   contaminants whose proper management and treatment are mandated to
   reduce associated environmental impacts. Quality diagnostic and
   treatment efficiency assessments necessitate the development of rapid,
   accurate, and reproducible methods of detection and analysis to
   accurately quantify phenolic compounds. Liquid chromatography (LC)
   analysis with ultraviolet (UV) detection and solid-phase extraction
   (SPE) sample preparation on Oasis HLB cartridges were performed and
   adapted to quantify eight priority phenolic compounds in woodwaste
   leachate. The method was validated on a synthetic solution simulating
   the woodwaste leachate, on spiked real woodwaste leachate to 1 mu g
   mL(-1), and applied to quantify phenolic compounds in the real woodwaste
   leachate. Calibration curves were linear for all compounds in the range
   of 1-30 mu g mL(-1), and high recoveries varying between 93.5\% for
   2-chlorophenol and 112.8\% for 4-nitrophenol were obtained. Detection
   limits ranged from 0.06 mu g L-1 for 2-chlorophenol to 0.129 mu g L-1
   for phenol. The proposed method reduced interference, background noise,
   analysis time, amount of organic solvents and is less costly when
   compared with other methods.}},

Abstract = {{A wastewater biofiltration model is used to assess the potential of
   modelling plant-sized secondary carbon removal biofilter units. Two
   distinct datasets collected at the Seine-Centre biofiltration plant
   (Colombes, France) are used. The model is first calibrated on multiple
   grab samples taken at different heights inside the filter media. Data
   from 24 hour composite samples at the unit influent and effluent over a
   2 year period are then simulated. Additional data are used to estimate
   hourly concentration profiles from composite samples in order to
   correctly use both composite and grab samples during modelling. The
   calibrated model is in most cases able to correctly predict the general
   nutrient behaviour for both datasets. The results of statistical scores
   such as the mean error and the mean absolute error are low for soluble
   components and remain correct for particles during years 2008-2009. Only
   one parameter set containing few heavily modified values is used to
   obtain these results. Modelling plant-sized biofilters appears to be
   practical and can be useful for easily evaluating plant optimization

Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pulsed thermography has become a widely accepted technique for the
   nondestructive testing of materials. In its simplest form, an operator
   views the infrared image of the sample surface as it cools in response
   to a brief heat pulse. Subsurface discontinuities, such as voids or
   delaminations, appear as transient hot spots in the image sequence.
   However, to improve sensitivity to smaller, deeper features, and to
   compensate for common issues including diffusion blurring, anisotropy
   and non-uniform heating, additional signal processing is often applied.
   Three of the most popular processing techniques, thermographic signal
   reconstruction, differential absolute contrast and pulsed phase
   thermography, are based on the 1D solution of the heat conduction
   equation. These techniques were applied to experimental pulsed
   thermography data from laminated composite samples with simulated
   discontinuities (fluorocarbon resin inserts) and were compared to
   unprocessed results based on signal-to-noise ratio at maximum signal
   contrast. Results indicate that anomalies with large diameter/depth
   ratio do not require additional processing, but processing does become
   essential as the diameter/depth ratio becomes smaller. The threshold at
   which processing becomes necessary depends on both material properties
   (for example, anisotropy, thermal conductivity and diffusivity) and
   experimental parameters (for example, energy input, camera frame rate
   and spatial resolution).}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{9504-9513}},
Abstract = {{Bacteriophages are now widely recognized as major players in a wide
   variety of ecosystems. Novel genes are often identified in newly
   isolated phages as well as in environmental metavirome studies. Most of
   these novel viral genes have unknown functions but appear to be coding
   for small, non-structural proteins. To understand their biological role,
   very efficient genetic tools are required to modify them, especially in
   the genome of virulent phages. We first show that specific point
   mutations and large deletions can be engineered in the genome of the
   virulent phage 2972 using the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR-Cas Type
   II-A system as a selective pressure to increase recombination
   efficiencies. Of significance, all the plaques tested contained
   recombinant phages with the desired mutation. Furthermore, we show that
   the CRISPR-Cas engineering system can be used to efficiently introduce a
   functional methyltransferase gene into a virulent phage genome. Finally,
   synthetic CRISPR bacteriophage insensitive mutants were constructed by
   cloning a spacer-repeat unit in a low-copy vector illustrating the
   possibility to target multiple regions of the phage genome. Taken
   together, this data shows that the CRISPR-Cas system is an efficient and
   adaptable tool for editing the otherwise intractable genomes of virulent
   phages and to better understand phage-host interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The hiddenMarkov model (HMM) is a state-of-the-art model for automatic
   speech recognition. However, even though it already showed good results
   on past experiments, it is known that the state conditional independence
   that arises from HMM does not hold for speech recognition. One way to
   partly alleviate this problem is by concatenating each observation with
   their adjacent neighbors. In this article, we look at a novel way to
   perform this concatenation by taking into account the frequency of the
   features. This approach was evaluated on spoken connected digits data
   and the results show an absolute increase in classification of 4.63\% on
   average for the best model.}},
