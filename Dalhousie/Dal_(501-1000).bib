Abstract = {{Resource allocation is an important issue that has not been well
   resolved in multi-relay multi-user Decode-and-Forward (DF) OFDM systems
   with subcarrier-pairing at relays in the presence of heterogeneous
   flows, i.e., simultaneous real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT)
   traffic. In this paper, we address the issue by first formulating it as
   a joint optimization problem of relay-user pair selection,
   subcarrier-pair assignment and power allocation and then solving it
   through dual decomposition and subgradient methods. Asymptotic optimal
   iterative algorithms with polynomial complexity are proposed with the
   objective of maximizing sum-transmission-rate of NRT traffic while
   providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee for RT traffic, in two
   cases: (i) with total network power constraint and (ii) with individual
   power constraints. Effective selections of initial dual variables and
   stepsize for the subgradient method are also presented. Simulation
   results are provided in multiple scenarios and they show that: (i) the
   proposed algorithms outperform the existing schemes in terms of
   providing QoS requirements of RT users and maximizing sum network
   transmission rates; (ii) algorithms designed under total power
   constraint exploit the power resource much better than those under
   individual power constraints. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{New results are reported on investigation of dispersion curves for
   surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at an inhomogenously doped
   semiconductor/dielectric interface whereby the dielectric is represented
   by the same undoped semiconductor. The doped semiconductor is described
   by its frequency-dependent permittivity that varies with the depth. It
   is shown that a transition layer (TL) with a linear change in carrier
   concentration supports one branch dispersion curve regardless of the TL
   thickness. The obtained dispersion curves reach a maximum at a finite
   frequency depending on the TL thickness, and subsequently asymptotically
   approach the zero frequency in the shortwave limit. Therefore two
   surface plasmon modes are supported at a given frequency: a long-wave
   mode with a positive group velocity and a short-wave mode with a
   negative group velocity. A condition of a zero group velocity can be
   satisfied by tuning the TL layer. It is shown that the conventional
   dispersion relation for SPPs at a TL with a zero thickness is an
   asymptotic solution, and the convergence of real dispersion curves is
   point-wise instead of an expected uniform convergence. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of nano-reinforcement on the mechanical
   response of adhesively bonded single-lap joints with composite adherends
   subjected to different loading (strain) rates are systematically
   investigated. The results are then compared to those of the neat
   thermoset resin and a toughened acrylic-epoxy adhesive. More
   specifically, nano-reinforced and neat resin-bonded joints mating
   carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy adherends were subjected to tensile
   loadings under 1.5 and 3mm/min and tensile impacts at a loading rate of
   2.04E+5mm/min. In some cases, additional tests were conducted to obtain
   the enhancement in properties that could be gained using the
   nano-reinforcements for use in our further numerical investigations. The
   other loading rates tried were 15, 150, and 1500mm/min. The high loading
   rate tests were conducted, using a modified instrumented pendulum
   equipped with a specially designed impact load transfer apparatus. The
   dispersion of nanoparticles was facilitated using a mechanical stirrer
   and a three-roll mill machine. The results of the impact tests revealed
   the positive influence of nano-reinforcements on the loading rate
   sensitivity of the joints. In all, the overall stiffness and strength of
   the joints increased as the nano-reinforcement and loading rates were
   increased. The failure surfaces were then examined with a scanning
   electron microscope to observe the distribution of the nanoparticles and
   study the mode of failure.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to provide further insight into the modeling aspects and
   influence of some important parameters involved in the simulation of
   vibration of submerged pipes, especially in relation to vibration-based
   structural health monitoring (VB-SHM) techniques. Two widely used
   techniques for modeling submerged pipelines, namely the ``added mass{''}
   and ``coupled acoustic-structural{''} approaches are compared, and their
   limitations and advantages in the context of VB-SHM are highlighted.
   Moreover, the paper also presents a comprehensive study of the effect of
   operational variability on the accuracy of VB-SHM of offshore pipelines.
   It is demonstrated that the geometric stiffness produced by the
   operational variability (such as changes in the internal and external
   pressures of pipelines) could variably alter the overall stiffness of
   such submerged bodies, hence affecting their dynamic response. Depending
   on the pipe stiffness, the imposed variations could significantly affect
   the accuracy of VB-SHM trials.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 108 specimens were prepared to examine the hydraulic
   performance and strength performance of nine different cement-stabilized
   soils under unexposed and freeze-thaw exposed conditions. Specimens from
   each mix design were evaluated under two levels of curing conditions
   (i.e., immature versus mature). Hydraulic conductivity and unconfined
   compressive strength (UCS) measurements were performed to assess changes
   in the performance of specimens after 12 cycles of freezing at -10 +/- 1
   degrees C and thawing at 22 +/- 1 degrees C. Measured mass losses of the
   specimens from a standard brushing test were also monitored at different
   freeze-thaw cycles, and results were compared with the changes in the
   hydraulic performance for each mix design. Hydraulic conductivity
   measurements on unexposed mature specimens showed that the lowest values
   likely occurred at water contents slightly wet of optimum water content
   (OWC). The UCS values showed a general decreasing trend with the
   increase in the water content for both immature and mature specimens
   under unexposed conditions. After freeze-thaw exposure, specimens showed
   minor reductions as well as increases of up to 5250 times in hydraulic
   conductivity values. Increases of up to 14\% and reductions of up to
   58\% in compressive strength were also observed, compared with unexposed
   conditions. For most cases, mature specimens resulted in a higher degree
   of damage compared with immature specimens. Results from the brushing
   tests showed this test method is not a suitable indicator for predicting
   changes in the hydraulic performance of cement-stabilized soils.
   Hydraulic conductivity measurements after a period of post-exposure
   healing showed damaged specimens have some potential in recovering parts
   of the increased hydraulic conductivity value due to the healing
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Ventilation heterogeneity is an important marker of small airway
   dysfunction in asthma. The frequency dependence of respiratory system
   resistance (R-rs) from oscillometry is used as a measure of this
   heterogeneity. However, this has not been quantitatively assessed or
   compared with other outcomes from oscillometry, including respiratory
   system reactance (X-rs) and the associated elastance (E-rs). Here, we
   used a multibranch model of the human lung, including an upper airway
   shunt, to match previously reported respiratory mechanics in mild to
   severe asthma. We imposed heterogeneity by narrowing a proportion of the
   peripheral airways to account for patient E-rs at 5 Hz, and then
   narrowed central airways to account for the remaining R-rs at 18 Hz. The
   model required >75\% of the small airways to be occluded to reproduce
   severe asthma. While the model produced frequency dependence in R-rs, it
   was upward-shifted below 5 Hz compared with in-vivo results, indicating
   that other factors, including more distributed airway narrowing or
   central airway wall compliance, are required. However, E-rs
   quantitatively reflected the imposed heterogeneity better than the
   frequency dependence of R-rs, independent of the frequency range for the
   estimation, and thus was a more robust measure of small-airway function.
   Thus, E-rs appears to have greater potential as a clinical measure of
   early small-airway disease in asthma.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis has become an important
   method of diet estimation in ecology, especially marine ecology.
   Controlled feeding trials to validate the method and estimate the
   calibration coefficients necessary to account for differential
   metabolism of individual fatty acids have been conducted with several
   species from diverse taxa. However, research into potential refinements
   of the estimation method has been limited. We compared the performance
   of the original method of estimating diet composition with that of five
   variants based on different combinations of distance measures and
   calibration-coefficient transformations between prey and predator fatty
   acid signature spaces. Fatty acid signatures of pseudopredators were
   constructed using known diet mixtures of two prey data sets previously
   used to estimate the diets of polar bears Ursus maritimus and gray seals
   Halichoerus grypus, and their diets were then estimated using all six
   variants. In addition, previously published diets of Chukchi Sea polar
   bears were re-estimated using all six methods. Our findings reveal that
   the selection of an estimation method can meaningfully influence
   estimates of diet composition. Among the pseudopredator results, which
   allowed evaluation of bias and precision, differences in estimator
   performance were rarely large, and no one estimator was universally
   preferred, although estimators based on the Aitchison distance measure
   tended to have modestly superior properties compared to estimators based
   on the Kullback-Leibler distance measure. However, greater differences
   were observed among estimated polar bear diets, most likely due to
   differential estimator sensitivity to assumption violations. Our
   results, particularly the polar bear example, suggest that additional
   research into estimator performance and model diagnostics is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{A safe supply of drinking water is a cornerstone of public health and
   community well-being. Complacency among those responsible for the
   provision of safe drinking water (e. g., water suppliers, operators, and
   managers) has led to numerous and otherwise avoidable waterborne
   outbreaks. Water safety plans present a risk-based, proactive framework
   for water management, and when properly implemented, virtually
   eliminates the option for complacency. However, the uptake of water
   safety plans remain limited worldwide. This paper reports on the
   experiences of early water safety plan adopters and identifies a number
   of non-technical operational and human factors that have undermined
   previous efforts. Specifically, it identifies these factors as a gap in
   the water safety plan implementation literature and suggests
   incorporating the broader community in water safety planning through a
   community readiness approach. Assessing and building community readiness
   for water safety plans is suggested to be a critical pre-implementation
   step, and a potential tool for use by water suppliers and by policy
   makers.}},

Abstract = {{Key points Natriuretic peptides (NPs) elicit their effects via multiple
   NP receptors (including NPR-A, NPR-B and NPR-C, with NPR-C being
   relatively poorly understood). We have studied the effects of NPR-C
   ablation on cardiac structure, function and arrhythmogenesis using NPR-C
   knockout (NPR-C-/-) mice. NPR-C-/- mice are characterized by sinoatrial
   node (SAN) dysfunction and a profound increase in susceptibility to
   atrial fibrillation. Increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in NPR-C-/-
   mice was associated with slowed electrical conduction in the SAN as well
   as the right and left atria due to enhanced collagen expression and
   deposition in the atria (structural remodelling), but without changes in
   action potential morphology (electrical remodelling) in isolated SAN or
   atrial myocytes. This study demonstrates a critical protective role for
   NPR-C in the heart.
   AbstractNatriuretic peptides (NPs) are critical regulators of the
   cardiovascular system that are currently viewed as possible therapeutic
   targets for the treatment of heart disease. Recent work demonstrates
   potent NP effects on cardiac electrophysiology, including in the
   sinoatrial node (SAN) and atria. NPs elicit their effects via three NP
   receptors (NPR-A, NPR-B and NPR-C). Among these receptors, NPR-C is
   poorly understood. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to determine
   the effects of NPR-C ablation on cardiac structure and arrhythmogenesis.
   Cardiac structure and function were assessed in wild-type (NPR-C+/+) and
   NPR-C knockout (NPR-C-/-) mice using echocardiography, intracardiac
   programmed stimulation, patch clamping, high-resolution optical mapping,
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction and histology. These studies
   demonstrate that NPR-C-/- mice display SAN dysfunction, as indicated by
   a prolongation (30\%) of corrected SAN recovery time, as well as an
   increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation (6\% in NPR-C(+/+)vs.
   47\% in NPR-C-/-). There were no differences in SAN or atrial action
   potential morphology in NPR-C-/- mice; however, increased atrial
   arrhythmogenesis in NPR-C-/- mice was associated with reductions in SAN
   (20\%) and atrial (15\%) conduction velocity, as well as increases in
   expression and deposition of collagen in the atrial myocardium. No
   differences were seen in ventricular arrhythmogenesis or fibrosis in
   NPR-C-/- mice. This study demonstrates that loss of NPR-C results in SAN
   dysfunction and increased susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias in
   association with structural remodelling and fibrosis in the atrial
   myocardium. These findings indicate a critical protective role for NPR-C
   in the heart.}},

Abstract = {{Women living on rural Kenyan smallholder dairy farms burn wood as
   biofuel in family cookhouses. Unventilated biofuel combustion produces
   harmful levels of respirable particles and volatile organic compound
   (VOC) emissions in indoor environments. Biogas digesters, which can
   generate high methane-content biogas from livestock manure composting
   were recently installed on 31 farms. The study objectives were to
   compare VOC exposure profiles for women cooking on farms with and
   without biogas digesters, and to compare seasonal variations in VOC
   exposures for those women cooking with biogas. Participants (n=31 biogas
   farms, n=31 referent farms) wore passive thermal desorption VOC sampling
   tubes and recorded cookhouse fuel use on time activity sheets for 7
   days. Women using biogas spent significantly less time (mean=509
   min/week) exposed to cookhouse wood smoke compared with the referent
   group (mean=1122 min/week) (P<0.01). Total VOC exposure did not differ
   between farm groups (P=0.14), though concentrations of
   trans-1,3-dichloropropene, bromoform, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene in biogas
   cookhouses were significantly lower than in referent cookhouses, even
   after Bonferroni correction. The composition of VOC species was also
   significantly different, reflecting the different fuel sources. Biogas
   digester technologies have great potential for reducing exposure to wood
   smoke VOCs in low-income countries.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to determine if trace additions of
   silicon could be used as a means to modify the metallurgical attributes
   of industrially processed Al-Cu-Mg powder metallurgy alloys. In
   completing this research a nominal bulk chemical composition of Al-2.3
   wt.\% Cu-1.6 wt.\% Mg-0.2 wt.\% Sn was utilized. The effects of minor
   (0.2 wt.\%) silicon additions on this baseline system as well as
   variants prepared with prealloyed iron and/or nickel were assessed.
   Silicon posed no impediments to sintering given that each alloy system
   sintered to near-full density (>99\%). Once heat treated to the T6
   condition, silicon promoted significant gains in yield strength
   (20\%-30\%) and UTS (10\%-20\%) in each instance. Data also confirmed
   that the beneficial effects of silicon persisted during prolonged
   thermal exposure at temperatures as high as 260 degrees C. Ultimately,
   the most desirable combination of properties was achieved in the PM
   system prepared with prealloyed iron and nickel coupled with silicon
   modification. The performance of this sintered alloy was very comparable
   to wrought 2618-T6 and greatly exceeded that of the conventional
   commercial PM mix AC-2014-T6.}},

   found that the FEM accurately predicted the test sample deformation, and
   the bending and twisting response of the samples were linear within the

   also exhibited appreciably lower concentrations of residual oxygen and
   hydrogen when compared to those present in the raw powders. Degassing
   experiments completed through thermogravimetric analyser (TGA)-gas
   chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) indicated that the release of
   CO2 and adsorbed/chemisorbed H2O were responsible for the enhanced
   purity of the SPS products. Particle size was also a factor of influence

Abstract = {{A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method was developed capable
   of measuring the rate of in situ alloying during Al-V master alloy (MA)
   sintering of Ti6Al4V based on monitoring the characteristics of the
   beta-alpha phase transformation during cooling from the sintering
   temperature. The beta transus temperature and transformation temperature
   range both decreased with increasing sintering time, while the enthalpy
   of transformation increased. Supporting microstructural analysis
   confirmed that this change in the beta-alpha phase transformation
   behaviour was due to interdiffusion of Ti, Al and V between the MA
   particle and CP-Ti matrix and the progressive dissolution of the MA
   particles. The majority of in situ alloying and MA dissolution occurred
   within one hour, while 3 h of sintering was required to achieve a level
   of homogenisation similar to that measured for a wrought Ti6Al4V sample.
   The use of finer MA particles resulted in more rapid and complete
   homogenisation.}},

Abstract = {{We report here magnetic resonance imaging measurements performed on
   suspensions with a bulk solid volume fraction (phi(0)) up to 0.55
   flowing in a pipe. We visualize and quantify spatial distributions of
   phi and velocity across the pipe at different axial positions. For dense
   suspensions (phi(0) > 0.5), we found a different behavior compared to
   the known cases of lower phi(0). Our experimental results demonstrate
   compaction within the jammed region (characterized by a zero macroscopic
   shear rate) from the jamming limit phi(m) approximate to 0.58 at its
   outer boundary to the random close packing limit phi(rcp) approximate to
   0.64 at the center. Additionally, we show that phi and velocity profiles
   can be fairly well captured by a frictional rheology accounting for both
   further compaction of jammed regions as well as normal stress
   differences.}},

Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary techno-economic evaluation of retrofitting reciprocating
   internal combustion engine based cogeneration into existing Canadian
   houses for the purpose of achieving or approaching net-zero energy
   rating is presented. Primary energy and electricity consumption,
   associated greenhouse gas emissions and tolerable capital cost are used
   as indicators. A whole building simulation model was used to simulate
   the performance of a commonly used cogeneration system architecture with
   thermal storage in ``typical{''} single storey houses located in
   Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver, representing the
   five major climatic regions of Canada. The system is assumed to sell
   excess electricity to the grid at the purchase price. A high efficiency
   auxiliary boiler is included to supply heat when cogeneration unit
   capacity is not sufficient to meet the heating load. The effect of
   thermal storage capacity, interest rate and acceptable payback period on
   the overall performance was evaluated through a sensitivity analysis.
   The findings suggest that internal combustion engine based cogeneration
   provides a promising option to achieve net-zero energy rating for
   Canadian houses, and therefore more detailed studies focusing on the
   entire Canadian housing stock are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study introduces a new strategy for functionalizing graphene
   nanoplatelets (GNPs) by bonding a silane agent to its structure. In
   order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method, epoxy resin
   specimens reinforced with silane modified GNPs (G-Si) are prepared at
   different weight contents of nanoparticles along with three other types
   of GNPs (unmodified GNP, graphene oxide GNP {[}GO], and amino
   functionalized GNP {[}G-NH2]). The nanocomposites' mechanical
   properties, such as the elastic modulus, ultimate strength, modulus of
   toughness and fracture toughness are evaluated and compared for
   different types of functionalization. Raman spectroscopy,
   thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) are employed to characterize the chemical and
   structural changes of the functionalized GNPs. The results show that
   nanocomposites containing G-Si and G-NH2 provide the best results for
   most of the mentioned properties. The functionalization of GNPs gives
   the most promising results for fracture toughness of epoxy, showing an
   82\% increase, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs and
   XRD analysis reveal that an improved dispersion status is obtained by
   GNP functionalization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Prediction functions based on simple kinetic models can be used to
   estimate soil N mineralization as an aid to improved fertilizer N
   management, but require long-term incubations to obtain the necessary
   parameters. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the
   feasibility of predicting the mineralizable N parameters necessary to
   implement prediction functions and in addition to verify their
   efficiency in modeling soil N supply (SNS) over a growing season. To
   implement a prediction function based on a first-order (F) kinetic
   model, a regression equation was developed using a data base of 92
   soils, which accounted for 65\% of the variance in potentially
   mineralizable N (N-0) using soil total N (STN) and Pool I, a labile
   mineralizable N pool. However, the F prediction function did not provide
   satisfactory prediction (R-2 = 0.17-0.18) of SNS when compared with a
   field-based measure of SNS (PASNS) if values of N-0 were predicted from
   the regression equation. We also examined a two-pool zero-plus
   first-order (ZF) prediction function. A regression model was developed
   including soil organic C and Pool I and explained 66\% of the variance
   in k(S), the rate constant of the zero-order pool. In addition, a
   regression equation was developed which explained 86\% of the variance
   in the size of the first-order pool, N-L, from Pool I. The ZF prediction
   function provided satisfactory prediction of SNS (R-2 = 0.41-0.49) using
   both measured and predicted values of k(S) and N-L. This study
   demonstrated a simple prediction function can be used to estimate SNS
   over a growing season where the mineralizable N parameters are predicted
   from simple soil properties using regression equations.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a methodology has been proposed for risk analysis of dust
   explosion scenarios based on Bayesian network. Our methodology also
   benefits from a bow-tie diagram to better represent the logical
   relationships existing among contributing factors and consequences of
   dust explosions. In this study, the risks of dust explosion scenarios
   are evaluated, taking into account common cause failures and
   dependencies among root events and possible consequences. Using a
   diagnostic analysis, dust particle properties, oxygen concentration, and
   safety training of staff are identified as the most critical root events
   leading to dust explosions. The probability adaptation concept is also
   used for sequential updating and thus learning from past dust explosion
   accidents, which is of great importance in dynamic risk assessment and
   management. We also apply the proposed methodology to a case study to
   model dust explosion scenarios, to estimate the envisaged risks, and to
   identify the vulnerable parts of the system that need additional safety

Abstract = {{This investigation emanated from the concern of management of a
   distribution centre (DC) in the beverage industry that a fast-picking
   tunnel was severely congested during peak-picking season. They were
   interested in finding out whether the placement sequence of
   stock-keeping units (SKUs) has an impact on throughput/performance. The
   objective of this investigation was to optimise the placement order of
   products in the fast-picking tunnel of a DC to reduce congestion and
   improve throughput. To minimise the total restocking effort, the number
   of pick locations for each product picked was first optimised. A
   simulation model was then built to evaluate the queuing of a given
   product placement strategy in the fast-picking tunnel (forward pick
   line). Finally, the performance of the following product placement
   strategies were evaluated: current strategy, probability low to high,
   probability high to low, volume low to high, volume high to low,
   probabilityxvolume high to low, probabilityxvolume low to high,
   probability bowl and volume bowl. The sequencing probability low to high
   sequence was the best placement strategy followed by the volume bowl and
   probability bowl sequences. The gap between these sequences reduces as
   the arrival rate in the forward pick area increases. Practitioners seem
   to prefer the bowl sequences over the probability low to high sequence
   because of the need to build a solid pallet base. Therefore, the
   industrial sponsor preferred the volume bowl sequence for
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainties exist in the water resources system, while traditional
   two-stage stochastic programming is risk-neutral and compares the random
   variables (e.g., total benefit) to identify the best decisions. To deal
   with the risk issues, a risk-aversion inexact two-stage stochastic
   programming model is developed for water resources management under
   uncertainty. The model was a hybrid methodology of interval-parameter
   programming, conditional value-at-risk measure, and a general two-stage
   stochastic programming framework. The method extends on the traditional
   two-stage stochastic programming method by enabling uncertainties
   presented as probability density functions and discrete intervals to be
   effectively incorporated within the optimization framework. It could not
   only provide information on the benefits of the allocation plan to the
   decision makers but also measure the extreme expected loss on the
   second-stage penalty cost. The developed model was applied to a
   hypothetical case of water resources management. Results showed that
   that could help managers generate feasible and balanced risk-aversion
   allocation plans, and analyze the trade-offs between system stability
   and economy.}},

Abstract = {{A method of experimentally determining the mechanical stiffness of
   single cells by using differential displacement measurements in a two
   stage spring system is presented. The spring system consists of a known
   MEMS reference spring and an unknown cellular stiffness: the ratio of
   displacements is related to the ratio of stiffness. A polyMUMPs
   implementation for aqueous media is presented and displacement
   measurements made from optical microphotographs using a FFT based
   displacement method with a repeatability of similar to 20 nm. The
   approach was first validated on a MEMS two stage spring system of known
   stiffness. The measured stiffness ratios of control structures (i) MEMS
   spring systems and (ii) polystyrene microspheres were found to agree
   with theoretical values. Mechanical tests were then performed on
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) in aqueous media. Cells were
   placed (using a micropipette) inside MEMS measuring structures and
   compressed between two jaws using an electrostatic actuator and
   displacements measured. Tested cells showed stiffness values between 5.4
   and 8.4 N m(-1) with an uncertainty of 11\%. In addition, non-viable
   cells were tested by exposing viable cells to methanol. The resultant
   mean cell stiffness dropped by factor of 3 x and an explicit
   discrimination between viable and non-viable cells based on mechanical
   stiffness was seen.}},

Title = {{Sound absorption of a flexible micro-perforated panel absorber based on
   PVDF piezoelectric film}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Micro-perforated panel (MPP) has been widely used in the noise control
   field. However, the performance at low frequencies is relatively poor
   due to the restricted space limitations in actual applications. Hence in
   this paper a flexible micro-perforated panel absorber (PVDF-MPPA) based
   on Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film is proposed, which
   is composed of a perforated aluminum-electrode PVDF piezoelectric film
   and a small air cavity. Its sound absorption at low frequency can be
   improved by employing panel vibration effect and shunting the electrodes
   of piezoelectric film with some electrical impedance. The corresponding
   structure of the PVDF-MPPA was designed and fabricated. Experiments were
   performed under different shunting cases such as open circuit, short
   circuit, and resonant circuit in an impedance tube with the testing
   frequency range from 100 Hz to 1600 Hz. The results demonstrated that
   the PVDF-MPPA with shunt circuits had a wider absorption bandwidth
   compared with a rigid MPP absorber with the same structural parameters.
   When compared with the open circuit and short circuit cases, the
   PVDF-MPPA with resonant circuit definitely has a better low frequency
   absorption performance if the shunting parameters have been carefully
   tuned. By using shunt-damping technology, the PVDF-MPPA has a potential
   to be widely used as an efficient sound absorber in practical situations
   because of its simple structure and good absorption performance at low
   frequencies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDHeightened awareness of the health benefits of fish oil
   consumption has led to a great increase in the number of fish oil
   supplements available to the consumer. Therefore manufacturers are
   continually looking for ways to distinguish their products from those of
   competitors. Minimally refined or virgin fish oils provide a unique
   feature; however, petroleum hydrocarbon contamination from oil spills is
   a reality in the world's oceans. The question arises whether oil
   produced from fish species caught in these polluted areas is free of
   petroleum hydrocarbons, with particular interest in unresolved complex
   mixtures (UCMs). This study investigates the presence of UCMs in
   commercially available fish oil supplements advertised as being virgin,
   as well as refined.
   RESULTSWeathered petroleum hydrocarbons in the form of a UCM were found
   at 523 mu g g(-1) in a virgin Alaskan salmon oil supplement. Supplements
   that were refined were free of this contamination.
   CONCLUSIONFish used in the production of fish oil supplements appear to
   have accumulated petrogenic hydrocarbons in their tissues which were not
   removed by minimal oil refining. Further study is required to determine
   if there are any health implications associated with long-term
   consumption of these contaminated supplements. (c) 2014 Society of

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{518}},
Pages = {{31-50}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the fatty acid (FA) composition and carbon stable isotope
   ratios of individual FAs (delta C-13(FA)) of 3 zooplankton species
   (Themisto libellula, Calanus marshallae/glacialis, and Thysanoessa
   raschii) sampled from the Bering Sea during winter maximum ice extent,
   spring ice melt, and summer ice-free conditions in 2009 and 2010. Our
   goal was to assess diets of these ecologically important species and
   estimate the proportional contribution of pelagic and sympagic carbon
   sources to their diets. FA profiles showed little variation in diet
   within species between ice conditions or years but revealed differences
   in diet among species. FA biomarkers confirmed that T. libellula was
   predominately carnivorous and that C. marshallae/glacialis and T.
   raschii were primarily herbivorous. Estimates from 4 stable isotope
   mixing models using combinations of delta C-13(FA) values of diatom FA
   markers (16:1n-7, 20:5n-3), and a flagellate FA marker (22:6n-3) showed
   that substantial, albeit highly variable, proportions of these FAs
   originated from organic matter originating from sea ice algae (T.
   libellula 36 to 72\%, C. marshallae/glacialis 27 to 63\%, and T. raschii
   39 to 71\%). Our results suggest that ice algae may be an important food
   source for zooplankton when water column phytoplankton are not available
   during critical periods in their life history. Predicted increases in
   water column phytoplankton production in the Bering Sea may help offset
   the expected reduction in ice algal production and any detrimental
   effects that this might have on consumers such as zooplankton.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the sintering response of a hypereutectic
   aluminum-silicon alloy, specifically Alumix-231 (Al-14Si-2.5Cu-0.5Mg),
   using Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). The focus was to link the influence
   of the sintering parameters to the sintered density, microstructure,
   hardness and flexural properties in T1 and T6 conditions. The results
   were compared to those obtained using the conventional press and sinter
   route, a method typically used for this alloy. The samples consolidated
   using SPS attained densities between 95\% and 100\%TD compared to those
   obtained by conventional sintering which were approximately 94\%TD.
   Before and after the aging heat treatment, microhardness and mechanical
   properties were assessed for both SPS and press-sinter samples. After
   sintering, in the TI condition, a hardness of 89 +/- 7 HV, a flexural
   strength of 702 +/- 28 MPa and a flexural strain of 6.2 +/- 1.2\% were
   obtained for the SPS samples. In the T6 condition, a hardness of 157 +/-
   5 HV, a flexural strength of 654 +/- 38 MPa and a flexural strain of 4.4
   +/- 0.2\% were obtained in the ideal SPS conditions. On the other hand,
   a hardness of 137 +/- 8 HV, a flexural strength of 315 +/- 69 MPa, and a
   flexural strain of 3.4 +/- 0.1\% were achieved for the conventional
   sintering process after the T6 heat treatment. The hardness in the T1
   condition was lower than what had been reported in the literature,
   however after a T6 heat treatment, hardness values obtained in this
   study were similar to previous work. On the other hand, the difference
   in flexural properties was unlike previous studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{618}},

Abstract = {{In this study it was determined that the addition of Fe to a Ti powder
   mixture results in pore formation either through the slow, solid state
   diffusion of Fe below the eutectic point (1085 degrees C), or as a
   result of Fe rich liquid formation above 1085 degrees C. The size of the
   pores scales proportionally with the size of the Fe particles used.
   Subsequent densification at 1200 degrees C increased with a decrease in
   Fe particle size. The rate of Fe in-situ alloying and microstructural
   homogenization during sintering was determined using a newly developed
   differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method. The rate of
   homogenization increased with a decrease in Fe particle size. The use of
   sub 10 mu m Fe powder resulted in improved densification compared to
   pure Ti and leads to complete homogenization during heating to 1200
   degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) will rely on the concept of ``small
   cell{''}, i.e. low-power and low-cost radio base station, whose target
   is to provide broadband and energy-efficient coverage in residential
   sites and hot spot outdoor environment. Small cells will be
   characterized by some peculiar features that will make easier the
   coordination among base stations in order to improve link capacity. In
   this paper, we will assess the link level performance of a cooperative
   multi-point transmission scheme for LTE-A small-cell uplink. The mobile
   terminal transmits the uplink signal to a virtual networked MIMO
   consisting of different Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) jointly processing the
   signal. Coorperation is applied at eNB level in order to improve system
   diversity without increasing terminal complexity. Bit-Error-Rate (BER)
   performance of the simulated networked MIMO system will be first
   appreciated, assuming error-free and delay-free backhauling. In the
   perspective of considering realistic simulation scenarios, we shall
   analyze the impact of channel estimation and channel coding, as per 3GPP
   standard, on link performance. The link energy efficiency will be also
   analyzed in terms of useful energy spent by the mobile terminal for
   correct transmission of information. Selected simulation results will
   show the dramatic improvement both in terms of BER performance and
   reduced energy consumption, obtained by cooperative transmission
   techniques for the LTE-A uplink. Imperfect channel estimation represents
   a critical issue, able at significantly impairing eNBs coordination even
   when robust channel coding is adopted.}},

Abstract = {{A ``nuclear power plant robot{''} is introduced in this paper. It is

   swinging arms in the front of the robot and two in the rear, they can
   swing synchronously, respectively. The movement posture during the
   boss-climbing are discussed. As the poses of the arms change, the
   position of the robot's centroid will change, thus affecting the
   obstacle surmounting capability of the robot. The theoretical value of
   robot platform's maximal obstacle surmounting capability is obtained and
   compared with the test results. The effect of centroid position on
   obstacle surmounting capability is obtained, which provides theoretical
   basis for centroid position control in obstacle surmounting process. An

   robot, where obstacle avoidance algorithm is the core. Artificial
   potential field (APF) algorithm has the advantage of sample mathematical
   model, which is understood and applied into practice easily. However,
   there are some problems in APF algorithm, for examples, local minimum
   and GNRON problem, which limits the effect of APF algorithm. In order to
   solve these problems, we propose a modified APF algorithm in this paper.
   This modified algorithm utilizes the improved potential field formulas
   for GNRON problem. Otherwise, this algorithm uses a method of boundary
   detection and setting a secondary target for optimal path and local
   minimum. Finally, we use MRPT virtual simulation platform to verify the
   modified algorithm. The simulation result and field test show that the
   modified is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Obstacle avoidance ability is the significant embodiment of the ground
   mobile robot, and the basic guarantee of the ground mobile robot to
   perform various tasks. Obstacle avoidance technologies are divided into
   two kinds, one is based on the global map and another is based on
   sensors respectively. This paper mainly aims at the local obstacle
   avoidance method based on sensors. The study of obstacle detection and
   obstacle avoidance are two inseparable parts in the research of obstacle
   avoidance ability. This paper proposes an efficient obstacle detection
   and obstacle avoidance algorithm based on 2-D lidar. A method is
   proposed to get the information of obstacles by filtering and clustering
   the laser-point cloud data. Also, this method generates the forward
   angle and velocity of robot based on the principle of minimum cost
   function. The obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance algorithm has
   advantages of a simple mathematical model and good real-time
   performance. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on
   MATLAB simulation platform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers amplify-and-forward (AF), multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO), two-hop relay systems in which the inter-relay
   interference (IRI), if not mitigated, may limit performance. In these
   systems with half-duplex relays, through TDMA scheduling, the wireless
   medium in both hops is always utilized through the simultaneous
   transmission of one of the sources and one of the relays which in turn
   leads to IRI. By representing IRI with the recursive term(s) and
   exploiting opportunistic listening, this interference is fully removed
   at the receiver(s) using limited channel state information (CSI) from
   both hops. As presented in this paper, the proposed MIMO IRI
   cancellation is applicable to cellular and ad-hoc wireless networks and
   could work with an arbitrary number of antennas provided that the number
   of antennas at the corresponding relays and the receivers is the same.
   We analyze the diversity gain and the multiplexing gain through
   simulations to verify the good performance of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents our initial investigations of noise enhancement
   control when decoding uplink transmissions in multi-cell multiuser
   multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems with zero-forcing (ZF)
   post-processing. This problem has been partially addressed within
   simplified cellular system topologies and with single antenna terminals.
   However, applying existing solutions directly to a multi cell system is
   not viable due to the noise enhancement that would heavily affect the
   inter-cell interference (ICI). Therefore, this paper proposes a
   cross-layer resource allocation to improve the performance by utilizing
   a low complexity scheduling (user and antenna selection) and a power
   allocation method. The proposed scheduling algorithm extends our
   previous work to a multi cell system where the base and the mobile
   stations are equipped with multiple antennas. When allocating the power
   levels to different users in order to manage the multiple access
   interference (MAI) in MU-MIMO environment, we utilize Newton's method
   for resource optimization due to its efficiency in finding the
   combination of spatial streams and power levels to improve the average
   bit error rates (BERs) and their statistics for different users. This
   improvement in BERs is documented in terms of median and average BER
   performance in the system under study with and without centralized ICI
   cancelation.}},

Abstract = {{Object grasping using vision is one of the important functions of
   manipulators. Machine learning based methods have been proposed for
   grasp detection. However, due to the variety of grasps and 3D shapes of
   objects, how to effectively find the best grasp is still a challenging
   issue. Thus this paper presents an extreme learning machine (ELM) based
   method to cope with this issue. This proposed method consists of three
   successive modules, including candidate object detection, estimation of
   object's major orientations and grasp detection. In the first module,
   candidate object region is extracted based on depth information. In the
   second module, object's major orientations guide the directions for
   sliding windows. In the third module, a cascaded classifier is trained
   to identify the right grasp. ELM is used as the base classifier in the
   cascade. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) are used as features.
   Experimental results in benchmark dataset and real manipulators have
   shown that this proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of
   accuracy and computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A novel magnetically-coupled resonant wireless power transfer (MCR-WPT)
   system using an array of printed spiral coil (PSC) resonators is
   presented to expand the receiving area. The resonator array is excited
   with a single planar driving loop to yield uniform magnetic field
   distribution at the receiver plane. First, the performance of a
   conventional transmitter coil array consisting of one transmitting
   resonator and multiple repeaters without frequency tracking is
   investigated. Then the performance of the proposed PSC resonator array
   with novel feed strategy is demonstrated. The results show the proposed
   MCR-WPT array system is able to provide consistent transfer efficiency
   when the receiver is axially misaligned with the transmitter. The
   measurement results are compared with the conventional planar MCR-WPT
   array and reveal that that with the proposed design, the transfer
   efficiency of the planar MCR-WPT system can be increased from 2.1\% to
   65.8\% in the misalignment region.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the optimization of a discrete-time controller
   designed on the basis of discrete root locus for the boost converter
   operating at 1000 kHz. The optimization is accomplished through a
   nonlinear least squares method. The digital control theory is not as
   rich as the analog control theory. Locating poles and zeros directly in
   the z-plane by a designer to render the required performance is a
   difficult task to accomplish. Direct placement of poles and zeros may
   also introduce distortion as well. Consequently, direct digital design
   approach based digital controller may not offer satisfactory
   performance. The poles and zeros are disturbed around their nominal
   positions through the optimization technique to snub the atrocities
   introduced by the unwanted digital phenomena. Effect of nonlinearities
   in the form of ADC/DAC quantization error, delay, etc. on performance is
   also accentuated. The effectiveness of the application of the
   optimization technique to the buck converter is investigated using the
   MATLAB/Simulink environment.}},

   elastic structures and non- stationary loads has long been recognized as
   an attractive tool of engineering analysis, especially at the pre-
   design stage where it has been particularly valued for its high
   computational efficiency. At the same time, the approach has a number of
   limitations, the most regrettable one being its inability to handle
   geometries that are more complex than the basic ones such as a spherical
   or cylindrical geometry. We present an attempt to overcome this
   limitation while still preserving the much favored computational
   efficiency by introducing a hybrid methodology that combines the

Abstract = {{Military sonars must detect, localize, classify, and track submarine
   threats from distances safely outside their circle of attack. However,
   conventional Pulsed Active Sonars (PAS) have duty cycles on the order of
   one percent which means that 99\% of the time, the track is out of date.
   In contrast, High Duty Cycle (HDC) sonars have duty cycles approaching
   100\% which enable near-continuous updates to the track. If one can
   overcome technical challenges such as the high dynamic range required by
   the receiver, then HDC should significantly improve tracking performance
   in the (approximately) free-field environment that one encounters in the
   deep ocean. Improvements in tracking performance in shallow water,
   however, are not assured since both targets and clutter will be tracked
   continuously and HDC may increase false tracks to an unacceptably high
   level - essentially continuously tracking the clutter. Furthermore, one
   would typically want to maintain the same bandwidth for an HDC system as
   for the PAS system it might replace. This will provide a significant
   increase in the time-bandwidth product, but may not produce the increase
   in gain anticipated if there are coherence limitations of the acoustic
   channel that result from environmental variability. To compare
   performance of HDC with conventional PAS in the littorals, a set of
   experiments was conducted as part of the Target and Reverberation
   Experiment (TREX) in spring 2013. This was one of the first
   scientifically controlled experiments conducted in the littorals to
   compare environmental effects on these two active sonar techniques. In
   most active sonar experiments, the source, receiver, and target are
   moving so that one cannot cleanly isolate the impact of platform motion
   from that of environmental variability. In the experiment discussed in
   this paper, however, R/V SHARP was fixed in a four-point mooring, and a
   free-flooding ring transmitter and a horizontal line array receiver were
   deployed from the deck and mounted a few meters above the seabed. The
   target, an air-filled hose, was deployed approximately 3 km away and
   anchored to the seabed with minimal surface expression, thereby
   drastically reducing its motion. This fixed-fixed geometry provided an
   opportunity to examine the effect of the acoustic channel on signal
   coherence. An initial examination of the echo levels from an air-filled
   passive target shows that there is very little difference in the
   coherence loss of HDC and PAS pulses. However, the standard deviation of
   the HDC echo levels is about 0.1 dB lower than PAS under similar
   environmental conditions; this may be because the longer HDC pulses
   provide some averaging of the effect of surface roughness on the
   coherent gain.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous active sonar ( CAS) is a special case of active sonar where
   the ping duration approaches the ping repetition interval. Sub-band
   processing is a method of breaking up the long-duration CAS transmission
   to achieve faster processing update rates than pulsed active sonar (
   PAS). This paper compares experimental signal-to-reverberation ratio (
   SRR) measured for CAS and PAS echoes. The processing bandwidth was
   varied, and the processing integration time was proportional to the
   bandwidth because linear frequency modulated ( LFM) pulses were
   employed. The data were collected during back-to-back CAS and PAS runs
   during the TREX13 sea trial, which was conducted in shallow, 20-m water
   near the shore of Florida, USA. Sub-band processing was applied to the
   CAS data as well as to the PAS data to allow comparison, although for
   PAS the increased updates are not at equal intervals over the ping cycle
   as in CAS. Increasing the number of sub-bands increases the update rate,
   but the corresponding decrease in bandwidth is expected to reduce SRR.
   Examining the trade off between update rate and SRR is an important
   first step in understanding how CAS performs in the littoral
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the selection of users and corresponding uplink
   decoding in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
   multi-cell systems, applicable to future wireless networks with
   centralized processing at the wireless controller (WC). Two-layer
   decoding is proposed. First, for all active mobile stations (MSs) the
   spatial streams are decoupled at the pre-assigned base stations (BSs) by
   using a zero-forcing (ZF) type algorithm. Second, for MSs with strong
   signals, hard-decision decoding is performed at the BSs; while for other
   MSs, especially those at the edge of the cells, soft decisions from
   multiple BSs are passed to the WC, where maximum ratio combining (MRC)
   is performed. When deploying MRC, two strategies are considered to deal
   with the inter-cell interference (ICI). Assuming access at the WC to
   hard-decoded user data, or the lack of it, MRC with successive
   interference cancellation (SIC) and conventional MRC are investigated,
   respectively. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
   potential of the technique developed in terms of total system sum rate
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers an interference-aware user selection and resource
   allocation for uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
   systems. At the base station (BS), zero-forcing (ZF) with singular value
   decomposition (SVD) decoupling of spatial streams is deployed. First,
   two algorithms are developed for mobile stations (MS)s and their
   corresponding antennas assignment as well as power allocation. The
   objective is to maximize the total system sum rate by considering the
   impact of multiple access noise enhancement on the spatial stream
   capacity. Then, an additional scheme is proposed to maximize the
   weighted sum capacity of all admitted users, where the weights are
   chosen based on the state of users' buffers. The proposed resource
   allocation and scheduling algorithms operate in a reduced search space
   for the sub-optimum configurations targeting lower overall complexity
   but still offering close to optimum results in a statistical sense.

   much the state estimator is biased, using the classical hypothesis test
   approach a threshold is assigned. The analysis is simulated on IEEE

   of bias test concept, the bias of voltage magnitude and phase angle
   errors versus the parameters uncertainty are shown for a PMU placement.
   Then, for different PMU placements, the values of parameters uncertainty

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a blind algorithm for channel identification
   and signal separation in MIMO OFDM systems with Nyquist sampling at the
   baseband. To estimate in time the channel and the input signals using
   compressed sensing, we exploit the sparsity structure of the matrix type
   channel impulse responses and the Gaussian characteristics of the
   transmitted OFDM signals. The matching pursuit sparse algorithm is
   applied in the channel recovery. First, we develop the method for blind
   deconvolution in SISO systems where after estimating the channel, a
   zero-forcing (Z-F) equalizer in the frequency domain recovers the
   transmitted QAM symbols. Then, we apply the method in the MIMO setting.
   This is accomplished by decomposing the matrix type convolution
   representing the mixing process in the MIMO time dispersive channel into
   systems of equations similar to the SISO case. Specifically, in the MIMO
   system, the SISO type sparse channel estimation is performed
   independently and in parallel for every receive antenna. The QAM symbol
   recovery on spatial streams is performed at every subcarrier using a
   matrix equivalent to the Z-F equalizer. The good estimation convergence
   of the method and its resilience in different SNR scenarios is verified
   through extensive simulations.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{427-440}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical study aimed at understanding the impact
   of the mushy-zone constant, A(mush), on simulated phase change heat
   transfer. This parameter is found in the Carman-Kozeny equation which is
   used in the enthalpy-porosity formulation for modeling natural
   convection driven phase change. The melting of dodecanoic acid inside a
   rectangular thermal storage unit was simulated in COMSOL 4.4 and FLUENT
   15.0; with A(mush) and the melting temperature range, Delta T, being
   varied per study. The simulated melt front positions were directly
   compared to experimental results. Results showed that A(mush) is an
   important parameter for accurately modeling phase change heat transfer;
   in particular, high A(mush) values corresponded to slower melting rates
   and the smallest A(mush) values resulted in unphysical predictions of
   the melt front development. Additionally, it was concluded that A(mush)
   and Delta T are not independent of one another in their roles of
   accurately modeling the melting rate; different values of Delta T would
   require different values of A(mush) to achieve the same melt front
   development. However, certain combinations of A(mush) and Delta T do
   lead to an overall melt fraction progression for the overall process and
   are in line with the experimental results, although the numerically
   predicted movement of the melting interface in such cases is not always
   correlated to the experiment. Further efforts are required to identify
   ideal values for these parameters, as well as to determine the extent to
   which these parameters hold for different materials and physical setups.
   It is anticipated that this paper will lead to further discussion on the

Abstract = {{The effect of different thawing methods on three haskap berry (Lonicera
   caerulea L.) varieties, Tundra (T), Berry Blue (BB) and Indigo Gem (IG),
   was investigated. Methods included thawing the frozen berries at room
   temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C), refrigerated temperature (4 degrees C)
   and using a microwave oven. All the berry varieties were analyzed for
   their total phenolic content (TPC)/total reducing capacity (TRC), total
   anthocyanin content (TAC) and antioxidant potential (DPPH center dot
   radical scavenging activity). The TPC/TRC, TAC and DPPH center dot
   scavenging activity ranges in the fresh fruits were 6.17-8.42 mg GAE/g
   FW, 4.49-6.97 mg C-3-G E/g FW, and 78.70-89.55 \%, respectively. Frozen
   storage for six months followed by consequent thawing at the standard
   conditions (room temperature) caused 35.85-44.73, 32.14-53.23, and
   26.28-29.57 \% reductions in the TPC/TRC, TAC, and DPPH center dot
   scavenging activity, respectively. The highest reduction occurred in the
   Berry Blue variety followed by that of Indigo Gem. Refrigerated thawing
   did not significantly improve the retention of phenolic compounds and
   anthocyanins. Microwave thawing could be achieved in significantly
   shorter time (17.31 min) as compared to room temperature (12.00 h) and
   refrigerated thawing (22.00 h) and could significantly improve the
   retention of phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant potential. The
   corresponding reductions in the TPC/TRC, TAC, and DPPH center dot
   scavenging activity of different varieties ranged from 24.97\%-39.87\%,
   18.92\%-47.22\%, and 21.39\%-27.29 \%, re-spectively. Thus, further
   investigation into the industrial application of microwave thawing is
   recommended to maximize the retention of bioactive compounds in products
   manufactured from frozen haskap berries.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that redundancy generally improves system reliability.
   For example, a geotechnical support system comprised of a single
   monopile will have the same failure probability as the monopile itself.
   Alternatively, if the geotechnical support system is comprised of two
   piles, each of which can support the load with probability 1-p(f), then
   the system failure probability will lie somewhere between p(f) and
   p(f)(2). In this case, if the failure probability of an individual pile
   is p(f)=1/100, then the system failure probability will lie between
   1/100 and 1/10,000, depending on the degree of statistical dependence
   between the piles. Clearly, redundancy in the geotechnical system has
   the potential to significantly reduce the system failure probability.
   From a design point of view, since redundancy generally increases system
   reliability, the individual system elements (e.g., piles) need not
   necessarily be designed to the same level of reliability. In other
   words, if the supported load is distributed amongst a number of footings
   or piles, redundancy should be taken into account to achieve
   construction savings while maintaining overall safety. This paper looks
   specifically at the effects of redundancy in pile support systems on the
   overall system reliability. It is assumed that the support only fails
   when all piles have failed and piles fail randomly according to the
   local ground strength (pile structural capacity is not considered). Two
   load transfer models between failed (excessively displaced) and
   surviving piles are considered. Pile system reliability is then
   estimated as a function of the distribution of pile resistance, the load
   transfer model, the number of piles, and the target design reliability
   of individual piles. Charts are produced to allow the selection of
   individual target design reliability for a given number of piles and the
   target system reliability.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study is to characterize the
   mechanical behavior and impact response of a recently developed 3D
   woven/braided fiberglass fabric. The 3D-fiberglass fabric (3DFGF)
   consists of two bi-directional woven fabrics, knitted together by
   vertical braided glass fiber pillars. In addition to, or instead of
   glass fibers, carbon and even basalt fibers, as well as hybridizations
   of these fibers, could be used to form such 3D clothes. The unique
   configuration of fibers in this particular 3DFGF provides outstanding
   impact resistance to panels formed by this fabric. Moreover, the two
   bi-directional woven fabrics of 3DFGF create hollow core regions,
   surrounded by vertical glass pillars, which could be filled with a foam,
   thus further enhancing the resilience of the panel.
   The weakest link in any fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) laminates is the
   interlaminar shear properties of the FRP, thus making them susceptible
   to impact loading. However, owing to the unique and resilient
   configuration of fibers in this new generation of 3DFGF, delamination
   type failure is seldom experienced by 3DFGFs. Moreover, to the best of
   authors' knowledge, there has been no investigation characterizing the
   impact response of such 3DFGFs.
   Three-point bending and flatwise compressive tests with two different
   core thicknesses are conducted in two principal directions of 3DFGF to
   investigate its mechanical behavior. For each specimen and thickness,
   two different configurations are considered: (i) panels with their
   hollow core cavities filled with a foam, and (ii) panels without foam.
   Moreover, the low-velocity impact (LVI) response and failure modes of
   this new fabric are also investigated experimentally and also by
   computational simulations. The latter is done to address the clear lack
   of a robust computational framework by which one could predict the
   response of such 3DFGFs. Therefore, a major part of this study deals
   with predicting the behavior of such a complex 3D materials
   configuration by the finite-element method, using a commercial code (the
   ABAQUS). It will be demonstrated that the good agreement obtained
   between the experimental and simulation results would render the adopted
   framework as an effective and reliable means for predicting and
   optimizing the response of such 3DFGFs subject to complex loading
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrians are particularly vulnerable road users within the urban
   environment. Many studies have examined the factors that contribute to
   the frequency and severity of collisions, but limited research has
   examined the influence of the built environment on pedestrian injury
   severity. This study used the Halifax regional municipality in Nova
   Scotia, Canada, as a case study to examine the effect of the built
   environment on the injury severity of pedestrians. Two ordered response
   models were used: a conventionally ordered probit model and a
   hierarchical ordered probit (HOPIT) model, which accommodated unobserved
   heterogeneity because the thresholds could vary across observations. In
   the HOPIT model fit in this study, the threshold covariates varied with
   whether the collision occurred at an intersection and with the number of
   walking commuters in the neighborhood. Built environment contributing
   factors, including a variety of street pattern classifications, land use
   types, transit supply, and demographic characteristics, were examined
   with other variables (e.g., pedestrian and driver characteristics,
   collision characteristics, environmental conditions). Nova Scotia
   Collision Record Database data were used for the years 2007 to 2011 to
   develop the ordered response models of the injury severity of
   pedestrians. The study found personal and collision characteristics to
   be significant to explain the injury severity outcomes of pedestrians.
   In addition, environmental characteristics (e.g., land use type,
   presence of activity centers, demographic attributes) were found to
   influence injury severity outcomes. The study results may help inform
   policy development to improve pedestrian safety in Nova Scotia.}},

Abstract = {{This paper models a LEED Silver institutional building and applies a
   model predictive control (MPC) strategy. The building is modelled using
   EnergyPlus, which is then compared to measured consumption data for
   model calibration. The calibrated model is then exercised with various
   control strategies to generate data used to create and train a
   statistical black box model. The black box model is then used as the
   base model for the model predictive controller, while EnergyPlus is used
   as a virtual building to determine savings. The resulting MPC strategy
   results are compared to the existing rule-based control applied to the
   building to highlight the energy savings. Initial results indicate a
   10\% HVAC energy reduction based 2013 climatic data for the site. While
   the energy reduction is small, it is achieved on a new LEED certified
   building and requires only software changes to the equipment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Commercial and Institutional (C\&I) buildings are responsible for
   approximately 20\% of total energy consumption in North America, of
   which heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for
   around 50\% in Canada and 30\% in USA. As such, C\&I buildings represent
   a substantial energy use reduction opportunity using new technologies.
   However, given that a building is principally to insure comfortable
   indoor conditions, it is critical that these requirements are not
   compromised. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a growing field of
   research for operating buildings that takes advantage of changing
   internal and external conditions of a building to save energy, operating
   cost, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while maintaining and
   potentially enhancing occupant comfort. The aims of this paper are
   twofold: a) to identify building characteristics that are beneficial to
   the performance of MPC strategies and provide explanation for their
   selection; and b) to provide detailed review of prototypical C\&I
   building categories to identify those that are the most suitable for the
   application of MPC. C\& I buildings that exhibit thermal mass, high
   solar gains, discrete occupancy periods, and the opportunity to vary
   temperature setpoints represent best candidates for MPC application.
   Offices and education buildings are best candidates based on their use
   profile, construction, and ubiquity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Investigating the Role of Built Environment and Lifestyle Choices in
   Active Travel for Weekly Home-Based Nonwork Trips}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{125-132}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of the built enviromnent and
   individual lifestyle choices on weekly frequency of active
   transportation (AT) for home-based nonwork trips in the Halifax Regional
   Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. The growing trend of auto-oriented
   lifestyle choices and dependency not only intensifies environmental
   emissions and energy use but leads to decreased AT use for daily
   activities. Studies show that the built environment plays a significant
   role in active mode choice for nonwork trips, which are more flexible in
   time and location. However, research investigating the effect of
   lifestyle and attitudes combined with built-environment attributes for
   AT use has been limited, particularly for weeklong nonwork trips.
   Accordingly, this study investigated weekly active travel for nonwork
   trips on the basis of data from the Halifax Household Mobility and
   Travel Survey. Factor analysis captured the effects of lifestyle choices
   and attitudes, which were categorized by individuals' attitudes toward
   (a) travel modes and (b) land use and the environment. From loading the
   factors of the lifestyle choice variables, nine attitudinal variables
   were obtained. The study employed an ordered probit modeling framework
   to examine relative contributions of relevant socioeconomic
   characteristics, built-environment attributes, and attitudinal factors.
   Model results revealed that attitudes and factors of lifestyle choice
   played important roles in weekly AT frequency for nonwork trips. For
   example, individuals with prowalk probike and protransit attitudes were
   likely to use AT more frequently for non-work-related trips than their
   counterparts. Although the impact of individuals' attitudes on AT trips
   was evident, this model also demonstrated that the built environment
   significantly influences the frequency of AT trips.}},

Abstract = {{A novel magnetically-coupled resonant wireless power transfer (MCR-WPT)
   system using an array of printed spiral resonators is presented. By
   replacing the single transmitting resonator in a conventional MCR-WPT
   with an array of smaller resonators, the transfer efficiency of the
   planar WPT system in both the over-coupled and under-coupled regions are
   significantly enhanced. Furthermore, with a proper design of the driving
   loop, the proposed WPT is able to provide consistent transfer efficiency
   even when the receiver is axially misaligned with the transmitter. Two
   WPT systems of the size of 10x21 mm(2) and 21x21 mm(2) for the
   transmitter, and 10x10 mm(2) for the receiver are proposed. The results
   are compared with the conventional planar WPT of the same size. The
   measurement results show that with the proposed design, the transfer
   efficiency of the planar WPT system can be increased from 5\% to 66\% in
   the over-coupled region and from 0.75\% to 40.67\% in misalignment

   than 0.5 degrees C. FEA predicts a chevron displacement of 0.98 tim in
   air and 49 nm in water at 6 V. Experimental measurements of
   displacements were performed using an FFT image analysis algorithm with
   sub-micron precision. Experimental results show a displacement of 1.11
   +/- 0.01 pi.m in air and 67 +/- 17 nm in water for 6V. The agreement
   between simulated and measured results validates the accuracy of the
   computational model used in this study. From the experimental data, the
   performance of the thermal actuator in water is about 6\% of its
   performance in air. The study indicates the feasibility of using thermal
   actuators to perform cell tests in aqueous media.}},

Abstract = {{In wind turbines the power generation (power capture) and output torque
   depends on wind speed. Due to the rapid variations in wind speed, wind
   and inflow angle evaluating the output power becomes a challenging
   problem. Many optimization control techniques seek to extract the output
   power continuously. This paper focusses on dynamic analysis and control
   of variable wind turbine's rotor yaw angle and angular deflection.
   Earlier work used wind direction and pitch angle to control the
   performance of wind turbine. Using rotor yaw and angular deflection
   control of horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines is relatively new.
   For dynamic analysis, rotor yaw and rotor angular deflection, model
   techniques and experimental setup mechanisms were done in detail.
   Simulations were carried out in C++ to program an Arduino
   microcontroller and motor driver. Matlab software was used to interface
   wind turbine experimental setup, Arduino microcontroller and show the
   functions and aerodynamic forces. The result shows that the performance
   of wind turbine with this technique gives better result by increasing
   the power capture by about 15\% more.}},

Abstract = {{An effective and accurate navigation for rescue robots in some human
   inaccessible sites is very necessary. This paper proposes a method of
   vision-based navigation with high accuracy and real-time capability.
   Firstly, the system overview and the experimental platform are
   presented. Then an image processing algorithm using classic theories,
   which resulted in less calculated amount, is introduced to detect the
   guidance line. Lastly, the control model based on the results of image
   processing and motion information of the robot which makes the control
   more precise is developed. The results of the experiments show the

   the performance of switched reluctance starter/generator system, the
   master switch angle is needed to optimize. In this paper, according to
   the serious nonlinear characteristic of switched reluctance motor, the
   nonlinear simulation model is built by wavelet neural network method.
   The system starting opening turn-on and turn-off angle has been
   optimized with the purpose of maximizing the torque and the system power
   opening turn-on and turn-off angle has been optimized with the purpose
   of both biggest power output and optimal efficiency. The optimum switch

   multiple transmit antennas. The ZF based post-processing at the AP using

   information (CSI) only. Moreover, an antenna selection algorithm is
   proposed to gain performance advantage from the channel diversity in

Abstract = {{In real time video transmission over Internet Protocol (IP), to make the
   video stream more resilient against packet loss in the network, packet
   erasure coding (EC) is applied as one form of packet loss concealment.
   The separation of source and channel coding even though sub optimum,
   offers the convenience of simplified implementations. In the framework
   of separate video and channel coding, significant benefits can be
   derived from understanding how to jointly adjust the video and packet
   erasure coding parameters to improve the quality of the reconstructed
   media after packet erasure recovery. To this end, in this paper, a
   testbed is presented for the evaluation of a real time encoding of
   interactive video applications with packet erasure coding at the IP
   layer. Specifically, practical video CODECs like H.264/AVC with
   different packetization strategies are deployed to test the improvements
   obtained in the recovered video stream for different coding rates in
   packet erasure codes. Quality of video is analyzed using PSNR of
   reconstructed video frames under different raw packet loss rates (PLRs)
   and for different packet sizes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the optical measurement of nm-scale MEMS in-plane
   motion using microphotographs, and the effect of degraded images on
   these results. Two common forms of image degradation are: blurring
   caused by the dynamic (AC) motion of the actuator and focus effects due
   to changes in focal plane or media changes. This paper address whether
   consistent nm-scale results can still be obtained when the image is thus
   changed. The motion of MEMS thermal actuators was measured by taking a
   series of undegraded microphotographs at varying DC voltages that
   produce displacements of similar to 2.5 microns. A FFT based algorithm
   was used to analyze the phase of periodic structures in the image and
   measure displacements with precision on the order of 20-100 nm. Pristine
   undegraded measurements were compared with both artificially blurred
   images as well as manually defocused images. It was found that the FFT
   method was robust to large amounts of blurring and defocusing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the photonic nanojets generated by micro-cylinders

   when plane wave propagates through various micro-cylinders embedded in

   of the generated photonic nanojets increases, as well as the distance
   between the micro-cylinders and the photonic nanojets. While the maximum
   intensity of the photonic nanojets decreases. In addition, photonic
   nanojet disappears when using rough surface micro-cylinders due to the
   strong random scattering and interference effect. In practice, these
   results provide guidance when using photonic nanojets for probing and
   manipulating nanoscale objects, nanopatterning and nanolithography with

   11T cell without using LEAP technique (regular 11T) is 76\% larger than
   that of traditional 6T cell and 16\% larger than that of the Quatro
   cell. The area of 11T cell with LEAP technique (LEAP-11T) is 15\% larger
   than that of regular 11T cell and 103\% larger than that of 6T cell.
   Simulation results show that the error cross section of regular 11T is
   17X lower and 2.8X lower than that of traditional 6T at LET = 10 and 30
   MeV-cm(2)/mg respectively in normal strikes; and it is 2.2X lower than

Abstract = {{A robust appearance model is usually required in visual tracking, which
   can handle pose variation, illumination variation, occlusion and many
   other interferences occurring in video. So far, a number of tracking
   algorithms make use of image samples in previous frames to update
   appearance models. There are many limitations of that approach: 1) At
   the beginning of tracking, there exists no sufficient amount of data for
   online update because these adaptive models are data-dependent and 2) in
   many challenging situations, robustly updating the appearance models is
   difficult, which often results in drift problems. In this paper, we
   proposed a tracking algorithm based on compressive sensing theory and
   particle filter framework. Features are extracted by random projection
   with data-independent basis. Particle filter is employed to make a more
   accurate estimation of the target location and make much of the updated
   classifier. The robustness and the effectiveness of our tracker have
   been demonstrated in several experiments.}},

   synchronization scheme for networked Hindmarsh-Rose neuron models.
   Regarding synchronization as a state estimation problem, an observer
   design approach is used for estimating full state dynamics. Stability of
   the trajectories to be synchronized is determined by utilization of the
   contraction theory that provides an efficient tool for analyzing
   convergence of manifolds with respect to each other. Thereupon, a region
   where contraction of trajectories takes place is determined; therefore
   the corresponding error dynamics of the model remain in that contracting
   region. Consequent results are also supported by a numerical simulation
   example in the end demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the spatial transferability analysis of a
   micro-behavioral model from the residential mobility component of the
   integrated land use, transportation, and environment (ELUTE) modeling
   system developed and implemented in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton
   Area, Ontario, Canada. The study examined whether ILUTE could be
   spatially transferred with the current model components to a different
   geographic area: Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The residential mobility
   component within ILUTE is a continuous-time, hazard-based duration
   model, developed with retrospective survey data from the Residential
   Mobility Survey 2 in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. This study
   developed a similar continuous-time, hazard-based duration model for the
   residential mobility decisions of households in Halifax on the basis of
   retrospective survey data from a household mobility and travel survey.
   The model results suggested that households in Halifax and the Greater
   Toronto and Hamilton Area exhibited profound differences in residential
   mobility decisions. Sociodemographic, dwelling, and neighborhood
   characteristics significantly affected residential mobility decisions in
   the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The effects of land use and
   accessibility measures were noteworthy for Halifax. For instance,
   home-to-work distances in Halifax affected the decision to move;
   however, such an effect could not be confirmed in the Greater Toronto
   and Hamilton Area. Households' first periods of residence after
   household formation in a residential location were shorter in Halifax
   than in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. It was concluded that the
   direct transfer of micromodels from one spatial context to another could
   be difficult.}},

   effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats}},
Journal = {{FOOD \& NUTRITION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cod muscle has a balanced protein profile that contains
   potentially bioactive amino acid sequences. However, there is limited
   information on release of these peptides from the parent proteins and
   their ability to modulate mammalian blood pressure.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to generate cod antihypertensive
   peptides with potent in vitro inhibitory effects against
   angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin. The most active peptides
   were then tested for systolic blood pressure (SBP)-reducing ability in
   spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).
   Design: Cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) was produced by subjecting the
   muscle proteins to proteolysis first by pepsin and followed by trypsin +
   chymotrypsin combination. In order to enhance peptide activity, the CPH
   was subjected to reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC separation to yield four
   fractions (CF1, CF2, CF3, and CF4). The CPH and RP-HPLC fractions were
   each tested at 1 mg/mL for ability to inhibit in vitro ACE and renin
   activities. CPH and the most active RP-HPLC fraction (CF3) were then
   used for enzyme inhibition kinetics assays followed by oral
   administration (200 and 30 mg/kg body weight for CPH and CF3,
   respectively) to SHRs and SBP measurements within 24 h.
   Results: The CPH, CF3, and CF4 had similar ACE-inhibitory activities of
   84, 85, and 87\%, which were significantly (p<0.05) higher than the
   values for CF1 (69\%) and CF2 (79\%). Conversely, the CF3 had the
   highest (63\%) renin-inhibitory activity (p<0.05) when compared to CPH
   (43\%), CF1 (15\%), and CF4 (44\%). CPH and CF3 exhibited uncompetitive
   mode of ACE inhibition, whereas renin inhibition was non-competitive.
   Even at a 6.7-fold lower dosage, the CF3 significantly (p<0.05) reduced
   SBP (maximum -40.0 mmHg) better than CPH (maximum -19.1 mmHg).
   Conclusions: RP-HPLC fractionation led to enhanced antihypertensive
   effects of cod peptides, which may be due to a stronger renin-inhibitory
   activity.}},

Title = {{Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Reshuffling Cluster
   Compressed Sensing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The existing compressed sensing (CS) based data gathering (CSDG) methods
   in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) usually assume that the sensed data
   are sparse or compressible. However, the sparsity of raw sensed data in
   some case is not straightforward. In this paper, we present reshuffling
   cluster compressed sensing based data gathering (RCCSDG) method to
   achieve both energy efficiency and reconstruction accuracy in WSNs. By
   incorporating CS into the cluster protocol, RCCSDG is able to reduce the
   energy consumption and support larger networks. Moreover, the sparsity
   of raw sensed data can be greatly improved by reshuffling pretreatment.
   A theoretical analysis to energy consumption of cluster head is
   performed, and the cost of the pretreatment is small enough to be
   neglected. Based on these natures, the raw sensed data can be recovered
   from fewer samples. Also, considering the sensed data to be of excellent
   temporal stability in a short time, we reshuffle them just one time in
   this stable period to further reduce the energy consumption of WSNs. In
   addition, the delay of RCCSDG is analyzed based on TDMA 2 scheduling
   scheme. We carry out simulations on real sensor datasets. The results
   show that the RCCSDG can effectively compress the data transmission and
   decrease energy consumption of WSNs while ensuring the reconstruction

Title = {{Encapsulation of food protein hydrolysates and peptides: a review}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Pages = {{79270-79278}},
Abstract = {{Food protein hydrolysates and peptides are considered a category of
   promising functional food ingredients. However, commercial application
   of protein hydrolysates and their constituent peptides can be impeded by
   their low bioavailability, bitter taste, hygroscopicity and likelihood
   of interacting with the food matrix. Encapsulation as a delivery
   mechanism can be used to overcome these challenges for improving the
   bioavailability and organoleptic properties of the peptides. Proteins,
   polysaccharides and lipids are the three carrier systems that have been
   utilized in food peptide encapsulation. The protein and polysaccharide
   systems mainly aim at masking the bitter taste and reducing the
   hygroscopicity of protein hydrolysates, whereas the lipid-based systems
   are intended for use in enhancing the bioavailability and biostability
   of encapsulated peptides. A spray drying technique is largely used to
   achieve microencapsulation in both protein and polysaccharide systems
   while, generally, liposomes are prepared by a film hydration technique.
   However, it is seen that the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of peptides
   using the liposome model is relatively lower since the entropy-driven
   liposome formation is uncontrolled and spontaneous. Achieving adequate
   EE through cost effective techniques is indispensable for encapsulation
   to be applicable to bioactive peptide-based product commercialization.
   Furthermore, the design of high quality functional foods requires
   detailed understanding of the release mechanism and kinetics,
   gastrointestinal stability, bioavailability and physiological
   bioactivity of the encapsulated peptide products.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing created many new opportunities for organisations across
   the world. Presently, Cloud services are available at affordable prices
   and accessible for all scales of businesses. The economic benefits of
   this wider acceptance to adopting Cloud computing are enormous and many
   companies have embraced Cloud computing now. Over the years, technology
   emergence has helped to enhance the growth of Cloud computing, but the
   growth had not been as per expectations in the beginning era of the
   Cloud computing. This paper analyzes various factors that have affected
   the adoption rate of Cloud computing to be slower than expectations.
   This paper also identifies that the major factor behind the slower
   growth of Cloud computing is the controversial view about Cloud
   computing in the eyes of IT workforce. Based on the result of a survey
   of IT workforce at various organizational levels, this paper establishes
   that the identified factors such as Cloud computing awareness and the
   fear of job loss in IT workforce played a role in slow adoption of Cloud
   computing. Further, this paper presents recommendations to handle
   technology adoption and forecasting in a better way in future. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper applies network tomography for load balancing. Load balancing
   is the allocation of the work of a single application to processors at
   run-time so that the execution time of the application is minimized. In
   order to achieve this purpose, load balancing algorithms require various
   network parameters to make decisions for effectively balancing the load.
   This paper analyses the scope of the application of network tomography
   to facilitate load balancing algorithms in estimating network parameters
   (packet loss and delay) to be used in decision making. This paper also
   exploits the interdependence of packet loss and delay in the context of
   load balancing. Evaluation results show that network tomography
   estimates link delays accurately from the knowledge of path delays and
   packet loss. This information is instrumental to be used to tune the
   delay dependence module of various load balancing algorithms. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The objective of this research project was to evaluate the potential use
   of chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs) as a drug delivery system for the
   molecule adenosine. Adenosine is an essential drug used for treating
   several health issues especially irregular heart rhythm. However, due to
   its extremely short half-life in vivo (< 10 s), the effective delivery
   of adenosine in clinical applications is a significant challenge. In
   this research, adenosine was encapsulated into NPs formed by ionic
   gelation of CS. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of
   20\% and 3\% were obtained, respectively, by forming a complex between
   CS NPs and adenosine. The obtained CS NPs had a spherical shape in the
   size range of 260.6 +/- 20.1 nm. Spectrophotometry analysis of the
   adenosine released in vitro showed an initial burst release phase, a
   plateau phase, followed by a steady release over a week.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling marine ecosystems requires insight and judgement when it comes
   to deciding upon appropriate model structure, equations and
   parameterisation. Many processes are relatively poorly understood and
   tough decisions must be made as to how to mathematically simplify the
   real world. Here, we present an efficient plankton modelling testbed,
   EMPOWER-1.0 (Efficient Model of Planktonic ecOsystems WrittEn in R),
   coded in the freely available language R. The testbed uses simple
   two-layer ``slab{''} physics whereby a seasonally varying mixed layer
   which contains the planktonic marine ecosystem is positioned above a
   deep layer that contains only nutrient. As such, EMPOWER-1.0 provides a
   readily available and easy to use tool for evaluating model structure,
   formulations and parameterisation. The code is transparent and modular
   such that modifications and changes to model formulation are easily
   implemented allowing users to investigate and familiarise themselves
   with the inner workings of their models. It can be used either for
   preliminary model testing to set the stage for further work, e.g.
   coupling the ecosystem model to 1-D or 3D physics, or for undertaking
   front line research in its own right. EMPOWER-1.0 also serves as an
   ideal teaching tool. In order to demonstrate the utility of EMPOWER-1.0,
   we implemented a simple nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplanktondetritus
   (NPZD) ecosystem model and carried out both a parameter tuning exercise
   and structural sensitivity analysis. Parameter tuning was demonstrated
   for four contrasting ocean sites, focusing on station BIOTRANS in the
   North Atlantic (47 degrees N, 20 degrees W), highlighting both the
   utility of undertaking a planned sensitivity analysis for this purpose,
   yet also the subjectivity which nevertheless surrounds the choice of
   which parameters to tune. Structural sensitivity tests were then
   performed comparing different equations for calculating daily
   depth-integrated photosynthesis, as well as mortality terms for both
   phytoplankton and zooplankton. Regarding the calculation of daily
   photosynthesis, for example, results indicated that the model was
   relatively insensitive to the choice of photosynthesis-irradiance curve,
   but markedly sensitive to the method of calculating light attenuation in
   the water column. The work highlights the utility of EMPOWER-1.0 as a
   means of comprehending, diagnosing and formulating equations for the
   dynamics of marine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a biologically-inspired
   hyper-redundant wheeled snake robot and a corresponding computer
   simulator to study the effects that joint failures have on the resulting
   lateral undulation motion. Experiments and corresponding simulations
   were carried out to study the robotic snake's lateral undulation gait as
   power to individual joints was turned off. The results showed that joint
   failures were most detrimental to the snake's lateral undulation gait
   when they occurred in the front half of the snake, while joint failures
   occurring between the midpoint and tail of the robotic snake were found
   to be less critical and generally resulted in slight lateral drifts as
   the forward motion progressed. To help compensate for joint failures in
   the tail-half part of the robot, a bias term was added to the control
   algorithm. For the conditions tested in this research, the use of a bias
   term appeared to be effective at reducing the lateral drift.}},

Title = {{Disordered amorphous calcium carbonate from direct precipitation}},
Journal = {{CRYSTENGCOMM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{4842-4849}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is known to play a prominent role in
   biomineralization. Different studies on the structure of biogenic ACCs
   have illustrated that they can have distinct short-range orders.
   However, the origin of so-called proto-structures in synthetic and
   additive-free ACCs is not well understood. In the current work, ACC has
   been synthesised in iso-propanolic media by direct precipitation from
   ionic precursors, and analysed utilising a range of different
   techniques. The data suggest that this additive-free type of ACC does
   not resemble clear proto-structural motifs relating to any crystalline
   polymorph. This can be explained by the undefined pH value in
   iso-propanolic media, and the virtually instantaneous precipitation.
   Altogether, this work suggests that aqueous systems and pathways
   involving pre-nucleation clusters are required for the generation of
   clear proto-structural features in ACC. Experiments on the
   ACC-to-crystalline transformation in solution with and without ethanol
   highlight that polymorph selection is under kinetic control, while the
   presence of ethanol can control dissolution re-crystallisation pathways.}},

   for Lithium Ion Batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{A1401-A1408}},
Abstract = {{LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) can deliver a high capacity of similar to
   200 mAh/g with an average discharge potential of similar to 3.8 V (vs.
   Li+/Li), making it a promising positive electrode material for high
   energy density lithium ion batteries. However, electrochemical tests
   from half cells and full cells show poor cycling performance when
   charged to potentials above 4.2 V. The calendar and cycle lifetimes of
   cells are affected by the structural stability of the active electrode
   materials as well as the parasitic reactions that occur in lithium ion
   batteries. In order to explore the major failure mechanisms of the
   material, half cells (coin cells) with control electrolyte and full
   cells (pouch cells) with control electrolyte and with selected
   electrolyte additives were tested over four different potential ranges.
   Isothermal microcalorimetry was used to explore the parasitic reactions
   and their potential dependence. In-situ and ex-situ X-ray diffraction
   and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the structural
   and morphological degradation of the materials over cycling. It was
   found that the dramatic c-axis change of the active material during
   charge and discharge may not be the major problem for cells that are
   cycled to higher potentials. The parasitic reactions that arise from the
   interactions between the electrolyte and the highly reactive delithiated
   cathode surface at high potentials are suggested as the main reason for
   the failure of cells cycled above 4.2 V. It should be possible to
   further improve the performance of NMC811 at high potentials by
   modifying the cathode surface and/or identifying and using electrolyte
   blends which reduce parasitic reactions. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Abstract = {{A method to enhance thermal microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
   actuators in aqueous media by using dielectric encapsulation layers is
   presented. Aqueous media reduces the available mechanical energy of the
   thermal actuator through an electrical short between actuator
   structures. Al2O3 and TiO2 laminates with various thicknesses were
   deposited on packaged PolyMUMPs devices to electrically separate the
   actuator from the aqueous media. Atomic layer deposition was used to
   form an encapsulation layer around released MEMS structures and the
   package. The enhancement was assessed by the increase of the elastic
   energy, which is proportional to the mechanical stiffness of the
   actuator and the displacement squared. The mechanical stiffness of the
   encapsulated actuators compared with the noncoated actuators was
   increased by factors ranging from 1.45 (for 45 nm Al2O3 + 20 nm TiO2) to
   1.87 (for 90nm Al2O3 + 40 nm TiO2). Displacement measurements were made
   for all laminate combinations in filtered tap water and seawater by
   using FFT based displacement measurement technique with a repeatability
   of similar to 10 nm. For all laminate structures, the elastic energy
   increased and enhanced the actuator performance: In seawater, the
   mechanical output energy increased by factors ranging from 5 (for 90 nm
   Al2O3) to 11 (for 90nm Al2O3 + 40 nm TiO2). The authors also measured
   the long-term actuator stability/reliability in seawater. Samples were
   stored for 29 days in seawater and tested for 17 days in seawater.
   Laminates with TiO2 layers allowed constant operation over the entire
   measurement period. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Journal = {{WATER POLICY}},

Pages = {{349-369}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental to community health and well-being is the capacity to access
   a sustainable supply of safe drinking water. Small community drinking
   water systems are the most vulnerable to contamination, and struggle to
   secure the funds necessary to improve water treatment and delivery
   systems, and meet increasingly stringent drinking water quality
   regulations. Little is known of the contextual and cultural differences
   between communities and the impact this has on regulatory compliance.
   This study explored the experiences and impact of individual actors
   within seven small community drinking water systems in locations across
   Canada. Qualitative, in-person interviews were conducted with water
   operators, consumers, and decision-makers in each community, and these
   findings were analysed thematically. Findings from the study show that
   communities approach and align with compliance challenges in three
   distinct ways: by adopting regulator-provided or regulator-driven
   solutions, by adopting an existing improvement framework (i.e.
   regionalization), or through reinvention to address a new issue or
   concern. Policy-makers looking to align small communities with
   appropriate water quality goals may benefit from a consideration of
   these contextual and cultural differences.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the four most commonly
   used receptor models, namely absolute principal component scores (APCS),
   pragmatic mass closure (PMC), chemical mass balance (CMB) and positive
   matrix factorization (PMF). The models were used to predict the
   contributions of a wide variety of sources to PM2.5 mass in Halifax,
   Nova Scotia during the experiment to quantify the impact of BOReal
   forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic using Aircraft
   and Satellites (BOR-TAS). However, particular emphasis was placed on the
   capacity of the models to predict the boreal wildfire smoke
   contributions during the BORTAS experiment. The performance of the four
   receptor models was assessed on their ability to predict the observed
   PM2.5 with an R-2 close to 1, an intercept close to zero, a low bias and
   low RSME. Using PMF, a new woodsmoke enrichment factor of 52 was
   estimated for use in the PMC receptor model. The results indicate that
   the APCS and PMC receptor models were not able to accurately resolve
   total PM2.5 mass concentrations below 2 mu g m(-3). CMB was better able
   to resolve these low PM2.5 concentrations, but it could not be run on 9
   of the 45 days of PM2.5 samples. PMF was found to be the most robust of
   the four models since it was able to resolve PM2.5 mass below 2 mu g
   m(-3), predict PM2.5 mass on all 45 days and utilise an unambiguous
   woodsmoke chemical tracer. The me-dian woodsmoke relative contributions
   to PM2.5 estimated using PMC, APCS, CMB and PMF were found to be 0.08,
   0.09, 3.59 and 0.14 mu g m(-3) respectively. The contribution predicted
   by the CMB model seemed to be clearly too high based on other
   observations. The use of levoglucosan as a tracer for woodsmoke was
   found to be vital for identifying this source.}},

Abstract = {{Three-hydroxy-oxylipins (3-OH oxylipins) have been previously detected
   in brewing yeast production strains at flocculation onset. In this work,
   the SMA strain of Saccharomyces pastorianus was characterized during
   growth in a miniature fermentation assay by measuring flocculation and
   cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH). Proportions of 3-OH oxylipin were
   also measured concurrently during growth in the miniature fermentation
   assay and a defined 3-OH oxylipin extraction protocol using ethyl
   acetate is presented along with a novel derivatization and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection approach. When the
   SMA strain was grown in the assay, near maximal CSH and flocculation
   levels were achieved by a 36h fermentation time. Under the same culture
   conditions, the oxylipin 3-OH decanoic acid (3-OH 10:0) was identified.
   This oxylipin could not be detected early in the fermentation, but
   elevated relative levels of 3-OH 10:0 were reached by 36h, coinciding
   with increased CSH levels. It was previously presumed that the formation
   of 3-OH oxylipins at flocculation onset might increase the CSH. However,
   results from this study suggest that 3-OH 10:0 may not contribute to
   cell wall hydrophobicity. The flocculation behaviour of the SMA strain
   was also monitored in the presence of 3-OH 10:0, but exposure to this
   oxylipin did not impact the sedimentation of this yeast, suggesting that
   3-OH oxylipins may not act as mediators of quorum sensing in this
   strain. Copyright (C) 2015 The Institute of Brewing \& Distilling}},

Abstract = {{Core-shell positive electrode materials with a core: shell mass ratio of
   2: 1 and 4: 1 were synthesized in a two-step reaction. Powder X-ray
   diffraction, SEM and spatial EDS measurements were used to characterize
   the core and shell phases in the precursors and lithiated products. It
   was determined using EDS that the precursor and lithiated products are
   both core-shell and the two phases can be easily resolved with
   laboratory grade XRD equipment. Two phase Rietveld refinement was
   completed on the core-shell lithiated products. The results of these
   refinements in conjunction with contour plots of the lattice parameters
   within the Li-Ni-Mn oxide layered single phase region were used to
   position the core and shell of each sample on the Li-Ni-Mn-O phase
   diagram as a function of the amount of Li2CO3 used in synthesis. The
   shell phase retained an approximately fixed amount of Li while the Li
   content of the core phase increased as the overall Li content of the
   core-shell sample increased. Both the core and shell were
   electrochemically active. A specific capacity of 220 mAh/g was achieved
   in a core shell material between 2.5-4.6 V vs. Li/Li+. (C) The Author(s)

Abstract = {{Ground-based observations have insufficient spatial coverage to assess
   long-term human exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at the
   global scale. Satellite remote sensing offers a promising approach to
   provide information on both short-and long-term exposure to PM2.5 at
   local-to-global scales, but there are limitations and outstanding
   questions about the accuracy and precision with which ground-level
   aerosol mass concentrations can be inferred from satellite remote
   sensing alone. A key source of uncertainty is the global distribution of
   the relationship between annual average PM2.5 and discontinuous
   satellite observations of columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD). We have
   initiated a global network of ground-level monitoring stations designed
   to evaluate and enhance satellite remote sensing estimates for
   application in health-effects research and risk assessment. This Surface
   PARTiculate mAtter Network (SPARTAN) includes a global federation of
   ground-level monitors of hourly PM2.5 situated primarily in highly
   populated regions and collocated with existing ground-based sun
   photometers that measure AOD. The instruments, a three-wavelength
   nephelometer and impaction filter sampler for both PM2.5 and PM10, are
   highly autonomous. Hourly PM2.5 concentrations are inferred from the
   combination of weighed filters and nephelometer data. Data from existing
   networks were used to develop and evaluate network sampling
   characteristics. SPARTAN filters are analyzed for mass, black carbon,
   water-soluble ions, and metals. These measurements provide, in a variety
   of regions around the world, the key data required to evaluate and
   enhance satellite-based PM2.5 estimates used for assessing the health
   effects of aerosols. Mean PM2.5 concentrations across sites vary by more
   than 1 order of magnitude. Our initial measurements indicate that the
   ratio of AOD to ground-level PM2.5 is driven temporally and spatially by
   the vertical profile in aerosol scattering. Spatially this ratio is also
   strongly influenced by the mass scattering efficiency.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS \& AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) sensors provide a way for
   an outdoor wheeled mobile robot to achieve better localization sensing
   that results in better navigation and control. In this paper, we propose
   a new practical path following approach with successful applications to
   the outdoor wheeled mobile robots (WMR). The primary focus of the
   approach is to use differential GPS (dGPS) technology as the only
   sensing device for localization while the odometry-based localization
   method for outdoor environment is not desirable. In using a dGPS sensing
   device for measurement, filter estimation techniques are also considered
   to account for measurement inaccuracies. Of the several techniques, the
   extended Kalman filter (EKF) is chosen and implemented as part of this
   approach for improved results. A secondary focus of the approach is to
   incorporate path planning as an integral part of the proposed technique,
   in which the boundary influence to the interested object is well
   integrated in addition to the conventional path following approaches.
   This allows for a better consideration of the inaccuracies inherent in
   GPS measurements by planning for them in order to ensure the robot
   achieves its objective. The dGPS-based proposed path following approach
   is firstly simulated in the simulation environment. The proposed
   approach is then applied and tested on a WMR experimental platform for a
   set of experimental cases with comparisons.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1307-1320}},
Abstract = {{Radiance spectroscopy was applied to the interstitial detection of
   localized inclusions containing Au nanocages or nanorods with various
   concentrations embedded in porcine muscle phantoms. The radiance was
   quantified using a perturbation approach, which enabled the separation
   of contributions from the porcine phantom and the localized inclusion,
   with the inclusion serving as a perturbation probe of photon
   distributions in the turbid medium. Positioning the inclusion at various
   places in the phantom allowed for tracking of photons that originated
   from a light source, passed through the inclusion's location, and
   reached a detector. The inclusions with high extinction coefficients
   were able to absorb nearly all photons in the range of 650-900 nm,
   leading to a spectrally flat radiance signal. This signal could be
   converted to the relative density of photons incident on the inclusion.
   Finally, the experimentally measured quantities were expressed via the
   relative perturbation and arranged into the classical Beer-Lambert law
   that allowed one to extract the extinction coefficients of various types
   of Au nanoparticles in both the transmission and back reflection
   geometries. It was shown that the spatial variation of perturbation
   could be described as 1/r dependence, where r is the distance between
   the inclusion and the detector. Due to a larger absorption cross
   section, Au nanocages produced greater perturbations than Au nanorods of
   equal particle concentration, indicating a better suitability of Au
   nanocages as contrast agents for optical measurements in turbid media.
   Individual measurements from different inclusions were combined into
   detectability maps.}},

Abstract = {{Energy storage technologies can provide services to the electricity grid
   that are necessary for its usability, stability, and reliability. The
   services, such as power factor correction and renewable energy
   arbitrage, are defined by duration, cycling occurrence, power, and
   market price. Storage technologies suitable to these applications, such
   as pumped hydro and batteries, are defined by their usable energy,
   power, efficiency, operating range, availability, lifetime, and cost.
   In this article, grid services and storage technologies are examined
   using a range of metrics. Through a series of figures and discussions,
   the reader is provided with a method for comparing universal
   characteristics with regional/technology specific values. This provides
   a guiding strategy to help identify overlap between service needs and
   storage technology capabilities, so as to aid in the specification and
   selection of systems for present and future grid storage opportunities.

Title = {{Analysis of Water Hammer Attenuation in Applications with Varying Valve
   Closure Times}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A multiple scales asymptotic analysis is developed to describe the
   attenuation of a water hammer pressure wave initiated by a time-varying
   valve closure. The analytical results expose a simple rule-of-thumb
   relationship between water hammer pressure wave attenuation and the
   periodic average of the absolute flow velocity that is predicted by a
   quasi-steady friction model. The effect of flow reversals on the
   pressure wave attenuation is examined through comparison with a similar
   method applied to the water hammer generated during flow establishment,
   wherein flow reversals do not occur and there is a nonzero net flow.
   Although the analytical description is based on the assumption that the
   water hammer is generated by a sudden valve closure, its practical
   usefulness is extended by using the numerical solution as a guide to
   demonstrate its validity for a range of valve closure durations. A
   qualitative upper limit on closure times to which the analytic results
   may be applied is also found. All results are numerically verified using
   the method of characteristics. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{A finite element study was conducted to investigate the in-plane

   the degree of this reduction was associated with the location of the
   opening. Based on regression analysis on finite element model results, a
   simple analytical method was proposed to define the relationship between
   the reduction factor in the stiffness and strength and opening size and
   location. The efficacy of the proposed equation and other existing

Title = {{Optimization of ultrasound-assisted extraction of anthocyanins from

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BERRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A considerable body of evidence has associated the
   consumption of blueberries to health-related benefits, mainly because of
   their anthocyanin content. The extraction of these compounds could
   contribute to their application in functional foods and value-added
   products.
   OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the ultrasound-assisted
   extraction (UAE) of anthocyanins from lowbush blueberries in a
   bench-scale system.
   METHODS: Two statistical design methods, namely full factorial and
   Box-Behnken, were used for the screening and optimization of the
   variables that significantly affect the UAE of anthocyanins. Extraction
   temperature, time, solvent concentration (acidified ethanol), and
   solvent to solid ratio were selected to determine higher anthocyanin
   extraction (assessed by the pH-differential method).
   RESULTS: When evaluated by response surface methodology, solvent to
   solid ratio and solvent concentration had a significant effect onUAE
   followed by ultrasound bath temperature. The mathematical model
   indicated that the highest anthocyanin extraction would be obtained with
   60\% acidified ethanol, solvent to solid ratio of 50 mL/g, at 65 degrees
   C for 11.5 min.
   CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-assisted extraction was shown to be an effective
   method of extracting total anthocyanins from Nova Scotia lowbush
   blueberries. A statistical model to predict optimum conditions for
   extraction was developed using a Box Behnken design.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Haskap berries (Lonicera caerulea L.) are processed into
   various products (e.g. juice, jam and chutneys). These fruits are rich
   in bioactive compounds, though losses can occur during frozen storage,
   affecting the nutritional content of the products.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of freezing storage temperature
   (-18 and -32 degrees C) and steam blanching prior to freezing on the the
   total phenolic content (TPC)/total reducing capacity (TRC), total
   anthocyanin content (TAC) and antioxidant potential of three Haskap
   berry varieties; Tundra (T), Berry Blue (BB) and Indigo Gem (IG).
   METHODS: Berries were stored at -18 or -32 degrees C for six months, and
   analyzed monthly for TPC/TRC, TAC, and DPPH radical scavenging activity.
   Steam blanching prior to freezing was also evaluated.
   RESULTS: Frozen storage at -18 degrees C for six months reduced the
   TPC/TRC by 37.08 to 47.16\%. TAC was also reduced, where the highest
   decrease was for BB (59.24\%) followed by IG (46.34\%), and DPPH
   scavenging activity decreased by 26.78 to 30.86\%. Blanching prior to
   freezing improved the retention of bioactive compounds but storage at
   -32 degrees C did not yield significant improvements.
   CONCLUSIONS: Steam blanching prior to freezing followed by frozen
   storage at -18 degrees C is recommended for better retention of the
   bioactive components of haskap berries.}},

Abstract = {{At its essence, biomechanical injury to soft tissues or tissue products
   means damage to collagen fibrils. To restore function, damaged collagen
   must be identified, then repaired or replaced. It is unclear at present
   what the kernel features of fibrillar damage are, how phagocytic or
   synthetic cells identify that damage, and how they respond. We recently
   identified a nanostructural motif characteristic of overloaded collagen
   fibrils that we have termed discrete plasticity. In this study, we have
   demonstrated that U937 macrophage-like cells respond specifically to
   overload-damaged collagen fibrils. Tendons from steer tails were
   bisected, one half undergoing 15 cycles of subrupture mechanical
   overload and the other serving as an unloaded control. Both halves were
   decellularized, producing sterile collagen scaffolds that contained
   either undamaged collagen fibrils, or fibrils with discrete plasticity
   damage. Matched-pairs were cultured with U937 cells differentiated to a
   macrophage-like form directly on the substrate. Morphological responses
   of the U937 cells to the two substratesand evidence of collagenolysis by
   the cellswere assessed using scanning electron microscopy. Enzyme
   release into medium was quantified for prototypic matrix
   metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) collagenase, and MMP-9 gelatinase. When
   adherent to damaged collagen fibrils, the cells clustered less, showed
   ruffled membranes, and frequently spread: increasing their contact area
   with the damaged substrate. There was clear structural evidence of
   pericellular enzymolysis of damaged collagenbut not of control collagen.
   Cells on damaged collagen also released significantly less MMP-9. These
   results show that U937 macrophage-like cells recognize strain-induced
   discrete plasticity damage in collagen fibrils: an ability that may be
   important to their removal or repair. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{The phase diagram of the Li-Mn-Ni-oxide pseudoternary system1 was used
   as a starting point to understand the influence of transition metal
   composition and lithium content on the structures and electrochemistry
   of materials with compositions: Li1+x(NiyMn1-y)(1-x)O-2 (y = 0.2, 0.33,
   0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7, 0 = x = 0.34). Mixed transition metal hydroxide
   precursors were synthesized via coprecipitation using a continuously
   stirred tank reactor. Powder X-ray diffraction results showed that
   additional spinel, rocksalt and/or layered phases were observed when the
   lithium content was less than that required for a single layered phase
   in agreement with ref 1. Additionally, residual Li2CO3 was detected in
   the backscattered scanning electron microscopy images for samples with
   relatively high lithium content. The boundaries of the single phase
   region were therefore defined and the contour plots of the lattice
   constants versus composition in the single phase region were generated.
   Electrochemical measurements showed that phase separation should be
   avoided and single phase samples should be prepared in order to obtain
   the highest capacity. The maximum reversible capacity to 4.6 V was found
   near the middle of the single phase region when 0.5 < y < 0.7, whereas
   it was at the top (smallest lithium content) of the single phase region
   when y <= 0.5.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, graphene-based titanium dioxide and zinc oxide composites
   (TiO2-G, ZnO-G) were synthesized using a hydrothermal process. Materials
   were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Photocatalytic
   activity of the composite materials under simulated solar light was
   studied using phenol as a model compound. A ca. 30\% improvement on the
   degradation performance by the TiO2-G composite (and ZnO-G) was observed
   when reaction rate constants were compared with TiO2 (and ZnO) only.
   This demonstrates the positive effect of graphene on suppressing charge
   recombination and extending the light absorption range. Further
   improvement on the photocatalytic degradation rate of phenol was
   obtained by coupling the two composites, ZnO-G and TiO2-G. This is
   attributed to more efficient charge separation and longer lifetime of
   the charge carriers, which eventually enhances the photocatalytic
   activity. The optimum stoichiometric amount of each component was
   obtained experimentally. Systematic parametric studies were also
   performed to study the effect of catalyst loading, initial phenol
   concentration, solution pH, and solar light intensity. Complete solar
   degradation of 40 ppm phenol was achieved within 60 min while using the
   coupled ZnO-G/TiO2-G photocatalysts at the optimum conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The number and complexity of natural organic matter (NOM) species limits
   identification of individual NOM compounds. The objective of this study
   was to employ several characterization techniques (resin fractionation,
   high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), and strategic
   UV254 absorbance) to samples from seven surface water sites in North
   America, and overcome the shortfalls of each tool. Resin fractionation
   indicated the samples were all high in hydrophobic acids (HOA),
   hydrophilic neutrals (HIN) and hydrophilic acids (HIA). Site B was the
   only site where HIAs were the highest NOM contributors. In the HPSEC
   analysis, each fraction exhibited a particular molecular weight (MW)
   range: 100-300 Da (HIN), 1-2kDa (HOA), and the HIA fractions exhibited
   MWs between these two ranges. Strategic UV254 measurements were taken at
   two sites to supplement the HPSEC results, and determine the difference
   in UV absorbance per unit dissolved organic carbon (SUVA value). Most
   fractions showed SUVA values of approximately 5 L/mg-m; however, the
   hydrophilic bases and hydrophobic neutral fractions could not be
   accurately evaluated due to the very low DOC concentrations for these
   two fractions (< 0.2mg/L). These methods are complimentary NOM
   characterization techniques, and the combined methodology addresses the
   analytical limits of each tool.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Vagal nerve stimulation in cardiac therapy involves delivering
   electrical current to the vagal sympathetic complex in patients
   experiencing heart failure. The therapy has shown promise but the
   mechanisms by which any benefit accrues is not understood. In this paper
   we model the response to increased levels of stimulation of individual
   components of the vagal sympathetic complex as a differential activation
   of each component in the control of heart rate. The model provides
   insight beyond what is available in the animal experiment in as much as
   allowing the simultaneous assessment of neuronal activity throughout the
   cardiac neural axis. The results indicate that there is sensitivity of
   the neural network to low level subthreshold stimulation. This leads us
   to propose that the chronic effects of vagal nerve stimulation therapy
   lie within the indirect pathways that target intrinsic cardiac local
   circuit neurons because they have the capacity for plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Immunotherapies, including peptide-based vaccines, are a growing area of
   cancer research, and understanding their mechanism of action is crucial
   for their continued development and clinical application. Exploring the
   biodistribution of vaccine components may be key to understanding this
   action. This work used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize
   the in vivo biodistribution of the antigen and oil substrate of the
   vaccine delivery system known as DepoVax (TM). DepoVax uses a novel
   adjuvanted lipid-in-oil based formulation to solubilise antigens and
   promote a depot effect. In this study, antigen or oil were tagged with
   superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), making them visible on MR images.
   This enables tracking of individual vaccine components to determine
   changes in biodistribution.
   Mice were injected with SPIO-labeled antigen or SPIO-labeled oil, and
   imaged to examine clearance of labeled components from the vaccine site.
   The SPIO-antigen was steadily cleared, with nearly half cleared within
   two months post-vaccination. In contrast, the SPIO-oil remained
   relatively unchanged. The biodistribution of the SPIO-antigen component
   within the vaccine site was heterogeneous, indicating the presence of
   active clearance mechanisms, rather than passive diffusion or drainage.
   Mice injected with SPIO-antigen also showed MRI contrast for several
   weeks post-vaccination in the draining inguinal lymph node. These
   results indicate that MRI can visualize the in vivo longitudinal
   biodistribution of vaccine components. The sustained clearance is
   consistent with antigen up-take and trafficking by immune cells, leading
   to accumulation in the draining lymph node, which corresponds to the
   sustained immune responses and reduced tumor burden observed in
   vaccinated mice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Pelagic primary production in Arctic seas has traditionally been viewed
   as biologically insignificant until after the ice breakup. There is
   growing evidence however, that under-ice blooms of pelagic phytoplankton
   may be a recurrent occurrence. During the springs of 2011 and 2012, we
   found substantial numbers (201-5713 cells m(-3)) of the large centric
   diatom (diameter >250 mu m) Coscinodiscus centralis under the sea ice in
   the Canadian Arctic Archipelago near Resolute Bay, Nunavut. The highest
   numbers of these pelagic diatoms were observed in Barrow Strait. Spatial
   patterns of fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes indicated two source
   populations for C. centralis: a western origin with low light conditions
   and high nutrients, and a northern origin with lower nutrient levels and
   higher irradiances. Fatty acid analysis revealed that pelagic diatoms
   had significantly higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mean +/-
   SD: 50.3 +/- 8.9\%) compared to ice-associated producers (30.6 +/-
   10.3\%) in our study area. In particular, C. centralis had significantly
   greater proportions of the long chain omega-3 fatty acid,
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), than ice algae (24.4 +/- 5.1\% versus 13.7
   +/- 5.1\%, respectively). Thus, C. centralis represented a significantly
   higher quality food source for local herbivores than ice algae, although
   feeding experiments did not show clear evidence of copepod grazing on C.
   centralis. Our results suggest that C. centralis are able to initiate
   growth under pack ice in this area and provide further evidence that
   biological productivity in ice-covered seas may be substantially higher
   than previously recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus on Georges Bank in the northwest
   Atlantic exhibit semi-annual spawning phenology, where the autumn spawn
   is dominant and the spring spawn is smaller and more variable. The
   spring spawn is thought to contribute little to total annual larval
   settlement on the Bank because fecundity is lower, larval development is
   slower and off-Bank transport is higher during spring. We tested the
   hypothesis that larval settlement during spring is negligible compared
   to autumn by incorporating spatially and temporally explicit information
   about spawning and larval mortality into a coupled biological-physical
   larval tracking model to investigate dispersal and connectivity during
   each spawning period. To accomplish this, we assimilated field data on
   adult density-at-size and seasonal fecundity-at-size as initial
   conditions into the model. We discovered that larval production varied
   in time (spring production on the Bank is half that of autumn) and space
   (spawners are concentrated along the advective pathway of the along-Bank
   gyre). Particle settlement and connectivity was reduced, but not
   negligible, during spring compared to autumn due to stronger dispersal
   off-Bank and into uninhabitable areas during spring. When mortality was
   made constant in space and time, lower larval production combined with
   slower growth during spring resulted in a minimal contribution of the
   spring spawn to annual settlement. When mortality was correlated with
   environmental variation in time and space, the spring spawn contributed
   up to one-third of the total annual larval settlement between the
   immediate upstream-downstream connected aggregations. We conclude that
   the spring spawn can make a substantial contribution to total annual
   larval production, and that settlement on Georges Bank and should be
   given more attention in field studies. Larval mortality has a strong
   influence on settlement during spring and autumn, and future field
   studies should focus on quantifying space and time variation in
   mortality in relation to the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring climate and anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems
   requires an understanding of how trophic components interact. However,
   integrative end-to-end ecosystem studies (experimental and/or modelling)
   are rare. Experimental investigations often concentrate on a particular
   group or individual species within a trophic level, while tropho-dynamic
   field studies typically employ either a bottom-up approach concentrating
   on the phytoplankton community or a top-down approach concentrating on
   the fish community. Likewise the emphasis within modelling studies is
   usually placed upon phytoplankton-dominated biogeochemistry or on
   aspects of fisheries regulation. In consequence the roles of zooplankton
   communities (protists and metazoans) linking phytoplankton and fish
   communities are typically under-represented if not (especially in
   fisheries models) ignored. Where represented in ecosystem models,
   zooplankton are usually incorporated in an extremely simplistic fashion,
   using empirical descriptions merging various interacting physiological
   functions governing zooplankton growth and development, and thence
   ignoring physiological feedback mechanisms. Here we demonstrate, within
   a modelled plankton food-web system, how trophic dynamics are sensitive
   to small changes in parameter values describing zooplankton vital rates
   and thus the importance of using appropriate zooplankton descriptors.
   Through a comprehensive review, we reveal the mismatch between empirical
   understanding and modelling activities identifying important issues that
   warrant further experimental and modelling investigation. These include:
   food selectivity, kinetics of prey consumption and interactions with
   assimilation and growth, form of voided material, mortality rates at
   different age-stages relative to prior nutrient history. In particular
   there is a need for dynamic data series in which predator and prey of
   known nutrient history are studied interacting under varied pH and
   temperature regimes. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{While healthy aging is associated with physiological changes that can
   impair control of trunk motion, few studies examine how spinal muscle
   responses change with increasing age. This study examined whether older
   (over 65 years) compared to younger (20-45 years) adults had higher
   overall amplitude and altered temporal recruitment patterns of trunk
   musculature when performing a functional transfer task. Surface
   electromyograms from twelve bilateral trunk muscle (24) sites were
   analyzed using principal component analysis, extracting amplitude and
   temporal features (PCs) from electromyographic waveforms. Two PCs
   explained 96\% of the waveform variance. Three factor ANOVA models
   tested main effects (group, muscle and reach) and interactions for PC
   scores. Significant (p < .0125) group interactions were found for all PC
   scores. Post hoc analysis revealed that relative to younger adults,
   older adults recruited higher agonist and antagonistic activity,
   demonstrated continuous activation levels in specific muscle sites
   despite changing external moments, and had altered temporal synergies
   within abdominal and back musculature. In summary both older and younger
   adults recruit highly organized activation patterns in response to
   changing external moments. Differences in temporal trunk musculature
   recruitment patterns suggest that older adults experience different
   dynamic spinal stiffness and loading compared to younger adults during a
   functional lifting task. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{510-522}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new unsupervised image segmentation method by
   using Bhattacharyya distance-based irregular pyramid, termed as `BDIP'
   algorithm. The proposed BDIP algorithm obtains a suboptimal labelling
   solution under the condition that the number of segments is not manually
   given. It hierarchically builds each level of the irregular pyramid,
   with the result that the final segments emerge as they are represented
   by single nodes at certain levels. The BDIP algorithm employs
   Bhattacharyya distance to estimate the intra-level similarity at higher
   pyramidal levels so as to improve the accuracy and robustness to noise.
   Furthermore, an adaptive neighbour search method is proposed such that
   the BDIP algorithm can self-determine the number of segments. This
   method considers not only the graphic constraint, but also the
   similarity constraint in the sense that a candidate node is selected as
   a neighbour of the centre node if there is no boundary evidence between
   these two nodes. With the pyramidal accumulation, this evaluation is
   aggregated into the approximately global evidence, based on which the
   number of segments can be self-determined. Experimental results have
   shown that this proposed BDIP algorithm outperforms other benchmark
   segmentation algorithms in terms of segmentation accuracy, labelling
   cost and robustness to noise.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, tundra wetlands are used to treat municipal wastewater in
   many Arctic communities, typically following primary treatment from a
   wastewater stabilization pond. Inclusion of tundra wetlands as part of
   the municipal wastewater treatment strategy for the Canadian Arctic is
   an option to meet upcoming federal Wastewater Systems Effluent
   Regulations (WSER). Water quality improvement has been demonstrated in
   tundra wastewater treatment wetlands; however, the mechanisms
   responsible for this observed treatment are not well understood. In this
   study, we conducted a detailed physical, hydraulic, and biogeochemical
   analysis of a tundra wetland receiving primary treated municipal
   wastewater in Coral Harbour, Nunavut. The primary objective was to gain
   a better understanding of the processes which contribute to water
   quality improvement within these types of environmental systems. Data
   were collected during four study periods throughout the treatment
   season, between mid-June 2011 and early-September 2012. Study results
   illustrated seasonal variability in the treatment performance and
   hydraulic characteristics of the wetland. Hydraulic residence times
   (HRTs) as short as 11 h were observed during the spring freshet, and as
   long as 14 days in mid-summer. Short HRTs in the spring freshet
   suggested the observed reduction of wastewater constituents was
   primarily by dilution from watershed contributions. Biogeochemical data
   showed seasonal increases in pH and DO, which were driven by algae
   growth, which corresponded to increases in TSS, and decreases in E. coli
   and nitrogen species. During the entire treatment season, the wetland
   effluent met the WSER, which does not currently include Nunavut, Canada.
   Contaminant concentration reductions were variable over the treatment
   season with the minimum reductions observed during the spring freshet
   (92.5\% of BOD5, 3.7 log of E. coli, 95.4\% of TSS, 77.3\% of TN, 73.7\%
   of TAN, 46.2\% of NH3-N, and 78.9\% of TP). Requisites for the
   responsible use of a wetland for wastewater treatment in an arctic
   setting should include the characterization of hydrological setting to
   quantify how external hydrologic inputs will influence treatment
   performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid mixtures of a combustible dust and flammable gas are found in
   many industrial processes. Such fuel systems are often encountered in
   the pharmaceutical industry when excipient (nonpharmaceutically active
   ingredient) powders undergo transfer in either a dry or solvent
   prewetted state into an environment possibly containing a flammable gas.
   The research described in this article simulated the conditions of the
   above scenarios with microcrystalline cellulose and lactose as
   excipients, and methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol as solvents.
   Standardized dust explosibility test equipment (Siwek 20-L explosion
   chamber, MIKE 3 apparatus, and BAM oven) and ASTM test protocols were
   used to determine the following explosibility parameters: maximum
   explosion pressure (P-max), volume-normalized maximum rate of pressure
   rise (K-St), minimum explosible concentration (MEC), minimum ignition
   energy (MIE), and minimum ignition temperature (MIT). The experimental
   results demonstrate the significant enhancements in explosion likelihood
   and explosion severity brought about by solvent admixture in either
   mode. The extent of solvent influence was found to be specific to the
   given excipient and method of solvent addition. Solvent burning velocity
   considerations help to account for some of the experimental observations

   meter. Five samples of each disposable blade type were tested and
   compared with a standard re-usable stainless steel blade using three
   different handle/light sources (Vital Signs LED, Heine 2.5V Xenon and
   3.5V Xenon). The light intensity delivered by the disposable blades
   ranged from 790 to 3846 lux for the different handle types. Overall, the
   3.5V Heine handle delivered the highest light output (p<0.007) in
   comparison with the other handles. For the disposable blades, the
   overall light output was significantly higher from the plastic than the
   metal blades (p<0.001).}},

Abstract = {{Electrocoagulation (EC) is a water treatment technology that has been
   proven effective at the bench scale for the removal of a wide variety of
   contaminants from water and wastewater. It is an electrochemical process
   that involves using a sacrificial anode to generate cations for
   coagulation. It also evolves hydrogen gas at the cathode, which some
   researchers have suggested can be used for natural flotation. EC has a
   number of advantages over conventional chemical coagulation (CC). For
   instance, solid metal electrodes tend to be easier to move and store
   than corrosive chemical salts. Furthermore, EC tends to increase
   solution pH, rather than consume alkalinity like chemical coagulants.
   However, unlike with CC, there are no standardized procedures for jar
   testing with EC, or for designing EC systems. Much of the current EC
   literature focuses on the treatment of a specific water or wastewater
   using custom EC systems. In an attempt to provide guidance for EC cell
   design, this paper reviews some of the current literature in four parts:
   electrodes, electrolyte, power source, and operational parameters.}},

Title = {{Risk-based process plant design considering inherent safety}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{438-464}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An inherently safer approach is becoming a key parameter of process and
   plant design. However, a lack of established guidelines and methods
   hinders most industries from utilizing inherent safety concepts to a
   full extent. This paper presents a risk-based design decision-making
   tool considering inherent safety. The tool is called the Risk-based
   Inherent Safety Index (RISI). The proposed indexing approach is an
   extension of the Integrated Inherent Safety Index (I2SI) earlier
   developed by Khan and Amyotte (2004, 2005). The RISI incorporates both
   consequence and probability of accident occurrence reduction through
   application of inherently safer design principles throughout the process
   design life cycle. Unlike other available dimensionless index-based
   matrices, risk components of the proposed indexing approach are
   expressed in terms of SI units. The RISI is applicable at different
   stages of the process design life cycle. Analytical and subjective
   equations assess the damage potential of major process accidents: fire,
   explosion and toxic release. The explosion accident scenario is studied
   separately in terms of vapor/gas explosion and dust explosion. The
   decision-making potential based on the quantitative results of the
   methodology is demonstrated by evaluating alternatives for biodiesel
   production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The agricultural use of wastewater biosolids is a common practice in
   many countries, but concerns exist regarding the presence of organic
   wastewater contaminants that remain in the land-applied biosolids. The
   objective of this study was to determine if contaminants present in
   biosolids are detectable in soil following land application. A suite of
   organic contaminants were monitored by gas chromatograph with mass
   spectrometer in agricultural soil samples from a site amended with
   increasing rates of alkaline-treated biosolids. Triclosan, a common
   antimicrobial agent, was detected at levels greater than the reporting
   limit in an environment-controlled incubation study and validated
   through in situ field samples from soils receiving the same
   alkaline-treated biosolid. A rapid decrease in triclosan concentration
   was observed during the first few weeks of the incubation study, with
   concentrations decreasing from 92 +/- 26 to 20 +/- 2 ng g(-1) (average
   78\% decrease) after 4 mo. The field results indicate that triclosan in
   fall-applied may persist overwinter. However, a rapid decrease in
   triclosan concentration during the spring and summer months led to
   levels lower than predicted following the spring application, and levels
   below our reporting limit (up to 85\% decrease) by the end of the study.
   Removal is posited to be through aerobic microbial degradation.}},

Title = {{Dynamic approach to risk management: Application to the Hoeganaes metal
   dust accidents}},

Abstract = {{Several major accidents caused by metal dusts were recorded in the past
   few years. For instance, in 2011, three accidents caused by iron dust
   killed five workers at the Hoeganaes Corp. facility in Gallatin,
   Tennessee (USA). In order to prevent such accidents, a dynamic approach
   to risk management was defined in this study. The method is able to take
   into account new risk notions and early warnings and to systematically
   update the related risk. It may be applied not only in the design phase
   of a system, but also throughout the system lifetime as a support to a
   more precise and robust decision making process. The synergy of two
   specific techniques for hazard identification and risk assessment was
   obtained: the Dynamic Procedure for Atypical Scenarios Identification
   (DyPASI) and the Dynamic Risk Assessment (DRA) methods. To demonstrate
   its effectiveness, this approach was applied to the analysis of Gallatin
   metal dust accidents. The application allowed collecting a number of
   risk notions related to the plant, equipment and materials used. The
   analysis of risk notions by means of this dynamic approach could have
   led to enhanced hazard identification and dynamic real-time risk
   assessment. However, the approach described is effective only if
   associated to a proper safety culture, in order to produce an
   appropriate and robust decision making response to emerging risk issues.

Title = {{Mass-Spring Matching Layers for High-Frequency Ultrasound Transducers: A
   New Technique Using Vacuum Deposition}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a technique of applying multiple matching layers to
   high-frequency (>30 MHz) imaging transducers, by using carefully
   controlled vacuum deposition alone. This technique uses a thin
   mass-spring matching layer approach that was previously described in a
   low-frequency (1 to 10 MHz) transducer design with epoxied layers. This
   mass-spring approach is more suitable to vacuum deposition in
   high-frequency transducers over the conventional quarter-wavelength
   resonant cavity approach, because thinner layers and more versatile
   material selection can be used, the difficulty in precisely lapping
   quarter-wavelength matching layers is avoided, the layers are less
   attenuating, and the layers can be applied to a curved surface. Two
   different 3-mm-diameter 45-MHz planar lithium niobate transducers and
   one geometrically curved 3-mm lithium niobate transducer were designed
   and fabricated using this matching layer approach with copper as the
   mass layer and parylene as the spring layer. The first planar lithium
   niobate transducer used a single mass-spring matching network, and the
   second planar lithium niobate transducer used a single mass-spring
   network to approximate the first layer in a dual quarter-wavelength
   matching layer system in addition to a conventional quarter-wavelength
   layer as the second matching layer. The curved lithium niobate
   transducer was press focused and used a similar mass-spring plus
   quarter-wavelength matching layer network. These transducers were then
   compared with identical transducers with no matching layers and the
   performance improvement was quantified. The bandwidth of the lithium
   niobate transducer with the single mass-spring layer was measured to be
   46\% and the insertion loss was measured to be -21.9 dB. The bandwidth
   and insertion loss of the lithium niobate transducer with the
   mass-spring network plus quarter-wavelength matching were measured to be
   59\% and -18.2 dB, respectively. These values were compared with the
   unmatched transducer, which had a bandwidth of 28\% and insertion loss
   of -34.1 dB. The bandwidth and insertion loss of the curved lithium
   niobate transducer with the mass-spring plus quarter-wavelength matching
   layer combination were measured to be 68\% and -26 dB, respectively;
   this compared with the measured unmatched bandwidth and insertion loss
   of 35\% and -37 dB. All experimentally measured values were in excellent
   agreement with theoretical Krimholtz-Leedom-Matthaei (KLM) model
   predictions.}},

   carbon-nanotube. The resulting nanocomposites exhibited significant
   improvement in their mode-I fracture toughness, while their mode-II
   fracture toughness was slightly degraded. Scanning-electron and
   atomic-force microscopes produced micrographs revealed the alteration of
   the fracture and toughening mechanisms of the resin by evidence such as
   relatively larger plastic deformation, crack deflection, bridging and
   pinning in mode-I fracture. An empirical fracture mechanism criterion

Abstract = {{Agricultural biomass is emerging as a sustainable and suitable resource
   for use in the production of solid fuel, designed for residential
   markets. The development of such a fuel source faces several challenges
   including combustion properties, a reliable supply of raw materials,
   distance from and access to conversion facilities, production scale and
   market access for agricultural biomass products. This paper evaluated
   the economic feasibility of an ``integrated on-farm production
   system{''} based in Nova Scotia, Canada and considered the importance
   and influence of policy on the development of a sustainable on-farm
   production system. This integrated approach is evaluated with input and
   output based incentive models, both of which are currently available in
   the USA and Prince Edward Island, Canada. The results indicate that the
   development of an integrated on-farm approach, while showing promise,
   will require policy implementation and pragmatic incentives to be truly
   sustainable. It is proposed that the benefits to the agricultural
   sector, rural communities and the environment should outweigh the costs
   of such incentives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{CaO-based chemical looping gasification of biomass for hydrogen-enriched
   gas production with in situ CO2 capture and tar reduction}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{7-12}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Steam gasification of biomass undergoes the problem of undesirable CO2
   and tar formation. Calcium oxide (CaO), when added to the gasification,
   could play the dual role of tar reforming catalyst and CO2 sorbent, and
   thereby produce more hydrogen. However, the deactivation of CaO after
   carbonation reaction is challenging for continuous hydrogen production
   and economical perspective. The concept of CaO-based chemical looping
   gasification (CaO-CLG) plays a key role in overcoming such a challenge.
   This work primarily aims at studying steam gasification of biomass with
   the presence of CaO in a uniquely designed chemical looping gasification
   (CLG) system for hydrogen production with in situ CO2 capture and tar
   reduction. The effect of solid circulation rates on gas and tar
   production is studied. A comparison of CaO-CLG, sand-based chemical
   looping gasification (Sand-CLG) and CaO-based bubbling fluidized bed
   gasification (CaO-BFBG) is presented mainly focusing on gas and tar
   production. The maximum H-2 and minimum CO2 concentrations as well as
   maximum H-2 yields of 78\%, 4.98\% and 451.11 ml (STP)/g of biomass,
   respectively, are obtained at the solid circulation rate of 1.04
   kg/m(2)s. At the same point, the maximum total gas yield was 578.38 ml
   (STP)/g of biomass and the tar content of 2.48 g/Nm(3) was the lowest.
   30\% higher concentration of H-2 and triple yield of H-2 were found in
   CaO-CLG compared to Sand-CLG. Compared to CaO-BFBG, CaO-CLG resulted in
   15\% higher concentration of H-2 and almost double yield of H-2.
   Moreover, the lowest tar content of 2.48 g/Nm(3) was obtained for
   CaO-CLG while the tar content was 68.5 g/Nm(3) for Sand-CLG and 26.71
   g/Nm(3) for CaO-BFBG. CO2 concentration obtained for CaO-CLG also
   significantly reduced by 13-17\% as compared to both Sand-CLG and
   CaO-BFBG. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   development and robustness testing it was shown to extract similarly to

   procedure were fully optimised prior to assessing the method's
   linearity, precision, and accuracy. Using a 2000-fold enrichment factor,
   method recoveries for priority compounds geosmin (GSM) and
   2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) were >90\%. Excellent linearity was obtained
   from the reportable detection limits up to 200ng L-1 and precision
   \%relative standard deviations were 8.5\% and 10.9\% for GSM and 2-MIB,
   respectively. Detection limits of 0.9 and 5.5ng L-1 for GSM and 2-MIB
   respectively were deemed fit-for-purpose in comparison to their odour
   thresholds. Validation data were also obtained for other commonly
   analysed taste and odour compounds, including 2,4,6-trichloroanisole,
   2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine. The
   validated method was used to screen surface waters in Nova Scotia,
   Canada for presence of taste and odour compounds, highlighting the
   presence of GSM on the east coast of Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Residential wood combustion is an important source of ambient air
   pollution, accounting for over 25\% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
   emissions in Canada. In addition to these ambient contributions, wood
   smoke pollutants can enter the indoor environment directly when loading
   or stoking stoves, resulting in a high potential for human exposure. A
   study of the effectiveness of air cleaners at reducing wood
   smoke-associated PM2.5 of indoor and outdoor origin was conducted in 31
   homes during winter 2009-10. Day 1, the residents' wood burning
   appliance operated as usual with no air cleaner. Days 2 and 3, the wood
   burning appliance was not operational and the air cleaner was randomly
   chosen to operate in ``filtration{''} or ``placebo filtration{''} mode.
   When the air cleaner was operating, total indoor PM2.5 levels were
   significantly lower than on placebo filtration days (p = 0.0001)
   resulting in a median reduction of 52\%. There was also a reduction in
   the median PM2.5 infiltration factor from 0.56 to 0.26 between these 2
   days, suggesting the air cleaner was responsible for increased PM2.5
   deposition on filtration days. Our findings suggest that the use of an
   air cleaner reduces exposure to indoor PM2.5 resulting from both indoor
   and ambient wood smoke sources.}},

Abstract = {{Bilateral teleoperation technology has caused wide attentions because of
   its applications in various remote operation systems. However, there
   exist some challenging control issues such as communication delay,
   unmeasurable environmental force, and various manipulator modelling
   uncertainties. In this study, the disturbance observer is designed based
   on the slave manipulator dynamics to observe the unmeasurable
   environmental force. When the environmental force is modelled as a
   general linear regression form, its unknown parameters can be estimated
   online by the least square adaptation law. A novel communication
   structure is proposed where only the master trajectory is transmitted to
   the slave side, and the transmission signal from the slave to the master
   is replaced by those estimated environmental parameters. Since these
   parameters are not power signals, the passivity problem of the
   communication channel and the trade-off limitation between the
   transparency performance and robust stability in traditional
   teleoperation control are essentially avoided. The sliding mode control
   and the force compensation of disturbance observer are integrated
   subsequently to deal with various manipulator modelling uncertainties,
   so that the excellent synchronisation performance can be realised. Thus,
   the proposed control algorithm can guarantee the robust stability and
   the good control performance simultaneously under arbitrary time delays.
   The simulation and experiment on two single degree-of-freedom
   manipulators are carried out and the results show the effectiveness of
   the proposed control algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment-borne Escherichia coli can elevate waterborne concentrations
   through sediment resuspension or hyporheic exchange. This study sought
   to correlate hydrological, sediment transport, and water quality
   variables with: (i) the temporal stability of sediment E. coli
   populations {[}concentrations, strain richness and similarity
   (Raup-Crick index)]; and (ii) the contribution of sediment E. coli to
   the water column as defined through a library-dependent microbial source
   tracking approach that matched waterborne E. coli isolates to sediment
   E. coli populations. Three monitoring locations differing in their
   hydrological characteristics and adjacent upland fecal sources (dairy
   operation, low-density residential, and tile-drained cultivated field)
   were investigated. Sediment E. coli population turnover was influenced
   by sediment transport at upstream, high-energy reaches, but not at the
   downstream low-energy reach. Sediment contributions to the water column
   averaged 13\% and 18\%, and fecal sources averaged 17\% and 21\% at the
   upstream sites adjacent to dairy operations and low-density residential
   areas, respectively. Waterborne E. coli at the downstream site had low
   matches to E. coli from reach sediments (1\%), higher matches to the
   upstream sediments (27\% and 12\%), and an average of 14\% matches to
   the tile drained field. The percentage of waterborne E. coli matching
   sediment-borne E. coli at each stream reach varied in correlations to
   hydrological and sediment transport variables, suggesting reach-specific
   differences in the role of sediment resuspension and hyporheic exchange
   on E. coli transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{402}},

Abstract = {{Si-Ca-Zn-La-Ti-Mg-Sr-Na glasses have demonstrated excellent
   biocompatibility both in vitro using the MTT/LDH assays (with L929 mouse
   fibroblast cells and human blood platelets), and in vivo using New
   Zealand White rabbits. However, the biological evaluation of the
   materials was performed on as-manufactured glass granules that were
   autoclaved, rather than aged or gamma-irradiated glass microspheres; the
   sterilization procedure required prior to implantation of these
   materials in its final form inside the human body. Given the fact that
   when a glass is subjected to aging either accelerated or natural changes
   in its physical properties can take place, it is imperative to determine
   whether the structure of such glasses will be altered over time in order
   to substantiate shelf-life claims. The structure of such glasses may
   also be altered as a result of exposure to the typical amounts of
   gamma-irradiation required to sterilize such materials prior to
   implantation. This paper therefore examines the structure of
   Si-Ca-Zn-La-Ti-Mg-Sr-Na glasses using XRD, DSC, pycnometry, Si-29
   MAS-NMR and ICP-OES to evaluate both the effect of accelerated aging and
   multiple cycles of 30 kGy gamma-irradiation on their structure and
   subsequent radiopacity. The Si-29 MAS-NMR results indicate that the peak
   maxima for each glass remain between -83 ppm and -86 ppm; a chemical
   shift for Si-29 associated with Q(2) to Q(3) units in silicate glasses,
   and that the local environment around the Si-29 isotope remains
   unaltered as a result of aging or exposure. Additional analysis (XRD,
   DSC, pycnometry, ICP-OES and radiopacity) showed that the glass
   transition temperature, T-g (676 +/- 4 degrees C) typically remains
   unchanged, as a result of exposure to both accelerated aging and
   ionizing radiation, as do the density (3.63 +/- 0.02 g/cm(3))
   radiopacity (7049 +/- 847HU), chemical composition and XRD
   diffractograms for each glass. Therefore it can be concluded that the
   accelerated aging conditions tested herein or use of 30 kGy
   gamma-irradiation dose or subsequent effects does not affect the local
   environment of the Si-29 isotope in the glasses, nor does it
   significantly alter the XRD diffraction patterns, chemical composition,
   T-g, density or the radiopacity values for the glass composition

Abstract = {{TiC and Ti(C,N) based cermets offer several improved characteristics
   relative to conventional WC-based ``hardmetals{''}, such as lower mass
   and improved oxidation resistance, which are combined with high
   toughness, hardness and wear resistance. In the present work the
   tribological behaviour of TIC and Ti(C, N) cermets has been evaluated
   under reciprocating sliding conditions. The cermets were produced using
   an in-situ, reaction sintering procedure to form the stoichiometric
   Ni3Al binder, with the binder contents varied from 20 to 40 vol\%. Wear
   tests were conducted using a ball-on-flat geometry, with a WC-6 wt\% Co
   sphere as the counter-face material, for loads from 20 to 60 N. The wear
   response was characterised using a combination of optical profilometry,
   scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and
   focused ion beam microscopy. Initially, two-body abrasive wear was
   observed to occur, which transitions to three-body abrasion through
   generation of debris from the cermet and counter-face materials.
   Ultimately, this wear debris is incorporated into a thin tribolayer
   within the wear track, which indicates a further transition to an
   adhesive wear mechanism. It was found that specific wear rates of the
   cermets increased with both applied load. The highest wear resistance
   was found for intermediate Ni3Al contents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: To measure changes in air quality during surgery.
   Methods: Operating room (OR) and hallway air quality was continuously
   monitored over a 3-month period. Rooftop monitoring was used to control
   for environmental changes and to account for the infiltration of outdoor
   air pollutants. Air quality measurements were correlated with operative
   times and electro-dissection equipment used.
   Results: OR air is cooler and drier compared to the adjacent hallway.
   Volatile organic compounds and other gases are below indoor air exposure
   limit guidelines. Lasers create greater 2.5 mu m particulate matter
   (PM2.5) mass concentration, and greater fine and coarse particle number
   than cautery or cold tissue dissection. Cautery produces more ultrafine
   particles (UFP) than other dissection techniques. OR air has lower
   particle counts than outdoor environmental air by virtue of air
   conditioning HEPA filtration.
   Conclusion: Compared to the outside air, operating room air has lower
   particle counts. Lasers produce higher concentrations of PM2.5 mass and,
   fine and coarse particle number counts. Cautery produces higher
   concentrations of UFP number counts than other modalities and warrants
   consideration of the use of masks with ultrafine particle filtration
   capacity. Operating room air is consistently cooler with decreased
   humidity, which may cause airway irritation.}},

Abstract = {{A planar dipole antenna is loaded with LC-tank resonators and chip
   resistors presented for ultra-wideband (UWB) radar and communication
   systems. Each staircase rectangular arm of the proposed planar dipole is
   loaded with an open complementary double concentric split-hexagonal-ring
   resonator (LC-tank) and a pair of chip resistors at the end for
   bandwidth enhancement, whereas a broadband microstrip to parallel-plate
   transformer (or balun) is applied as the feeding structure of the
   antenna to provide impedance matching as well as balanced-unbalanced
   transition. The measurement results show that the proposed antenna
   operates over a frequency bandwidth of 0.64-3.8 GHz with S-11 < -15 dB
   and exhibits highly directive radiation patterns for the first 100\% of
   the operating bandwidth (0.64-2 GHz) with gains in the range 2.2-4.2

Abstract = {{This study introduces a chance constrained interval fuzzy robust dynamic
   programming (CCIFRDP) approach, which can effectively reflect uncertain,
   dynamic and interactive features of energy-environmental management
   systems, as well as assist in examining the reliability of satisfying
   (or risk of violating) system constraints under uncertainty. Within a
   multi-stage context, the CCIFRDP can facilitate dynamic analysis for
   capacity-expansion planning under different constraint-violation risk
   levels. The developed method has been applied to the planning for
   facility expansion and energy-flow allocation within a regional
   energy-environment system. The results indicate that reasonable
   solutions for both binary and continuous variables have been generated
   under different levels of constraint-violation risk. The obtained
   interval solutions are useful in generating decision alternatives, which
   represent various options for environmental-economic tradeoffs. The
   results can be used to generate decision alternatives and help managers

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to assess the effects of compaction

   from samples prepared using both methods were compared. Analyses
   included the measurement of green and sintered densities, tensile
   properties and microstructural analyses. Results indicated that sintered
   products of a largely comparable quality could be realised for both
   alloys regardless of the compaction approach employed. PM2324 displayed
   sensitivity to compaction pressure such that low values were preferred
   for cold isostatic pressing (CIP) whereas higher values yielded superior
   sintered products when die compaction was implemented. Conversely,
   compaction pressure had no meaningful impact on the sintering behaviour
   of PM7075 for CIP or die pressed samples.}},

Abstract = {{Sandwich structures have been studied extensively for planar structures;
   however, the use of composite tubing, manufactured by pultrusion, in a
   bending situation where a core material can contribute to take shear
   stresses, can find many applications in modern structures made of
   composite materials. The objective of this article is to develop
   analytical solutions for axial effective modulus and major Poisson's
   ratio of a pultruded unidirectional composite tubing filled with a core
   material. In this work, the unidirectional composite tubing and its core
   are considered to have transversely isotropic and isotropic properties,
   respectively. For the validation of the results, the obtained exact
   analytical solutions are reduced to a case where both the materials are
   isotropic and compared to the existing solutions for an isotropic
   material filling in an isotropic tube. Further validations of our exact
   analytical solutions for the transversely isotropic tubing and isotropic
   core are carried out employing a finite element analysis of the same
   structure, where the results show excellent agreements between the
   analytical solutions and the numerical results. Finally, a parametric
   study is conducted to investigate the variations in the effective
   properties of the two-phase composite cylinder based on the variations
   in the skin and/or core geometries and their material properties.}},

Abstract = {{Echo particle image velocimetry (Echo PIV) presents itself as an
   attractive in vivo flow quantification technique to traditional
   approaches. Promising results have been acquired; however, limited
   quantification and validation is available for post-stenotic flows. We
   focus here on the comprehensive evaluation of in vitro downstream
   stenotic flow quantified by Echo PIV and validated in relation to
   digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). A Newtonian blood analog was
   circulated through a closed flow loop and quantified immediately
   downstream of a 50 \% axisymmetric blockage at two Reynolds numbers (Re)
   using time-averaged Echo PIV and DPIV. Centerline velocities were in
   good agreement at all Re; however, Echo PIV measurements presented with
   elevated standard deviation (SD) at all measurements points. SD was
   improved using increased line density (LD); however, frame rate or field
   of view (FOV) is compromised. Radial velocity profiles showed close
   agreement with DPIV with the largest disparity in the shear layer and
   near-wall recirculation. Downstream recirculation zones were resolved by
   Echo PIV at both Re; however, magnitude and spatial coverage was reduced
   compared to DPIV that coincided with reduced contrast agent penetration
   beyond the shear layer. Our findings support the use of increased LD at
   a cost to FOV and highlight reduced microbubble penetration beyond the
   shear layer. High local SD at near-wall measurements suggests that
   further refinement is required before proceeding to in vivo
   quantification studies of wall shear stress in complex flow
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical dispersion of the time-domain radial point interpolation

   observation indicates that the RPIM method is a more general method and

Abstract = {{A meshless method with local radial basis functions is proposed for
   solving the time-domain electromagnetic wave equations. In comparison

   nodes, electric field nodes where electric fields are also collocated in
   space. With this feature, implementation complexity of the RPIM method
   is significantly reduced, and conformal modeling and muti-scale
   capabilities of the RPIM method can now be further explored with higher
   efficiency. The time-marching formulations of the proposed method are
   derived and stability analysis of the method is presented. Comparisons
   of the proposed method with the conventional meshless method are also

Abstract = {{The radiation by a submerged fluid-filled cylindrical shell in response
   to a transient external pressure pulse is considered, and a
   semi-analytical model based on the Reissner Mindlin shell theory is
   employed to simulate the interaction numerically. Two types of radiated
   waves that have been previously seen in experimental images for a
   submerged evacuated cylindrical shell are observed in both the external
   and internal fluids, the symmetric Lamb waves So and the antisymmetric
   Lamb (or pseudo-Rayleigh) waves Ao. The third type of radiated waves is
   also observed that has not been explicitly imaged either experimentally
   or numerically for a submerged evacuated cylindrical shell, and it is
   demonstrated that these waves are the Scholte Stoneley waves A. The
   effect that the complex structure of the radiated field has on the wave
   phenomena in the internal fluid is analyzed for shells of several
   different thicknesses, and the results of this analysis are summarized
   in the form of diagrams suitable for the use at the pre-design stage.

Abstract = {{A submerged fluid-filled cylindrical shell subjected to a sequence of
   two shock waves originated at the same source is considered. It is
   demonstrated that, unlike in the case of a submerged evacuated shell,
   there exists a certain critical range of the values of the delay between
   the incident wavefronts where both the peak compressive and the peak
   tensile stress observed in the structure are significantly (60\% or
   more) higher than the respective stresses in the same system subjected
   to a single-front loading. It is further demonstrated that the highest
   and the lowest hydrodynamic pressure attained in the system is also
   dramatically affected for certain values of the delay between the
   incident wavefronts, with the maximum double-front pressure being more
   than 30\% higher than its single-front counterpart. The practical
   relevance of the findings is discussed in the context of the predesign
   analysis of industrial systems subjected to shock loading. (C) 2014

Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{437-460}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A circular cylindrical shell loaded by one or two fluids and responding
   to an external shock wave is analyzed in the context of the possible
   inception of shock-induced cavitation. Several scenarios of fluid
   contact are considered including a submerged evacuated shell and a
   submerged fluid-filled shell for three different combinations of the
   parameters of the internal and external fluids. A semi-analytical
   shell-shock interaction model is employed in order to predict the
   regions of the fluids where cavitation is likely to occur, and the
   respective cavitation development is hypothesized about. The most
   interesting and practically important finding is that when fluid is
   present both inside and outside the shell, there exist conditions when
   cavitation is expected to occur in both the internal and external fluid,
   resulting in a particularly complex and violent structural re-loading
   occurring upon the collapse of the respective cavitation regions. The
   inception of cavitation in the internal fluid alone and in the external
   fluid alone is also possible. The findings are summarized in a manner
   that is suitable for use at the pre-design stage as a guide for
   preliminary assessment of the possibility of shock-induced cavitation in
   fluid-interacting industrial systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The viability of two solid adsorbents, limestone and cement powder, for

   neutralization following refrigerant destruction was studied.
   Neutralization tests performed at 408 K using 5\% HCl in N-2 and 5\% HF
   in N-2, showed that limestone had a significantly higher adsorption
   capacity for both HF and HCl. similar to 49\% of fed HCl, and between
   7.8\%-16.2\% of fed HF gases were adsorbed by 7 g of limestone for a gas
   flow rate of 6.67x10(-6) m(3)/s (STP) over 30 to 180 minutes. Effective
   diffusivities (D (e) ) of HCl and HF into the limestone particles were
   1.5x10(-9) and 2.2x10(-9) m(2)/s, respectively, indicating that a solid
   diffusion mechanism dominance would limit the suitability of this method
   as a solid adsorbent in the tested form. Under these conditions,
   complete particle conversion times were 227 hours for HCl-limestone and
   154 hours for HF-limestone. Considering the long conversion times
   observed, shorter conversion times would require micron-scale particle
   sizes, suitable for entrained flow but not for a packed-bed arrangement.
   A Na2CO3/Limestone slurry used to neutralize the reactor effluent proved
   efficient within this system, and may be a more suitable alternative for
   acid neutralization involving HF.}},

Abstract = {{Embolization of vascular tumors is an important tool in minimally

   a range of 45-500m. Three size ranges (45-150, 150-300, and 300-500m)
   were used in the current study. The glass microspheres were eluted in
   polar (saline solution) and non-polar (dimethyl sulfoxide) medium, and
   ion release profiles were recorded using inductively coupled plasma
   atomic emission spectroscopy. Approximately 80\% of Gaussian
   distribution was achieved by simple sieving. The ions released from the
   microspheres were dependent upon surface area to volume ratio as well as
   the nature of elution media. Greater ions were released from smaller
   particles (45-150m) having largest surface area in polar medium. For the
   genotoxicity bacterial mutation Ames assay, the concentrations of all
   the ions were well below their therapeutic concentration reported in the

Abstract = {{We investigated the presence of inflammatory signs in the progression of
   fatty liver disease induced by fasting. Sixty standard black American
   mink (Neovison vison) were fasted for 0, 1, 3, 5, or 7 days and one
   group for 7 days followed by re-feeding for 28 days. Liver sections were
   evaluated histologically and liver mRNA levels indicating endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) stress, adipogenic transformation, and inflammation were
   assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. After 3 days of fasting, the
   mink had developed moderate liver steatosis. Increased hyaluronan
   reactivity in lymphocytic foci but no Mallory-Denk bodies were seen in
   livers of the mink fasted for 5-7 days. Up-regulation of
   glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa was observed on day 7 indicating ER
   stress, especially in the females. Liver lipoprotein lipase and monocyte
   chemoattractant protein 1 mRNA levels increased in response to 5-7 days
   of food deprivation, while tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was
   the highest in the mink fasted for 5 days. The expression of the genes
   of interest, except for TNF-alpha, correlated with each other and with
   the liver fat content. The mRNA levels were found to change more rapidly
   below n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio threshold of 0.15.
   Following re-feeding, hepatocyte morphology and mRNA abundance returned
   to pre-fasting levels. Within the studied timeframe, evidence for ER
   stress, adipogenic transformation, and liver inflammation suggested
   incipient transition from steatosis to steatohepatitis with potential
   for development of more severe liver disease. This may present a
   possibility to influence disease progression before histologically
   observable steatohepatitis.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy produces rapid, non-pathological volume-overload in the
   maternal circulation due to the demands of the growing fetus. Using a
   bovine model for human pregnancy, previous work in our laboratory has
   shown remarkable pregnancy-induced changes in leaflet size and mechanics
   of the mitral valve. The present study sought to relate these changes to
   structural alterations in the collagenous leaflet matrix. Anterior
   mitral valve leaflets were harvested from non-pregnant heifers and
   pregnant cows (pregnancy stage estimated by fetal length). We measured
   changes in the thickness of the leaflet and its anatomic layers via
   Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining, and in collagen crimp (wavelength and
   percent collagen crimped) via picrosirius red staining and polarized
   microscopy. Collagen concentration was determined biochemically:
   hydroxyproline assay for total collagen and pepsin-acid extraction for
   uncrosslinked collagen. Small-angle light scattering (SALS) assessed
   changes in internal fiber architecture (characterized by degree of fiber
   alignment and preferred fiber direction). Pregnancy produced significant
   changes to collagen structure in the mitral valve. Fiber alignment
   decreased 17\% with an 11.5A degrees rotation of fiber orientation
   toward the radial axis. Collagen fiber crimp was dramatically lost,
   accompanied by a 53\% thickening of the fibrosa, and a 16\% increase in
   total collagen concentration, both suggesting that new collagen is being
   synthesized. Extractable collagen concentration was low, both in the
   non-pregnant and pregnant state, suggesting early crosslinking of
   newly-synthesized collagen. This study has shown that the mitral valve
   is strongly adaptive during pregnancy, with significant changes in size,
   collagen content and architecture in response to rapidly changing
   demands.}},

Abstract = {{Solar combisystems that are capable of providing space heating and
   cooling as well as domestic hot water heating present a promising
   alternative to conventional systems to achieve net zero energy status in
   residential buildings. To determine whether or not the performance of
   such systems would be suitable in the northerly Canadian context, a
   preliminary study was conducted to evaluate the thermal performance of a
   solar combisystem with space heating, cooling, domestic hot water
   heating and thermal storage capability for houses in the four climate
   regions of Canada (Atlantic, Central, Prairies and Pacific) based on
   simulations conducted using models developed within the TRNSYS 17.1
   energy simulation software. For days without sufficient sunshine,
   auxiliary heating and cooling systems are included. The operation of the
   solar combisystem and the auxiliary systems is controlled using a
   realistic control algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to
   determine effects of solar collector area and storage capacity on solar
   combisystem performance. The results show that solar combisystems can
   provide a substantial fraction of the space heating, cooling and
   domestic hot water heating energy requirement of a simple house in all
   major climatic regions of Canada. As to be expected, climatic conditions
   have an important impact on solar combisystem performance. The results
   also show that increasing solar collector area enhances solar fraction,
   and the solar fraction curve peaks at a specific storage capacity. Based
   on the favorable results found in this study, it is clear that further
   and more detailed studies are warranted on solar combisystem
   applications in Canada. The next step in this work will be a much more
   detailed evaluation using the Canadian Hybrid Residential Energy End-use
   and Emissions Model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Silage effluent management: A review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{113-122}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Silage effluent is a potent wastewater that can be produced when
   ensiling crops that have a high moisture content (MC). Silage effluent
   can cause fish kills and eutrophication due to its high biochemical
   oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrient content, respectively. It has a high
   acidity (pH approximate to 3.5-5) making it corrosive to steel and
   damaging to concrete, which makes handling, storage and disposal a
   challenge. Although being recognized as a concentrated wastewater, most
   research has focused on preventing its production. Despite noted
   imprecision in effluent production models and therefore limited ability
   to predict when effluent will flow there has been little research aimed
   at identifying effective reactive management options, such as
   containment and natural treatment systems. Increasing climate
   variability and intensifying livestock agriculture are issues that will
   place a greater importance on developing comprehensive, multi layered
   management strategies that include both preventative and reactive
   measures. This paper reviews important factors governing the production
   of effluent, approaches to minimize effluent flows as well as treatment
   and disposal options. The challenges of managing silage effluent are
   reviewed in the context of its chemical constituents. A multi-faceted
   approach should be utilized to minimize environmental risks associated
   with silage effluent. This includes: (i) managing crop moisture content
   prior to ensiling to reduce effluent production, (ii) ensuring the
   integrity of silos and effluent storages, and (iii) establishing
   infrastructure for effluent treatment and disposal. A more thorough
   investigation of constructed wetlands and vegetated infiltration areas
   for treating dilute silage effluent is needed. In particular, there
   should be efforts to improve natural treatment system design criteria by
   identifying pre treatment processes and appropriate effluent loading
   rates. There is also a need for research aimed at understanding the
   effects of repeated land application of effluent on soil quality and
   crop yields, as spreading is a common disposal practice. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Disposal of manure contaminated with Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV)
   is a significant concern to the mink industry. Inactivation of AMDV
   under field conditions has received limited attention in the scientific
   literature. We evaluated the thermal inactivation of AMDV in vitro and
   during composting of mink manure. Spleen homogenate containing AMDV was
   heated under controlled conditions at 45 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 65
   degrees C for 3 days. Results of the in vitro study identified complete
   absence of viral replication in mink at 65 degrees C only. Next,
   manure-mixed AMDV packed in polyester pouches was inserted in different
   layers of three replicate mink manure compost piles. The virus was
   retrieved after the compost piles had undergone a heating period and
   subsequently returned to ambient temperatures. Temperature regimes in
   the compost piles were categorized as >= 65 degrees C, >= 60-64 degrees
   C, and >= 55-59 degrees C. Initially, layer-wise composite virus samples
   were assayed for virus replication in mink. Twenty-one-day
   post-inoculation (p.i.) plasma tested for AMDV and antibodies indicated
   infection in 40\%, 80\%, and 100\% of mink inoculated from samples
   originating from the top, center and bottom layers of the piles,
   respectively. Subsequently, the virus was extracted from individual
   pouches in compost layers achieving thermal activity >= 65 degrees C and
   was tested in mink. No antibodies or virus was detected in plasma taken
   weekly up to day 21 p.i. PCR data of bone marrow and lymph nodes
   collected on day 21 p.i. also showed no AMDV. However, mink that
   received virus from positive control manure indicated infection in their
   plasma as early as 1 week p.i. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a rapidly developing additive
   manufacturing technique, with advantages in flexibility and low material
   waste. Many parameters used in a SLS process are determined by powder
   type: blended powders have limitations due to wetting and diffusion,
   while prealloyed powders require processing in a small temperature range
   dictated by the alloy composition. As an alternative to these, a coated
   powder was fabricated by electrochemical means. This tin-copper
   composite powder was compared with a blend of tin and copper powders,
   using metallographic, crystallographic, and thermal analysis techniques
   as well as SLS. It was found that, because of the uniform distribution
   of liquid and increased contact between phases in the composite powder,
   sintering took place in the composite powder but not in the blend. After
   a homogenization treatment, mechanical testing of the sintered samples
   showed that the strength and ductility were comparable to high-porosity
   materials produced using other techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Double-layered grating structures (DGSs) fabricated of gold (Au) and
   silver (Ag), respectively, are proposed for chem/biosensing in the
   midinfrared range. The geometry parameters of the DGS sensors are
   optimized using a rigorous coupled wave analysis method such that the
   minimum reflectance is obtained at an infrared wavelength of 4.8 mu or
   6.7 mu m. The magnetic field patterns and Poynting vector distributions
   within the optimized grating structures are examined using a
   finite-difference time-domain method. The simulation results show that
   for a resonant wavelength of 4.8 mu m, the Au and Ag sensors both have a
   sensitivity of 2000 nm/RIU (refractive index unit) and 3000 nm/RIU
   theoretical sensing resolution of 5 x 10(-6) RIU and of 1 x 10(-7) RIU,
   respectively. Similarly, for a resonant wavelength of 6.7 mu m, the two
   sensors have a sensitivity of around 200 nm/RIU and theoretical
   resolution of 5 x 10(-5) RIU. In other words, the sensitivity of the DGS
   sensors optimized for an infrared wavelength of 4.8 mu m is one order
   higher than that of the sensors optimized for a wavelength of 6.7 mu m.
   In general, the results presented in this paper show that the proposed
   DGS sensors provide a simple and versatile solution for performing
   chem/biosensing at midinfrared wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{Wild blueberry growers apply herbicides uniformly to control weeds
   within fields. The repeated and excessive use of herbicides in bare
   spots and blueberry plant areas that exist within fields has resulted in
   an increased cost of production and environmental contamination. A
   prototype variable rate (VR) sprayer was developed for spot-application
   (SA) of herbicides to the weeds. The boom was divided into 16 sections
   (0.76 m per section). The VR control system consisted of eight digital
   color cameras mounted on a separate boom in front of the tractor, a
   20-channel MidTech Legacy 6000 controller, and two 8-channel VR
   controllers (VRCs) interfaced to a Pocket PC (PPC) via wireless
   Bluetooth (R). Cameras were connected via USB cables to a computer. The
   cameras were capable of taking the images in real-time. Custom software
   was developed for processing the images to detect weeds in real-time.
   The triggering signals were sent to the VRC to open the specific nozzles
   where the weeds had been detected.
   The VR sprayer performed well and adequately sprayed propyzamide on red
   sorrel (Rumex acetosella L.) and flumioxazin on moss (Polytrichum
   commune) within the selected wild blueberry fields. Results of T-test
   from experiment 1 suggested that the percent area coverage of water
   sensitive papers in target and non-target areas after the flumioxazin
   application was significant indicating SA technique using VR sprayer
   accurately applied the flumioxazin on targets. SA from experiment 2
   resulted in a 69\% reduction in propyzamide use with 25 cm before and
   after target buffer and 28\% cover of red sorrel.}},

   energy problems to incorporate a variety of qualitative and quantitative
   criteria, usually spanning environmental, social, engineering, and
   economic fields. MCDA and associated methods such as life-cycle
   assessments and cost-benefit analysis can also include risk analysis to
   address uncertainties in criteria estimates. One technology now being
   assessed to help mitigate climate change is carbon capture and storage
   (CCS). CCS is a new process that captures CO2 emissions from
   fossil-fueled power plants and injects them into geological reservoirs
   for storage. It presents a unique challenge to decisionmakers (DMs) due
   to its technical complexity, range of environmental, social, and
   economic impacts, variety of stakeholders, and long time spans. The
   authors have developed a risk assessment model using a MCDA approach for
   CCS decisions such as selecting between CO2 storage locations and
   choosing among different mitigation actions for reducing risks. The
   model includes uncertainty measures for several factors, utility curve
   representations of all variables, Monte Carlo simulation, and
   sensitivity analysis. This article uses a CCS scenario example to
   demonstrate the development and application of the model based on data
   derived from published articles and publicly available sources. The
   model allows high-level DMs to better understand project risks and the
   tradeoffs inherent in modern, complex energy decisions.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents numerical simulations and experimental verification
   of a vibration-based damage detection technique. Health monitoring of a
   submerged pipe's girth-weld against an advancing notch is attempted.
   Piezoelectric transducers are bonded on the pipe for sensing or

   an impulsive force; (ii) using one of the piezoelectric transducers as
   an actuator to propagate chirp waves into the pipe. The methodology
   adopts the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which processes vibration
   data to establish energy-based damage indices. The results obtained from
   both the numerical and experimental studies confirm the integrity of the
   approach in identifying the existence, and progression of the advancing

Abstract = {{Area coverage with an onboard sensor is an important task for an
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with many applications. Autonomous
   fixed-wing UAVs are more appropriate for larger scale area surveying
   since they can cover ground more quickly. However, their non-holonomic
   dynamics and susceptibility to disturbances make sensor coverage a
   challenging task. Most previous approaches to area coverage planning are
   offline and assume that the UAV can follow the planned trajectory
   exactly. In this paper, this restriction is removed as the aircraft
   maintains a coverage map based on its actual pose trajectory and makes
   control decisions based on that map. The aircraft is able to plan paths
   in situ based on sensor data and an accurate model of the on-board
   camera used for coverage. An information theoretic approach is used that
   selects desired headings that maximize the expected information gain
   over the coverage map. In addition, the branch entropy concept
   previously developed for autonomous underwater vehicles is extended to
   UAVs and ensures that the vehicle is able to achieve its global coverage
   mission. The coverage map over the workspace uses the projective camera
   model and compares the expected area of the target on the ground and the
   actual area covered on the ground by each pixel in the image. The camera
   is mounted on a two-axis gimbal and can either be stabilized or
   optimized for maximal coverage. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation results
   and real hardware implementation on a fixed-wing UAV show the
   effectiveness of the approach. By including the already developed
   automatic takeoff and landing capabilities, we now have a fully
   automated and robust platform for performing aerial imagery surveys.}},

Abstract = {{A novel control scheme for asymmetric bilateral teleoperation systems is
   developed based on linear models of the hardware, with considerations in
   the existence of communication time delays. The master and slave
   manipulators were modeled as linear single degree of freedom systems.
   The human user force was modeled based on the band limited availability
   of human motion, and the environmental force was modeled as a spring and
   damper combination based on the slave position. The configuration of the
   whole system represents a relatively general framework for the
   teleoperation systems. The main contribution of the work can be
   concluded as follows. First to deal with asymmetric systems in
   teleoperation, an impedance matching approach was applied to the master
   side dynamics, while a static error feedback gain was used to stabilize
   the slave side dynamics. Second, in the existence of bounded random
   time-varying delays, approaches and techniques based on the Lyapunov
   method proposed for network controlled systems are now proposed for
   bilateral teleoperation systems. Specifically, a Lyapunov functional is
   proposed with consideration for the upper and lower bound of random
   delays. Linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques are used with rigorous
   stability proof to design the slave side controller control gains.
   Furthermore, the cone complementarity algorithm is used to deal with
   nonlinear terms within the LMI under the new formulation. Finally, the
   applications of the proposed algorithm to haptic devices are described
   thoroughly, and experimental results with comparisons to simulation
   results are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach.}},

   characterize the varying probability of the evolution of interphase
   debonding. Influences of debonding damage, particle volume fraction,

Abstract = {{Superelastic TiNi shape memory alloys have been extensively used in
   various applications. The great interest in TiNi alloys is due to its
   unique shape memory and superelastic effects, along with its superior
   wear and dent resistance. Assessment of mechanical properties and dent
   resistance of superelastic TiNi is commonly performed using indentation
   techniques. However, the coupling of deformation and reversible
   martensitic transformation of TiNi under indentation conditions makes
   the interpretation of results challenging. An attempt is made to enhance
   current interpretation of indentation data. A load-depth curve is
   predicted that takes into consideration the reversible martensitic
   transformation. The predicted curve is in good agreement with
   experimental results. It is found in this study that the elastic modulus
   is a function of indentation depth. At shallow depths, the elastic
   modulus is high due to austenite dominance, while at high depths, the
   elastic modulus drops as the depth increases due to austenite to
   martensite transition, i.e., martensite dominance. It is also found that
   TiNi exhibits superior dent resistance compared to AISI 304 steel. There
   is two orders of magnitude improvement in dent resistance of TiNi in
   comparison to AISI 304 steel.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the use of a photoelectrochemical chemical

   instrument feasibility. The study found that peCOD could accurately
   detect oxygen demand based on theoretical chemistry concepts (i.e.,
   theoretical oxygen demand). The next step in the study evaluated NOM
   removal in practice. Specifically, a drinking water plant survey found
   that the removal of NOM, as measured by peCOD, was approximately 3.5
   times greater than the removal using traditional NOM surrogates-e.g.,

   currents on each branch of radiator. The antenna provides band-notch
   functionality by embedding dumbbell-shaped slots within the radiator,

   low-profile antenna can easily be fabricated on a single layer of FR4
   substrate with dimensions of 26 x 31 x 1.6 mm(3). Good correlation is
   obtained between the simulated and measured results. The antenna
   operates across 2.8-11 GHz to fully satisfy Federal Communications

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are recently developed nanoparticles that
   are formed by stacks of short disk-like layers of graphite. They cost
   considerably less than their carbon nanotubes (CNTs) counterparts, and
   can be potentially used to generate multi-functional material systems.
   However, there are significant number of structural differences between
   GNPs and CNTs. It is therefore timely to review and optimize the current
   processing techniques used for generating GNP-nanocomposites. In this
   research, a scalable shear mixing approach (i.e., a three-roll mill) is
   utilized for achieving uniform dispersion of different fractions of GNPs
   in an epoxy resin. Then, the stiffness, electrical and thermal
   conductivity, and linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the
   resulting nanocomposites were evaluated. The as-processed nanocomposites
   exhibited significant improvement in their thermal properties, but a
   moderate increase in stiffness. The electrical percolation threshold of
   the nanocomposite occurred at higher concentration of GNP than that
   predicted by the available micromechanical models. This is attributed to
   the change in size of GNPs, which occurs as a result of manufacturing

Abstract = {{Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene markers were evaluated for their use as a
   microbial source tracking tool in a well characterized 750 ha
   agricultural watershed in Nova Scotia, Canada. Water quality monitoring
   was conducted following the validation of host-specific and universal
   Bacteroidales (AllBac) markers for their proficiency in this particular
   geographic region, which provided further evidence that these markers
   are geographically stable. Increasing Escherichia coli concentrations
   were positively correlated (p < 0.01) with concentrations of the AllBac
   marker in water samples, suggesting that this universal marker is more
   suited as a positive DNA control rather than as an indicator of recent
   fecal contamination. Ruminant (BacR) and bovine (CowM2) specific marker
   detection was associated with increased runoff due to precipitation in
   sub-watersheds putatively impacted by cattle farming, demonstrating that
   the BacR and CowM2 markers can be used to detect the recent introduction
   of fecal matter from cattle farming activities during rainfall events.
   However, the human associated marker (BacH) was only detected once in
   spite of numerous on-site residential wastewater treatment systems in
   the watershed, suggesting that this assay is not sensitive enough to
   detect this type of human sewage source. E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella
   spp. DNA was not detected in any of the 149 watershed samples; however,
   114 (76.5\%) of those samples tested positive for Campylobacter spp. No
   significant correlation (p > 0.05) was found between Campylobacter spp.
   presence and either E. coli or AllBac marker levels. Further studies
   should be conducted to assess the origins of Campylobacter spp. in these
   types of watersheds, and to quantify pathogen cell numbers to allow for
   a human health risk assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Glass polyalkenoate cements (GPC) comprising zinc borogermanate glass
   may have clinical potential as injectable bone cements. However
   significant improvements in setting characteristics are required, i.e.
   significant extension of working/setting times into clinical relevant
   ranges is required without compromising strength. Achieving such
   features may be possible via reducing the zinc to germanium ratio of
   such glasses coupled with an annealing process. The reactivity of
   non-annealed and annealed experimental glasses with Zn:Ge ratios between
   1:0.64 and 1:1.11 were compared by measuring GPC working times, setting
   times, and compressive strengths. The working and setting time results
   were impressive, and ranged from 2-15 and 5-31 min, respectively,
   influenced by both Zn:Ge ratio and annealing. Interestingly, abrupt and
   significant changes in handling properties were observed in both non
   annealed and annealed GPCs as the Zn:Ge ratio passed 1:1. The strongest
   composition comprised an annealed glass with a 1:0.74 ratio, which
   demonstrated 30 MPa at 1 day increasing to 39 MPa at 30 days. The
   influence of glass annealing on GPC strength was found to be
   compositionally dependent. These experimental GPCs demonstrated handling
   characteristics sufficient for use as injectable bone cements (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Indoor fine particles (FPs) are a combination of ambient particles that
   have infiltrated indoors, and particles that have been generated indoors
   from activities such as cooking. The objective of this paper was to
   estimate the infiltration factor (F-inf) and the ambient/non-ambient
   components of indoor FPs. To do this, continuous measurements were
   collected indoors and outdoors for seven consecutive days in 50
   non-smoking homes in Halifax, Nova Scotia in both summer and winter
   using DustTrak (TSI Inc) photometers. Additionally, indoor and outdoor
   gravimetric measurements were made for each 24-h period in each home,
   using Harvard impactors (HI). A computerized algorithm was developed to
   remove (censor) peaks due to indoor sources. The censored indoor/outdoor
   ratio was then used to estimate daily F(inf)s and to determine the
   ambient and non-ambient components of total indoor concentrations. F-inf
   estimates in Halifax (daily summer median = 0.80; daily winter median =
   0.55) were higher than have been reported in other parts of Canada. In
   both winter and summer, the majority of FP was of ambient origin (daily
   winter median = 59\%; daily summer median = 84\%). Predictors of the
   non-ambient component included various cooking variables, combustion
   sources, relative humidity, and factors influencing ventilation. This
   work highlights the fact that regional factors can influence the
   contribution of ambient particles to indoor residential concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{It has been recently found that nitinol (TiNi) alloy has superior wear
   resistance compared to other conventional materials. The stress-induced
   martensite transformation exhibited by this alloy contributes to its
   high wear resistance. Nitinol is characterized by shape memory and
   superelastic effect which occur due to reversible martensite
   transformation. The superelastic effect of TiNi alloy is characterized
   by large recoverable deformation associated with the reversible
   stress-induced martensite transformation. Understanding the tribological
   properties of superelastic TiNi under reciprocating wear helps to
   increase its utilization in application where high wear is expected. In
   the present study the tribological behavior of superelastic TiNi is
   studied using reciprocating wear tests. Wear tests were performed under
   various normal loads and frequencies. The effect of normal load,
   frequency and sliding distance on wear behavior of superelastic TiNi is
   investigated. Several effects were found to control the wear response
   under a range of normal load and reciprocating frequency. Abrasion,
   adhesion and delamination mechanisms were identified during wear. (C)

Abstract = {{The wild blueberry industry is facing increased harvesting losses with
   the existing commercial harvester. These machines are no longer able to
   efficiently harvest the higher yields that result from improvements in
   plant growth and productivity. This study was designed to evaluate the
   performance efficiency of a commercial wild blueberry harvester for
   fruit losses during harvesting. Four wild blueberry fields were selected
   in the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick provinces of Canada. A 3 x 3
   factorial experiment was constructed to examine the joint effect of
   ground speed and header revolution per minute (rpm) on picking
   efficiency of the harvester. Eighty-one yield plots (0.91 x 3 m) were
   selected randomly in each field. The field boundaries, bare spots,
   weeds, and yield plots were mapped with a real-time kinematics global
   positioning system (RTK-GPS). The harvester was operated at specific
   levels of ground speed at 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 km h(-1) and header rpm of
   26, 28 and 30. The total fruit yield, un-harvested berries on the
   plants, berries on the ground, and berries through the blower, were
   collected from each plot within the selected fields. The pre-harvest
   fruit losses were collected from each plot prior to harvest. The
   treatment combinations were assigned randomly within the selected
   fields. The slope, plant height, and fruit zone were also recorded
   manually from each plot.
   Results indicated that the pre-harvest fruit losses were lower in early
   season compared to those harvested later. Un-harvested berries on the
   plants and losses through the blower were significantly lower than
   losses on the ground. Significant relationship among the fruit yield and
   total losses (r = 0.54 to 0.82) suggested that losses during harvesting
   were proportional to fruit yield. A factorial analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) showed that ground speed, header rpm, and their interaction were
   found to have significant (p = 0.05) effects on the picking efficiency
   of the harvester. Results of means comparison showed that a combination
   of 1.2 km h(-1) and 26 rpm resulted in significantly lower losses when
   compared with other treatment combinations. Results also revealed that a
   suitable combination of ground speed and header rpm can minimize the
   fruit losses during harvesting. This can increase harvestable yield and
   farm profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, fertilizer is applied uniformly in wild blueberry (Vaccinium
   angustifolium. Ait) fields, once in a two year production cycle, without
   considering substantial variation in soil/plant characteristics,
   topographic features, and fruit yield. The heavy rainfall, gentle to
   severe topography with high proportion of bare spots, and weed patches
   in wild blueberry fields emphasizes the need for variable rate split
   (VRS) fertilization to avoid environmental contamination. Two commercial
   wild blueberry fields were selected in central Nova Scotia to examine
   the impact of VRS fertilization on ammonia volatilization losses.
   Management zones (MZs) were delineated based on slope variation within
   the selected fields (steep slope (Zone-1), moderate slope (Zone-2), and
   low slope areas (Zone-3)). The fields were divided into two sections
   (VRS section and uniform rate (UR) section). Global positioning system
   (GPS) guided prescription maps based on slope variation were generated
   in ArcGIS 10 software to apply fertilizer in both fields. In VRS
   section, fertilizer was applied three times with commercial variable
   rate (VR) fertilizer spreader in Zone-1, Zone-2, and Zone-3 with
   fertilization rates of 66, 50, 33, and kg ha(-1), respectively. Single
   uniform grower's fertilizer rate (200 kg ha(-1)) was applied in UR
   sections of the selected fields for comparison. The ammonia
   volatilization trials were established under VRS and UR fertilized
   sections of the selected fields immediately following the fertilization.
   The ammonia volatilization samples were collected after each
   fertilization in VRS sections and once in UR sections. The samples were
   analyzed for ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentrations. Leaf samples
   were collected in third week of July at tip-dieback stage and analyzed
   for leaf nutrient concentrations. The results of repeated measure
   analysis of variance showed ammonia volatilization losses were
   significantly (p < 0.05) lower in VRS sections as compared to uniformly
   fertilized sections of the selected fields. Secondly, the study found
   that the leaf nutrient concentrations were not reduced using VRS
   fertilization. Results of this study also indicated that the VRS
   fertilization improved the nitrogen use efficiency and reduced the
   ammonia volatilization in wild blueberry fields.}},

Abstract = {{The necessary conditions for a dust explosion to occur are
   well-expressed by the explosion pentagon: (i) fuel, (ii) oxidant, (iii)
   ignition source, (iv) mixing of the fuel and oxidant, and (v)
   confinement of the resulting mixture. While it might seem relatively
   straightforward to prevent or mitigate a dust explosion by simply
   removing one of the pentagon elements, the field of dust explosion risk
   reduction is more complex. Building upon previous work by the author and
   other dust explosion researchers, the theme of the current paper is that
   this complexity is partially rooted in several erroneous beliefs. These
   beliefs ignore the realities found with full consideration of
   appropriate scientific and engineering principles. Several such myths
   and their factual counterparts are presented with an illustrative
   example. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new grinding wheel grooving system is proposed that is
   able to both groove as well as re-groove a grinding wheel using a
   single-point diamond dressing tool. The re-grooving capability of the
   new system is achieved by synchronizing the grinding wheel angular
   position with the dressing tool translational position. This position
   synchronization enables the diamond dressing tip to repeatedly engage
   the grinding wheel at the same angular position around the wheel and
   then proceed to trace the existing groove pattern along the wheel
   surface to, for example, refresh a worn groove geometry. Furthermore,
   the proposed system can be mounted on either a non-CNC or a CNC
   conventional grinding machine and can groove and re-groove the grinding
   wheel without the need to remove it from the grinding wheel spindle. The
   novel wheel grooving system was experimentally validated by creating
   helically shaped circumferential grooves on the grinding wheel surface.
   The resulting maximum differences in groove width and depth were found
   to be 0.015 and 0.013 mm, respectively, for ten consecutively cut
   grooves. These small discrepancies are believed to be primarily due to
   the brittle fracture mechanism of the abrasive grits. Furthermore, the
   new wheel grooving system was shown to be able to create a wide range of
   different groove patterns on the wheel surface. A wear study was then
   carried out to compare the performance of both grooved and non-grooved
   grinding wheels. For the conditions used in this research, the results
   of this wear study showed that a grooved wheel not only exhibits less
   wear than a non-grooved wheel but also can remove approximately twice as
   much workpiece material before failure occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) loading from residential onsite wastewater systems (OWSs)
   into neighboring surface waters is a poorly understood process in rural
   watersheds; this can be further challenged when rural residential
   dwellings are intermixed with agricultural land use. The objectives of
   this research were (i) to design a P onsite wastewater simulator
   (POWSIM) to assess P loads from individual or clusters of residential
   OWSs typically used in Nova Scotia, Canada; and (ii) to simulate OWS P
   loads in a mixed agricultural watershed (Thomas Brook Watershed {[}TBW],
   NS) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in conjunction
   with POWSIM, to predict and compare P loading from agricultural and
   residential sources. The POWSIM loading tool has three computational
   components: (i) disposal field selection and treatment media mass
   calculation, (ii) disposal field P treatment dynamics, and (iii) soil
   subsurface plume P treatment dynamics. The combination TBW POWSIM and
   SWAT modeling approach produced a better simulation of baseflow total P
   (TP) loads in both a predominantly residential subcatchment and one
   dominated by agriculture than the SWAT model without POWSIM. The
   residential subcatchment had 48\% of its average annual land use TP load
   (simulated) contributed by OWSs, whereas the agricultural subcatchment
   had 39\%. Watershed-scale sensitivity analyses of POWSIM input
   parameters for 18- and 50-yr OWS operation periods found the P loading
   rate into the disposal field, long-term P removal rates in the disposal
   field and soil systems, soil maximum P sorption capacity, and mass of
   native soil involved in P treatment to be most sensitive.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of hollow beams with a long focal depth from a radially
   polarized Bessel-Gaussian beam with a second-order vortex phase and an
   amplitude filter is theoretically investigated by Richards-Wolf's
   integral. The null intensity on the optical axis is achieved by
   introducing the second-order vortex. The long focal depth is a result of
   the amplitude filtering based on the cosine function and Euler
   transformation. Numerical results indicate that the focal depth of a
   hollow beam is improved from 0.96 lambda to 2.28 lambda with a slight
   increase of the transverse size for the simplest amplitude filter
   design. The intensity distribution twist phenomenon of the x- and
   y-polarized components around the optical axis due to the introducing of
   the vortex phase is also discussed. It is believed that the proposed
   scheme can be used to achieve particle acceleration and optical
   trapping. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous chlorination kinetics of the lipid regulator gemfibrozil and the
   formation of reaction products were investigated in deionized water over
   the pH range 3 to 9, and in two wastewater matrices. Chlorine oxidation
   of gemfibrozil was found to be highly dependent on pH. No statistically
   significant degradation of gemfibrozil was observed at pH values greater
   than 7. Gemfibrozil oxidation between pH 4 and 7 was best represented by
   first order kinetics. At pH 3, formation of three reaction products was
   observed. 4'-ClGem was the only reaction product formed from pH 4-7 and
   was modeled with zero order kinetics. Chlorine oxidation of gemfibrozil
   in two wastewater matrices followed second order kinetics. 4'-ClGem was
   only formed in wastewater with pH below 7. Deionized water rate kinetic
   models were applied to two wastewater effluents with gemfibrozil
   concentrations reported in literature in order to calculate potential
   mass loading rates of 4'ClGem to the receiving water.}},

   on sinter quality were investigated. A comparison with conventionally
   processed PM counterparts was also conducted. Applied pressure and
   ultimate processing temperature bore the greatest influence on
   processing, while heating rate and hold time showed a minor effect. Full
   density specimens were achieved for both powders under select processing
   conditions. To compliment this, large (80 mm) and small (20 mm) diameter
   samples were made to observe possible up-scaling effects, as well as
   tensile properties. Large samples were successfully processed, albeit
   with somewhat inferior densities to the smaller counterparts presumably
   due to the temperature inhomogeneity during processing. An investigation
   of tensile properties for SPS samples exhibited extensive ductility
   (similar to 30\%) at high sintering temperatures, while lower
   temperature SPS samples as well as all PM processed samples exhibited a
   brittle nature. The measurement of residual oxygen and hydrogen contents
   showed a significant elimination of both species in SPS samples under
   certain processing parameters when compared to conventional PM
   equivalents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two-region fin model captures the heat spreading behaviour in
   multilayered composite bodies (i.e., laminates), heated only over a
   small part of their domains (finite heat source), where there is an
   inner layer that has a substantial capacity for heat conduction parallel
   to the heat exchange surface (convection cooling). This resulting heat
   conduction behaviour improves the overall heat transfer process when
   compared to heat conduction in homogeneous bodies. Long-term heat
   storage using supercooling salt hydrate phase change materials, stovetop
   cookware, and electronics cooling applications could all benefit from
   this kind of heat-spreading in laminates. Experiments using laminate
   films reclaimed from post-consumer Tetra Brik cartons were conducted
   with thin rectangular and circular heaters to confirm the laminate body,
   steady-state, heat conduction behaviour predicted by the two-region fin
   model. Medium to high accuracy experimental validation of the two-region
   fin model was achieved in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates for
   forced external convection and natural convection, the latter for
   Cartesian only. These were conducted using constant heat flux finite
   heat source temperature profiles that were measured by infrared
   thermography. This validation is also deemed valid for constant
   temperature heat sources.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{114-122}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the fatigue fracture of steel pipes, each consisting of
   an inclined semi-elliptical crack, subjected to axial loading is
   investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The inclined angle
   of the crack with respect to the axis of loading varies between 0
   degrees and 90 degrees. On a microscopic scale, in fact, the fracture
   surface is not smooth indeed, as asperities, which are related to
   microstructure details, are developed. The mutual sliding interactions
   of these asperities result in a pressure and a frictional stress field
   between the fracture surfaces. In the present investigation, a new crack
   growth model, which accounts for the fracture surface interaction
   effects on the crack growth, is proposed. The fracture surface is
   considered in a form of a factory roof, with asperity height of h and
   wavelength of lambda. Subsequently, this proposed model is applied to
   predict fatigue crack growth in steel pipes under complex stress states.

Abstract = {{The effect of strain rate on the mechanical behavior of epoxy reinforced

   containing various amounts of GNP are prepared and tested at four
   different strain rates (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10/s) under compressive and
   tensile loading regimes. The results show that incorporation of GNP
   highly affects the behavior of epoxy. The fracture surfaces of tensile
   specimens are also investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   to discern the surface features and dispersion state of GNP. Finally,
   the predictive capability of some of the available models for evaluating
   the strength of nanocomposites are assessed and compared against the
   experimental results. Moreover, a modification factor to the widely used
   Halpin-Tsai model is proposed to improve the accuracy of the model when
   evaluating the Young's modulus of nanocomposites at various strain
   rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lymph flow is the primary mechanism for returning interstitial fluid to

   sought to determine the functional responses of postnodal mesenteric

   create mesenteric venous hypertension to elevate mesenteric lymph flow.
   Three days after surgery, postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels from
   mesenteric venous hypertension (MVH; n = 7) and sham surgery (Sham; n =
   6) group animals were evaluated and compared. Contraction frequency
   (MVH: 2.98 +/- 0.75 min(-1); Sham: 5.42 +/- 0.81 min(-1)) and fractional
   pump flow (MVH: 1.14 +/- 0.30 min(-1); Sham: 2.39 +/- 0.32 min(-1)) were
   significantly lower in the venous occlusion group. These results

   rigid core}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{215-225}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{A submerged fluid-filled cylindrical shell containing a rigid co-axial
   core and subjected to an external shock wave is considered, and the
   fluid dynamics of such interaction is analyzed for the most general
   scenario of two different fluids. It is demonstrated that the
   phenomenology of the interaction in this case is fundamentally different
   from the case when the fluids are identical. In the latter case, all the
   most important wave propagation, reflection and focusing phenomena in
   the internal fluid that are observed for the shell without a core are
   also present when a core is placed inside the fluid, unless the core
   directly occupies the region of the fluid where the phenomena occur.
   When the fluids are different, however, it is possible that some
   phenomena are not observed even when the core does not occupy the
   respective region of the fluid. Due to the very high pressure that is
   often associated with the phenomena in question, this observation is of
   considerable practical significance in that it suggests the possibility
   of a very significant reduction of the peak pressure in the system by
   means of placing an additional structure inside the primary shell. The
   observations made are quantified using a number of pressure
   time-histories aimed at facilitating the pre-design analysis of
   shock-subjected fluid-interacting structures. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We present results of investigations into a low-frequency vibration mode
   (LVM) in {[}001] poled Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-PbTiO3 crystal. Through a
   series of impedance measurement and polarization microscopy observations
   of domain structure, we find that the LVM is a shear mode arising from a
   polarization component lying in the (001) plane. Through quenching, a
   metastable state can be reached where the LVM is greatly enhanced and
   the thickness vibration mode of the typical poled state is highly
   suppressed. Measurements on the transverse vibration modes of
   differently oriented crystal samples show that the LVM state possesses a
   macroscopic orthorhombic symmetry (mm2) with its polarization vector
   along the {[}110] direction. The structural differences between the
   LVM-enhanced state and the usual poled state are discussed in detail.
   The two states have the same crystalline phase but different
   ferroelectric domain structures. When heated above the
   rhombohedral-to-tetragonal transition temperature, T-rt, a tetragonal
   phase with (110) domain walls is formed. This domain structure can be
   frozen by the rapid quenching through the Trt. Based on compatibility of
   ferroelectric polarizations at domain walls, and observed polarization
   microscopy results, we are able to infer the possible arrangement of
   domain structures in rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. The {[}110]
   polarization component associated with LVM originates from the domain
   structure with well-organized (110) domain walls. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{At high concentration or in the presence of electrolytes and organic

   phases. In an attempt to pattern such a gel phase, we have studied the
   electrodissolution of a metallic electrode in a water suspension of
   carboxylated CNCs (cCNCs). Depending on the metal used, the
   electrodissolution process was observed at a different positive
   potential. In the case of copper the minimum potential at which we could
   observe optically the growth of the gel phase was 200 mV. The growth
   rate was current limited indicating that the process was controlled by
   the electrodissolution of the copper electrode. This hypothesis was
   confirmed by using circular and square copper patterns as positive
   electrodes. In both cases, the consumption of the electrode material was
   observed optically and correlated with the growth of the gel phase.}},

Abstract = {{The recent research in Body Area Networks (BANs) is focused on making

   network traffic load, energy consumption, and improves BAN reliability.
   The three scenarios with fixed and variable number of packets sent by
   source nodes are considered for better analysis. Static nodes are
   considered in first and second scenarios whereas mobile nodes are used
   in third scenario. We have performed extensive simulations in the
   OMNeT++ based Castalia-3.2 simulation environment to show that our
   proposed protocol has better performance in terms of reduced BAN traffic
   load, increased successful transmission rate, reduced number of packets
   forwarded by intermediate nodes, no packets dropped due to buffer
   overflow, and overall lower energy consumption when compared with a
   similar protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Domino effects are low-probability high-consequence accidents causing
   severe damage to humans, process plants, and the environment. Because
   domino effects affect large areas and are difficult to control,
   preventive safety measures have been given priority over mitigative
   measures. As a result, safety distances and safety inventories have been
   used as preventive safety measures to reduce the escalation probability
   of domino effects. However, these safety measures are usually designed
   considering static accident scenarios. In this study, we show that
   compared to a static worst-case accident analysis, a dynamic consequence
   analysis provides a more rational approach for risk assessment and
   management of domino effects. This study also presents the application
   of Bayesian networks and conflict analysis to risk-based allocation of
   chemical inventories to minimize the consequences and thus to reduce the
   escalation probability. It emphasizes the risk management of chemical
   inventories as an inherent safety measure, particularly in existing
   process plants where the applicability of other safety measures such as
   safety distances is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing humankind.
   Mitigating climate change will require a suite of actions to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a new
   technology aimed at mitigating climate change by capturing and storing
   carbon dioxide, typically in deep geological reservoirs. CCS has risks
   characteristic of new technologies, as well as risks unique to this
   technology and its application. Large-scale CCS decision making is
   complex, encompassing environmental, social, and economic considerations
   and requiring the risks to be taken into consideration. CCS projects
   have been cancelled as a result of inadequate assessments of risks. To
   date, studies assessing CCS have been limited mostly to environmental,
   social, and economic fields in isolation from each other, predominantly
   using life cycle assessments (LCAs), cost benefit analyses (CBAs), or
   surveys of public perception. LCAs, CBAs, and surveys of public
   perception all have limitations for assessing difficult multifaceted
   problems. Incompatibilities across CCS assessment methods have hindered
   the comparison of the results across these single-discipline studies and
   limited the possibility of drawing broader conclusions about CCS
   development. More standardization across assessment methods, study
   assumptions, functional units, and assessment criteria for CCS could be
   beneficial to the integration of multiple study results. We propose a
   set of criteria, which decision analysts could use to develop
   CCS-project-specific criteria lists in order to comprehensively assess a
   CCS project's viability. This list was created by determining the
   frequency of use of each criterion in recent studies, with a focus on
   their use across disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to fabricate double-walled
   poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres to increase encapsulation
   efficiency and avoid rapid release of hydrophilic drugs such as
   meglumine antimoniate.
   Methods: In this study, double-walled and one-layered microspheres of
   PLGA were prepared using the emulsion solvent evaporation technique to
   better control the release of a hydrophilic drug, meglumine antimoniate
   (Glucantime (R)), which is the first choice treatment of cutaneous
   leishmaniasis. The effect of hydrophobic coating on microspheres' size,
   morphology, encapsulation efficiency and drug release characteristics
   was evaluated. Furthermore, the presence of antimony in meglumine
   antimoniate made it possible to observe the drug distribution within the
   microspheres' cross section by means of energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy.
   Results: Drug distribution images confirmed accumulation of the drug
   within the inner core of double-walled microspheres. In addition, these
   microspheres encapsulated the drug more efficiently up to 87\% and
   demonstrated reduced initial burst and prolonged release compared to
   one-layered microspheres. These superiorities make double-walled
   microspheres an optimum candidate for sustained delivery of hydrophilic
   drugs.
   Conclusion: Double-walled microspheres provide some advantages over
   traditional microspheres overcoming most of their limitations.
   Double-walled microspheres were found to be more efficient than their
   corresponding one-layered microspheres in terms of encapsulation
   efficiencies and release characteristics.}},

   reductions depend largely on the size of the housing stock, existing

Abstract = {{The sudden appearance of toxic cyanobacteria (CB) blooms is still
   largely unpredictable in waters worldwide. Many post-hoc explanations
   for CB bloom occurrence relating to physical and biochemical conditions
   in lakes have been developed. As potentially toxic CB can accumulate in
   drinking water treatment plants and disrupt water treatment, there is a
   need for water treatment operators to determine whether conditions are
   favourable for the proliferation and accumulation of CB in source waters
   in order to adjust drinking water treatment accordingly. Thus, a new
   methodology with locally adaptable variables is proposed in order to
   have a single index, f(p), related to various environmental factors such
   as temperature, wind speed and direction. The index is used in
   conjunction with real time monitoring data to determine the probability
   of CB occurrence in relation to meteorological factors, and was tested
   at a drinking water intake in Missisquoi Bay, a shallow transboundary
   bay in Lake Champlain, Quebec, Canada. These environmental factors alone
   were able to explain a maximum probability of 68\% that a CB bloom would
   occur at the drinking water treatment plant. Nutrient limitation also
   influences CB blooms and intense blooms only occurred when the dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) mass ratio was below
   3. Additional monitoring of DIN and TP could be considered for these
   source waters prone to cyanobacterial blooms to determine periods of
   favourable growth. Real time monitoring and the use of the index could
   permit an adequate and timely response to CB blooms in drinking water
   sources. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue crack growth rate of 6061 T651 aluminum alloy centre-cracked
   plates, subject to a variable amplitude loading (VAL), is established
   using a coupled analytical/computational approach. The method utilises
   the generalised Willenborg retardation model in conjunction with the
   Walker model, with several of the models parameters obtained through
   nonlinear finite element analyses. A two-parameter approach is also used
   in this study to explore the influence of compressive stress cycles in a
   VAL scenario on the crack tip opening displacement, and in turn, on the
   resulting fatigue crack growth rate of the material. The work includes
   the evaluation of the crack tip opening displacement and residual
   stresses in the vicinity of a crack by nonlinear finite element
   analysis, and application of the Generalised Willenborg model to
   evaluate the fatigue crack growth; particularly, under the influence of
   the compressive stress cycles, tensile overloads and underloads have
   been investigated. The finite element analysis results are compared with
   the experimental results reported in earlier studies by the authors.
   The results further demonstrate two important phenomena, that is, (i)
   the influence of FCG retardation effects due to the tensile overloads
   and (ii) the acceleration effect due to the applied compressive
   underloads of a VAL stress-time history.}},

   recognized by the Japanese aborigines as the ``elixir of life.{''} Due
   to their recent arrival on the North American market, haskap berries
   have not yet been positioned among other berries and compared in terms
   of their phytochemical content. Haskap berries have higher ascorbic acid
   and anthocyanin content than other berries known for their
   health-promoting benefits, such as blueberries. In this article, we give
   a brief description of the phytochemical content and limitations of
   current methods used for their quantification, as well as a critical
   review of the techniques available to assess the antioxidant capacity of
   haskap extract in comparison to other berries. We then present results
   from recent studies with haskap extracts used in in vitro (bacterial and
   human cell cultures), preclinical trials (in animal models), and a
   first-in-human study to assess the implications for human health.
   Finally, we discuss current commercial products and the potential of

Title = {{Ecological risk assessment of nonylphenol in coastal waters of China
   based on species sensitivity distribution model}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},

Abstract = {{Nonylphenol (NP) is an endocrine disruptor and causes feminization and
   carcinogenesis in various organisms. Consequently, the environmental
   distribution and ecological risks of NP have received wide concern.
   China accounts for approximately 10\% of the total NP usage in the
   world, but the water quality criteria of NP have not been established in
   China and the ecological risks of this pollutant cannot be properly
   assessed. This study thus aims to determine the predicted no effect
   concentration (PNEC) of NP and to assess the ecological risks of NP in
   coastal waters of China with the PNEC as water quality criteria. To
   obtain the HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5\% of biological species)
   and PNEC estimates, the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) models
   were built with chronic toxicity data of NP on aquatic organisms
   screened from the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) ECOTOX
   database. The results showed that the PNEC for NP in freshwater and
   seawater was 0.48 mu g L-1 and 0.28 mu g L-1, respectively. The RQ (risk
   quotient) values of NP in coastal waters of China ranged from 0.01 to
   69.7. About 60\% of the reported areas showed a high ecological risk
   with an RQ value >= 1.00. NP therefore exists ubiquitously in coastal
   waters of China and it poses various risks to aquatic ecosystems in the
   country. This study demonstrates that the SSD methodology can provide a
   feasible tool for the establishment of water quality criteria for
   emergent new pollutants when sufficient toxicity data is available. (c)

Volume = {{273}},
Pages = {{85-93}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{The fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater
   treatment systems is an area of increasing concern. Little research has
   been done to understand this issue in rural or decentralized
   communities. The objective of this research was to examine the ability
   of a bench scale nitrifying recirculating biofilter (RBF) to remove four
   acidic PhACs: gemfibrozil, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from
   secondary treated municipal wastewater at concentrations of 20 and 200
   mu g/L. The average removals in this study were between 92 and 99\% for
   ibuprofen, 89 and 99\% for naproxen, 62 and 92\% for gemfibrozil and 40
   and 76\% for diclofenac, which is consistent with literature. Ibuprofen
   and naproxen were largely removed through biological transformation;
   whereas gemfibrozil and diclofenac showed more variable removal, likely
   due to both biological transformation and sorption processes. PhAC
   removal in the RBFs was repeatable between trials, robust and responsive
   to system upsets, and the presence of PhACs as a single compound versus
   mixtures had no impact on PhAC removal efficiency. In summary, this
   study indicates that RBFs as a nitrifying stage of a multi-stage
   filtration process could be a viable technology for removal of some
   acidic pharmaceuticals in small onsite wastewater treatment facilities.

Abstract = {{We demonstrated the application of relative radiance-based continuous

   properties (the effective attenuation coefficient, the diffusion
   coefficient, the absorption coefficient and the reduced scattering

   range. Both the side-firing fiber (the detector) and the fiber with a
   spherical diffuser at the end (the source) were inserted interstitially
   at predetermined locations in the phantom. The porcine phantoms were
   prostate- shaped with similar to 4 cm in diameter and similar to 3 cm
   thickness and made from porcine loin or tenderloin muscles. The
   described method was previously validated using the diffusion
   approximation on simulated and experimental radiance data obtained for
   homogenous Intralipid-1\% liquid phantom. The approach required
   performing measurements in two locations in the tissue with different
   distances to the source. Measurements were performed on 21 porcine
   phantoms. Spectral dependences of the effective attenuation and
   absorption coefficients for the loin phantom deviated from corresponding
   dependences for the tenderloin phantom for wavelengths < 750 nm. The
   diffusion constant and the reduced scattering coefficient were very
   close for both phantom types. To quantify chromophore presence, the plot
   for the absorption coefficient was matched with a synthetic absorption
   spectrum constructed from deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin and water. The
   closest match for the porcine loin spectrum was obtained with the

   quality guidelines. Furthermore, in comparison with the fish standards,
   the studied fish species were not found to be contaminated by heavy
   metals. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis demonstrated
   that the wastewater from the numerous industries and the domestic
   sewages around the DEPZ might have a possible impact on heavy metals
   contamination in the study area. The Pearson correlation analysis showed
   significant correlations (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) between most of the
   metals in the samples of effluents, water, sediments, and fish muscles.
   The percentage enrichment factor (EF\%) and geo-accumulation index
   (I-geo) were followed to evaluate metal contamination in the sediment
   samples. Dhalaibeel sediment was maximally enriched for Cr (53.55\%) and
   Bangshi River sediment for Zn (54.37\%). The geo-accumulation index
   values for the sediment samples were less than zero, indicating that the
   sediment samples were free from contamination. This study could be used
   as a model study to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on
   heavy metals contamination in aquatic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of chelation of three alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba)
   by polyphosphates on the pH and viscosity of the solution is examined
   and correlated to the phosphate glass properties. Also, the impact of
   the polyphosphate average degree of polymerization ((D-p) over bar) as
   well as the type and amount of chelated divalent cation on the
   degradation rate of the chains is studied. Subsequently, the number of
   divalent cations required for polyphosphate chain agglomeration to form
   a coacervate, and the resulting composition of these coacervates, was
   investigated. A decrease in polyphosphate solution pH during chelation
   was routinely obtained, with a sudden shift in the rate of pH drop
   occurring around a divalent cation/phosphorus molar ratio of 0.18.
   Longer chains or cations with a smaller ionic radius accelerated the
   rate of (D-p) over bar reduction. The number of divalent cations
   required for coacervation depends on different variables such as the
   polyphosphate concentration, the (D-p) over bar, and the type of
   divalent cation. The formed coacenrate retains the (D-p) over bar of
   polyphosphate originally used for coacervation, and the resulting Ca/P
   molar ratio depends largely on the amount of calcium being used during
   coacervation. Overall, this article helps one to understand the
   coacervation of polyphosphates in order to exploit their potential as a
   biomaterial.}},

Abstract = {{The canine prostate is a close match for the human prostate and is used
   in research of prostate cancers. Determining accurately optical
   absorption and scattering properties of the gland in a wide spectral
   range (preferably in a minimally invasive way), linking optical
   properties to concentrations of major endogenous chromophores, and
   detecting the presence of localized optical inhomogeneities like
   inclusions of gold nanoparticles for therapeutic and diagnostic
   purposes, are among the major challenges for researchers. The goal of
   the article is to demonstrate a feasibility of the multifunctional
   radiance spectroscopy platform in providing the required information.
   For ex vivo canine prostate, extraction of the effective attenuation and
   diffusion coefficients using relative cw radiance measurements was
   demonstrated in the 650- to 900-nm range. The derived absorption
   coefficient was decomposed to contributions from 9.0 mu M HbO(2), 29.6
   mu M Hb, and 0.47 fractional volume of H2O. Detection of a localized
   inclusion containing similar to 1.5 . 10(10) gold nanorods (0.8 mu g Au)
   at 10 mm distance from the urethra was achieved with the detector in the
   urethra and the light source in a virtual rectum position. The platform
   offers the framework for a systematic study of various chromophores in
   the prostate that can be used as comprehensive diagnostic markers. (C)

Journal = {{INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{253-267}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss a hierarchical production planning approach to
   schedule ice cream production, a continuous batch production process
   with sequence-dependent setup times and highly seasonal demand. We use
   mixed-integer linear programming models to optimize production plans for
   long-, medium-, and short-term planning. The long-term model, the
   monthly model, is used to plan aggregate production and inventory levels
   for the year to meet demand each month at the lowest cost possible. The
   medium-term model, the weekly model, is used to disaggregate the
   long-term plan to minimize weekly setup and holding costs over a 13-week
   period. The short-term model, the daily model, is a detailed scheduling
   model that determines an optimal daily production sequence for the
   products and run lengths determined by the second model, while meeting
   the labor schedule defined by the first model for the upcoming
   production week. When used together, the three decision models produce
   feasible results at each stage, and short-term operations reflect the
   goals of the long-term plan. Synchronizing the model breakdown with
   Scotsburn's management hierarchy provides support at each
   decision-making level. The hierarchical plan reduces costs, improves
   production efficiency, and creates better linkages between the decisions
   of each management level.}},

Title = {{Sheep's wool insulation: A sustainable alternative use for a renewable
   resource?}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{9-15}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Material selection in manufacturing may be characterized as a series of
   trade-offs between characteristics, properties, environmental impacts,
   sustainability, availability, and economics. Societal concerns about the
   environmental impacts of construction practices and materials have been
   expressed through an increase in the demand, production and use of
   ``green{''} building products. This, combined with a desire to integrate
   more bioproducts and natural and renewable resources into the
   construction industry, has extended to the production and promotion of
   insulation made from sheep's wool.
   Although substantial literature exists on the insulation properties and
   other benefits of wool, less is known about the economics and
   manufacturing processes of sheep's wool insulation at varying scales of
   production. This paper contributes to this field of enquiry through
   presentation of the preliminary results of a wool insulation
   manufacturing pilot project, in which the scale and economics of the
   production of sheep's wool insulation were considered. Processing
   techniques, the impact of sheep breed, yield, energy use, and
   manufacturing costs were also examined. The results of the pilot project
   indicate that, while sheep's wool insulation produced at a smaller, or
   artisanal scale shows some potential, scale of operation and volume of
   production need to be carefully considered in order to ensure long-term
   sustainability of the operation. Using the least expensive sheep's wool
   available for the manufacture of wool batt insulation (and thereby
   reducing production costs) did not, in this pilot study, have a negative
   impact on productivity or product performance. Diversion of this waste
   stream of currently less marketable, and consequently less valuable
   wool, into the production of a green building material may offer small
   but significant benefit to sheep producers and the broader agricultural
   community, as well as consumers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A competitive kinetic scheme representing primary and secondary
   reactions is proposed for torrefaction of large wet wood particles.
   Drying and diffusive, convective and radiative mode of heat transfer is
   considered including particle shrinking during torrefaction. The model
   prediction compares well with the experimental results of both mass
   fraction residue and temperature profiles for biomass particles. The
   effect of temperature, residence time and particle size on torrefaction
   of cylindrical wood particles is investigated through model simulations.
   For large biomass particles heat transfer is identified as one of the
   controlling factor for torrefaction. The optimum torrefaction
   temperature, residence time and particle size are identified. The model
   may thus be integrated with CFD analysis to estimate the performance of
   an existing torrefier for a given feedstock. The performance analysis
   may also provide useful insight for design and development of an
   efficient torrefier. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   of inclusion, not just its volume fraction. It is shown that a small
   epsilon(1)-order perturbation of the unit cell contour yields the
   epsilon(2)(1)-ordercontribution to the homogenized relations. The
   obtained solution is analyzed and compared with known results in some
   particular cases, and the limits of its applicability are evaluated. (C)

Title = {{Sourcing fatty acids to juvenile polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in the

Abstract = {{Juvenile polar cod (Boreogadus saida) are often found in close
   association with sea ice and represent an important trophic link in the
   Arctic food web. However, the proportional contribution of sea ice algal
   production via the sympagic food web to the diet of polar cod is
   unknown. To estimate the proportional contribution of fatty acids (FAs)
   from sea ice-derived particulate organic matter (i-POM) to the diet of
   juvenile polar cod, we used FA profiling and compound-specific stable
   carbon isotope analysis of individual FAs from juvenile polar cod
   collected from three regions in the Beaufort Sea. The delta C-13 values
   of the FAs 14:0, 16:4n-1, 18:0, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the polar cod
   were found to most strongly resemble pelagic POM rather than i-POM.
   Results from isotope-mixing models using diatom FA markers indicated
   that the proportional contribution of FAs from i-POM to juvenile polar
   cod was a parts per thousand currency sign2 \%, which suggests that
   juvenile polar cod had not sourced their FAs from i-POM. Thus, changes
   in sea ice coverage due to environmental change may not affect juvenile
   polar cod in regard to nutrients such as FAs but may still affect their
   populations by reducing critical shelter from predators.}},

Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Urinary tract obstruction (UTO) is a commonly noted disorder on prenatal
   ultrasound that has the potential to lead to permanent loss of renal
   function. To study the molecular processes of the disease, an in vitro
   model has been developed which involves mechanical stretch of proximal
   tubule cells grown on flexible plates which mimics the physiological
   conditions during UTO. This study employs a one dimensional SOS-PAGE
   fractionation procedure, followed by in-gel digest and LC-MS/MS analysis
   in a semi-quantitative experiment using spectral counting to relatively
   quantify changes in protein expression following the established model
   of UTO. Quantitative analysis shows 317 of the 1630 identified proteins
   express altered abundance, with 135 increased and 182 decreased in
   abundance as a result of stretch. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG
   annotations implicate a number of physiological processes that have been
   previously shown in addition to some potentially novel processes in UTO.
   The quantitative proteomic analysis we performed here provides a more
   complete characterization of changes in protein abundance as a result of
   stretch than previous studies, and provides a number of previously
   undescribed proteins in proximal tubule cells that may play a role in
   UTO.
   Biological significance
   Urinary tract obstruction (UTO) is a commonly noted abnormality on
   prenatal ultrasound that can either resolve spontaneously or require
   surgical intervention to prevent permanent renal damage or loss of
   function. While targeted studies of UTO have shown a number of
   pathological responses in proximal tubule cells, there are currently no
   large-scale quantitative studies that aim to elucidate a global cellular
   response. This study uses a semi-quantitative approach and applies a
   well characterized model of UTO to determine a number of cellular
   processes affected by UTO simulation and identifies a number of proteins
   with altered abundance that have not been noted previously in UTO.

Abstract = {{The oxygen content of a Cu powder has a significant influence on the
   transient liquid phase sintering (TLPS) behaviour of a Cu-Ni powder
   mixture. For Cu with low oxygen content, interdiffusion occurs between
   the Cu and Ni powders during heating and melting of the Cu phase. This
   interdiffusion leads to isothermal solidification of the Cu rich liquid
   and full TLPS behaviour. For Cu with a high oxygen content, a
   displacement reaction at the Cu/Ni interface occurs. Under certain
   conditions, this reaction leads to the formation of a continuous NiO
   layer over the Ni powder surface. This prevents Cu/Ni interdiffusion and
   wetting of the Ni particles by the molten Cu, thus eliminating the
   possibility for a TLPS process. Analysis of the results, indicate that
   the extent of NiO layer formation depends on oxygen content of the Cu,
   the composition of the powder mixture and the Ni particle size.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare temporal activation patterns from 24 abdominal and
   lumbar muscles between healthy subjects and those who reported recovery
   from recent low back injury (LBI).
   Design: Cross-sectional comparative study.
   Setting: University neuromuscular function laboratory.
   Participants: Healthy adult volunteers (N=81; 30 LBI, 51 asymptomatic
   subjects).
   Interventions: Trunk muscle electromyographic activity was collected
   during 2 difficulty levels of a supine trunk stability test aimed at
   challenging lumbopelvic control.
   Main Outcome Measures: Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to
   determine differences in temporal and/or amplitude electromyographic
   patterns between groups. Mixed-model analyses of variance were performed
   on PC scores that explained more than 89\% of the variance (alpha=.05).
   Results: Four PCs explained 89\% and 96\% of the variance for the
   abdominal and back muscles, respectively, with both muscle groups having
   similar shapes in the first 3 PCs. Significant interactions or group
   main effects were found for all PC scores except PC4 for the back
   extensors. Overall activation amplitudes for both the abdominal and back
   muscles (PC1 scores) were significantly (P<.05) higher for the LBI
   group, with both abdominal and back muscles of the LBI group
   demonstrating an increased response to the leg-loading phase (PC2
   scores) compared with the asymptomatic group. Differences were also
   found between groups in their preparatory activity (PC3 scores), with
   the LBI group having a higher early relative amplitude of abdominal and
   back extensor activity.
   Conclusions: Despite perceived readiness to return to work and low pain
   scores, muscle activation patterns remained altered in this LBI group,
   including reduced synergistic coactivation and increased overall
   amplitudes as well as greater relative amplitude differences during
   specific phases of the movement. Electromyographic measures provide
   objective information to help guide therapy and may assist with
   determining the level of healing and return-to-work readiness after an
   LBI. (C) 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new Quality Link Metric (QLM), ``Inverse
   Expected Transmission Count (InvETX),{''} in Optimized Link State
   Routing (OLSR) protocol. Then, we compare performance of three existing
   QLMs which are based on loss probability measurements: Expected
   Transmission Count (ETX), Minimum Delay (MD), and Minimum Loss (ML) in
   Static Wireless Multi-hop Networks (SWMhNs). A novel contribution of
   this paper is enhancement in conventional OLSR to achieve high
   efficiency in terms of optimized routing load and routing latency. For
   this purpose, first we present a mathematical framework, and then to
   validate this frame work, we select three performance parameters to
   simulate default and enhanced versions of OLSR. The three chosen
   performance parameters are throughput, Normalized Routing Load, and
   End-to-End Delay. From the simulation results, we conclude that
   adjusting the frequencies of topological information exchange results in
   high efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This study was concerned with the interaction between the cationic
   antimicrobial peptide, protamine (Ptm) and the cytoplasmic membranes of
   the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The objective of the study was to explain the
   observed paradox of internalization without permanent disruption of the
   cell envelope. We carried out Monte Carlo computer simulation of Ptm in
   an aqueous environment in the presence of similar to 100mM NaCl and
   model membranes consisting of either (65:35) or (75:25) PE:PG molar
   ratios. The (75:25) model, representative of the gram-negative
   cytoplasmic membrane, showed that the Ptm center of mass remained at
   least 7nm from the membrane surface leading to the prediction that Ptm
   would not internalize via disruption of the inner membrane.
   By using immunoelectron microscopy of Ptm-treated cells, we showed that
   Ptm internalization to the cytoplasm took place rapidly in the presence
   or absence of the outer envelope. Ultrastructural examination revealed
   no obvious morphological changes to cells that were treated with
   subinhibitory or bactericidal levels of Ptm. Reconstituted phospholipid
   bilayers were constructed and were unperturbed by Ptm treatment over a
   wide range of concentrations and applied transmembrane voltages. We
   conclude that in the cases of the cell envelopes of E.coli,
   S.typhimurium and P.aeruginosa, Ptm internalized by means independent of
   the phospholipid bilayer, most likely mediated by one or more membrane
   proteins such as cation-selective barrel-like proteins. Work is
   currently underway to test this hypothesis. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Wild blueberry producers apply fungicide uniformly without considering
   significant bare spots in the field. The wrong or over use of fungicide
   in bare spots results in an increased cost of production and threatens
   the environment. An automated prototype variable rate (VR) sprayer was
   used for spot-application (SA) of Chlorothalonil (Bravo(A (R)))
   fungicide in a wild blueberry field. Eighteen 6.1 m wide test tracks
   were selected in the field and bare spots were mapped using a real-time
   kinematics-global positioning system (RTK-GPS). Six plots were selected
   randomly for three different application rates. Water sensitive papers
   (WSP) were placed in foliage and bare spots in SA and
   uniform-application (UA) tracks. The percent area coverage (PAC) of WSP
   with both SA and UA in foliage and bare spot areas were calculated.
   Plant growth parameters were measured from all 108 randomly selected
   plots in SA, UA and control (CN) tracks for comparison. Plant images
   were taken over six selected plots in each of the 18 tracks. Images were
   analyzed using custom developed software to calculate the percentage of
   green pixels (PGP) for determining the effect of Bravo(A (R)) on plant
   health. Fruit yield parameters were also measured from selected plots
   for comparison. Non-significance of the t test for SA versus UA plant
   targets' PAC indicated that there was no significant bias in the SA with
   saving (9.90-51.22 \%) and SA was accurate. Bravo(A (R)) did not show
   any significant difference on plant growth parameters among SA, UA and
   CN. However, PGP, floral bud and harvestable yield of SA and UA were
   significantly increased over CN. Therefore, a VR sprayer could be used
   for SA of fungicides in wild blueberry cropping system to reduce
   chemical usage and maintain crop productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The present study assessed the ability of a low cost dual-view
   computer-vision system (CVS) to measure volume and color co-occurrence
   image textural features of apple slices to find the end of drying
   process by comparing physical texture parameters and moisture content.
   Apple slices were dried at three different temperatures (40, 60 and 80
   degrees C) and their volumes were measured with both the CVS and a
   caliper. The physical texture parameters and image textural features
   were measured according to the moisture content. While the CVS can be
   used to measure the volume of the apple slices during the drying
   process, the volume was not a good indicator of the end of drying
   because of porosity development. The peak force and initial slope of
   physical texture showed a significant correlation with H3, H5 and S2 and
   H3, H5 and S11 of image texture features, respectively. Eleven image
   texture features correlate well with the moisture content (R-2 > 0.9)
   and also had a high correlation between each other. The uniformity of
   intensity (I1) of image feature was a good indicator of the end of
   drying because of the close correlations with moisture content. The
   drying times according to the moisture content and the uniformity of
   intensity were 4.31 +/- 0.313 h and 4.42 +/- 0.125 h, respectively. (C)

Title = {{A model to assess dust explosion occurrence probability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{268}},
Pages = {{140-149}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Dust handling poses a potential explosion hazard in many industrial
   facilities. The consequences of a dust explosion are often severe and
   similar to a gas explosion; however, its occurrence is conditional to
   the presence of five elements: combustible dust, ignition source,
   oxidant, mixing and confinement. Dust explosion researchers have
   conducted experiments to study the characteristics of these elements and
   generate data on explosibility. These experiments are often costly but
   the generated data has a significant scope in estimating the probability
   of a dust explosion occurrence. This paper attempts to use existing
   information (experimental data) to develop a predictive model to assess
   the probability of a dust explosion occurrence in a given environment.
   The pro-posed model considers six key parameters of a dust explosion:
   dust particle diameter (PD), minimum ignition energy (MIE), minimum
   explosible concentration (MEC), minimum ignition temperature (MIT),
   limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) and explosion pressure (P-max). A
   conditional probabilistic approach has been developed and embedded in
   the proposed model to generate a nomograph for assessing dust explosion
   occurrence. The generated nomograph provides a quick assessment
   technique to map the occurrence probability of a dust explosion for a
   given environment defined with the six parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{WEAR}},

Abstract = {{The cost of erosion attack to the global oil and gas industry has drawn
   significant attention amongst researchers in recent years. Erosion is a
   complex phenomenon and in order to recommend ways to mitigate its effect
   it is essential to have a full understanding of the tribo-mechanisms
   involved. In the present study erosion tests were conducted on API X42
   steel using aluminum oxide as erodent The extent of material degradation
   is a function of the properties of abrasive particle, target material,
   erodent velocity, abrasive feed rate, attack angle and environment. In
   this study, erosion tests were carried out under high mean abrasive feed
   rate of 160 g min(-1). Particle velocities and attack angles employed
   were as follows: 36 m s(-1), 47 m s(-1), 56 m s(-1) and 81 m s(-1) at 30
   degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively. Similar to
   erosion at low abrasive feed rate, it is found that erosion rate
   decreases with increasing impact angle and increases with increasing
   particle velocity. However, under the present experimental conditions,
   it is found that the velocity exponent (n) in the erosion rate equation
   (E=kV(n)) decreases with increasing abrasive particle angle of
   incidence. Contrary to common understanding for low particle feed rate
   tests, this finding suggests that the ``n{''} value is mechanism
   dependent. Several mechanisms are found to be responsible for the
   behavior of API X42 steel under the experimental conditions used in this
   work. Heavy plastic deformation and fracture, ploughing and metal
   cutting are identified as operative mechanisms during erosion of API X42
   pipeline steel. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental
   and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and
   articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic
   interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of
   designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being
   simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the
   paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition
   with that suggested by a study group of the International
   Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the
   Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example
   definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly
   reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are
   discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate
   developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products
   and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the
   Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of
   efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to
   name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments
   to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues
   confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution
   Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising
   self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and
   recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements
   of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption
   Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,)
   Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart
   Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this
   paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of
   the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are
   offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the
   development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The
   approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy
   initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are
   given next. The first considers distribution network active management
   and future development trends in technologies and methods, where
   centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying
   agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of
   smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system
   (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of
   recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid.
   Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new
   and innovative research approaches and results are included.
   These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control
   approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of
   energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems,
   energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging
   stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI)
   in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for

Abstract = {{The expectation of perfectly geometric shapes of subwavelength grating
   (SWG) structures such as smoothness of sidewalls and sharp corners and
   nonexistence of grating defects is not realistic due to
   micro/nanofabrication processes. This work numerically investigates
   optical properties of an optimal solar absorber comprising a
   single-layered silicon (Si) SWG deposited on a finite Si substrate, with
   a careful consideration given to effects of various types of its
   imperfect geometry. The absorptance spectra of the solar absorber with
   different geometric shapes, namely, the grating with attached
   nanometer-sized features at the top and bottom of sidewalls and periodic
   defects within four and ten grating periods are investigated
   comprehensively. It is found that the grating with attached features at
   the bottom absorbs more energy than both the one at the top and the
   perfect grating. In addition, it is shown that the grating with defects
   in each fourth period exhibits the highest average absorptance (91\%)
   compared with that of the grating having defects in each tenth period
   (89\%), the grating with attached features (89\%), and the perfect one
   (86\%). Moreover, the results indicate that the absorptance spectrum of
   the imperfect structures is insensitive to angles of incidence.
   Furthermore, the absorptance enhancement is clearly demonstrated by
   computing magnetic field, energy density, and Poynting vector
   distributions. The results presented in this study prove that imperfect
   geometries of the nanograting structure display a higher absorptance
   than the perfect one, and provide such a practical guideline for
   nanofabrication capabilities necessary to be considered by structure
   designers. (C)2014 Optical Society of America}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3, 2, SI}},
Pages = {{814-820}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Canadian Blood Services runs approximately 16,000 donor
   clinics annually. While there were more than 220 different clinic
   configurations used in 2011 and 2012, 67\% of all clinic configurations
   followed one of 51 standard models. As part of operational planning for
   current and future configurations it was necessary for Canadian Blood
   Services to calculate staffing requirements for standard clinic models.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this article we present a method that
   incorporates both cost control and impact on donor experience. We
   calculate staffing requirements to minimize costs, but adjust using
   queuing theory to ensure donor wait time metrics are met. The method can
   be applied in a wide variety of situations.
   RESULTS: Although developed for a particular study, the methods
   described in this article can be applied in a wide variety of
   situations. A case study in which the model is used to review existing
   staffing arrangements at Canadian Blood Services is presented.
   CONCLUSION: The staffing model can be used to balance the requirements
   of minimizing staffing costs with that of ensuring that donors do not
   suffer unnecessary delays. Moreover, in an example application, savings
   of 3.4\% were identified through the modeling process.}},

Abstract = {{An automated sensing system consisting of hardware and software was
   developed for spot-application of herbicide in pruned wild blueberry
   fields. The hardware of the system consisted of a ruggedized PC, four
   digital cameras, a signal output unit, an 8-channel computerized
   variable rate controller (VRC), a flow controller, a pocket PC, solenoid
   valves, a servo valve, a flow meter, and nozzles mounted on an
   all-terrain vehicle. Custom software was developed in C++ and installed
   in the ruggedized PC to acquire images from the cameras and process in
   real-time to calculate the fraction of green pixels for weed detection
   in each image. Green contrast between weed and non-weed area in pruned
   wild blueberry fields was used to develop a robust and effective
   discriminating algorithm. Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images were converted to
   normalized green ratio binary images using the ratio of 255{*}G/(R+G+B)
   followed by segmentation for the discrimination. Custom software was
   capable of processing images to differentiate weed area from non-weed
   area in real-time and send the signal to the VRC to open the valve in
   the specific section of the boom where the weeds were detected. The
   normalized green ratio algorithm showed very reliable accuracy under
   different outdoor light conditions (>500 lux) and shade conditions. The
   sensing system performed well for accurate weed detection and for
   sending signals to the VRC for spraying the correct weed targets at up
   to 8 km h(-1) ground speed in the fields.}},

   and clinical applications}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Barefoot running has become a popular research topic, driven by the
   increasing prescription of barefoot running as a means of reducing
   injury risk. Proponents of barefoot running cite evolutionary theories
   that long-distance running ability was crucial for human survival, and
   proof of the benefits of natural running. Subsequently, runners have
   been advised to run barefoot as a treatment mode for injuries, strength
   and conditioning. The body of literature examining the mechanical,
   structural, clinical and performance implications of barefoot running is
   still in its infancy. Recent research has found significant differences
   associated with barefoot running relative to shod running, and these
   differences have been associated with factors that are thought to
   contribute to injury and performance. Crucially, long-term prospective
   studies have yet to be conducted and the link between barefoot running
   and injury or performance remains tenuous and speculative. The injury
   prevention potential of barefoot running is further complicated by the
   complexity of injury aetiology, with no single factor having been
   identified as causative for the most common running injuries. The aim of
   the present review was to critically evaluate the theory and evidence
   for barefoot running, drawing on both collected evidence as well as
   literature that have been used to argue in favour of barefoot running.
   We describe the factors driving the prescription of barefoot running,
   examine which of these factors may have merit, what the collected
   evidence suggests about the suitability of barefoot running for its
   purported uses and describe the necessary future research to confirm or
   refute the barefoot running hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of liquid dairy manure (LDM) application rates (12.5 and
   25 kL ha(-1)) and soil type on the decay rates of library-independent
   fecal source tracking markers (host-associated Bacteroidales and
   mitochondrial DNA) and persistent (>58 d) Escherichia coli population
   structure was examined in a field study. The soils compared were an
   Aquic Haplorthod and a Typic Haplorthod in Nova Scotia, Canada, that
   differed according to landscape position and soil moisture regime. Soil
   type and LDM application rate did not influence Escherichia coli decay
   rates (0.045-0.057 d(-1)). Escherichia coli population structure, in
   terms of the occurrence of abundance of strain types, varied according
   to soil type (p = 0.012) but did not vary by LDM application rate (p =
   0.121). Decay of ruminant-specific Bacteroidales (BacR), bovine-specific
   Bacteroidales (CowM2), and mitochondrial DNA (AcytB) markers was
   analyzed for 13 d after LDM application. The decay rates of BacR were
   greater under high-LDM application rates (0.281-0.358 d(-1)) versus
   low-LDM application rates (0.212-0.236 d(-1)) but were unaffected by
   soil type. No decay rates could be calculated for the CowM2 marker
   because it was undetectable within 6 d after manure application. Decay
   rates for AcytB were lower for the Aquic Haplorthod (0.088-0.100 d(-1)),
   with higher moisture status compared with the Typic Haplorthod (0.135
   d(-1)). Further investigation into the decay of fecal source tracking
   indicators in agricultural field soils is warranted to assess the
   influence of soil type and agronomic practice on the differential decay
   of relevant markers and the likelihood of transport in runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Post-auricular approach is commonly used in otologic surgery.
   The objective of this study was to ascertain whether post-auricular
   approach alters the position of the auricle.
   Methods: All patients who underwent post-auricular approach for

   Results: Nineteen patients were included in the study. Mean age at
   surgery was 9.05 years; 11 were male and 8 were female. Overall, there
   was no statistically significant long-term postoperative change in any
   of the three measurements, indicating stability of the auricular
   position. No difference was also noted on the basis of patient

Abstract = {{The ``human factor{''} constitutes an important role in the prediction
   of safe operation of a facility. Hence, information about human
   capacities and behaviours should be applied methodically to increase the
   safety of a systematic process. This paper provides an analysis of human
   factors in pre- and post-maintenance operations. For possible failure
   scenarios, this paper considers the procedures for removing process
   equipment from service (pre-maintenance) and returning the component to
   service (post-maintenance). In this study, a pump is used as the test
   example. For each scenario, the human error probability (HEP) is
   calculated for each activity, using the Human Error Assessment and
   Reduction Technique (HEART) which is commonly implemented technique in
   industry, can also be applied in the analyses of safety cases. HEART is
   a reliable technique for comparing HEP and its approach is based on the
   degree of error recovery. Consequences are also assessed for each
   activity in this methodology. The final value of risk for each activity
   is assigned by combining error likelihood and related consequences. When
   the calculated risk is beyond acceptable levels, risk management
   strategies are provided to increase the safety of the maintenance
   procedures. The most probable human errors for a considered case study
   are related to the activities of ``draining lines{''} and ``open
   valves{''}. These two activities have high HEPs, which are 9.57E-01 and
   9.62E-01, respectively. (C) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the impact on energy consumption and GHG emissions
   as well as the technoeconomic feasibility of retrofitting solar domestic
   hot water (DHW) heating systems to all houses in the Canadian housing
   stock (CHS). The study was conducted using the Canadian Hybrid
   Residential End-Use Energy and GHG Emissions Model (CHREM). It was
   assumed that all houses that have a DHW system with a tank, and a roof
   facing south, south-west or south-east could be retrofitted with a solar
   DHW system. As to be expected, the energy and GHG emissions impact of
   retrofitting SDHW systems into the CHS is substantial. If all eligible
   existing DHW systems (30\% of those existing in the CHS) were to be
   retrofitted with SDHW systems, the energy consumption and GHG emissions
   of the Canadian residential sector would be reduced by about 2\%. This
   is equivalent to 22.7 PJ of end-use energy savings and 1 Mt of GHG
   emissions reduction, or 11.8\% and 11.9\%, respectively, of the current
   amounts associated with domestic hot water heating. The energy savings
   potential with SDHW systems in all provinces are similar, while the GHG
   emission reductions vary significantly due to the substantially
   different fuel mix used in different provinces. The economic feasibility
   results demonstrate the impact of installation and fuel costs, as well
   as interest and energy price escalation rates on payback period. (C)

Abstract = {{The main objective of this investigation was to implement lean
   manufacturing system (LMS) to improve productivity of airconditioning
   coil manufacturing at Blue Star Limited. LMS was successfully employed
   to improve coil manufacturing productivity or output by 77 \% or from
   121 coils to 214 coils per shift. The LMS tools; such as value stream
   mapping, single minute exchange of die, and Kaizen were employed to
   reduce the setup time of coil expander machine from 60 to 20 min, an
   improvement of 67 \%. The increase in percentage value addition (\%VA)
   of the coil shop was from 5 to 12 \%, an improvement of 140 \%. The
   improvement, especially in coil expander machine was achieved through
   Kaizen (continuous improvement) targeting design and work method
   changes. The specific innovative design changes or improvements made in
   the expander machine to reduce the setup time included the application
   of: (1) gear rack and gear pinion mechanism, (2) spring and cam and
   lever mechanism, and (3) one touch mechanism in the various components
   of the machine. Many method Kaizens were also proposed to simplify the
   setup procedure by eliminating waste (muda) from the setup of expander.
   Other benefits were obtained through reduction of work-in-process
   inventory, which in turn reduced the shop floor congestion and coil
   damage due to extra coil handling and improved workplace safety.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudoalteromonas sp. NCIMB 2021 (NCIMB 2021) was grown in synthetic
   seawater (SSW) containing pyruvate, in the presence (SSW++) and absence
   (SSW-) of divalent cations. Cultures contained single cells. Addition of
   the cationic antibacterial peptide (CAP), protamine, did not inhibit,
   but rather increased, the growth of NCIMB 2021 in SSW++ and caused the
   bacteria to grow in chains. Bacterial growth was assessed using
   turbidity, cell counts and the sodium salt of resazurin. In SSW-, NCIMB
   2021 was no longer resistant to protamine. The minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) was 5mgml(-1).
   Significance and Impact of the Study
   Protamine is a cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAP), which is active
   against a variety of bacteria. This is the first in-depth study of the
   interaction of protamine with a marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas sp.
   NCIMB 2021. Our results show that protamine is only active in seawater
   in the absence of divalent cations. In the presence of the divalent
   cations, Mg2+ and Ca2+, protamine enhances the growth of
   Pseudoalteromonas sp. NCIMB 2021 and produces chains rather than
   individual cells. These are important considerations when deciding on
   applications for protamine and in terms of understanding its mechanism
   of action.}},

Abstract = {{We determined fatty acid (FA) profiles and carbon stable isotopic
   composition of individual FAs (delta C-13(FA) values) from sea ice
   particulate organic matter (i-POM) and pelagic POM (p-POM) in the Bering
   Sea during maximum ice extent, ice melt, and ice-free conditions in
   2010. Based on FA biomarkers, differences in relative composition of
   diatoms, dinoflagellates, and bacteria were inferred for i-POM versus
   p-POM and for seasonal succession stages in p-POM. Proportions of diatom
   markers were higher in i-POM (16:4n-1, 6.6-8.7 \%; 20:5n-3, 19.6-25.9
   \%) than in p-POM (16:4n-1, 1.2-4.0 \%; 20:5n-3, 5.5-14.0 \%). The
   dinoflagellate marker 22:6n-3/20:5n-3 was highest in p-POM. Bacterial FA
   concentration was higher in the bottom 1 cm of sea ice (14-245 mu g L-1)
   than in the water column (0.6-1.7 mu g L-1). Many i-POM delta C-13(FA)
   values were higher (up to similar to 10 aEuro degrees) than those of
   p-POM, and i-POM delta C-13(FA) values increased with day length. The
   higher i-POM delta C-13(FA) values are most likely related to the
   reduced dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) availability within the
   semi-closed sea ice brine channel system. Based on a modified Rayleigh
   equation, the fraction of sea ice DIC fixed in i-POM ranged from 12 to
   73 \%, implying that carbon was not limiting for primary productivity in
   the sympagic habitat. These differences in FA composition and delta
   C-13(FA) values between i-POM and p-POM will aid efforts to track the
   proportional contribution of sea ice algal carbon to higher trophic
   levels in the Bering Sea and likely other Arctic seas.}},

Abstract = {{Sediments and surface water contamination by the industrial effluents
   containing heavy metals is the most detrimental environmental impact.
   Therefore, the present work attempts to determine the status of eight
   heavy metal distribution in sediments and water samples, and their
   ecological risks' assessment in the studied area. The distribution
   pattern of heavy metals in the water and sediment follows the sequences:
   Zn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Mn > Ni > As > Cd and Mn > Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni >
   As > Cd, respectively. Gross water pollution is observed at different
   sampling points of Dhalai Beel and Bangshi River. The comparison of
   sedimentary mean metal concentrations with several environmental
   contamination monitoring parameters, viz, threshold effect level (TEL),
   probable effect level (PEL), and severe effect lever (SEL) indicates
   that the metal levels are less than PEL except Cr. Moreover, the level
   of contamination degree (C (d)) and modified degree of contamination (mC
   (d)) indicates `low' and `nil to low' degree of contamination,
   respectively. Pollution load indices (PLI) of the studied area are lower
   than unity, indicates no pollution. Furthermore, a toxic-response factor
   is applied to assess the potential ecological risk of these heavy metals
   into the water body. The results of this study exhibit a low potential
   ecological risk of heavy metals. The Pearson's correlation and cluster
   analysis are also performed to assess the heavy metal interactions in
   water and sediment samples.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{271-279}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we address the decision of choosing a patient mix for a
   hospital that leads to the most beneficial treatment case mix. We
   illustrate how capacity, case mix and patient mix decisions are
   interrelated and how understanding this complex relationship is crucial
   for achieving the maximum benefit from the fee-for-service financing
   system. Although studies to determine the case mix that is of maximum
   benefit exist in the literature, the hospital actions necessary to
   realize this case mix have seen less attention. We model the hospital as
   an M/G/infinity queueing system to evaluate the impact of accepting
   certain patient types. Using this queueing model to generate the
   parameters, an optimization problem is formulated. We propose two
   methods for solving the optimization problem. The first is exact but
   requires an integer linear programming solver whereas the second is an
   approximation algorithm relying only on dynamic programming. The model
   is applied in the department of surgery at a Dutch hospital. The model
   determines which patient types result in the desired growth in the

Abstract = {{Application of a tensile overload within an otherwise constant amplitude
   cyclic loading scenario is known to retard the resulting crack
   propagation in metals, thus resulting in longer fatigue life. The
   magnitude of retardation and crack length increment that would be
   affected by such an overload would depend on the overload ratio and the
   nature of baseline loading. However, the influence of an overload within
   a baseline loading with negative stress ratio on crack propagation has
   not been extensively investigated. Consequently, the influence of
   overload (with various overload ratios), applied within various baseline
   loadings consist of both positive and negative stress ratios, is
   considered in our experimental investigation. It is shown that the
   retardation response of AM60B magnesium alloy varies when the stress
   ratio of the baseline loading changes. Wheeler model's parameters are
   evaluated separately for positive and negative stress ratios. For
   positive stress ratio, the affected zone was modified based on the
   baseline loading's stress ratios.
   The experimental results reveals that retardation trend in crack
   propagation would be affected significantly by negative stress ratios;
   therefore, Wheeler's model would have to be modified to account for this
   important issue. Moreover, the influence of loading sequence (i.e., when
   the overload is followed by a compressive underload) on retardation of
   crack propagation is also investigated.
   Finally, surface roughness of the fractured specimens is carefully
   examined by a profilometer and its variation with respect to stress
   ratio is reported in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Flow Sand Filters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The lateral flow sand filter (LFSF) is an on-site wastewater technology
   widely used to treat septic tank effluent (STE) in Nova Scotia, Canada.
   In this study, linear and nonlinear isotherm models (accounting for both
   sorption and precipitation processes) were developed and evaluated to
   simulate cumulative phosphorus (P) treatment in eight LFSFs that
   operated from September 2004 to October 2011. The LFSFs varied in design
   based on slope (5, 30\%), sand grain size (fine, medium, coarse), and
   filter length (5.5, 8m). The HYDRUS two-dimensional (2D) model was used
   to estimate the mass of sand involved in active P treatment to normalize
   the isotherm influent P loads for each LFSF. The isotherm equations
   tested were linear, Langmuir, Freundlich, and 2-part piecewise linear.
   Linear, Freundlich, and 2-part piecewise linear functions were also
   combined with batch sorption experiment derived Langmuir equations and
   subsequently tested. For the six 8-m long LFSFs, the individual 2-part
   piecewise linear isotherms had the best model performance. The P removal
   processes in the lower STE-loaded medium sand, 5.5-m-long LFSFs 7 and 8
   were adequately modeled by both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, but
   all seven isotherms had satisfactory model performance. Phosphorus
   treatment isotherms were also developed by averaging input parameters
   from the individual filter isotherms on the basis of filter length and
   sand grain size. The average P treatment isotherms had poor model
   performance results for the 8-m-long LFSFs, possibly caused by different
   P removal rates related to filter slope and residence time. All of the
   eight LFSF designs were not effective at long-term P treatment with
   effluent concentrations exceeding 1mgPL-1 at the end of the study
   period; however, the fine- and medium-grained sand 8-m-long designs for
   both slope classes had the best observed P reduction rates. The results
   of this study will be used to develop disposal field input parameters
   for watershed-scale models.}},

Abstract = {{Selection for large body size in mink (Neovison vison) can result in
   obesity, which is associated with poor reproduction and metabolic
   disorders. Caloric restriction is effective in diminishing oxidative
   stress and delaying aging-related diseases. This study investigated the
   effects of moderate diet restriction on body condition, health, and
   reproductive success of mink breeder females. One-hundred control
   females were fed according to conventional feeding practice, while the
   feed allowance of their 100 sister-pair females was restricted in order
   to maintain an ideal body condition during the fall and eliminate the
   need for drastic slimming prior to breeding. Repeated measures analyses
   revealed that body weight gain during the fall and weight loss prior to
   breeding was significantly less for the restricted females. The
   restricted females had significantly larger live litters (5.88 kits)
   than the control dams (4.62 kits; P < 0.05). They were also able to
   maintain their body weight and condition during early lactation and were
   able to regain weight and condition post-lactation, unlike their control
   sisters. Based on their comet scores (restricted: 88; control: 116), the
   restricted primiparous females experienced less DNA damage (P < 0.05),
   while no significant differences were apparent for the multiparous
   females (restricted: 170; control: 153). No changes in telomere length
   were observed among the dams. Moderate diet restriction of mink breeder
   females during the fall eliminated extreme fluctuations in body weight
   and condition throughout the seasonal production cycle and improved
   their litter size, and in primiparous females, lessened DNA damage. (C)

Abstract = {{Due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, energy
   sources that release smaller amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere are of
   considerable interest. Attention is also now being paid to sequestering
   CO2 from the combustion process and eliminating discharge to the
   atmosphere from the major source points. Chemical-looping combustion
   (CLC) is a promising concept that can be used in power generation, which
   integrates power production and CO2 capture. In the present study, a
   commercially obtained iron ore was used as an oxygen carrier and the
   associated reduction reaction kinetics parameters have been estimated
   based on isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in reducing
   environments. The iron oxide in the ore, which is initially Fe2O3,
   proceeds through a sequence of reaction steps and can ultimately end up
   as metallic iron. The reduction mechanism for the first stage reaction
   (i.e., Fe2O3 to Fe3O4) was evaluated using a number of different
   gas-solid reaction models. The results indicate that the Avrami-Erofe'ev
   model can be successfully applied to the experimental data. Through this
   approach, it was confirmed that the initial reaction stage is
   phase-boundary-controlled, which gradually transitions to diffusion
   control. The apparent activation energy was estimated and compared with
   values from the literature data.}},

   The study found that adding 1/2 in. light aluminum VB on the indoor side
   of windows with automatic control based on zone temperature would result
   in substantial reduction in energy and GHG emissions in the Canadian
   housing stock. Other types of window shading devices may be effective in
   reducing the cooling energy consumption, but they result in an increase
   in overall energy consumption when both heating and cooling season
   performance is taken into consideration.
   The economic feasibility of VB depends largely on the fuel mix and cost
   of fuels used as well as the tolerable payback period and expected fuel
   cost escalation rate. Thus, the economic feasibility is different for

   Al braze sheets, as well as a two-layer lap joint made from these
   sheets, under identical conditions. A two-layer modeling method was then
   used to analyze the above data to determine R-c for the lap joint as a
   function of processing temperature. This in situ analysis of R-c for a
   developing joint during brazing was able to distinguish both solid-state
   and liquid-phase reactions occurring at the faying surfaces of the
   joint. Consequently, it represents a powerful, new experimental tool
   that can be used to investigate the mechanisms of braze joint formation
   and the thermal properties of a joint as a function of processing
   condition. In the particular case of this study, the technique
   demonstrates that the use of a Ni-based fluxless brazing process to join
   aluminum ( Al) sheets, reduced the R-c of the lap joint by 100-folds
   from 1.3 x 10(-4) m(2) K/W before brazing to 1.35 x 10(-6) m(2) K/W
   after brazing. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Phosphite-based fungicides are increasingly used to control fungi-like
   plant pathogens from the Oomycetes group. A rapid, precise, and
   cost-effective suppressed conductivity high performance ion
   chromatography (HPIC) method was developed to assess the concentrations
   of soluble phosphites (Phi) and phosphates (Pi) in plant samples. This
   technique was used to determine the amount of Phi and Pi in leaves and
   tubers of potato plants following foliar applications of the Phi-based
   fungicide Confine (TM). High amounts of Phi were determined in both
   leaves and tubers indicating that potato plants efficiently uptake and
   translocate the fungicide. The number of applications of Confine (TM)
   and its concentration were found to be directly proportional with the
   amount of Phi detected in potato plants and inversely proportional with
   the development of Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary in these
   plants. Levels of Phi comparable to those determined in plants were
   found to strongly inhibit the growth of P. infestans in vitro. The
   simultaneous estimation of the in planta Phi concentration and of the
   sensitivity of P. infestans to Phi represent the most comprehensive
   approach of assessing the efficacy of Phi-based fungicides in
   controlling late blight development in potatoes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Offshore pipelines are usually subject to hostile environments.
   Temperature changes and repetitive start-up/shutdown in offshore
   pipelines generate cycles of axial compression and relaxation.
   Consequently, the pipes may become subject to loading magnitudes that
   could cause them to locally buckle and wrinkle, and if subject to
   repeated loading, they could undergo ratcheting. Pipelines could also be
   subject to damage in the form of dents. This form of damage would have a
   profound effect on a pipe's ratcheting response when subjected to cyclic
   loading. In this article, the ratcheting response of locally dented
   pipes that were subject to axially applied cyclic loading has been
   experimentally investigated. Scaled pipes (tubes) were first laterally
   indented with a cylindrical indenter and then were subjected to a
   monotonic axial compressive load that initiated small amplitude wrinkles
   on them. The pipes were subsequently subjected to repeated axial strain.
   The experiments were conducted on low carbon steel pipes (API 5L-grade
   B), with D-o/t similar or equal to 35, which were indented to three
   different indentation depths. Significant variation in pipes' responses
   was observed, and the number of cycles prior to collapse dramatically
   decreased by as much as 75\% when the indentation depth was marginally
   increased.}},

Abstract = {{A rigorous design using periodic silicon (Si) gratings as absorbers for
   solar cells in visible and near-infrared regions is numerically
   presented. The structure consists of a subwavelength Si grating layer on
   top of an Si substrate. Ranges of grating dimensions are preliminary
   considered satisfying simple and feasible fabrication techniques with an
   aspect ratio defined as the ratio of the grating thickness (d) and the
   grating lamella width (w), with 0 < d/w < 1.0. The subwavelength grating
   structure (SGS) is assumed to comprise different lamella widths and
   slits within each period in order to finely tune the grating profile
   such that the absorptance is significantly enhanced in the whole
   wavelength region. The results showed that the compound SGS yields an
   average absorptance of 0.92 which is 1.5 larger than that of the Si
   plain and conventional grating structures. It is shown that the
   absorptance spectrum of the proposed SGS is insensitive to the angle of
   incidence of the incoming light. The absorptance enhancement is also
   investigated by computing magnetic field, energy density, and Poynting
   vector distributions. The results presented in this study show that the
   proposed method based on nanofabrication techniques provides a simple
   and promising solution to design solar energy absorbers or other energy
   harvesting devices. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion control strategies are important for many utilities in
   maintaining water quality from the water treatment plant to the
   customers' tap. In drinking water with low alkalinity, water quality can
   become significantly degraded in iron-based pipes if water utilities are
   not diligent in maintaining proper corrosion control. This article
   reports on experiments conducted in bicarbonate buffered (5mg-C/L)
   synthetic water to determine the effects of corrosion control (pH and
   phosphate) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the rate constants of
   the Fe(II) oxidation process. A factorial design approach elucidated
   that pH (P = 0.007, contribution: 42.5\%) and phosphate (P = 0.025,
   contribution: 22.7\%) were the statistically significant factors in the
   Fe(II) oxidation process at a 95\% confidence level. The comprehensive
   study revealed a significant dependency relationship between the Fe(II)
   oxidation rate constants (k) and phosphate-to- Fe(II) mole ratio. At pH
   6.5, the optimum mole ratio was found to be 0.3 to reduce the k values.
   Conversely, the k values were observed to increase for the phosphate-to-
   Fe(II) mole ratio >1. The factorial design approach revealed that
   chlorine and DOM for the designated dosages did not cause a
   statistically significant (=0.05, P>0.05)change in rate constants.
   However, an increment of the chlorine to ferrous iron mole ratio by a
   factor of approximate to 2.5 resulted in an increase k values by a
   factor of approximate to 10. This study conclusively demonstrated that
   the lowest Fe(II) oxidation rate constant was obtained under low pH
   conditions (pH 6.5), with chlorine doses less than 2.2mg/L and with a
   phosphate-to-Fe(II)moleratio approximate to 0.3 in the iron water
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{As an important component of the driver assistance system or autonomous
   vehicle, traffic sign detection can provide drivers or vehicles with
   safety and alert information about the road. Most existing methods for
   traffic sign detection only focus on one or several categories of signs
   while there are various signs in the real world. This paper proposes a
   biologically-inspired method for detecting almost all categories of
   traffic signs of interest. Based on the fact that traffic signs are
   designed to be salient such that they can stand out from its
   surroundings, this proposed method employs the bottom-up attention
   mechanism to select the salient objects in the image and the attentional
   selection is biases based on the top-down attention mechanism so as to
   filter out non-traffic-sign salient objects. Experimental results have
   shown that the proposed method is valid for detecting various types of
   traffic signs.}},

Abstract = {{The autonomous obstacle avoidance planning of USV is the guarantee and
   the precondition of carrying out the performance. Obstacle avoidance
   planning is required to possess high accuracy and instantaneity due to a
   complex environment and faster speed. The algorithm of Artificial
   Potential Field has the advantage of sample mathematical model, which is
   easy to understand and implement, and facilitate the underlying control.
   However, application of traditional Artificial Potential Field has the
   problems of local minimum, destination unreachable, and poor accuracy of
   algorithm. Aiming at these issues, a method of the obstacle avoidance
   planning of Unmanned Surface Vehicle based on improved Artificial
   Potential Field is proposed in this article, and its feasibility is

Abstract = {{The motion of spherical robot is non-linear and coupling, so most of the
   movement takes the decomposition into linear motion and steering motion

   ground and jitter during the process. To solve the problem, this paper
   proposes fuzzy PID control method for compensation of the deflection
   angle to adjust trajectory. First, spherical robot kinematics and
   dynamics models are developed, and then fuzzy PID control method is
   analyzed, the compensation of motor mathematical model is established,
   and finally the robot simulation is conducted in Simulink. Result shows
   that the effect is well compensation.}},

Abstract = {{Land yacht is a new type of mobile robot powered by the wind through the
   use of a sail. The structure and analysis of an autonomous controlled
   four wheeled land yacht are presented in this paper. The land yacht
   consists of a hull, a studding sail, a dual-front-wheel steering
   mechanism, two rear wheels, an axle, two wire ropes, a servomotor and a
   steering engine. As the studding sail and the dual-front-wheel steering
   mechanism are maneuvered by the servomotor and steering engine with a
   gyroscope and an aerovane, respectively, the land yacht reaches the
   destination by itself. Relationships between maximum true speed,
   start-up wind speed and angle of attack are established based on the
   aerodynamic characteristics of the NACA0018 airfoil. Requirements are
   found for the land yacht to maintain stability and to not tip over.
   Stability and start-up wind speed are discussed for different true wind
   angles and angles of attack. Finally, the prototype is presented and
   experiments of stability and start-up wind speed are introduced to
   validate these requirements. The results show that the maximum true wind
   speed blowing the land yacht can be 16.2m/s and the minimum start-up
   wind speed is just 3.9m/s.}},

Abstract = {{The graphical user interface (GUI) described in this paper provides a
   complete procedure for constructing both the analog and digital
   controllers for switching converters for superior performance. Although
   the GUI is designed to control switching converters having second-order
   transfer function, it can equally be applied to all second-order
   systems. The purpose of this GUI is to facilitate SMPS designers,
   including most control engineers, who lack a sound background in control
   system theory. Without having deep insight into the control theory, one
   can easily design a controller for a switching converter in order to
   achieve dynamic performance. The GUI comes with the advantage of
   investigating the effects of sampling time and mapping techniques while
   designing a digital controller. The analog controller is designed on the
   basis of Bode plot of the frequency response, which is then converted
   into the digital controller using suitable sampling period. A design
   example is provided to validate the competency of this GUI.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Wi-Fi positioning method based on Deep
   Learning (DL). To deal with the variant and unpredictable wireless
   signals, the positioning is casted in a four-layer Deep Neural Network
   (DNN) structure that is capable of learning reliable features from a
   large set of noisy samples and avoids the need for hand-engineering.
   Also, to maintain the temporal coherence, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
   based fine localizer is introduced to smooth the positioning result
   obtained from the immediate estimation of DNN-based coarse localizer.
   The data required for the experiments is collected from the real world
   in different periods to meet the actual environment. Experimental
   results indicate that the proposed system leads to substantial
   improvement on localization accuracy in case of the turbulent wireless

Abstract = {{In most research work, the steering process has been ignored when
   considering the ability to move quickly from point to point. Being under
   control when suffering from Coriolis force or external disturbance in
   various types of terrain is also essential for spherical robots in
   hazardous locations such as the Antarctic ice shelf. In this paper, we
   has a spherical robot with deformable structure, which has two steering
   engines to control the dip angle between the ground and mid body. The
   deformable parts on either side of the robot were designed not only to
   stabilize itself using the method of limiting the degree of freedom with
   the ground but also to increase the reaction torque from the ground in
   the steering process. An experiment was set to investigate the
   relationship between the curvature radius of steering motion and driving
   angular velocity of the shell. The designed robot was proved to be well
   under control in test cases with external disturbances like driven by
   wind power.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we incorporate a compact LC tank, chip resistors and a
   double-layer frequency selective surface (FSS) to construct a planar
   dipole antenna for UWB radar and communication systems. Two staircase
   rectangular antenna arms are isolated with open complementary double
   concentric split-hexagonal-ring resonators (LC tanks) and chip resistors
   for bandwidth enhancement. The overall electric size of the antenna is
   0.33 lambda x 0.16 lambda at the lowest frequency end of the operational
   band. For impedance matching as well as balanced-unbalanced transition,
   a broadband microstrip to parallel-strip transformer (or balun) was
   designed as the feeding structure to the antenna. Finally, a double
   layer FSS is added in from the dipole to yield the in-phase reflection
   and consequently produce gain enhancement. The measurements show the
   proposed antenna operates over the frequency bandwidth of 0.65-3.8 GHz
   with S-11 < -10 dB and exhibits highly directive radiation patterns with
   smooth gains in the range of 6.2-9 dBi.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) are employing heterogeneous
   technologies now a days to meet the increasing demands of Intelligent
   Transportation System (ITS) applications such as enriched multimedia,
   video conferencing, gaming and online collaboration. Deployment and
   maintenance cost for infrastructures are also a major concern. This work
   proposes a framework, capable of catering multiple technologies
   simultaneously (such as local area network, wide area networks and
   cellular networks), that deploys wired and wireless integrated
   technologies to exploit the advantages of both. Therefore, it offers the
   architecture based on radio over fiber technology to meet the future
   requirements of high data rate for Road Vehicle Communication (RVC) in
   VANETs and it comes up with the most important and perhaps desperately
   needed feature of `Future Technology Support' yielding very high data
   rates support. Several traditionally deployed architectures are striving
   to come up with the future needs but due to their various limitations
   they were unable to attain their expected outcomes. The proposed RoF
   based architecture justifies its need inducing a true value and powerful
   features to dramatically enhance the overall performance of the entire
   system. Several evaluation parameters have been chosen that clearly
   present the strength of proposed RoF framework and prove that RoF
   framework is the better option for the service providers in the area of
   ITS applications. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved indirect estimation link delays from a
   triplet of network metrics; path delays, packet loss rate (PLR), and
   jitter by using indirect inverse modeling techniques. conventionally a
   network metric is estimated by directly observing another network
   parameter. Based on the evidence in the literature that path delays,
   PLR, and jitter are interdependent, this work exploits this mutual
   interdependent of this triplet of metrics based on the notion that a
   better observation leads to better estimation. We applied NTF1 model, a
   variation of non negative tensor factorization (NTF) for this purpose
   and estimated link delay from a triplet of metrics. Evaluation process
   used data from an experimental test bed that consists of standard
   networking devices. The estimated link delays were correlated to actual
   link delays to benchmark the accuracy of estimation. Results showed a
   better correlation between the estimated and measured link delays when a
   triplet of metrics is used. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Software defined networking (SDN) is an emerging approach to handle data
   forwarding and control separately. The notion of programmability has
   central importance in SDN. Two implementation strategies; proprietary
   and open source, are shaping the trends of the adoptability of SDN by
   major hardware manufacturers. A group of leading vendors believes that
   loose coupling between the logical and physical layers of a network
   hinders the proper provision of physical resources and suggests a
   proprietary fix to this problem. The other group regards the notion of
   openness as s key feature of SDN. This paper compares and contrasts
   these two implementation strategies of SDN by identifying their
   respective operating principles, features of the product lines, and
   weakness and strengths. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The solutions to parameter setting of PID controllers have always been
   an essential problem of control system design. The single-neuron PID
   controller can achieve the parameters' self-adaption to the real
   operation conditions by adjusting the gain value. Two computational
   intelligent algorithms deriving their theory sources from the uncertain
   reasoning are introduced to realize the on-line adjustments of gain,
   which are general fuzzy logic and a normal cloud model with
   universality. The designs on these two regulators are given containing
   the forms of the membership functions under the fuzzy logic \& cloud
   model, control rules for 1-dimensional \& 2-dimensional input modes, and
   the inference models, etc. The numerical simulations are implemented and
   the comparative analysis on the dynamic performance is presented based
   on the existent step responses and the adjustable parameters' curves
   with adaptive changes. By contrast, it concludes that a 2-dimensional
   normal cloud model leads to the desired overshoot, and its 1-dimensional
   model with shorter program running time adapts to occasions of high
   real-time demands, and fuzzy logic regulators can better meet the
   control requirements of the shorter setting time.}},

Abstract = {{Design of implantable wireless telemetry is challenging due to
   strictly-limited allowable power budgets. The design of wireless
   prototypes becomes even more challenging due to the need for
   rice-grain-sized autonomous devices with enhanced useful life. This
   paper elaborates on the design and implementation of a second-generation
   prototype of a baseband (BB) transmitter (TX) proposed for use in
   next-generation body area networks (BANs), with an implementation
   targeted in TSMC's 65 nm Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)
   process. The proposed BB TX utilizes a preamble-based asynchronous
   packet transmission methodology that can potentially meet the
   energy-efficiency demands of next-generation BANs (below 500pJ/bit). A
   comparison of the implemented integrated circuit (IC) with the
   first-generation prototype reveals an improvement of 88\% in power
   consumption. The proposed design requires 1.3mW of power at a supply
   voltage of 0.9V with an energy efficiency of 144pJ/bit.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to introduce analytical closed form
   solutions for the prediction of effective axial and transverse Young's
   modulus and Poisson ratios of a matrix-filled nanotube (i.e., a
   representative element of nanotube reinforced nanocomposites) as well as
   its mechanical behavior (i.e., displacements, strains and stress
   distributions) when it is subjected to externally applied uniform axial
   and radial loads. In this work, both the nanotube and its filler
   material are considered to be generally cylindrical orthotropic. For the
   derivation of exact solutions for radial loading case, no plain strain
   condition is assumed and effects of axial strain is taken into
   consideration to obtain a more precise set of solutions. Analytical
   formulae are developed based on the principles of linear elasticity and
   continuum mechanics and then exact solutions are obtained for
   displacements, strains and stress distributions within the domain of
   each individual constituent. To validate and verify the accuracy of the
   closed form solutions obtained from the analytical approach, a 3-D model
   of a matrix-filled nanotube is generated and solved for displacements,
   strains and stresses, numerically, using a finite element method.
   Excellent agreements were achieved between the results obtained from the
   analytical and numerical methods.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of particle shape on the angle of internal friction, and the
   resulting impact on beach sediment dynamics, is still poorly understood.
   In areas characterized by sediments of specific shape, particularly
   non-rounded particles, this can lead to large departures from the
   expected sediment dynamics. The steep slope (1 : 10) of the mixed
   sand-gravel beach at Advocate Harbour is stable in large-scale
   morphology over decades, despite a high tidal range of 10m or more, and
   intense shore-break action during storms. The Advocate sand (d < 2 mm)
   was found to have an elliptic, plate-like shape (Corey Shape Index, CSI
   approximate to 0.2-0.6). High angles of internal friction of this
   material were determined using direct shear, ranging from phi
   approximate to 41 to 49 degrees, while the round to angular gravel was
   characterized as phi = 33 degrees. The addition of 25\% of the elliptic
   plate-like sand-sized material to the gravel led to an immediate
   increase in friction angle to phi = 38 degrees. Furthermore,
   re-organization of the particles occurred during shearing, characterized
   by a short phase of settling and compaction, followed by a pronounced
   strong dilatory behavior and an accompanying strong increase of
   resistance to shear and, thus, shear stress. Long-term shearing (24 h)
   using a ring shear apparatus led to destruction of the particles without
   re-compaction. Finally, submerged particle mobilization was simulated
   using a tilted tray submerged in a waterfilled tank. Despite a smooth
   tray surface, particle motion was not initiated until reaching tray tilt
   angles of 31 degrees and more, being >= 7 degrees steeper than for
   motion initiation of the gravel mixtures. In conclusion, geotechnical
   laboratory experiments quantified the important impact of the elliptic,
   plate-like shape of Advocate Beach sand on the angles of internal
   friction of both pure sand and sand-gravel mixtures. The resulting
   effect on initiation of particle motion was confirmed in tilting tray
   experiments. This makes it a vivid example of how particle shape can
   contribute to the stabilization of the beach face.}},

Abstract = {{Perceived audio quality is an important metric in determining resilience
   of voice coding techniques against packet loss when streaming audio over
   Internet Protocol (IP) networks. For highly compressed audio, relatively
   small packet loss can dramatically reduce the quality of the
   reconstructed sound. A key strategy for decreasing the impact of packet
   loss on audio quality is the deployment of packet erasure coding which
   proactively sends the redundant packets used at the receiver to recover
   in part from lost data. In this paper, we present a testbed for voice
   quality monitoring with practical audio streaming applications. The
   paper provides architectural insights into the design and testing of
   erasure codes when combined with audio streaming applications. By
   adjusting packetization method and coding rates that maximize resistance
   to packet losses, we demonstrate that good voice quality can be obtained
   for a wide range of the raw packet loss rates in the IP networks for a
   variety of voice codes like G.711 and G.729.}},

Abstract = {{The high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals combined with nonlinear
   transmitter characteristics results in poor bit error rate (BER)
   performance and causes out-of-band spectrum regrowth of the waveforms
   entering the channel. A popular technique with low complexity to reduce
   nonlinear distortions in memoryless high power amplifiers (HPA) is
   amplitude clipping which limits the peak envelope of the HPA input to a
   predetermined level. This paper characterizes in-and out-of-band
   distortion as a result of clipping the Nyquist sampled OFDM signal which
   is then filtered and subsequently passed through the transmitter HPA.
   For transmitters with limited filtering of the HPA output, this offers a
   trade-off between out-of-band distortion reduction and in-band
   distortion increase in the transmitted OFDM signal. To this end, this
   paper documents spectral regrowth reduction versus irreducible BER using
   computer simulations. Also, to verify the feasibility of the
   predistortion system, the clipping and filtering has been implemented on
   a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a technique of applying multiple mass-spring type
   matching layers to high-frequency (>20MHz) imaging transducers, by using
   carefully controlled vacuum deposition. A vacuum deposited matching
   layer design has significant advantages over traditional quarter wave
   matching for high frequency transducers, because thin uniform layers
   with no adhesion layer can be used and the materials used with vacuum
   deposition exhibit lower acoustic losses than materials typically used
   for high frequency quarter wave matching. Two different 3 mm diameter 45
   MHz planar lithium niobate transducers and one geometrically curved 3 mm
   lithium niobate transducer were designed and fabricated using this
   matching layer approach with copper as the ``mass{''} layer and
   parylene-C as the ``spring{''} layer. The first planar lithium niobate
   transducer used a single mass-spring matching network and the second
   planar lithium niobate transducer used a single mass-spring network, to
   approximate the first layer in a dual quarter wavelength matching layer
   system in addition to a conventional quarter wavelength layer as the
   second matching layer. The curved lithium niobate was press focused and
   used a similar mass-spring + quarter wavelength matching layer network.
   These transducers were then compared with identical transducers with no
   matching layers and the performance improvement was quantified. The
   bandwidth of the lithium niobate transducer with the single mass-spring
   layer was measured to be 46 \% and the insertion loss was measured to be
   -21.9 dB. The bandwidth and insertion loss of the lithium niobate
   transducer with the mass-spring network plus quarter wavelength matching
   were measured to be 59 \% and -18.2 dB respectively. These values were
   compared to the unmatched transducer, which had a bandwidth and
   insertion loss of 28 \% and -34.1 dB. The bandwidth and insertion loss
   of the curved lithium niobate transducer with the mass-spring plus
   quarter wavelength matching layer combination were measured to be 68\%
   and -26 dB respectively. This compared to the measured unmatched
   bandwidth and insertion loss of 35 \% and -37 dB. All experimentally
   measured values were in excellent agreement with theoretical models.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the design, fabrication and characterization of a 50
   MHz Vernier array. The Vernier array was based on a 128 element
   transducer with half-wavelength pitch, where every third element was
   used for transmit, every forth element was used for receive and unused
   elements were left inactive. The array was a forward looking kerfless
   design based on a PZT-5H substrate with an element-to-element pitch of
   19 microns, and the probe was packaged in a 2.5 mm by 3.1 mm endoscopic
   form factor. The array was fabricated with a single
   P(VDF-TrFE)-copolymer matching layer and a polymethylpentene (TPX) lens
   for passive elevation focusing to a depth of 6 mm. To generate beam
   profiles, images and videos, the transducer was connected to an in-house
   developed 64-channel, high-frequency phased array beamformer. Near
   real-time radiation patterns and images were collected at a frame rate
   of 10 Hz. The performance of the Vernier array was directly compared to
   that of a previously developed phased array transducer with
   approximately one-wavelength pitch. Both transducers possessed similar
   two-way beamformed pulse bandwidths of 60\%. At large steering angles
   the Vernier array suppressed the grating lobe levels 15 dB over the
   previously developed phased array, however, as a result of the
   sparseness of the Vernier array, the measured two-way sensitivity was
   18.2 dB lower than the phased array with the fully active aperture.
   Experimental measurements were in good agreement with the theoretical
   predictions of 20dB grating lobe suppression and 22dB lower sensitivity
   than the phased array. Comparison images were generated of wire phantoms
   in a water bath as well as wire phantoms situated in a tissue phantom in
   order to assess the tradeoff between lower grating lobe levels at the
   expense of lower sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Crystalline relaxor-PT piezoelectrics poled in {[}001] can sometimes
   exhibit a second thickness-mode resonance in the impedance spectrum at a
   frequency lower than the resonance associated with longitudinal
   vibrations. In this study we investigate this low vibration mode (L VM)
   in PMN-PT single crystal. We show that the mode is a shear wave mode
   arising due to a polarization component lying in the (001) plane. The
   presence of the mode and its strength in the impedance spectrum can be
   controlled either by thermal quenching from a temperature above the
   tetragonal-rhombohedral transition temperature or through the
   application of a bias voltage during slower cooling. By varying the rate
   of cooling or the applied bias during cooling the impedance spectrum
   peak corresponding to the L VM can be enhanced in which case the usual
   longitudinal resonance peak is suppressed or the L VM can be suppressed
   in which case the longitudinal resonance is enhanced. Samples in which
   the L VM is enhanced exhibit a macroscopic orthorhombic symmetry (mm2)
   with a polarization vector lying along the {[}110] direction as
   demonstrated by the transverse vibration modes observed in samples cut
   to different crystallographic orientations. Samples in which the L VM is
   enhanced exhibit the same phase structure but different domain
   structures than samples in which it is suppressed. The L VM is
   characterized by a domain structure with (110) domain walls. These walls
   appear in the high-temperature tetragonal phase and can be frozen into
   the room temperature state by rapid quenching. Based on the
   compatibility of possible polarization directions and domain wall
   orientations with polarization microscopy observation of our samples,
   possible arrangements of the domain structures in the rhombohedral and
   tetragonal phases are determined. It is shown that the {[}110]
   polarization component associated with the L VM originates from a domain
   structure with well-organized (110) domain walls.}},

Abstract = {{A set of prototype RF delay lines have been developed in order to meet
   the required bandwidth, delay accuracy, and delay range requirements for
   a previously developed 64 channel endoscopic phased array prototype.
   Each delay line is based on a planar PMN-32\% PT pulseecho transducer
   situated in a water bath, reflecting off a polished brass reflector. The
   pulse-echo transducers are mounted on individual in-house fabricated
   piezoelectric bimorphs, which are `simply' supported. This creates an
   electronic delay time proportional to the distance between the
   single-element transducer and the reflecting surface in the water bath.
   When the physical length between the transducer and the reflecting
   surface is changed, the delay time also changes. A variable high voltage
   signal causes bimorph actuation and, in turn, the variable delays. The
   experimentally measured centre frequency and bandwidth for the pulse
   echo transducers was 45 MHz and 60\% respectively. The pulse echo
   insertion loss without considering water attenuation or loss into the
   brass reflector was measured to be -20.8 dB, therefore one single
   low-noise amplifier with 20 dB gain was required for each delay line to
   have zero insertion loss. The signal-to-noise ratio was only decreased
   by 1.1dB with this amplifier in place. The total delay range measured by
   adjusting the bimorph voltage by +/- 80V was 1.4 mu s, and the
   accuracy/repeatability of the pulse delay was less than 3ns. To date 16
   channels of individually controlled parallel delays have been fabricated
   and the fabrication/testing of a full 64 channel system is ongoing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm to implement Central
   Routing (CR) as an alternative to the existing approaches to avoid full
   mesh topology in internal border gateway protocol (iBGP). BGP is a key
   protocol to exchange routing information within an Autonomous System
   (AS) and among various ASes. All the routers inside an AS have to be
   connected in full mesh topology to run iBGP protocol to make discoveries
   such as the selection of root node and the exchange of information. A
   full mesh topology becomes cumbersome and hard to manage as a network
   grows. For large networks alternatives to a full mesh topology are
   available such as route reflectors and BGP confederation at the cost of
   increased overheads and the possibility of network inconsistencies. The
   concept of CR is an alternative solution, where the root node in an AS
   is responsible for all the control and management operations such as
   maintaining routing tables and calculating paths. The proposed CR based
   scheme has been implemented through simulations and the results prove CR
   to be a successful alternative of route reflectors and BGP
   confederation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the lack of availability of micro-data of population
   characteristics, the synthesis of individual and household attributes is
   a necessary step for developing a disaggregate, dynamic travel demand
   forecasting model. Agent-based micro-simulation models attempt to
   forecast travel behaviour of individuals and households by simulating
   the behaviour of the singular actors in the system. The framework for
   generating synthesis population presented in this paper is a fundamental
   contribution to the development of an Integrated Transport, Land Use and
   Environment Modelling System in Nova Scotia, Canada. In this paper, a
   population is synthesized for individuals and households in Atlantic
   Canada using the Fitness Based Synthesis (FBS) approach. A synthetic
   algorithm is designed that allows both individual and household
   attribute levels to synthesize simultaneously. Unequal probabilities
   based on the sampling weight are used in the household selection step of
   the algorithm. In this way, the performance and accuracy of the
   synthetic population produced has been improved. The synthetic algorithm
   is tested for two functions: first, using the one level (household)
   control tables; and second, using two levels (individual and household)
   control tables. The data used in this study is collected from the 2006
   Canadian Census and the 2006 Public Use Micro-data File (PUMF). The
   algorithm is implemented using a high-level matrix programming language
   for numerical computation in MATLAB. The results show that the synthetic
   population with both individual and household level attributes has the
   best fitness value. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{A Planar Magnetically Coupled Resonant Wireless Power Transfer System
   Using Printed Spiral Coils}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Abstract = {{A fully planar wireless power transfer (WPT) system via strongly coupled
   magnetic resonances is presented. In it, both the transmitter and the
   receiver are planarized with the use of coplanar printed spiral coils
   (PSCs) and a printed loop. An equivalent circuit model of the proposed
   planar WPT system is derived to facilitate the design, and a flowchart
   is provided for the optimization of the system with given size
   constraints. To realize high peak power transfer efficiency, the quality
   factor of individual loop or resonator, the mutual coupling between
   resonators, and the frequency splitting phenomenon of the system are
   analyzed in addition to the effect of the input impedance of the system
   on the transmission efficiency. Furthermore, parallel current paths are
   created by applying auxiliary strips to the backside of the substrates
   and connecting to the prime resonators using vias to decrease the
   resistance and to increase the quality factor of the PSC resonators, and
   this in turn further improves the transfer efficiency of the proposed
   planar WPT system. The measured results show that the proposed WPT
   system is able to provide a stable wireless power transfer with up to
   81.68\% efficiency at a distance of 10 cm. The planar structure and the
   high transfer efficiency make the proposed design a suitable candidate
   for wireless power transfer of small portable electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Water safety plans provide a relatively new management approach for
   identifying and addressing risks in a water supply. In 2011, the
   province of Alberta (Canada) became the first jurisdiction in North
   America to require that all water supplies develop drinking water safety
   plans (DWSPs). This research explored the implementation of DWSPs
   through the experiences of `early adopter' operators who work in small
   communities. Specifically, in-person open-ended qualitative interviews
   with operators from 15 small communities from across Alberta were
   conducted to explore implementation challenges and opportunities. The
   findings highlight a number of barriers associated with the
   relationships between decision-making bodies, regulatory authorities and
   water operators, all of which have the potential to support or hinder
   the uptake of a DWSP. Findings also indicate that a DWSP can act as a
   bridge, providing a much-needed tool to facilitate communication about
   water supplies and help to support and manage relationships between
   stakeholders. This study revealed a number of important and useful
   insights to the small community early DWSP adopter experience in Canada
   that could be applied in other jurisdictions looking to adopt similar
   practices.}},

   combining location and spherical coordinate feature representation. The
   proposed approach utilizes the feature representation in spherical
   coordinate system effectively depicting the kinematic connectivity among
   hand, wrist and elbow for recognition. Meanwhile, 3D trajectory data
   acquired from Kinect avoid the interference of the illumination change
   and cluttered background. In experiments with a dataset of 20 gestures
   from Chinese sign language, the Extreme Learning Machine(ELM) is tested,
   compared with Support Vector Machine(SVM), the superior recognition

Abstract = {{A low-profile broadband omnidirectional multiple-input and
   multiple-output (MIMO) antenna with dual polarization is presented,
   which provides polarization diversity for the 4G Long Term Evolution
   (LTE) communication systems, networks, and base stations. It consists of
   two orthogonally polarized radiating elements with separate feeds. The
   horizontally-polarized element is comprised of four pairs of flag-shaped
   dipoles, four parasitical strips, and a balun with tapered striplines
   for balance-unbalance transition. It has a fractional bandwidth of 55\%
   covering from 1.7 GHz to 3.0 GHz with return loss greater than 10 dB and
   an overall size of 43x43x1.6 mm(3). The vertically polarized element
   consists of a discone antenna, a round sleeve, and a top-loading ring
   shorted to the ground-plane for bandwidth enhancement. It has a
   fractional bandwidth of 137\% covering from 671 MHz to 3580 MHz, and an
   overall volume of 170x170x56 mm(3). The measurement results show both
   antenna elements exhibit smooth gain over the operational bandwidth. In
   addition, the geometrical shape and compactness of the proposed design,
   along with the omnidirectional radiation patterns, makes it ideal for
   ceiling or surface-mounted 4G LTE applications.}},

Title = {{Pulse Rate Variability Estimation Method Based on Sliding Window
   Iterative DFT and Hilbert Transform}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{347-355}},
Abstract = {{An approach for deriving pulse rate variability (PRV) from
   photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is proposed. By combining sliding
   window iterative discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with the Hilbert
   transform algorithm, this method effectively reduces the influence of
   noise and sampling frequency compared with those of traditional methods.
   First, the fundamental component of the PPG signal is computed with the
   sliding window iterative DFT algorithm. Then, it is processed by an
   integer coefficient low-pass filter and the Hilbert transform to produce
   an instantaneous pulse rate (IPR). Finally, PRV is extracted from IPR in
   the frequency domain. PRV is also derived from the PPG signal in the
   time domain for comparison with that derived using the proposed method.
   Furthermore, PRV obtained from PPG signals at various sampling
   frequencies and with various noise levels is investigated. The results
   show that the proposed method can accurately derive PRV from PPG
   signals, even if the PPG signal has a low sampling frequency (4 Hz) and
   high noise (e.g., SNR is about 3.0). The experimental results indicate
   that the proposed method can be used to estimate PRV when the subjects
   are in different states (rest, sleeping, or visual fatigue). Moreover,
   the proposed method is efficient and thus suitable for detecting PRV in
   real time. It has potential for PRV assessment in various medical
   fields, such as home health and clinical and hospital environments.}},

Abstract = {{Deterministic code-based designs proposed for wind turbine foundations
   are typically biased on the conservative side, and overestimate the
   probability of failure, which can lead to higher than necessary
   construction cost. In this study reliability analysis of a gravity-based
   foundation, concerning its bearing capacity, is used to calibrate a
   code-based design procedure. A probabilistic finite-element model is
   developed to analyse the bearing capacity of a surface footing on soil
   with spatially variable undrained strength. Monte Carlo simulation is
   combined with a re-sampling simulation technique to perform the
   reliability analysis. The calibrated code-based design approach leads to
   savings of up to 20\% in the concrete foundation volume, depending on
   the target annual reliability level. The study can form the basis for
   future optimisation on deterministic-based designs for wind turbine

Title = {{Confined flow of suspensions modelled by a frictional rheology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{759}},
Abstract = {{We investigate in detail the problem of confined pressure-driven laminar
   flow of neutrally buoyant non-Brownian suspensions using a frictional
   rheology based on the recent proposal of Boyer et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett.,
   vol. 107 (18), 2011, 188301). The friction coefficient (shear stress
   over particle normal stress) and solid volume fraction are taken as
   functions of the dimensionless viscous number I defined as the ratio
   between the fluid shear stress and the particle normal stress. We
   clarify the contributions of the contact and hydrodynamic interactions
   on the evolution of the friction coefficient between the dilute and
   dense regimes reducing the phenomenological constitutive description to
   three physical parameters. We also propose an extension of this
   constitutive framework from the flowing regime (bounded by the maximum
   flowing solid volume fraction) to the fully jammed state (the random
   close packing limit). We obtain an analytical solution of the fully
   developed flow in channel and pipe for the frictional suspension
   rheology. The result can be transposed to dry granular flow upon
   appropriate redefinition of the dimensionless number I. The predictions
   are in excellent agreement with available experimental results for
   neutrally buoyant suspensions, when using the values of the constitutive
   parameters obtained independently from stress-controlled rheological
   measurements. In particular, the frictional rheology correctly predicts
   the transition from Poiseuille to plug flow and the associated particles
   migration with the increase of the entrance solid volume fraction. We
   also numerically solve for the axial development of the flow from the
   inlet of the channel/pipe toward the fully developed state. The
   available experimental data are in good agreement with our numerical
   predictions, when using an accepted phenomenological description of the
   relative phase slip obtained independently from batch-settlement
   experiments. The solution of the axial development of the flow notably
   provides a quantitative estimation of the entrance length effect in a
   pipe for suspensions when the continuum assumption is valid.
   Practically, the latter requires that the predicted width of the central
   (jammed) plug is wider than one particle diameter. A simple analytical
   expression for development length, inversely proportional to the
   gap-averaged diffusivity of a frictional suspension, is shown to
   encapsulate the numerical solution in the entire range of flow
   conditions from dilute to dense.}},

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{135-143}},
Abstract = {{Produced water is a major wastewater stream in the oil and gas industry
   which typically consists of dispersed and dissolved oils, and high
   levels of salinity. Despite concerns that dissolved aromatics in
   produced water may be detrimental to marine life, discharge regulations
   and treatment technologies for produced water largely focus on dispersed
   oil and grease removal. The purpose of this research project was to
   investigate coagulation with ferric chloride (FeCl3) and dissolved air
   flotation (DAF) at bench-scale for the removal of both dispersed and
   dissolved oils from synthetic and offshore produced water samples, with
   a specific focus on the impact of salinity on the coagulation process.
   Coagulation and DAF treatment of the produced water samples achieved
   high removals of dispersed oil and grease, but had limited impact on
   dissolved aromatics. The coagulation process in the saline produced
   water samples reduced dispersed oil and grease concentrations from 100
   mg/L to below North American discharge limits (i.e. 30 mg/L in Canada,
   29 mg/L in the USA) under all conditions tested, while the effectiveness
   of coagulation treatment in the fresh water synthetic samples was highly

Pages = {{144-162}},
Abstract = {{Water temperature is an important component for water quality and biotic
   conditions in rivers. A good knowledge of river thermal regime is
   critical for the management of aquatic resources and environmental
   impact studies. The objective of the present study was to develop a
   water temperature model as a function of air temperatures, water
   temperatures and water level data using artificial neural network (ANN)
   techniques for two thermally different streams. This model was applied
   on an hourly basis. The results showed that ANN models are an effective
   modeling tool with overall root-mean-square-error of 0.94 and 1.23
   degrees C, coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.967 and 0.962 and
   bias of -0.13 and 0.02 degrees C, for Catamaran Brook and the Little
   Southwest Miramichi River, respectively. The ANN model performed best in
   summer and autumn and showed a poorer performance in spring. Results of
   the present study showed similar or better results to those of
   deterministic and stochastic models. The present study shows that the
   predicted hourly water temperatures can also be used to estimate the
   mean and maximum daily water temperatures. The many advantages of ANN
   models are their simplicity, low data requirements, their capability of
   modeling long-term time series as well as having an overall good

Abstract = {{We present measurements of a long-range smoke transport event recorded
   on 20-21 July 2011 over Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, during the
   Quantifying the impact of BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants
   over the Atlantic using Aircraft and Satellites (BORTAS-B) campaign.
   Ground-based Fourier transform spectrometers and photometers detected
   air masses associated with large wild-land fires burning in eastern
   Manitoba and western Ontario.
   We investigate a plume with high trace gas amounts but low amounts of
   particles that preceded and overlapped at the Halifax site with a second
   plume with high trace gas loadings and significant amounts of
   particulate material. We show that the first plume experienced a
   meteorological scavenging event, but the second plume had not been
   similarly scavenged. This points to the necessity to account carefully
   for the plume history when considering long-range transport since
   simultaneous or near-simultaneous times of arrival are not necessarily
   indicative of either similar trajectories or meteorological history. We
   investigate the origin of the scavenged plume, and the possibility of an
   aerosol wet deposition event occurring in the plume similar to 24 h
   prior to the measurements over Halifax. The region of lofting and
   scavenging is only monitored on an intermittent basis by the present

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the results of an experimental investigation into four
   potential explanatory factors (i.e. Fe(II) ions, pH, phosphate and
   reaction time) with different levels, and their influence in the
   formation of haloacetic acids (HAAs) in water samples are presented.
   This study revealed that Fe(II) ions (p = 0.0001), phosphate based
   corrosion inhibitor (p = 0.01) and pH (p = 0.003) were the main
   significant factors for HAAs formation. A change in Fe(II) ions
   concentration from 0 to 3 mg/L, and PO4 dosage from 0 to 1.5 mg/L,
   decreased HAAs formation by more than 50 and 14\% respectively. In
   contrast, HAAs formation was observed to increase 7.92\% with the
   increase in pH values from 6.5 to 8.5 in the same reaction systems.
   Considering all of the significant factors, a predictive model for HAAs
   formation was developed using 40 experiments. The adequacy of the
   developed model was checked statistically using numerical and graphical
   diagnostics. The model was found to be statistically significant, and
   the lack of fit test was found to be insignificant. An independent data
   set, obtained from HAAs formation study using the natural water samples
   collected from three main water treatment plants in Nova Scotia, Canada,
   was used to validate the model.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{92-100}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the findings of the modeling of mobility tool
   ownership of the youth population in the greater Toronto and Hamilton
   area (GTHA) in Ontario, Canada. Research on mobility tool ownership is
   limited. The key contribution of the research is to enhance the
   understanding of how neighborhood characteristics and accessibility
   affect mobility tool ownership among GTHA youth. The study exclusively
   considered youth between the ages of 17 and 19 years; at this age the
   subjects passed through a transitional stage in the GTHA because of
   opportunities for ownership of types of mobility tools. This study used
   data from the 2006 Transportation Tomorrow Survey, a household-based
   travel survey of the GTHA. The study used a latent class choice modeling
   approach to account for unobserved heterogeneity, which was often
   ignored in traditional choice modeling. The results suggest that the
   latent class logit model outperforms the conventional multinomial logit
   model according to model fit and its ability to evaluate various
   parameters across latent classes. Several sociodemographic
   characteristics, trip attributes, accessibility measures, and
   neighborhood characteristics were found to explain different types of
   mobility tool ownership of the youth population. Finally, the results
   revealed that latent heterogeneity existed in the sampled population.
   The research offers important behavioral insights into the formation of
   travel habits of youth that could be useful in shaping the travel
   behavior of Toronto's young adults.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, small amounts of either Ir or Ru (up to 22 mu g cm(-2).)
   were added to 85 mu g cm(-2) Pt by either co-sputtering or over-layer
   sputtering onto 3M Company's NSTF catalyst support, which was grown on
   glassy carbon electrodes for the purpose of simulating fuel cell
   start-up and shut-down with rotating disk electrode techniques. The
   transient cathode potentials caused by fuel cell start-up, shut-down and
   operating conditions were simulated with a combination of potentiostatic
   and galvanostatic holds. Constant potential was used to simulate fuel
   cell run, rest and idle, and constant current was used to simulate the
   start-up and shut-down events. Over the course of an experiment, the
   catalyst would experience potential as low as 0.650 V-RHE (run) and as
   high as 1.53-1.8 V-RHE (dependent on the behavior of the composition)
   under the galvanostatic holds. All compositions including either Ir or
   Ru lasted significantly longer than for pure Pt under repeated
   start-up/shut-down. The stability of the over-layer Ir-Pt compositions
   was significantly higher than for the co-sputtered deposition. The
   compositions containing 9 and 22 mu g cm(-2) Ir over-layer on Pt showed
   no ORR activity decrease over the course of 1400 SU/SD simulations (2800

Journal = {{BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1659-1671}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Photo-crosslinking of biomolecules such as collagen and
   fibrinogen is an emerging area of research interest. The use of a small
   dental curing light with a non-toxic photosensitizer represents a novel,
   practical approach to periodontal wound treatment.
   OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of riboflavin-sensitized
   photo-oxidation using a dental curing light on two collagenous
   biomaterials, as a preliminary step towards developing a medical
   technology for wound closure/healing.
   METHODS: A collagenous biomaterial (DBP) and type I collagen gels were
   treated by this photo-oxidative technique and characterized by
   hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) analysis, amino acid analysis,
   SDS-PAGE, and rheology.
   RESULTS: HIT analysis suggested that dental curing light exposure for
   300 s with riboflavin produced heavily crosslinked DBP. Dental curing
   light exposure for 300 s with riboflavin also showed a reduction in
   lysine concentration of DBP. SDS-PAGE showed that dental curing light
   exposure for 30 or 300 s with riboflavin resulted in crosslinked
   collagen gels. Dental curing light exposure for 30 s with riboflavin
   yielded a collagen gel with the strongest rheological characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: This novel approach to wound treatment has potential for
   wide adoption and clinical use, particularly because dental curing
   lights, riboflavin, and collagen biomaterials are all used clinically,
   but not yet combined together as one technology for broad application.}},

Title = {{ZEQoS: A New Energy and QoS-Aware Routing Protocol for Communication of
   Sensor Devices in Healthcare System}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel integrated energy and QoS-aware routing
   protocol with the considerations of energy, end-to-end latency, and
   reliability requirements of body area network (BAN) communication. The
   proposed routing protocol, called ZEQoS, introduces two main modules
   (MAC layer and network layer) and three algorithms (neighbor table
   constructor, routing table constructor, and path selector). To handle
   ordinary packets (OPs), delay-sensitive packets (DSPs), and
   reliability-sensitive packets (RSPs), the new mechanism first calculates
   the communication costs, end-to-end path delays, and end-to-end path
   reliabilities of all possible paths from a source to destination. The
   protocol then selects the best possible path(s) for OPs, RSPs, and DSPs
   by considering their QoS requirement. Extensive simulations using
   OMNeT++ based simulator Castalia 3.2 demonstrate that the performance of
   the proposed integrated algorithm is satisfactory when tested on a real
   hospital scenario, and all data types including OPs, DSPs, and RSPs are
   used as offered traffic. Simulations also show that the ZEQoS also
   offers better performance in terms of higher throughput, less packets
   dropped on MAC and network layers, and lower network traffic than
   comparable protocols including DMQoS and no Routing.}},

Title = {{Municipal water quantities and health in Nunavut households: an
   exploratory case study in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, Canada}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Abstract = {{Background: Access to adequate quantities of water has a protective
   effect on human health and well-being. Despite this, public health
   research and interventions are frequently focused solely on water
   quality, and international standards for domestic water supply minimums
   are often overlooked or unspecified. This trend is evident in Inuit and
   other Arctic communities even though numerous transmissible diseases and
   bacterium infections associated with inadequate domestic water
   quantities are prevalent.
   Objectives. Our objective was to explore the pathways by which the
   trucked water distribution systems being used in remote northern
   communities are impacting health at the household level, with
   consideration given to the underlying social and environmental
   determinants shaping health in the region.
   Methods. Using a qualitative case study design, we conducted 37
   interviews (28 residents, 9 key informants) and a review of government
   water documents to investigate water usage practices and perspectives.
   These data were thematically analysed to understand potential health
   risks in Arctic communities and households.
   Results. Each resident receives an average of 110 litres of municipal
   water per day. Fifteen of 28 households reported experiencing water
   shortages at least once per month. Of those 15, most were larger
   households (5 people or more) with standard sized water storage tanks.
   Water shortages and service interruptions limit the ability of some
   households to adhere to public health advice. The households most
   resilient, or able to cope with domestic water supply shortages, were
   those capable of retrieving their own drinking water directly from lake
   and river sources. Residents with extended family and neighbours, whom
   they can rely on during shortages, were also less vulnerable to
   municipal water delays.
   Conclusions. The relatively low in-home water quantities observed in
   Coral Harbour, Nunavut, appear adequate for some families. Those living
   in overcrowded households, however, are accessing water in quantities
   more typically seen in water insecure developing countries. We recommend
   several practical interventions and revisions to municipal water supply
   systems.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},

Abstract = {{The Li-Mn-Ni-O system has received much attention for potential positive
   electrode materials in lithium ion batteries. In recent work the phase
   diagram under certain experimental conditions has been mapped out. Using
   the phase diagram as a guide, it is possible to select compositions near
   the boundary of the layered region that are layered-layered
   nano-composites or are single phase layered depending on the synthesis
   conditions. Some compositions are single phase layered no matter what
   synthesis conditions are used. Other compositions near LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2,
   which lie near the boundary of the single phase layered region, can
   either be single phase layered when quenched or a layered-layered
   nano-composite if cooled more slowly in an oxygen poor atmosphere or be
   a three phase material if cooled slowly in an oxygen rich atmosphere.
   Here, XRD and electrochemical data are reported on samples synthesized
   under various oxygen partial pressures for both quenched and slow cooled
   samples. These results are related to the phase diagram in order to
   better understand the consequences of the structural changes taking
   place during cooling on the electrochemistry. Single phase samples show
   excellent charge-discharge capacity and reversibility. However, there is
   a dramatic decrease in capacity in samples showing the first signs of
   forming a layered-layered nano-composite, suggesting that
   layered-layered nano-composites should be avoided. (C) 2014 The

Journal = {{MATRIX BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Due to the high occurrence rate of overextension injuries to tendons and
   ligaments, it is important to understand the fundamental mechanisms of
   damage to these tissues' primary load-bearing elements: collagen fibrils
   and their constituent molecules. Based on our recent observations of a
   new subrupture, overload-induced mode of fibril disruption that we call
   discrete plasticity, we have sought in the current study to re-explore
   whether the tensile overload of collagen fibrils can alter the helical
   conformation of collagen molecules. In order to accomplish this, we have
   analyzed the conformation of collagen molecules within repeatedly
   overloaded tendons in relation to their undamaged matched-pair controls
   using both differential scanning calorimetry and variable temperature
   trypsin digestion susceptibility. We find that tensile overload reduces
   the specific enthalpy of denaturation of tendons, and increases their
   susceptibility to trypsin digestion, even when the digestion is carried
   out at temperatures as low as 4 C. Our results indicate that the tensile
   overload of collagen fibrils can uncoil the helix of collagen molecules,
   placing them in a stable, denatured state. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to investigate the influence
   of a non-Newtonian blood analog of aqueous xanthan gum on flow
   separation in laminar and transitional environments and in both steady
   and pulsatile flow. Initial steady pressure drop measurements in laminar
   and transitional flow for a Newtonian analog showed an extension of
   laminar behavior to Reynolds number (Re) similar to 2900 for the
   non-Newtonian case. On a macroscale level, this showed good agreement
   with porcine blood. Subsequently, PIV was used to measure flow patterns
   and turbulent statistics downstream of an axisymmetric stenosis in the
   aqueous xanthan gum solution and for a Newtonian analog at Re similar to
   520 and Re similar to 1250. The recirculation length for the
   non-Newtonian case was reduced at Re similar to 520 resultant from
   increased viscosity at low shear strain rates. At Re similar to 1250,
   peak turbulent intensities and turbulent shear stresses were dampened by
   the non-Newtonian fluid in close proximity to the blockage outlet.
   Although the non-Newtonian case's recirculation length was increased at
   peak pulsatile flow, turbulent shear stress was found to be elevated for
   the Newtonian case downstream from the blockage, suggesting shear layer
   fragmentation and radial transport. Our findings conclude that the
   xanthan gum elastic polymer prolongs flow stabilization, which in turn
   emphasizes the importance of non-Newtonian blood characteristics on the
   resulting flow patterns in such cardiovascular environments.}},

Title = {{Variable rate spreader for real-time spot-application of granular
   fertilizer in wild blueberry}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{70-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The commercial variable rate (VR) fertilizer spreader can change
   fertilizer rates in different management zones using global positioning
   system (GPS) guided prescription maps. The VR fertilizer spreader allows
   the independent control only on half of the fertilizer boom (3.66 m; 6
   nozzles). This existing VR fertilizer spreader fertilizes unevenly
   distributed small sized bare spots/weed patches which are less than half
   boom length in wild blueberry fields. Therefore, the existing VR
   fertilizer spreader was modified to control each pair of nozzles for
   spot-application of fertilizer only in plant areas. The automated
   sensing and control system consisting of 6 mu Eye color cameras,
   solenoid valves, pneumatic cylinders, programmable logic controller
   (PLC), 8-channel VR controller (VRC) interfaced to a pocket PC (PPC)
   using wireless Bluetooth (R) radio with Windows Mobile (R) and a custom
   software was developed. The mu Eye color cameras were mounted on a
   separate boom in front of the tractor at a height of 1.2 m. The modified
   VR spreader was capable of using prescription maps and automated sensing
   and control system simultaneously to detect foliage/bare spots in
   real-time to avoid fertilization in bare spots/weed patches. The
   ACCU-RATE controller calibration and response time calculations were
   performed prior to field experiment.
   The results of calibration tests for the ACCU-RATE controller suggested
   <5\% deviation when compared with the manually measured application
   rate. The results of response time revealed that the maximum of 2.38 s
   and 2.25 s were taken to dispense clay filler and fertilizer
   respectively, after detection of the target. In order to assess the
   real-time performance accuracy of modified variable rate granular (MVRG)
   fertilizer spreader grass and wild blueberry fields were selected.
   Artificial bare spots were made using orange colored tarps in the
   selected grass field and equal numbers of weighed rat catchers were
   placed on artificial bare spots and grass.-The MVRG fertilizer spreader
   was operated on VR mode (detection and no application in artificial bare
   spots) and the rat catchers were collected and re-weighed. The same
   procedure was repeated for uniform (UN) application mode of the system
   (application on both grass and artificial bare spots). This test was
   repeated for wild blueberry field to detect bare spots and plants for
   spot-application of fertilizer only in plant areas. The results of
   paired t-tests showed significant difference (P-value < 0.0001) between
   VR and UN treatments when the clay filler weight collected from bare
   spots were compared for both fields. The results showed non-significant
   difference (P-value > 0.05) between VR and UN treatments in grass/plant
   areas. These results suggested that the MVRG fertilizer spreader was
   efficient and accurate for spot-application of fertilizer to increase
   farm profitability and reduce environmental risks. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel nonlinear signal processing technology, which is
   denoted as the polarity-invariant square law (PISL) algorithm, is
   proposed to compensate nonlinear distortions caused by monobit
   digitization and to mitigate the performance degradation of impulse
   radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) receivers employing monobit
   analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). An analytical framework based on
   characteristic functions has been developed to evaluate bit error rates
   of monobit transmitted-reference (TR) receivers and performance
   improvement offered by the PISL algorithm. Both theoretical analysis and
   simulations show that by employing the PISL algorithm, the monobit
   weighted TR (MWTR) receivers can achieve a bit-error-rate performance
   that is more than 10 dB over the direct-reference algorithm and is less
   than 1.5 dB away from the performance bound of the MWTR receivers in
   intravehicle UWB channels. Furthermore, the MWTR receiver employing the
   PISL algorithm is insensitive to a correlation interval; this feature
   not only reduces complexity of the receiver design but also ensures
   performance robustness over various multipath channels. Therefore, the
   PISL algorithm can be considered an enabling technology for the monobit
   IR-UWB receivers that demand high performance, lower power consumption,
   and low complexity.}},

Title = {{Bench-scale evaluation of drinking water treatment parameters on iron
   particles and water quality}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Discoloration of water resulting from suspended iron particles is one of
   the main customer complaints received by water suppliers. However,
   understanding of the mechanisms of discoloration as well as role of
   materials involved in the process is limited. In this study, an array of
   bench scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of the
   most common variables (pH, PO4, Cl-2 and DOM) on the properties of iron
   particles and suspensions derived from the oxygenation of Fe(II) ions in
   NaHCO3 buffered synthetic water systems. The most important factors as
   well as their rank influencing iron suspension color and turbidity
   formation were identified for a range of water quality parameters. This
   was accomplished using a 2(4) full factorial design approach at a 95\%
   confidence level. The statistical analysis revealed that phosphate was
   found to be the most significant factor to alter color (contribution:
   37.9\%) and turbidity (contribution: 45.5\%) in an iron-water system. A
   comprehensive study revealed that phosphate and chlorine produced iron
   suspension with reduced color and turbidity, made zeta-potential more
   negative, reduced the average particle size, and increased iron
   suspension stability. In the presence of DOM, color was observed to
   increase but a reverse trend was observed to decrease the turbidity and
   to alter particle size distribution. HPSEC results suggest that higher
   molecular weight fractions of DOM tend to adsorb onto the surfaces of
   iron particles at early stages, resulting in alteration of the surface
   charge of iron particles. This in turn limits particles aggregation and
   makes iron colloids highly stable. In the presence of a phosphate based
   corrosion inhibitor, this study demonstrated that color and turbidity
   resulting from suspended iron were lower at a pH value of 6.5 (compared
   to pH of 8.5). The same trend was observed in presence of DOM. This
   study also suggested that iron colloid suspension color and turbidity in
   chlorinated drinking water systems could be lower than non-chlorinated
   systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a 40-MHz, 64-element phased-array transducer packaged
   in a 2.5 x 3.1 mm endoscopic form factor. The array is a forward-looking
   semi-kerfed design based on a 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3 -0.32PbTiO(3)
   (PMN-32\%PT) single-crystal wafer with an element-to-element pitch of 38
   mu m. To achieve a miniaturized form factor, a novel technique of wire
   bonding the array elements to a polyimide flexible circuit board
   oriented parallel to the forward-looking ultrasound beam and
   perpendicular to the array was developed. A technique of partially
   dicing into the back of the array was also implemented to improve the
   directivity of the array elements. The array was fabricated with a
   single-layer P(VDF-TrFE)-copolymer matching layer and a
   polymethylpentene (TPX) lens for passive elevation focusing to a depth
   of 7 mm. The two-way -6-dB pulse bandwidth was measured to be 55\% and
   the average electromechanical coupling (k(eff)) for the individual
   elements was measured to be 0.62. The one-way -6-dB directivities from
   several array elements were measured to be +/- 20 degrees, which was
   shown to be an improvement over an identical kerfless array. The -3-dB
   elevation focus resulting from the TPX lens was measured to be 152 mu m
   at the focal depth, and the focused lateral resolution was measured to
   be 80 mu m at a steering angle of 0 degrees. To generate beam profiles
   and images, the probe was connected to a commercial ultrasound imaging
   platform which was reprogrammed to allow for phased array transmit
   beamforming and receive data collection. The collected RF data were then
   processed offline using a numerical computing script to generate sector
   images. The radiation pattern for the beamformed transmit pulse was
   collected along with images of wire phantoms in water and
   tissue-equivalent medium with a dynamic range of 60 dB. Finally, ex vivo
   tissue images were generated of porcine brain tissue.}},

Abstract = {{KPCA algorithm can solve the problem of nonlinear characteristic that
   the PCA algorithm can't handle with and the traditional curvelet
   decomposition algorithm cannot take full advantage of the fine scale
   component information. So we put forward KPCA algorithm and data fusion
   algorithm. The KPCA algorithm has a good effect on extracting face
   contour and the curve detail information through internal nonlinear
   kernel function. Data fusion algorithm can make use of different scale
   of image which decomposed by curvelet according to certain proportion.
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) has the strong ability of classification of
   small samples and the advantage of dealing with nonlinear and high
   dimension. In this paper, the KPCA and SVM methods were combined with
   and used for face recognition. At first, the paper made use of the
   low-frequency of the face images decomposed by curvelet transform, then
   the feature vectors were extracted by KPCA, and the strategy of ``one vs
   one{''} of SVM was chosen to perform recognition. The results based on
   the ORL and Yale shows the success of KPCA+SVM employed in face
   recognition. Then the curvelet faces were reduced dimension by PCA. The
   coarse information and the fine information were combined by data
   fusion. The results based on the ORL shows the success of data fusion
   employed in face recognition.}},

   lead-lag controller is first designed on the basis of classical theory
   of control systems using root-locus technique. The controller is then
   equivalently converted into a PID controller. The application of the
   derivative part of the PID controller on the output voltage signal
   rather than on the output voltage error signal reduces both the maximum
   percent overshoot and the settling time. The modified but improved form
   of PID controller is known as PID controller with Derivative on Output

   controller for the easier implementation. MATLAB/Simulink based

Abstract = {{As an important component of the driver assistance system or autonomous
   vehicle, traffic-sign recognition can provide drivers or vehicles with
   safety and alert information about the road. This paper proposes a new
   method for the task of traffic-sign recognition by employing extreme
   learning machine (ELM) whose infrastructure is a single-hidden-layer
   feed-forward network. This method includes two stages: One is the
   training stage which estimates the parameters of ELM based on training
   images of traffic signs; the other is the recognition stage which
   identifies each test image by using the trained ELM.
   Histogram-of-gradient descriptors are used as features in this proposed
   method. The German traffic sign recognition benchmark data set {[}1]
   with more than 50000 images of German road signs over 43 classes is
   used. Experimental results have shown that this proposed method achieves
   not only high recognition precision but also extremely low computational
   cost in terms of both training and recognition stages. An outstanding
   balance between recognition ratio and computational speed is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{An important part for sign language expression is hand shape, and the 3D
   hand motion trajectories also contain abundant information to interpret

   extracted from the depth images and spherical coordinate (SPC) feature
   extracted from the 3D hand motion trajectories combine to make up the
   final feature representation. The new representation not only
   incorporates both the spatial and temporal information to depict the
   kinematic connectivity among hand, wrist and elbow for recognition
   effectively but also avoids the interference of the illumination change
   and cluttered background compared with other methods. Meanwhile, our
   self-built dataset includes 320 instances to evaluate the effectiveness
   of our combining feature. In experiments with the dataset and different

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing debate to determine which engineering design
   projects provide the greatest learning opportunity for students.
   Variations include: whether the client is hypothetical, from industry,
   or a member of a community organization, whether the product is a paper
   design, prototype, or fully functioning product, and whether the length
   of the project is a few weeks long, multi-semester, or multi-year. In
   order to compare the merit of each of the factors and measure the impact
   on student learning, an assessment technique must be developed.
   While students develop many versatile skills through design projects,
   such as communication, teamwork, leadership, and engineering science
   content, the largest impact is shown in students' ability to design.
   Design projects can be the sole location that students are exposed to
   lessons in how to design, so this is the ideal skill to measure, as it
   is less likely to be affected by external factors.
   Using a combination of four-point Likert scale items, multiple-choice
   questions relating to a design scenario, and quantitative
   self-assessment, a design ability assessment technique was piloted in
   the Winter of 2013 at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The
   design ability construct was defined as an ability to define the
   problem, evaluate alternatives, and communicate the design. This was
   derived from a literature review and accreditation materials. Four-point
   Likert-scale items were also included concerning ethical awareness,
   which was defined as knowledge of equal treatment of all persons,
   ethical conduct in all situations, appreciating cultural diversity for
   all ethnicities, and possessing a keen awareness of engineers'
   responsibility to society.
   The quantitative instrument was piloted to 240 students with a 10\%
   response rate. While some items displayed a statistically significant
   result, other items were highly skewed, indicating a poorly written
   item. Using this information, the instrument was updated and is in the
   process of validation. This paper will discuss the original instrument,
   results of the pilot study, and the changes that were inspired by the
   study.}},

   detection (GND), is developed to encompass existing nonlinear detection
   technologies as well as further optimize the performance of nonlinear
   detection for noncoherent impulse radio (IR) ultra-wideband (UWB)
   receivers. Computer simulations show that independent of absence or
   presence of narrowband interferences (NBIs), the GND-based receivers can
   achieve much better bit-error rate (BER) performance than the energy
   detection (ED) based receivers under both AWGN and multipath channels.
   Furthermore, as compared to the existing nonlinear detection algorithms,
   the GND algorithm with a well selected beta value always has the best
   BER performance and the strongest ability to resist NBIs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of power allocation
   and subcarrier assignment in the OFDM bidirectional systems where two
   users exchange data assisted by multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays.
   We assume the availability of imperfect channel state information (CSI)
   that contains a probabilistic uncertainty component and consider its
   worst effect when performing resource allocation. Moreover, we adopt
   dynamic network coding to exploit channel diversity. The objective of
   the resource allocation problem is to maximize the weighted sum rates of
   the two users subject to quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and
   individual power constraints. We formulate the problem as a mixed
   integer programming problem and solve it efficiently in an asymptotic
   manner by using the dual method. Simulation results show that the
   proposed scheme is robust to imperfect CSI and provides better
   performance compared to the scheme with static network coding.}},

Abstract = {{Decaying fossil fuel resources, international relation complexities, and
   the risks associated with nuclear power have led to an increased demand
   for alternative energy sources. Renewable energy sources offer adequate
   solutions to these challenges.
   Forecasting of solar energy has also increased over the past decade due
   to its use in photovoltaic (PV) system design, load balance in hybrid
   systems, and projected potential future PV system feasibility.
   Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been used successfully for solar
   energy forecasting. In this work, several meteorological variables from
   the Solar Village in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia are used as a case study to
   determine the most effective variables for Global Solar Radiation (GSR)
   prediction. Those variables are then used as inputs for a proposed GSR
   prediction model. This model will be applicable in different locations
   and conditions, and has a simple structure and offers better results in
   terms of error between actual and predicted solar radiation values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of the Ant Colony algorithm for
   optimizing filter placement and sizing on a radial distribution system
   to reduce power losses and keep the effective harmonic voltage values
   and the total harmonic distortion (THD) within prescribed limits. First,
   a harmonic load flow (HLF) algorithm is performed to demonstrate the
   effect of harmonic sources on total power loss. Then the Ant Colony
   algorithm is used in conjunction with HLF to place a selection of filter
   sizes available at each possible location so that both power loss and
   THD are minimized. As a result the optimal adjustment of location and
   size of the filter are determined. Results of computational experiments
   on standard test systems are presented to demonstrate improvement and
   effectiveness of using the filters at the optimal location. The
   methodology used can be easily extended to different distribution

   increase the number of multiplexed signals within a channel use close to
   what is offered in interference alignment approaches without incurring
   the corresponding system complexity. Specifically, we divide the
   communication process into two stages. In the first stage, the
   transmitter with multiple antennas using time division multiplexing
   sends to different users in their allocated time slots a number of
   messages equal to the number of transmit antennas in a MISO frame. In
   the next stage, every user and its assigned relays form an independent
   network, and relays using an amplify-and-forward scheme aid the recovery
   of messages by the user solving linear system of equations. All of these
   subnetworks utilize the available channel concurrently producing an
   acceptable level of multiple access interference (MAI) where the MAI is
   controlled using a clustering technique tailored to location of users
   and potential relays. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the
   capacity improvements in the proposed scheme and showing good

Abstract = {{A variety of wireless sensor network (WSN) applications have been
   proposed. However, the efficiency of WSNs, as well as their ability to
   interact with different environments, varies. Many challenges and
   problems to be solved remain. Overcoming these challenges requires a
   protocol that will design and provide a highly efficient system, thus
   helping the WSN to transmit data in a suitable time. In WSNs with Mobile
   Elements (MEs), the task is first to find an effective way to minimize
   the length of the tour that the ME follows for data gathering. However,
   the minimized tour length should still offer access to all nodes in the
   networks for data collection form the sensor nodes. In this paper, we
   propose a protocol that results in a shorter ME tour length than
   previously proposed protocols, using closest rendezvous points (CRPs)
   distributed throughout the network. Furthermore, this proposed protocol
   offers access to all nodes inside the network for the exchange of data
   with the MEs, as facilitated by the suggested CRP algorithm. One or more
   nodes can be represented by a single CRP that provides connectivity to
   all of the nodes within its wireless range. In cases where a greater
   number of MEs are used, less time is required to traverse the network
   for data gathering. This research demonstrates that the tour time can be
   reduced significantly by using more than one ME.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy logic based controller is usually employed to control the complex
   and ambigious plants. In this paper we propose the design and
   construction of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) having reduced number of
   rules to control DC-DC buck converter operating in continuous conduction
   mode (CCM). A Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller on the basis of
   fuzzy logic is constucted using the MATLAB/Simulink environement. It is
   then compared performance wise to the modified and improved version of
   classical PD controller, i.e., Proportional-Derivative with
   Derivative-on-Output (PD-DOO) controller. The PD-DOO controller even
   further improves the output voltage performance characteristics like
   percent overshoot, settling time, etc. offered by the PD controller. The
   MATLAB/Simulink simulation results reveal that the proposed FLC with
   smaller rule base not only exhibits improved load and line regulations
   but also shows better set-point tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli can persist in streambed sediments and influence water
   quality monitoring programs through their resuspension into overlying
   waters. This study examined the spatial patterns in E. coli
   concentration and population structure within streambed morphological
   features during baseflow and following stormflow to inform sampling
   strategies for representative characterization of E. coli populations
   within a stream reach. E. coli concentrations in bed sediments were
   significantly different (p = 0.002) among monitoring sites during
   baseflow, and significant interactive effects (p = 0.002) occurred among
   monitoring sites and morphological features following stormflow. Least
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression revealed
   that water velocity and effective particle size (D (10)) explained E.
   coli concentration during baseflow, whereas sediment organic carbon,
   water velocity and median particle diameter (D (50)) were important
   explanatory variables following stormflow. Principle Coordinate Analysis
   illustrated the site-scale differences in sediment E. coli populations
   between disconnected stream segments. Also, E. coli populations were
   similar among depositional features within a reach, but differed in
   relation to high velocity features (e.g., riffles). Canonical
   correspondence analysis resolved that E. coli population structure was
   primarily explained by spatial (26.9-31.7 \%) over environmental
   variables (9.2-13.1 \%). Spatial autocorrelation existed among
   monitoring sites and morphological features for both sampling events,
   and gradients in mean particle diameter and water velocity influenced E.
   coli population structure for the baseflow and stormflow sampling
   events, respectively. Representative characterization of streambed E.
   coli requires sampling of depositional and high velocity environments to
   accommodate strain selectivity among these features owing to sediment
   and water velocity heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-small angle X-ray scattering has been used for the first time to
   elucidate, in situ, the aggregation structure of a model edible oil
   system. The three-dimensional nano-to micro-structure of tristearin
   solid particles in triolein solvent was investigated using 5, 10, 15,
   and 20\% solids. Three different sample preparation procedures were
   investigated: two slow cooling rates of 0.5 degrees/min, case 1 (22 days
   of storage at room temperature) and case 2 (no storage), and one fast
   cooling of 30 degrees/min, case 3 (no storage). The length scale
   investigated, by using the Bonse-Hart camera at beamline ID-15D at the
   Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, covered the range
   from 300 angstrom to 10 mu m. The unified fit and the Guinier-Porod
   models in the Irena software were used to fit the data. The former was
   used to fit 3 structural levels. Level 1 structures showed that the
   primary scatterers were essentially 2-dimensional objects for the three
   cases. The scatterers possessed lateral dimensions between 1000 and 4300
   angstrom. This is consistent with the sizes of crystalline nanoplatelets
   present which were observed using cryo-TEM. Level 2 structures were
   aggregates possessing radii of gyration, R-g2 between 1800 angstrom and
   12000 angstrom and fractal dimensions of either D-2 = 1 for case 3 or
   1.8 <= D-2 <= 2.1 for case 1 and case 2. D-2 = 1 is consistent with
   unaggregated 1-dimensional objects. 1.8 <= D-2 <= 2.1 is consistent with
   these 1-dimensional objects (below) forming structures characteristic of
   diffusion or reaction limited cluster-cluster aggregation. Level 3
   structures showed that the spatial distribution of the level 2
   structures was uniform, on the average, for case 1, with fractal
   dimension D-3 approximate to 3 while for case 2 and case 3 the fractal
   dimension was D-3 approximate to 2.2, which suggested that the
   large-scale distribution had not come to equilibrium. The Guinier-Porod
   model showed that the structures giving rise to the aggregates with a
   fractal dimension given by D-2 in the unified fit level 2 model were
   cylinders described by the parameter s approximate to 1 in the
   Guinier-Porod model. The size of the base of these cylinders was in
   agreement with the cryo-TEM observations as well as with the results of
   the level 1 unified fit model. By estimating the size of the
   nanoplatelets and understanding the structures formed via their
   aggregation, it will be possible to engineer novel lipids systems that
   embody desired functional characteristics. VC 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Dust explosion is one of the main threats to equipment safety and human
   health in industries. Complex factors leading to accidents, serious
   consequences, and relevant safety measures are the main interests of
   governmental agencies, researchers, and industrial companies. However, a
   generic risk analysis model for dust explosions is absent. The bow-tie
   model can be used to investigate the relationships among basic causes,
   safety barriers, and possible consequences of an accident scenario. In
   this paper, a framework is established for quantitative risk assessment
   of dust explosions based on bow-tie analysis via review and analysis of
   previous major dust explosions. A large inventory of relevant safety
   measures is presented, and the implementation and efficacy of such
   safety measures to reduce the risk of dust explosions is thoroughly
   discussed. Finally, the methodology is applied to a case study. The
   results show that the generic bow-tie developed in this study can be
   tailored to a wide variety of dust explosion accident scenarios with
   minimal manipulation; also, implementation of relevant safety measures
   can significantly reduce the risk of dust explosions.}},

Abstract = {{The simple chemistry of sodium polyphosphate (NaPP) makes it a very safe
   inorganic polymer for bio-applications. Recently we have focused on an
   in-situ forming system comprised of NaPP and calcium chloride solutions
   which, on contact, form a gel-like material. This system could be used
   in a variety of bio-applications. The first step of our studies has been
   synthesis and characterization of NaPP with the average degree of
   polymerization ((D) over bar (p)) from 50 up to 25,000, that is
   summarized in this manuscript. NaPP with (D) over bar (p) lower than 500
   was obtained from fractionation of a NaPP glass. NaPP with (D) over bar
   (p) higher than 500 was obtained from an ion-exchange process on a
   potassium polyphosphate crystalline phase. The ion-exchange process was
   optimized maximizing the potassium exchange with sodium while minimizing
   resin waste. The (D) over bar (p) of prepared NaPPs was determined by
   titration, viscosity and P-31-liquid nuclear magnetic resonance
   measurements. The accuracy of these methods in determining the chain
   length is discussed. The effect of furnace time and temperature on (D)
   over bar (p) is also discussed. In addition, since both fractionation
   and ion-exchange methods introduce water, the resulting NaPPs were
   evaluated for residual water by differential scanning calorimetry and
   elemental analysis methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeFunctional MRI (fMRI) techniques that can provide excellent blood
   oxygen level dependent contrast, rapid whole brain imaging, and minimal
   spatial distortion are in demand. This study explored whether fMRI
   sensitivity can be improved through the use of compressed sensing (CS)
   reconstruction of variable density spiral fMRI.
   MethodsThree different CS-reconstructed 1-shot variable density spirals
   were explored (corresponding to 28\%, 35\%, and 46\% under-sampling),
   and compared with conventional 1-shot and 2-shot Archimedean spirals
   acquired using matched echo time and volume repetition time. fMRI maps
   were reconstructed with or without CS MRI and sensitivity was compared
   using identically matched voxels.
   ResultsThe results demonstrated that an l(1)-norm based CS
   reconstruction only led to an increase in functional contrast when
   applied to 28\% under-sampled data. A whole brain t-contrast map
   revealed that 2-shot uniformly sampled spiral and 28\% under-sampled
   spiral data reconstructed with CS yield equivalent sensitivity, even
   with matched echo time and volume repetition time
   ConclusionVD spiral exhibits a useful operating range, in the region of
   25-30\% under-sampling, for which CS reconstruction can be used to
   increase the sensitivity of fMRI to brain activity. Using CS, VD
   acquisitions achieve the same sensitivity as 2-shot Archimedean
   acquisitions, but require only a single shot. Magn Reson Med

Title = {{Exploring resource allocation and alternate clinic accessibility
   landscapes for improved blood donor turnout}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{89-97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An important goal for blood agencies, especially in the context of aging
   populations, is to ensure the sufficiency of the blood supply. Of the
   eligible population, only a small proportion donates. A question
   therefore is how to expand the donor base. Previous research has shown
   that accessibility to clinics positively associates with donor turnout.
   Since accessibility depends on the allocation of resources to clinic
   sites it provides a policy handle to facilitate donor participation.
   Generation and examination of clinic accessibility landscapes can be
   part of a strategy to increase donor turnout. The research uses donor
   and clinic databases provided by Canadian Blood Services for calendar
   year 2008. Donor numbers were aggregated at the level of Dissemination
   Areas for the city of Toronto, Canada, and complemented with
   socio-economic and demographic information from the Census. Multivariate
   statistical analysis confirms the positive association between number of
   donors and accessibility, calculated using a two-step floating approach.
   The model becomes the objective function in a heuristic search procedure
   (genetic algorithms) to investigate the potential effect on donor
   turnout of allocation of resources to clinics. The results of the
   analysis indicate that the current number of donors is at the lower end
   of the range of solutions obtained from generating accessibility
   landscapes. Gains in the total number of estimated donors range between
   1\% and 22\%. An advantage of generating several solutions is the
   possibility of examining the magnitude of change required, in terms of
   the (re-)allocation of resources to clinics. Detailed examination of the
   results can assist decision-makers to evaluate the trade-offs between
   the magnitude of the change required and the potential payoff. Given
   current trends, there is a need for planning to ensure that the supply
   of blood is sufficient. Even small gains can make an important
   difference between a sufficient blood supply and shortages. The approach
   presented here to generate clinic accessibility landscapes constitutes a
   useful tool for blood agencies to explore scenarios for increasing their
   donor base. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{PurposeTo compare hyperpolarized helium-3 (He-3) and xenon-129 (Xe-129)
   MRI in asthmatics before and after salbutamol inhalation.
   Materials and MethodsSeven asthmatics provided written informed consent
   and underwent spirometry, plethysmography, and MRI before and after
   salbutamol inhalation. He-3 and Xe-129 ventilation defect percent (VDP)
   and ventilation coefficient of variation (COV) were measured. To
   characterize the airways spatially related to ventilation defects, wall
   area percent (WA\%) and lumen area (LA) were evaluated for two subjects
   who had thoracic x-ray computed tomography (CT) acquired 1 year before
   MRI.
   ResultsBefore salbutamol inhalation, Xe-129 VDP (8 5\%) was
   significantly greater than He-3 VDP (6 +/- 5\%, P = 0.003).
   Post-salbutamol, there was a significant improvement in both Xe-129 (5
   +/- 4\%, P < 0.0001) and He-3 (4 +/- 3\%, P = 0.001) VDP, and the
   improvement in Xe-129 VDP was significantly greater (P = 0.008). Xe-129
   MRI COV (Pre: 0.309 +/- 0.028, Post: 0.296 +/- 0.036) was significantly
   greater than He-3 MRI COV (Pre: 0.282 +/- 0.018, Post: 0.269 +/- 0.024),
   pre- (P < 0.0001) and post-salbutamol (P < 0.0001) and the decrease in
   COV post-salbutamol was significant (Xe-129, P = 0.002; He-3, P <
   0.0001). For a single asthmatic, a sub-segmental Xe-129 MRI ventilation
   defect that was visible only before salbutamol inhalation but not
   visible using He-3 MRI was spatially related to a remodeled fourth
   generation sub-segmental airway (WA\% = 78\%, LA = 2.9 mm(2)).
   ConclusionIn asthma, hyperpolarized Xe-129 MRI may help reveal
   ventilation abnormalities before bronchodilation that are not observed
   using hyperpolarized He-3 MRI. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

Abstract = {{This study was performed to investigate dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   adsorption equilibrium using synthetic iron pipe corrosion scales i.e.
   goethite and magnetite for different pH values ranging from 2.5 to 10.5.
   The synthesized goethite and magnetite was characterized by XRD, SEM and
   BET surface area. SEM micrographs for before and after DOM adsorption
   study revealed a significant change on the morphology of goethite and
   magnetite surface. Molecular weight distributions of DOM measured by
   HPSEC revealed that the higher molecular weight fractions adsorbed
   preferentially onto goethite and magnetite surface, and it was
   pronouncedly observed at lower pH. The DOM adsorption data illustrated
   to be fit well by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating monolayer
   coverage. The standard Gibb's free energy (6,Cads) changes of adsorption
   process stating the DOM adsorption onto goethite and magnetite surface
   was spontaneous under the experimental conditions. However, the maximal
   adsorption capacity for goethite and magnetite were revealed to be 4.75
   mg-C/g and 3.79 mg-C/g respectively at pH 2.5. The DOM adsorption study
   was observed to be highly pH dependent. Consequently, zeta (xi)
   potential measurements revealed that surface charge of goethite and
   magnetite was modified due to DOM adsorption onto their surfaces, and
   their pH for point zero charge (pH(PZC)) was shifted to lower pH
   compared to that of in absence of DOM. Nevertheless, it has been
   suggested that ligand exchange between carboxyl/hydroxyl functional
   groups of DOM and, goethite and magnetite surface was the leading
   interaction mechanism for DOM adsorption process. FTIR spectroscopy
   study was in agreement with the conclusion cited above. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Erosion-corrosion is common in oil and gas processing plants and
   pipelines where there is interaction, between solid particles, corrosive
   fluid and target material. The objective of the present work is to
   assess the synergism between erosion and corrosion of API X-70 pipeline
   steel under liquid-solid impingement conditions in 2 g/l NaCl solution
   purged with CO2 as the corrosive (acidic) media and aluminum oxide as
   the erodent. The total material loss rate, the components of erosion,
   corrosion and their synergistic interactions have been determined. The
   experimental results show that there is an immense correlation exists
   between erosion and corrosion. During erosion-corrosion, erosion
   enhances corrosion and corrosion enhances erosion resulting in higher
   material loss. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the worn
   specimen reveals that plastic deformation and fracture are the dominant
   mechanisms during the erosion-corrosion process. Furthermore, corrosion
   removes the work hardened layer and exposes a stress free surface for
   erosion while erosion removes the passive film from the surface and
   creates a work hardened layer which is highly susceptible to corrosion.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the `mixing' mechanism of CMOS bulk-driven (BD) mixer is
   analyzed in detail. Based on the theoretical analysis, a novel method to
   improve harmonic mixing rejection (HMR) which is important for wideband
   mixer is proposed. Three BD mixers of different structures are designed
   in TSMC 65 nm technology to verify this design methodology. Simulation
   proves that HMR performance is improved for different mixer structures
   by following the methodology. The broadband HMR is robust under process,
   temperature, bias and local oscillator amplitude variation without
   sacrificing other performances. These proposed mixers offer conversion
   gain above 4.6, -0.5 and 11.0 dB, respectively, covering frequency from
   850 MHz to 6 GHz. The simulated IIP3 are 14.51, 16.82 and 4.96 dBm
   respectively. Power consumptions are 0.96, 1.2 and 0.33 mW respectively

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to investigate the addition of zirconium
   into a recently developed aluminum-copper-magnesium powder metallurgy
   (PM) alloy (Al-2.3 w/o Cu-1.6 w/o Mg-0.2 w/o Sn). Three variations of
   the alloy were considered. One was a zirconium-free baseline blend,
   whereas the other two contained 0.2 w/o Zr sourced as either an
   aluminum-zirconium master alloy or as a prealloyed addition within the
   base aluminum powder itself A study of the green properties indicated a
   slight decrease in green strength within the prealloyed system. The
   sintering response revealed that each system reached near-pore-free
   density and that each alloy demonstrated an excellent combination of
   tensile properties. The prealloyed system was particularly advantageous
   as it exhibited the highest yield strength and UTS coupled with an
   exceptionally high elongation to failure of 10\%. However, the most
   striking advantage of utilizing prealloyed zirconium was the ability to
   essentially eliminate distortion in the liquid-phase-sintered product.
   It is postulated that this behavior is related to the formation of a
   fine dispersion of thermally stable Al3Zr particles within the aluminum
   grains that improved elevated temperature strength and compact rigidity

Abstract = {{We investigated whether immature allysine-derived cross-links provide
   mechanically labile linkages by exploring the effects of immature
   cross-link stabilization at three levels of collagen hierarchy: damaged
   fibril morphology, whole tendon mechanics, and molecular stability.
   Tendons from the tails of young adult steers were either treated with
   sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to stabilize labile cross-links, exposed only
   to the buffer used during stabilization treatment, or maintained as
   untreated controls. One-half of each tendon was then subjected to five
   cycles of subrupture overload. Morphologic changes to collagen fibrils
   resulting from overload were investigated using scanning electron
   microscopy, and changes in the hydrothermal stability of collagen
   molecules were assessed using hydrothermal isometric tension testing.
   NaBH4 cross-link stabilization did not affect the response of tendon
   collagen to tensile overload at any of the three levels of hierarchy
   studied. Cross-link stabilization did not prevent the characteristic
   overload-induced mode of fibril damage that we term discrete plasticity.
   Similarly, stabilization did not alter the mechanical response of whole
   tendons to overload, and did not prevent an overload-induced thermal
   destabilization of collagen molecules. Our results indicate that
   hydrothermally labile cross-links may not be as mechanically labile as
   was previously thought. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Abstract = {{This study presents a numerical simulation of the three dimensional
   laminar mixed convection between two elliptical horizontal cylinders
   using temperature dependent physical properties. The inner cylinder is
   uniformly heated whereas the outer cylinder is adiabatic. The flow and
   thermal fields are modeled by the continuity, momentum and energy
   equations with appropriate initial and boundary conditions using an
   elliptical coordinate system. The model equations are numerically solved
   by a finite volume numerical method with a second order accurate
   spatiotemporal discretization. For the considered geometric, dynamic and
   thermal controlling parameters, it is found that the realistic
   consideration of the mixed convection with variable physical properties
   gives physically sound flows and thermal fields that are qualitatively
   and quantitatively different from those of forced convection with
   temperature dependent properties and those of mixed convection with
   constant properties; the obtained Nusselt number is also higher in this
   case. The heat transfer enhancement obtained by considering natural
   convection within mixed convection with temperature dependent physical
   properties increases with the increased Grashof number which is
   proportional to the heat flux imposed at the surface of the inner
   cylinder. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combining
   agricultural wastes or a finished compost (wheat straw, horse manure and
   bedding, sheep manure, and a wheat straw-SHW finished compost) as
   compost feedstocks with cattle slaughterhouse wastes (SHW) on a
   field-scale. The composts were managed in covered bins over 200 days and
   physico-chemical parameters related to organic matter bio-degradation
   were measured over time. Thermophilic temperatures were maintained above
   55 degrees C for 12-46 days to meet the Canadian Council of Ministers of
   the Environment (CCME) guidelines for pathogen control. Final C:N ratios
   were highest in a horse manure and bedding:SHW compost at 23:1 but
   ranged from 18.5 to 20.5:1 for the remaining three treatments,
   representing a wheat straw:SHW compost and different combinations of
   horse manure and bedding, SHW, and/or sheep manure. Average reduction in
   mass of total carbon across all the composts in the current study was
   54.2\%. Maturity tests at the end of the study determined that the CO2-C
   evolution rate in all compost products was less than 1 mg g(-1) organic
   matter day(-1) suggesting highly stable final compost products. Compost
   mass reductions all responded as exponential decay functions with R-2
   values ranging from 0.84 to 0.99 regardless of compost feedstock
   composition. Agricultural by-products and composts are suitable
   feedstocks for use with SHW to generate a stable final product while
   meeting regulatory parameters to achieve conventional pathogen control.

Title = {{Effect of CaO on tar reforming to hydrogen-enriched gas with in-process
   CO2 capture in a bubbling fluidized bed biomass steam gasifier}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},

Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies showed that calcium oxide (CaO), when added to a
   biomass steam gasifier, could play the role of both CO2 sorbent and tar
   reforming catalyst, and thereby produce more hydrogen. However, most of
   these works focused on the former role with little attention to tar
   reforming aspect of CaO. Therefore, this work aims primarily at studying
   the tar reforming effect of in-bed CaO. To this end, an in-depth
   analysis of the effect of CaO on tar yield and composition is presented.
   The present work also studies the role of CaO as a CO2 sorbent to
   enhance hydrogen production from steam gasification of biomass in a
   bubbling fluidized bed. The influence of different operating parameters,
   temperature (T) and steam to biomass (S/B) ratio, as well as the effect
   of using in-bed CaO on gas and tar production is investigated. Results
   show that the maximum H-2 and minimum CO2 concentration of 63.07\% and
   18.68\%, respectively are obtained at T = 650 degrees C and S/B = 3.41.
   The maximum H-2 yield of 256.81 ml g(-1)-biomass was obtained at T = 700
   degrees C and S/B = 3.41, at which the minimum tar content of 6.45 g N
   m(-3) was also received. Compared to a bed of sand alone, a 20\% higher
   H-2 concentration, an almost double H-2 yield and a 67\% reduction in
   tar content were obtained when a bed of CaO was used. Moreover, shifting
   the tar species from higher to fewer ring structures as a result of
   in-bed CaO can reduce tar dew point by 11 degrees C and tar carcinogenic
   potential by almost 60\%. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy

   its inactivation during desiccation. However, due to the higher
   desiccation resistance of Listeria relative to P. fluorescens and S.
   baltica, the pathogen survived in greater final numbers. In contrast, S.
   proteamaculans outcompeted the pathogen during the biofilm formation and
   exhibited similar desiccation survival, causing the N-21 days of
   Serratia to be ca 3 Log(10)(CFUcm(-2)) greater than that of Listeria in
   the dual species biofilm. Microscopy revealed biofilm morphologies with
   variable amounts of exopolymeric substance and the presence of separate

Abstract = {{The current research provides guidance on the prevention and mitigation
   of dust explosion using a Quantitative Risk Management Framework (QRMF).
   Using concepts drawn from previous studies, the framework consists of
   three main steps: (i) a new combined safety management protocol, (ii)
   the use of DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code) and FTA (Fault Tree
   Analysis) to assess explosion consequences and likelihood, respectively,
   and (iii) application of the hierarchy of controls (inherent, engineered
   and procedural safety). QRMF assessment of an industrial case study
   showed that the original process was at high risk. DESC simulations and
   Probit equations determined the destructive percentages. FTAs revealed
   high probabilities of explosion occurrence; in addition, detailed
   individual and societal risks calculations were made, before and after
   the framework was applied. Based on the hierarchy of controls technique,
   the framework showed significant risk reduction to the point where the
   residual risk was acceptable for the process. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{6701-6711}},

Abstract = {{Modeling surface water Escherichia coli fate and transport requires
   partitioning E. coli into particle-attached and unattached fractions.
   Attachment is often assumed to be a constant fraction or is estimated
   using simple linear models. The objectives of this study were to: (i)
   develop statistical models for predicting E. coli attachment and
   virulence marker presence in fluvial systems, and (ii) relate E. coli
   attachment to a variety of environmental parameters. Stream water
   samples (n = 60) were collected at four locations in a rural, mixed-use
   watershed between June and October 2012, with four storm events (>20 mm
   rainfall) being captured. The percentage of E. coli attached to
   particles (>5 mu m) and the occurrences of virulence markers were
   modeled using water quality, particle concentration, particle size
   distribution, hydrology and land use factors as explanatory variables.
   Three types of statistical models appropriate for highly collinear,
   multidimensional data were compared: least angle shrinkage and selection
   operator (LASSO), classification and regression trees using the general,
   unbiased, interaction detection and estimation (GUIDE) algorithm, and
   multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). All models showed that
   E. coli particle attachment and the presence of E. coli virulence
   markers in the attached and unattached states were influenced by a
   combination of water quality, hydrology, land-use and particle
   properties. Model performance statistics indicate that MARS models
   outperform LASSO and GUIDE models for predicting E. coli particle
   attachment and virulence marker occurrence. Validating the MARS modeling
   approach in multiple watersheds may allow for the development of a
   parameterizing model to be included in watershed simulation models. (C)

Abstract = {{Nova Scotia, Canada's community feed-in tariff (COMFIT) scheme is the
   world's first feed-in tariff program specifically targeting
   locally-based renewable energy projects. This study investigated
   selected turbine capacities to optimize electricity production, based on
   actual wind profiles for three sites in Nova Scotia, Canada (i.e.,
   Sydney, Caribou Point, and Greenwood). The turbine capacities evaluated
   are also eligible under the current COMFIT-large scheme in Nova Scotia,
   including 100 kW, 900 kW and 2.0 MW turbines. A capital budgeting model
   was developed and then used to evaluate investment decisions on wind
   power production. Wind duration curves suggest that Caribou Point had
   the highest average wind speeds but for shorter durations. By
   comparison, Sydney and Greenwood had lower average wind speeds but with
   longer durations. Electricity production cost was lowest for the 2.0 MW
   turbine in Caribou Point (\$0.07 per kWh), and highest for the 100 kW
   turbine located in Greenwood (\$0.49 per kWh). The most financially
   viable wind power project was the 2.0 MW turbine assumed to operate at
   80 m hub height in Caribou Point, with NPV=\$251,586, and BCR=1.51. Wind
   power production for the remaining two sites was generally not
   financially feasible for the turbine capacities considered. The impact
   of promoting local economic development from wind power projects was
   higher in a scenario under which wind turbines were clustered at a
   single site with the highest wind resources than generating a similar
   level of electricity by distributing the wind turbines across multiple
   locations. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Many structures such as aircrafts, risers, and offshore pipelines that
   are in contact with fluids, become subjected to complex variable
   amplitude loading (VAL) stress-time histories during their service
   lives. As a result, the structural life assessment and damage-tolerant
   analyses of such structures are considered as two important design
   criteria. In this paper, a VAL stress-time history is used to study the
   fatigue life of 6061-T651 aluminum alloy, with focus on the retardation
   effect resulting from the applied peak tensile overload cycles (TOLCs).
   Various so-called ``clipping{''} levels are tested, and the results are
   compared with those obtained through an analytical method, using the
   Willenborg retardation approach, in conjunction with the Walker fatigue
   crack growth model. The results would demonstrate the significant
   influence of the TOLC present within VAL scenarios on retarding the
   fatigue crack growth rate of the material. The study also investigates
   the influence of various clipping levels on the fatigue response of the
   material, also highlighting the limitations of the analytical approach
   in estimating the resulting crack growth rate. It is observed that the
   analytical method predicts a higher fatigue life for the material
   subjected to VAL, which is non-conservative for design purposes. Some
   suggestions are provided for fatigue life estimation of the material
   when subjected to VAL scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to modify the microstructure
   of sintered Al-SiC composites with particle concentrations ranging from
   4 to 16 vol\%. Two SiC particle sizes (490N and 800 grades) were
   examined. Following FSP, the hardness of the 4 and 8 vol\% of 490N grade
   SiC composites increased from 130 HV and 145 HV to 171 HV and 177 HV
   respectively. The increase was accounted for by the severe deformation
   occurring during FSP which uniformly distributed the SiC particles. The
   composites containing 16 vol\% SiC could not be fully consolidated using
   FSP, and contained residual pores and lack of consolidation which
   originated from the as-received sintered microstructure. The hardness
   correlated well with the mean inter-particle spacing for the SiC
   particles in the case of composites containing 4 and 8 vol\% SiC. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel link-layer encryption protocol for wireless
   sensor networks. The protocol design aims to reduce energy consumption
   by reducing security related communication overhead. This is done by
   merging security related data of consecutive packets. The merging (or
   combining packets) based on simple mathematical operations helps to
   reduce energy consumption by eliminating the requirement to send
   security related fields in headers and trailers. We name our protocol as
   the Compact Security Protocol referred to as C-Sec. In addition to
   energy savings, the C-Sec protocol also includes a unique security
   feature of hiding the packet header information. This feature makes it
   more difficult to trace the flow of wireless communication, and helps to
   minimize the cost of defending against replay attacks. We performed
   rigorous testing of the C-Sec protocol and compared it with well-known
   protocols including TinySec, MiniSec, SNEP and Zigbee. Our performance
   evaluation demonstrates that the C-Sec protocol outperforms other
   protocols in terms of energy savings. We also evaluated our protocol
   with respect to other performance metrics including queuing delay and
   error probability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Government priorities on provincial Nutrient Management Planning (NMP)
   programs include improving the program effectiveness for environmental
   quality protection, and promoting more widespread adoption.
   Understanding the effect of NMP on both crop yield and key water-quality
   parameters in agricultural watersheds requires a comprehensive
   evaluation that takes into consideration important NMP attributes and
   location-specific farming conditions. This study applied the Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the effects of crop and
   rotation sequence, tillage type, and nutrient N application rate on crop
   yield and the associated groundwater leaching and sediment loss. The
   SWAT model was applied to the Thomas Brook Watershed, located in the
   most intensively managed agricultural region of Nova Scotia, Canada.
   Cropping systems evaluated included seven fertilizer application rates
   and two tillage systems (i.e., conventional tillage and no-till). The
   analysis reflected cropping systems commonly managed by farmers in the
   Annapolis Valley region, including grain corn-based and potato-based
   cropping systems, and a vegetable-horticulture system. ANOVA models were
   developed and used to assess the effects of crop management choices on
   crop yield and two water-quality parameters (i.e., leaching and sediment
   loading). Results suggest that existing recommended N-fertilizer rate
   can be reduced by 10-25 \%, for grain crop production, to significantly
   lower leaching (P > 0.05) while optimizing the crop yield. The analysis
   identified the nutrient N rates in combination with specific crops and
   rotation systems that can be used to manage leaching while balancing
   impacts on crop yields within the watershed.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1875-1883}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effects of feeding total mixed ration (TMR) or pasture forage from a
   perennial sward under a management intensive grazing (MIG) regimen on
   grain intake and enteric methane (EM) emission were measured using
   chambers. Chamber measurement of EM was compared with that of SF6
   employed both within chamber and when cows grazed in the field. The
   impacts of the diet on farm gate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission were also
   postulated using the results of existing life cycle assessments.
   Emission of EM was measured in gas collection chambers in Spring and
   Fall. In Spring, pasture forage fiber quality was higher than that of
   the silage used in the TMR (47.5\% v. 56.3\% NDF; 24.3\% v. 37.9\% ADF).
   Higher forage quality from MIG subsequently resulted in 25\% less grain
   use relative to TMR (0.24 v. 0.32 kg dry matter/kg milk) for MIG
   compared with TMR. The Fall forage fiber quality was still better, but
   the higher quality of MIG pasture was not as pronounced as that in
   Spring. Neither yield of fat-corrected milk (FCM) which averaged 28.3
   kg/day, nor EM emission which averaged 18.9 g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)
   were significantly affected by diet in Spring. However, in the Fall, FCM
   from MIG (21.3 kg/day) was significantly lower than that from TMR (23.4
   kg/day). Despite the differences in FCM yield, in terms of EM emission
   that averaged 21.9 g/kg DMI was not significantly different between the
   diets. In this study, grain requirement, but not EM, was a
   distinguishing feature of pasture and confinement systems. Considering
   the increased predicted GHG emissions arising from the production and
   use of grain needed to boost milk yield in confinement systems, EM
   intensity alone is a poor predictor of the potential impact of a dairy
   system on climate forcing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the possible effects of increased stiffness at the
   incudostapedial joint (ISJ) on sound transmission in the human middle
   ear.
   Background: The physiologic role played by the IS joint in the mechanics
   of human middle ear function is unclear. It is also unclear how fixation
   of this joint might manifest itself and what the implications are of
   fixing this joint during surgical reconstruction.
   Hypothesis: Increased stiffness of the ISJ will affect sound
   transmission through the middle ear.
   Methods: Cyanoacrylate adhesive was instilled around the ISJ joint in 5
   fresh human cadaveric temporal bones to increase ISJ stiffness. Laser
   Doppler vibrometry measurements of sound-induced peak-to-peak
   displacement of the umbo and stapes footplate were made before and after
   stiffening the ISJ.
   Results: At baseline, the measurements at the stapes footplate followed
   those at the umbo but were approximately 12 dB lower in the speech
   frequencies. We found that stiffening the ISJ produced an almost equal
   decrease in peak-to-peak displacement at both the umbo and the stapes
   footplate, with little change in their relative motion, consistent with
   an increase in ossicular impedance. The decrease was mainly between 400
   and 1,000 Hz with a statistically significant mean magnitude loss of 6
   dB at 740 Hz.
   Conclusion: Increased stiffness at the ISJ results in a small, probably
   clinically insignificant decrease of 3 to 6 dB in middle ear sound
   transmission in the lower frequencies between 400 and 1,000 Hz.}},

   Al-Cu-Mg powder metallurgy alloy with Fe and/or Ni additions was
   successfully developed. The objectives of this research were designed to
   expand upon this work with an emphasis on characterising the industrial
   processing behaviour and thermal stability of the alloy with and without
   additions of these transition metals. All powder compacts exhibited an
   industrial sintering response that mirrored prior laboratory findings
   thereby confirming commercial viability. Subsequently, tensile specimens
   were machined from industrially sintered bars, heat treated to the T6
   temper and then subjected to various conditions of thermal exposure at
   temperatures up to 280 degrees C. Differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) data confirmed that Fe/Ni additions reduced the precipitation
   kinetics of the S-type phases responsible for peak strengthening at
   temperatures <160 degrees C and thereby enhanced the thermal stability
   of important tensile properties such as yield strength. At higher
   temperatures (>200 degrees C), the Fe/Ni additions were less effective
   with both alloys exhibiting comparable levels of strength degradation.}},

   quaternary Ni-Cr-Fe-Al powder metallurgy system provided a measureable
   improvement in oxidation resistance both in terms of thickness of oxide
   layer and in overall weight gain. Conversely, 0.1w/o Y provided little
   benefit when added with the Si and was shown to be detrimental in the
   absence of Si. Interestingly, little difference was noted in final
   microstructures. Specifically, variation in \%gamma' between samples was
   minimal (58.3-61.7 v/o) and a distinct precipitate free zone was always
   present between the oxide and the gamma+gamma' matrix.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{51-62}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The potential of using screen-type static mixers to intensify mass
   transfer limited multiphase-reactions was investigated using a case of
   diesel desulfurization. Two reactor designs were assessed at different
   superficial velocities and operating temperatures. By focusing energy
   dissipation within a very narrow distance in the regions adjacent to the
   screen, it was possible to generate local energy dissipation rates as
   high as 40,000 W/kg while maintaining the specific energy consumption
   rates below 0.2 kWh/t of liquid processed.
   Depending on the operating temperature, up to 15,400-fold reduction in
   the residence time needed to react 95\% of the sulfur present in the
   diesel can be achieved by replacing a standard mixing tank agitated by a
   Rushton-type impeller with a screen-type static mixer. About 97\% of
   this can be credited to the higher inter-phase mass transfer achievable
   in screen-type static mixers, while the remaining 3\% can be attributed
   to the higher average mass transfer driving force encountered under the
   plug flow conditions prevalent in this contactor. The relatively uniform
   flow conditions encountered across the pipe diameter minimized the
   formation of difficult-to-separate liquid-liquid dispersions with the
   ensuing dispersion separating within 20s. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fire and explosion are accidents which potentially can occur in oil and
   gas processing facilities. While fire and explosion could occur as a
   consequence of each other, most published work has assessed fire and
   explosion separately, ignoring interactions between the two phenomena.
   The current study proposes a novel approach to model the entire
   sequences involved in a potential accident using liquid and gas release
   incidents as two test cases. The integrated scenario is modelled using
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes FLACS and FDS. An integrated
   approach is adopted to analyse and represent the effects
   (injuries/death) of the accident. The proposed approach can be used in
   designing safety measures to minimize the adverse impacts of such
   accidents. It can also serve as an important tool to develop safety
   training to improve emergency preparedness plans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A submerged evacuated circular cylindrical shell subjected to a sequence
   of two external shock waves generated at the same source is considered.
   A semi-analytical model combining the classical methods of mathematical
   physics with the finite-difference methodology is developed and employed
   to simulate the interaction. Both the hydrodynamic and structural
   aspects of the problem are considered, and it is demonstrated that
   varying the delay between the first and second wavefronts has a very
   significant effect on the stress-strain state of the structure. In
   particular, it is shown that for certain values of the delay, the
   constructive superposition of the elastic waves travelling around the
   shell results in a `resonance-like' increase of the structural stress in
   certain regions. The respective stress can be so high that it sometimes
   exceeds the overall maximum stress observed in the same structure but
   subjected to a single-front shock wave with the same parameters, in some
   cases by as much as 50\%. A detailed parametric analysis of the observed
   phenomenon is carried out, and an easy-to-use diagram summarizing the
   finding is proposed to aim the pre-design analysis of engineering

Abstract = {{The influence of welding-induced residual stress and distortion on the

   Residual stresses and distortions due to welding are simulated by
   three-dimensional thermo-elasto-plastic finite-element analysis, and the
   behaviour of stiffened plates under compressive axial loads is evaluated
   considering various stiffened plate geometries. Welding-induced residual
   stress and distortion distributions are examined, and the behaviour of
   stiffened plates under compressive axial loads with and without
   welding-induced residual stress is compared with International
   Association of Classification Societies design formulae. Results of the
   numerical analyses reveal that welding-induced residual stresses reduce
   the ultimate strength of flat-bar stiffened plates by as much as 18\%.
   Load shortening curves generated by finite-element analysis are compared
   with curves derived from design formulae, showing good agreement among
   ultimate strength values predicted by the two methods. There is,
   however, some discrepancy between the post-ultimate capacities of
   stiffened plates predicted by the two methods, which may influence the

Title = {{A material sensitive modified wheeler model for predicting the
   retardation in fatigue response of AM60B due to an overload}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{220-229}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Application of an overload within an otherwise constant-amplitude
   loading scenario causes retardation in crack propagation. Several models
   have been proposed for predicting retardation in crack propagation due
   to an overload cycle. Among them, the widely used Wheeler model, assumes
   the ``affected zone dimension{''} to be a function of the current and
   overloaded plastic zone radii. When one considers the actual shape of
   the plastic zone, however, one realizes that the affected zone dimension
   does not agree with that assumed by Wheeler.
   In this paper, the influence of a single overload (but by considering
   three different overload ratios) on the fatigue crack growth retardation
   of center-cracked AM60B magnesium alloy plates is experimentally
   investigated. The retardation effect on crack growth due to an applied
   overload within a random-amplitude loading scenario, using various
   ``clipping levels{''}, is also investigated. The sensitivity of this
   material to overload is compared with the response of some other
   materials.
   The actual radius of the plastic zone is evaluated for various stress
   intensity factors, using the finite element method. The results indicate
   that depending on the material, the affected zone would be sometimes
   larger or smaller than that produced by Wheeler's model. Subsequently, a
   new parameter, hereafter referred to as the ``sensitivity parameter{''}
   (beta), is introduced that enables one to evaluate the affected zone
   dimension more accurately. It is shown that the proposed modified model
   is more effective than the original one in predicting the retardation
   response of the alloy. The integrity of the modified model is also
   investigated by evaluating the retardation in some other materials. (C)

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of porosity and
   void size on effective elastic geotechnical engineering properties with
   a 3D model of random fields and finite element. The random field theory
   is used to generate models of geomaterials containing spatially random
   voids with controlled porosity and void size. A ``tied freedom{''}
   analysis is developed to evaluate the effective Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio in an ideal block material of finite elements. To
   deliver a mean and standard deviation of the elastic parameters, this
   approach uses Monte-Carlo simulations and finite elements, where each
   simulation leads to an effective value of the property under
   investigation. The results are extended to investigate an influence of
   representative volume element (RVE). A comparison of the effective
   elastic stiffness of 2D and 3D models is also discussed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, the stability of networked control systems (NCSs) with
   communication constraints at both channels is investigated. A
   Conventional Round-Robin Scheduling (CRRS) is applied to deal with the
   communication constraints issue for its simple structure. Furthermore, a
   Dynamic Round-Robin Scheduling (DRRS), which can preserve the
   controllability and the detectability of the systems, is considered. For
   the unreliable communication channels, two independent homogeneous
   Markov chains are selected to model the packet dropouts phenomenon in
   the sensor-to-controller (S/C) channel and the controller-to-actuator
   (C/A) channel. According to the periodic property of the Round-Robin
   Scheduling (RRS), an auxiliary system with augmented Markov chain is
   established by the lifting technique to facilitate the stability
   analysis of the closed-loop system. A necessary and sufficient condition
   of the exponential mean-square stability for the NCSs is derived. Two
   illustrative examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed stability analysis method. (C) 2013 The Franklin Institute.

Abstract = {{Multilayer laminate bodies exhibit beneficial heat spreading qualities
   when one or more inner layers have sufficiently high thermal
   conductivity to carry heat laterally under non-uniform heating
   conditions. The proposed model is broken up in two regions of interest:
   the heated region and the fin region. This model predicts the behaviour
   experienced by laminate films when heated by a constant temperature or
   heat flux over only part of the domain. The one dimensional,
   steady-state, two-region fin model is unique in its representation of
   the conduction heat transfer in the heat spreading layer only, for both
   Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. Temperature uniformity is wholly
   attainable with applied heat fluxes, while laminates provide improved
   heat transfer rates with applied temperature sources (e.g. phase change
   materials) over conventional, homogeneous, encapsulation materials. The
   two-region fin model predicts temperature profiles and rates of heat
   transfer for steady-state or pseudo steady-state analyses as validated
   by a two-dimensional finite element model under the applicable
   conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of initial contamination levels,
   biofilm maturity and presence of salt and fatty food soils on
   desiccation survival of Listeria monocytogenes on stainless steel (SS)
   coupons. L. monocytogenes cultures grown (at 15 degrees C for 48 h) in
   Tryptic Soy Broth with 1\% glucose (TSB-glu) containing either 0.5 or
   5\% (w/v) NaCl were re-suspended in TSB-glu containing either 0.5 or 5\%
   NaCl and used to contaminate SS coupons at levels of 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5
   log CFU/cm(2). Desiccation (at 15 degrees C for 20 days, 43\% RH)
   commenced immediately (non-biofilm) or following biofilm formation (at
   15 degrees C for 48 h, 100\% RH). To study the impact of food lipids,
   non-biofilm L. monocytogenes cells were suspended in TSB-glu containing
   either canola oil (5-10\%) or lard (20-60\%) and desiccated as above on
   SS coupons. Following desiccation for 20 days, survivors decreased by
   1.4-3.7 log CFU/cm(2) for non-biofilm L. monocytogenes cells. The
   contamination level had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on survival
   kinetics. SEM micrographs showed mature biofilms on coupons initially
   contaminated with 5.5 and 7.5 log CFU/cm(2). Mature biofilm cells were
   significantly (p < 0.05) more desiccation resistant than cells in
   immature biofilms formed by the lowest contamination level. Besides
   biofilm maturity/formation, previous osmoadaptation, exposure to lard
   (20-60\%) or salt (5\%) during desiccation significantly (p < 0.05)
   increased the bacterium's survival. In conclusion, L. monocytogenes
   desiccation survival can be greatly reduced by preventing presence of
   mature biofilms and salty or fatty soils on food contact surfaces. (C)

Abstract = {{This comparative review highlights the relationships between the

   of fluid dynamics (FD) in the physical sciences. In both the BPA and FD
   communities, scientists study the motion and phase change of a liquid in
   contact with air, or with other liquids or solids. Five aspects of BPA
   related to FD are discussed: the physical forces driving the motion of
   blood as a fluid; the generation of the drops; their flight in the air;
   their impact on solid or liquid surfaces; and the production of stains.
   For each of these topics, the relevant literature from the BPA community
   and from the FD community is reviewed. Comments are provided on
   opportunities for joint BPA and FD research, and on the development of
   novel FD-based tools and methods for BPA. Also, the use of dimensionless
   numbers is proposed to inform BPA analyses. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{The one-step leapfrog alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference
   time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method is reformulated for simulating general
   electrically dispersive media. It models material dispersive properties

   with the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) and then incorporated
   into the one-step leapfrog ADI-FDTD method. The final equations are
   presented in the form similar to that of the conventional FDTD method
   but with second-order perturbation. The adapted method is then applied
   to characterize (a) electromagnetic wave propagation in a rectangular
   waveguide loaded with a magnetized plasma slab, (b) transmission
   coefficient of a plane wave normally incident on a monolayer graphene
   sheet biased by a magnetostatic field, and (c) surface plasmon
   polaritons (SPPs) propagation along a monolayer graphene sheet biased by
   an electrostatic field. The numerical results verify the stability,
   accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed one-step leapfrog
   ADI-FDTD algorithm in comparison with analytical results and the results

Abstract = {{This study presents a new attempt of applying the hydrological model
   SWAT to the Three Gorges watershed in China for addressing its non-point
   source (NPS) pollution control issues. The model was calibrated and
   validated using the monitoring data collected during 2002-2008, and
   satisfactory values of R-2 and ENS (Nash-Suttclife Efficiency) were
   obtained. The calibrated SWAT model was then used to simulate 6
   different land use scenarios for investigating the effects of each
   scenario on the non-point source (NPS) pollution control in the
   watershed. Six scenarios were designed with distinct land use focuses
   and include five newly-designed scenarios (Q1-Q5) representing 5
   different land use alternatives and a baseline scenario (Q6)
   representing the land use pattern the watershed had in 2005. It was
   identified that the farmland is the dominant contributor to the NPS
   pollution in the watershed in terms of yields of sediment, TN and TP. If
   the farmland is changed to the woodland, grassland or shrubland, a
   better control and reduction over the NPS pollution could be achieved.
   This study provides a good understanding of the interactions between
   different land use patterns and the NPS pollution control for
   decision-makers to make sound decisions. Changing the land use pattern
   and implementing alternative management practices could help reduce the
   non-point source pollution effectively and thus play a significant role
   in improving reservoir water quality of the watershed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a two-dimensional nanometer scale tip-plate discharge
   model has been employed to study nanoscale electrical discharge in
   atmospheric conditions. The field strength distributions in a nanometer
   scale tip-to-plate electrode arrangement were calculated using the
   finite element analysis (FEA) method, and the influences of applied
   voltage amplitude and frequency as well as gas gap distance on the
   variation of effective discharge range (EDR) on the plate were also
   investigated and discussed. The simulation results show that the probe
   with a wide tip will cause a larger effective discharge range on the
   plate; the field strength in the gap is notably higher than that induced
   by the sharp tip probe; the effective discharge range will increase
   linearly with the rise of excitation voltage, and decrease nonlinearly
   with the rise of gap length. In addition, probe dimension, especially
   the width/height ratio, affects the effective discharge range in
   different manners. With the width/height ratio rising from 1: 1 to 1:
   10, the effective discharge range will maintain stable when the
   excitation voltage is around 50 V. This will increase when the
   excitation voltage gets higher and decrease as the excitation voltage
   gets lower. Furthermore, when the gap length is 5 nm and the excitation
   voltage is below 20 V, the diameter of EDR in our simulation is about
   150 nm, which is consistent with the experiment results reported by
   other research groups. Our work provides a preliminary understanding of
   nanometer scale discharges and establishes a predictive
   structure-behavior relationship.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental program involving the test of 25 push-out specimens was
   conducted to study the behaviour and strength of shear studs in the
   application of composite bridge decks and to assess the detailing
   requirement specified in the code practice. Testing parameters included
   reinforcement mesh position, presence of stud head, and stud height. An
   alternative type of shear studs, referred to as adjustable studs, was
   also studied and its capacity was compared with conventional studs.
   Results showed that the position of reinforcement mesh affected the
   specimen failure mode and ultimate load. Comparing with the cases where
   the mesh was placed either flush with the stud head or above the stud,
   the maximum ultimate load was reached and the failure was by stud
   shear-off when the mesh intercepted the studs. Shear studs with heads
   resulted in a higher ultimate load in specimens than unheaded shear
   studs. In the comparison between conventional and adjustable shear
   studs, while they shared similar failure modes, adjustable studs showed
   on average lower load capacity than their conventional counterparts. For
   all specimens studied, only specimens with reinforcement mesh satisfying
   the detailing requirement were able to attain the code specified
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It has been suggested that more-complex fibrillation
   requires higher energy shocks to terminate. Furthermore, animal studies
   have demonstrated that shock timing also plays a role. The objective of
   this study was to test these assertions in a clinical context.
   Methods: Near- and far-field electrograms were collected during
   defibrillation threshold testing. Fibrillation complexity was measured
   by quantifying the organization in the signals with wavelet-based
   methods, scaling exponent, and cross-correlation analysis. Receiver
   operator characteristic curves were used to determine predictive value.
   The effect of the phase at which defibrillation shocks were applied was
   also determined.
   Results: No measure was able to classify whether a particular shock
   would be successful. All performed very poorly. Shock timing played no
   role in defibrillation outcome.
   Conclusions: Signal organization of a local electrogram and phase of
   shock delivery do not relate to minimum defibrillation shock energy
   immediately after ventricular fibrillation onset.}},

Abstract = {{Embolization with micron-sized particulates is widely applied to treat
   uterine fibroids. The objective of this work was to develop mixture
   designs to predict materials composition-structure-property
   relationships for the SiO2-CaO-ZnO-La2O3-TiO2-MgO-SrO-Na2O glass system
   and compare its fundamental materials properties (density and
   cytocompatibility), against a state-of-the-art embolic agent (contour
   polyvinyl alcohol) to assess the potential of these materials for
   embolization therapies. The glass structures were evaluated using Si-29
   MAS NMR to identify chemical shift and line width; the particulate
   densities were determined using helium pycnometry and the cell
   viabilities were assessed via MTT assay. Si-29 MAS NMR results indicated
   peak maxima for each glass in the range of -82.3ppm to -89.9ppm;
   associated with Q(2) to Q(3) units in silicate glasses. All experimental
   embolic compositions showed enhanced invitro compatibility in comparison
   to Contour PVA with the exceptions of ORP9 and ORP11 (containing no
   TiO2). In this study, optimal compositions for cell viability were
   obtained for the following compositional ranges: 0.095-0.188mole
   fraction ZnO; 0.068-0.159mole fraction La2O3; 0.545-0.562mole fraction
   SiO2 and 0.042-0.050mole fraction TiO2. To ensure ease of producibility
   in obtaining good melts, a maximum loading of 0.068mole fraction La2O3
   is required. This is confirmed by the desirability approach, for which
   the only experimental composition (ORP5) of the materials evaluated was
   presented as an optimum composition; combining high cell viability with
   ease of production (0.188mole fraction ZnO; 0.068mole fraction La2O3;
   0.562mole fraction SiO2 and 0.042mole fraction TiO2).}},

Abstract = {{One of the major advantages of bolted joints (BJs) over welded, riveted
   and adhesively bonded joints is the disassembling option. This option
   facilitates the manufacturing and transportation of large-scale
   structures that are commonly formed as assemblage of various large
   structural components. However, this option is not always problem free,
   in that, during the life cycle of such structures, the bolts used to
   fasten the joints may become loosened. Although several techniques have
   been developed to mitigate bolt self-loosening (BSL), nonetheless,
   development of a methodology for detecting BSL has consumed considerable
   attention in recent years. As a result, several researchers have been
   seeking simple and reliable methods for detecting bolt-loosening in BJs,
   without compromising their stability. In this study, piezoelectric
   sensors are used to collect the vibration signals of a laboratory-scale
   single lap joint, joining two steel plates with three bolts. The
   acquired signals are then processed using the empirical mode
   decomposition method and the energies of the respective signals are
   calculated. A recently developed effective method is then employed to
   establish the so-called energy damage index, evaluated based on the
   energy stored in certain modes of the collected signal, in both the
   damaged and healthy states of the system. This method is found to be
   quite effective in detecting bolt loosening and the progression of
   self-loosening.}},

Abstract = {{Better understanding of the impact that electrolytes have on the
   hydrodynamic performance of airlift reactors, ALR, is critical to
   improving the design and operational performance of these units which
   are increasingly being used as chemical and biochemical reactors. Such
   knowledge is particularly important to the saline environment
   encountered in water and wastewater treatment, algae production,
   treatment of produced water, aquaculture applications, and the
   management of marine environment.
   The effect of salt concentration on the mass transfer characteristics of
   ALR was investigated using a 200 1 pilot scale internally circulated
   unit equipped with a dual-fluid transonic sparger capable of generating
   microbubbles. Saline solutions containing 0-58,500 ppm were tested.
   A critical analysis of the literature suggests that the liquid side mass
   transfer coefficient, k(L),, is significantly reduced in the presence of
   electrolytes. This adverse effect was however compensated for by the
   achievement of large gas holdups and the formation of very fine bubbles
   in the slowly-coalescent saline systems. The combined effect of these
   factors resulted in the achievement of k(L)a values as high as 0.028
   s(-1) at a superficial velocity of 0.03 m/s while maintaining the
   benefits of the homogeneous flow regime. The values achieved are much
   higher than most ALR data reported for the rapidly-coalescent air/water
   system and are about 5-fold larger than those obtained using
   conventional spargers in the case of the slowly-coalescent saline
   solutions. This superior performance is amplified by the coalescence
   retardation effect of electrolytes; hence, the mass transfer performance
   data depicted a transition/critical concentration at about 0.1 M, a
   value that is slightly lower than that obtained in bubble columns but
   somewhat higher than that obtained using the lab-scale method for
   testing the coalescence of two adjacent bubbles (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the performance of ceramic-on-ceramic
   total hip replacements by combining a retrieval analysis with a
   survivorship analysis to elucidate mechanisms that led to clinical
   failure. Semiquantitative surface damage assessment, contact
   profilometry, contour measurements, and scanning electron microscopy
   were performed to characterize the types and quantify the extent of
   surface damage on the retrieved ceramic components. The implantation
   period was positively correlated with both damage scores of the femoral
   heads (R=0.573, p < 0.001) and the acetabular cups (R=0.592, p < 0.001).
   Increased maximal out-of-roundness values of the femoral heads
   correlated with both increased metal transfer damage score (R=0.384,
   p=0.023) and increased stripe damage score (R=0.729, p 0.001) of the
   acetabular liners. The damage rate (damage score/year) for both the
   retrieved heads and acetabular liners was at least 2.2-fold greater at
   inclination angles of >45 degrees than the damage rate at inclination
   angles of 45 degrees. For the retrieved femoral heads only, the linear
   wear rate of 25.5 +/- 21.3 mu m/year at inclination angles of >45
   degrees was 6-fold greater than the linear wear rate of 4.2 +/- 2.3 mu
   m/year at inclination angles of 45 degrees. Metal transfer on the
   ceramic bearing surface could possibly contribute to fluid-film
   starvation and, in combination with an increased inclination angle, may
   facilitate an adhesive wear mechanism associated with stripe surface
   damage. At our institution, the clinical survivorship of
   ceramic-on-ceramic total hip replacements was 98.9\% (a total of 9 out
   of 815 patients were revised within 10 years after total hip
   arthroplasty) with revision as the end point, suggesting their safe use
   in younger patients.}},

Abstract = {{The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station received
   worldwide attention in March 2011; since then, much of the reporting has
   been limited to stories such as the state of the reactor, the
   trans-Pacific movement of flotsam caused by the tsunami, and the effect
   of the tsunami and accident on Japanese communities. Other than the
   closure of Japan's last operating reactor in May 2012, little has been
   discussed outside of Japan regarding the policies introduced in response
   by the Japanese government in its effort to maintain Japanese energy
   security and the effects on Japan's electricity suppliers and the
   Japanese people.
   This paper presents a detailed examination of the crisis-driven changes
   to policy and regulations instituted by the Japanese government and
   electricity suppliers in the immediate aftermath of the accident up to
   May 2012. The disruption to Japan's long-term energy policies is
   discussed in terms of the country's need to maintain its energy
   security. The paper also considers a number of different energy futures
   for Japan in light of the accident and how they could improve energy
   security in terms of availability, affordability, and acceptability. (c)

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{102-111}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The March 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
   station affected both short- and long-term energy-security in Japan,
   resulting in crisis-driven, ad hoc energy policy and, because of the
   decision to shutter all nuclear reactors, increased the country's demand
   for fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. However, the effects of the
   accident on energy security were not restricted to Japan; for example,
   the worldwide availability and affordability of liquefied natural gas
   were affected by Japan's increased demand; while the accident itself
   resulted in the loss of public acceptability of nuclear power and led
   countries, such as Germany and Italy, to immediately shut down some of
   the nuclear reactors or abandon plans to build new ones.
   This paper examines some of the short-term effects on global energy
   security following the accident at Fukushima, focusing on the main
   replacement fuel, liquefied natural gas. It shows, amongst other things,
   that the accident increased investment in liquefied natural gas projects
   around the world. The paper shows that despite Fukushima contributing to
   nuclear power's loss of acceptability in most developed countries, it is
   still seen as an essential way of improving energy security in many
   countries and, despite what its critics may say, will probably continue
   to be used as a significant source of low-carbon electricity. (c) 2012

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{638-644}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The consequences of myocardial ischemia are examined from the standpoint
   of the neural control system of the heart, a hierarchy of three neuronal
   centers residing in central command, intrathoracic ganglia, and
   intrinsic cardiac ganglia. The basis of the investigation is the premise
   that while this hierarchical control system has evolved to deal with
   ``normal{''} physiological circumstances, its response in the event of
   myocardial ischemia is unpredictable because the singular circumstances
   of this event are as yet not part of its evolutionary repertoire. The
   results indicate that the harmonious relationship between the three
   levels of control breaks down, because of a conflict between the
   priorities that they have evolved to deal with. Essentially, while the
   main priority in central command is blood demand, the priority at the
   intrathoracic and cardiac levels is heart rate. As a result of this
   breakdown, heart rate becomes less predictable and therefore less
   reliable as a diagnostic guide as to the traumatic state of the heart,
   which it is commonly used as such following an ischemic event. On the
   basis of these results it is proposed that under the singular conditions
   of myocardial ischemia a determination of neural control indexes in
   addition to cardiovascular indexes has the potential of enhancing
   clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the issue of output feedback stabilization for
   networked control systems. The randomly sampled measurement process
   caused by the time-varying channel load is modeled as a Markov chain. An
   event-driven transmitter, which depends on the measurement sampling
   period, is introduced to transmit the control signal. In order to
   achieve a less conservative result, a novel output feedback controller,
   including both sampling and event-driven transmitter-induced delay
   indexes, is proposed. The sufficient and necessary condition for the
   mean-square stability, the stochastic stability, and the exponential
   mean-square stability for the closed-loop system is established, and the
   controller is designed by using the cone complementarity linearization
   approach. Finally, based on the ZigBee real communication channel, a
   cart and inverted pendulum system is shown to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study presents combustion and emission results obtained using a
   prototype pellet furnace with 7-32 kW capacity (designed for burning
   high ash content pellet fuels) for four biomass pellets: one grass
   pellet and three wood pellets. Fuel property, gas emissions and furnace
   efficiency are compared. In regard to fuel properties, proximate
   analysis, ultimate analysis and heating values are determined and
   emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are measured and
   compared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for ash analysis.
   No ash agglomeration was observed and ash discharge was in the form of
   powder instead of lumped particles, which are usually observed for high
   ash biomass fuel. The results suggest that grass pellets can
   successfully be combusted with similar performance and emissions to that
   of other wood pellets if burned in appropriate combustion installations.

   convection-A case study of a replica Roman bath}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Floor and wall subcutaneous convective heating is a common and efficient
   supplementary system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
   (HVAC) but the concept dates back nearly 2500 years to when ancient
   Greeks and Romans used it to warm their bathing facilities. This paper
   explores the thermal environment of a replica Roman bath resulting from
   purely subcutaneous convective heating by modelling the bath using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Previous studies examining the
   interior of baths have used either heat fluxes or lumped-mass
   thermodynamics, but neither approach possesses the detail of CFD. The
   average temperature in the 3 m x 4 m room modelled is 35 degrees C;
   however, the hottest air is trapped in the high vault leaving the region
   inhabited by the patrons significantly cooler than the average. The
   results also show that stratification is prominent and that the open
   doorway connecting to the next room heavily influences the room
   temperature. The results also suggest a relative insensitivity to
   changes in the convective heat transfer coefficient and addition of
   humidity to the model. Furthermore, this study not only provides further
   knowledge about an alternative HVAC system but enhances our
   understanding of ancient Roman baths. In addition, it offers an insight
   to a unique thermal environment on the basis of multi-phase and species
   modelling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess lead release in a pipe rig
   system that was disinfected with either chloramines or free chlorine.
   The study was carried out using pipe loops and copper pipe rigs that had
   lead solder, which provided the only source of lead. The water quality
   of the treated water had a low alkalinity ( as ), neutral pH, and low
   hardness ( as ). However, the study used a corrosion control program
   that consisted of dosing with 0.8-mg of zinc orthophosphate and
   controlling the pH to 7.3, that was consistent with the
   corrosion-control program operated in the host water treatment plant.
   Key findings from the study confirmed that chloramines would result in
   lead release under the current corrosion-control program, whereas free
   chlorine was not as compromising. Lead concentrations were approximately
   an order of magnitude lower in the free chlorine system than the
   chloramine systems. In this study, chloramines with a target residual
   concentration of released and following stagnation times of 24h and
   30min, respectively. Furthermore, chloramines with a target residual
   concentration of resulted in a lead release of and following a
   stagnation time of 24h and 30min, respectively. By comparison, the pipe
   rigs that were dosed with a free chlorine target residual concentration
   of had lead concentrations of and for the 24-h and 30-min stagnation
   times. This project demonstrates that care needs to be taken when
   evaluating secondary disinfectants, particularly for those water systems
   having a low dissolved inorganic carbon concentration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends traditional wheel-soil modeling for lightweight
   mobile robots operating with smooth wheels on dry sandy soil to capture
   the transient oscillations that have been observed in drawbar pull
   measurements. To model these drawbar pull fluctuations, a new dynamic
   pressure-sinkage relationship was extrapolated from the literature and
   experimental observations of smooth rigid wheels operating in sandy
   soil. The resulting two-dimensional high-fidelity analytical model was
   validated with a unique single-wheel testbed designed from a Blohm
   Planomat 408 computer-numerically-controlled creep-feed grinding
   machine. For the experimental conditions used in this research, the
   resulting model is able to predict the fluctuating values of the drawbar
   pull for a variety of slip ratios and normal loads tested with a smooth
   rigid wheel in sandy soil. The new model was tuned at a single normal
   load over a variety of slip ratios and was then able to predict the
   amplitude and frequency of the oscillations about the mean drawbar pull
   at different normal loads and slip ratios.}},

Abstract = {{The large recoverable deformation associated with reversible
   stress-induced martensitic transformation for superelastic TiNi alloys
   has been widely exploited in many applications. However, to employ
   superelastic TiNi in applications where high impact loading is expected,
   as in bearings, the effect of loading rate on superelasticity needs to
   be understood. In the current article, the effect of indentation loading
   rate on dent resistance and superelasticity of TiNi is studied.
   Indentation tests are performed, at different loading rates on
   superelastic TiNi alloy and correlated to tensile stress-strain data. It
   is found that the reversible deformation drops as loading rate is
   increased and superelasticity diminishes. Based on data collected and
   results analysis it is proposed that the loss in superelastic behavior
   under high indentation loading rate is related to retardation of the
   stress-induced martensitic transformation. Furthermore, a simple heat
   model was proposed and showed that the temperature rise during
   indentation is not significant.}},

Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{108-117}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Blowouts are among the most undesired and feared accidents during
   drilling operations. The dynamic nature of blowout accidents, resulting
   from both rapidly changing physical parameters and time-dependent
   failure of barriers, necessitates techniques capable of considering time
   dependencies and changes during the lifetime of a well. The present work
   is aimed at demonstrating the application of bow-tie and Bayesian
   network methods in conducting quantitative risk analysis of drilling
   operations. Considering the former method, fault trees and an event tree
   are developed for potential accident scenarios, and then combined to
   build a bow-tie model. In the latter method, first, individual Bayesian
   networks are developed for the accident scenarios and finally, an
   object-oriented Bayesian network is constructed by connecting these
   individual networks. The Bayesian network method provides greater value
   than the bow-tie model since it can consider common cause failures and
   conditional dependencies along with performing probability updating and
   sequential learning using accident precursors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   scaled 12-lobe turbofan mixer. Scalloping was achieved by eliminating
   approximately 70\% of the lobe sidewall area. Measurements were made
   downstream of the mixer in a co-annular wind tunnel, and the simulations
   were carried out using an unstructured Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes
   (RANS) solver, Numeca FINE/Hexa, with k-omega SST model. In the core
   flow, the swirl angle was varied from 0 deg to 30 deg. At high swirl
   angles, a three-dimensional separation bubble was formed on the lobe's
   suction surface penetration region and resulted in the generation of a
   vortex at the lobe valley. The valley vortex quickly dissipated
   downstream. The mixer lobes removed most of the swirl, but scalloped
   lobes removed less swirl in the region of the scalloped notch. The
   residual swirl downstream of the scalloped mixer interacted with the
   vortices and improved mixing rates compared to the unscalloped mixer.
   Core flow swirl up to 10 deg provided improved mixing rates and reduced
   pressure and thrust losses for both mixers. As core flow swirl increased
   beyond 10 deg, the mixing rate continued to improve, but pressure and
   thrust losses declined compared to the zero swirl case. Lobe scalloping,
   in high swirl conditions, resulted in better mixing and improved
   pressure loss over the unscalloped mixer but at the expense of reduced
   thrust.}},

Abstract = {{Gait measures are used to evaluate change in patients with knee
   osteoarthritis (OA), but reliability has not been fully established in
   this population. This study examined test-retest reliability of knee
   angle and moment gait waveform characteristics captured using discrete
   parameters and principal component analysis (PCA) in individuals with
   moderate knee OA. Participants (n = 20) underwent three-dimensional gait
   analysis on two occasions. Motion and force data were captured using two
   camera banks, infrared light emitting diodes and force plate during
   self-selected walking. Knee angle and moment waveforms were calculated
   and analyzed using discrete parameters and by identifying waveform
   characteristics using PCA. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,k)
   examined test-retest reliability of discrete parameters and PCA derived
   scores (PC-scores). ICC2,k values ranged from 0.57 to 0.93 for discrete
   parameters, 0.52-0.86 for knee angle PC-scores and 0.30-0.94 for the
   knee moment PC-scores. However, 10 of 13 discrete parameters, six of
   nine knee angle PC-scores and seven of nine knee moment PC-scores had
   ICC2,k values greater than or equal to 0.70. Discrete parameters and
   PC-scores from flexion angles and adduction moments had the highest
   ICC2,k values while adduction angles, rotation angles, and rotation
   moments had the lowest. Most knee angle and moment waveform
   characteristics demonstrated ICC2,k values that could be interpreted as
   acceptable. Caution should be used when examining adduction and rotation
   angle magnitudes and early/mid-stance rotation moment magnitudes due to
   lower ICC2,k values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Optical detection of gold nanoparticles in a prostate-shaped porcine
   phantom}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles can be used as molecular contrast agents binding
   specifically to cancer sites and thus delineating tumor regions. Imaging
   gold nanoparticles deeply embedded in tissues with optical techniques
   possesses significant challenges due to multiple scattering of optical
   photons that blur the obtained images. Both diagnostic and therapeutic
   applications can benefit from a minimally invasive technique that can
   identify, localize, and quantify the payloads of gold nanoparticles
   deeply embedded in biological tissues. An optical radiance technique is
   applied to map localized inclusions of gold nanorods in 650- to 900-nm
   spectral range in a porcine phantom that mimics prostate geometry.
   Optical radiance defines a variation in the angular density of photons
   impinging on a selected point in the tissue from various directions. The
   inclusions are formed by immersing a capillary filled with gold nanorods
   in the phantom at increasing distances from the detecting fiber. The
   technique allows the isolation of the spectroscopic signatures of the
   inclusions from the background and identification of inclusion locations
   in the angular domain. Detection of similar to 4 x 10(10) gold
   nanoparticles or 0.04 mg Au/mL (detector-inclusion separation 10 mm,
   source-detector separation 15 mm) in the porcine tissue is demonstrated.
   The encouraging results indicate a promising potential of radiance
   spectroscopy in early prostate cancer diagnostics with gold
   nanoparticles. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{While macrophages have been implicated in the failure of bioprosthetic
   heart valves, the macrophage response to crosslinked native pericardial
   collagen has not been previously investigated. Using decellularized
   bovine pericardium (DBP) as a model for native collagen, this study
   investigated the response of macrophage-like cells (U937s) to DBP,
   either: (i) untreated, or (ii) exogenously crosslinked with
   glutaraldehyde or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC).
   We have previously validated the use of U937 cells as models for the
   response of human monocyte-derived macrophages to decellularized
   pericardial materials and, per our previous work, differentiated the
   U937 cells directly on the three material surfaces. After 72 h in
   culture, the cells and medium were analyzed for DNA content, acid
   phosphatase activity, and cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase release.
   As well, cell/substrate samples were fixed for SEM. Fewer cells attached
   to or survived on the glutaraldehyde-treated substrate, and some showed
   an abnormal morphology compared to cells cultured on the other surfaces.
   Further, cells on glutaraldehyde-treated surfaces released more
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, more MMP-1 and less MMP-2 and MMP-9. The
   poor performance of the U937 macrophage-like cells on the
   glutaraldehyde-treated surfaces appears to be due to surface
   characteristics rather than to soluble aldehyde or other components
   leaching from the crosslinked material. These results provide evidence
   that crosslinking with glutaraldehyde is cytotoxic to macrophage-like
   cells, and that crosslinking with a zero-length crosslinker like EDC can
   be an acceptable alternative crosslinking treatment for biomaterials.

Abstract = {{Background: The ECG is important in the diagnosis and triage of the
   acute coronary syndrome (ACS), especially in the hyperacute phase, the
   ``golden hours,{''} during which myocardial salvage possibilities are
   largest. An important triaging decision to be taken is whether or not a
   patient requires primary PCI, for which, as mentioned in the guidelines,
   the presence of an ST elevation (STE) pattern in the ECG is a major
   criterion. However, preexisting non-zero ST amplitudes (diagnostic, but
   also non-diagnostic) can obscure or even preclude this diagnosis.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the potential diagnostic
   possibilities of ischemia detection by means of changes in the ST
   vector, Delta ST, and changes in the VG (QRST integral) vector, Delta
   VG. We studied the vectorcardiograms (VCGs) synthesized of the ECGs of
   84 patients who underwent elective PTCA. Mean +/- SD balloon occlusion
   times were 260 +/- 76 s. The ECG ischemia diagnosis (ST elevation, STE,
   or non-ST-elevation, NSTE), magnitudes and orientations of the ST and VG
   vectors, and the differences Delta ST and Delta VG with the baseline ECG
   were measured after 3 min of balloon occlusion.
   Results: Planar angles between the Delta ST and Delta VG vectors were
   14.9 +/- 14.0 degrees. Linear regression of Delta VG on Delta ST yielded
   Delta VG = 324. Delta ST (r = 0.85; P < 0.0001, Delta ST in mV). We
   adopted Delta ST > 0.05 mV, and the corresponding Delta VG > 16.2 mV.ms
   as ischemia thresholds. The classical criteria characterized the ECGs of
   46/84 (55\%) patients after 3 min of occlusion as STE ECGs. Combined
   application of the Delta ST and Delta VG criteria identified 73/84
   (87\%) of the patients as ischemic.
   Conclusion: Differential diagnosis by Delta ST and Delta VG (requiring
   an earlier made non-ischemic baseline ECG) could dramatically improve
   ECG guided detection of patients who urgently require catheter
   intervention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundSince the 1970s red blood cells (RBCs) have had a rated shelf
   life of 42 days. Recently, studies have suggested poorer patient
   outcomes when older blood is transfused. However, shortening the shelf
   life of RBCs may increase costs and lead to greater instances of
   outdates and shortages.
   Study Design and MethodsA simulation method to evaluate the impact of a
   shorter shelf life for RBCs on a regional blood network was developed. A
   network model of the production and distribution system in the province
   of Quebec was built and validated.
   ResultsThe model suggests that a shelf life of 21 or 28 days will have
   modest impact on outdate and shortage rates. A shelf life of 14 days
   will create significant challenges for both blood suppliers and
   hospitals and will result in systemwide outdate rates of 6.64\% and
   shortage rates of 2.75\%. The impact of a shorter shelf life for RBCs
   will disproportionately affect smaller and midsize hospitals.
   ConclusionA shelf life of 28 or 21 days is feasible without excessive
   increases to systemwide outdate, shortage, or emergency ordering rates.
   Large hospitals will see minimal impact; smaller hospitals will see
   larger increases and may be unable to find inventory policies that
   maintain both low outdate and shortage rates. Reducing the shelf life to
   14 days, or lower, results in significant challenges for suppliers and
   hospitals of all sizes. All hospitals will see an impact on outdate and
   shortage rates; overall systemwide outdate rates (6\% or more) will
   reach levels that would currently be considered unacceptably high.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of high-frequency phased-array ultrasound transducers is
   challenging because of the small element- to-element pitch required to
   avoid large grating lobes appearing in the field-of-view. Phase
   coherence imaging (PCI) was recently proposed as a highly effective
   technique to suppress grating lobes in large-pitch arrays for synthetic
   aperture beamforming. Our previous work proposed and theoretically
   validated a technique called pulse probing for improving grating lobe
   suppression when transmit beamforming is used with PCI. The present work
   reports the experimental verification of the proposed technique, in
   which the data was collected using a high-frequency ultrasound system
   and the processing was done offline. The data was collected with a
   50-MHz, 256-element, 1.26.-pitch linear array, for which only the
   central 64-elements were used as the full aperture while the beam was
   steered to various angles. By sending a defocused pulse, the PCI
   weighting factors could be calculated, and were subsequently applied to
   the conventional transmit-receive beamforming. The experimental two-way
   radiation patterns showed that the grating lobe level was suppressed
   approximately 40 dB using the proposed technique, consistent with the
   theory. The suppression of overlapping grating lobes in reconstructed
   phased array images from multiple wire-phantoms in a water bath and
   tissue phantoms further validated the effectiveness of the proposed
   technique. The application of pulse probing along with PCI should
   simplify the fabrication of large-pitch phased arrays at high
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that
   progresses with marked interindividual clinical variability. We
   postulate the existence of endogenous molecules within the human brain
   exerting an antiaggregant activity that will prevent/slow Alzheimer
   disease progression. Methods: We performed in silico studies to
   determine if the small endogenous molecules L-phosphoserine (L-PS) and
   3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) could bind to the target region of
   beta-amyloid responsible for protein misfolding. In vitro assays
   measured the antiaggregation effect of these molecules at varying
   concentrations. Results: In silico studies demonstrated that L-PS and
   3-HAA, both endogenous brain molecules, were capable of binding to the
   histidine(13)-histidine-glutamine-lysine(16) (HHQK) region of
   beta-amyloid involved in misfolding: these interactions were
   energetically favoured. The in vitro assays showed that both L-PS and
   3-HAA were capable of inhibiting beta-amyloid aggregation in a
   dose-dependent manner, with 3-HAA being more potent than L-PS.
   Limitations: Studies were performed in silico and in vitro but not in
   vivo. Conclusion: We successfully identified 2 endogenous brain
   molecules, L-PS and 3-HAA, that were capable of binding to the region of
   beta-amyloid that leads to protein misfolding and neurotoxicity. Both
   L-PS and 3-HAA were able to inhibit beta-amyloid aggregation in varying
   concentrations; levels of these compounds in the brain may impact their
   effectiveness in slowing/preventing beta-amyloid aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-free glass polyalkenoate cements (GPC) have been hindered for
   use as injectable bone cements by their inability to balance handling
   characteristics with mechanical integrity. Currently, zinc-based,
   aluminum-free GPCs demonstrate compression strengths in excess of 60
   MPa, but set in c. 1-2 mm. Previous efforts to extend the setting
   reaction have remained clinically insufficient and are typically
   accompanied by a significant drop in strength. This work synthesized
   novel glasses based on a zinc silicate composition with the inclusion of
   GeO2, ZrO2, and Na2O, and evaluated the setting reaction and mechanical
   properties of the resultant GPCs. Germanium based GPCs were found to
   have working times between 5 and 10 min, setting times between 14 and 36
   min, and compression strengths in excess of 30 MPa for the first 30
   days. The results of this investigation have shown that the inclusion of
   GeO2, ZrO2, and Na2O into the glass network have produced, for the first
   time, an aluminum-free GPC that is clinically viable as injectable bone
   cements with regards to handling characteristics and mechanical

Abstract = {{Cellular and molecular MRI trafficking studies using superparamagnetic
   iron oxide (SPIO) have greatly improved non-invasive investigations of
   disease progression and drug efficacy, but thus far, these studies have
   largely been restricted to qualitative assessment of hypo- or
   hyperintense areas near SPIO. In this work, SPIO quantification using
   inversion recovery balanced steady-state free precession (IR-bSSFP) was
   demonstrated at 3 T by extracting R-2 values from a monoexponential
   model (P. Schmitt et al., 2004). A low flip angle was shown to reduce
   the apparent recovery rate of the IR-bSSFP time course, thus extending
   the dynamic range of quantification. However, low flip angle
   acquisitions preclude the use of traditional methods for combining RF
   phase-cycled images to reduce banding artifacts arising from
   off-resonance due to B-0 inhomogeneity. To achieve R-2 quantification of
   SPIO, we present a new algorithm applicable to low flip angle IR-bSSFP
   acquisitions that is specifically designed to identify on-resonance
   acquisitions. We demonstrate in this work, using both theoretical and
   empirical methods, that the smallest estimated R-2 from multiple RF
   phase-cycled acquisitions correspond well to the on-resonance time
   course. Using this novel minimum R-2 algorithm, homogeneous R-2 maps and
   linear R-2 calibration curves were created up to 100 mu g(Fe)/mL with 20
   degrees flip angles, despite substantial B-0 inhomogeneity. In addition,
   we have shown this technique to be feasible for pre-clinical research:
   the minimum R-2 algorithm was resistant to off-resonance in a single
   slice mouse R-2 map, whereas maximum intensity projection resulted in
   banding artifacts and overestimated R-2 values. With the application of
   recent advances in accelerated acquisitions, IR-bSSFP has the potential
   to quantify SPIO in vivo, thus providing important information for
   oncology, immunology, and regenerative medicine MRI studies. Crown

Abstract = {{Objective The leishmanin skin test (LST) has been used for clinical
   diagnosis of leishmaniasis and epidemiological studies of the disease.
   Thus far, evidence has suggested that LST conversion indicates a degree
   of protection against leishmaniasis. In this study, we have put this
   assumption to test. Methods and materials A total of 273 participants
   with positive LST living in a hyperendemic area for leishmaniasis were
   followed for threeyears for any occurrence of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
   Results Twenty-two of the 273 participants contracted leishmaniasis
   during the 3-year follow-up. These new cases included participants who
   had a previous history of active disease, those who had a history of
   leishmanization, or those who were suspected of having a history of
   subclinical infection. Discussion In this study, the incidence of
   leishmaniasis in individuals with positive LST was close to the general
   incidence of the disease in the same hyperendemic area. These results
   suggest that although LST conversion may be a marker for partial
   immunity towards leishmaniasis, it may not, however, indicate complete
   protection against the disease, and consequently there is a need for
   revision of current vaccine development approaches which are based on
   rendering vaccinated individuals LST positive.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental program involving the testing of 14 specimens was
   conducted to investigate the behavior and capacity of concrete masonry
   infills bounded by steel frames. Five infill specimens as well as one
   bare frame specimen were subjected to an in-plane lateral load applied
   at the frame top beam level whereas the remaining 8 specimens were
   tested under combined in-plane axial and lateral loading. Specimens
   included non-grouted, partially grouted and fully grouted infills. The
   openings of infills were also considered. The presence of axial. load
   resulted in a marked increase in the lateral resistance of the infills
   and the correlation between axial load and lateral resistance is
   discussed. In addition, grouting and opening on the failure mode,
   lateral ultimate load, and stiffness of specimens are presented. The
   comparison of the test results with values suggested by the current
   design standards of both Canada and United States shows that the
   Canadian standard provides a markedly conservative design of masonry
   infills whereas the American design standard gives an improved estimate
   of infill stiffness and strength. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{22-31}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a non-contact, non-destructive three-dimensional
   wheel scanning system which is capable of measuring and characterizing
   the surface topography of grinding wheels. The scanning system employs a
   white light chromatic sensor that traverses across the wheel surface
   using motorized stages controlled by a computer. With a planer
   resolution of 2 mu m and a depth resolution of 25 nm, the novel scanning
   system was shown to compare well with a HITACHI S-4700 Scanning
   Electronic Microscope and a Nanovea PS50 profiler for measuring a 60
   grit aluminum oxide grinding wheel-without having to destroy the
   grinding wheel to take the measurements. It was shown that image
   processing techniques, including segmentation and ``blob{''} analyses,
   were able to extract the cutting edge density, width, spacing and
   protrusion height from the raw topography measurements. The wheel
   scanning system was then used to characterize the surface of a grinding
   wheel that had been dressed using fine, medium and coarse dressing
   conditions. The resulting cutting edge width and spacing was found to be
   exponentially distributed over the wheel surface-regardless of the
   dressing condition, while the cutting edge protrusion height appeared to
   be approximately normally distributed. The coarse dressing condition
   yielded fewer, smaller and more widely spaced cutting edges than the
   medium and fine cases. Furthermore, for the dressing conditions used in
   this research, it was observed that dressing noticeably affected the
   grinding wheel surface to a depth of 80 mu m, while grain geometry and
   spacing dominated the surface topography beyond this depth. (C) 2013

   diffractive optical element is investigated, for the first time, by
   finite-difference time-domain method based on rigorous electromagnetic
   theory. The focusing of G-Fresnel lens with different incident
   wavelength, focal length, and period of grating are explored. Numerical
   result shows that a subwavelength focusing can be achieved by G-Fresnel
   lens. Meanwhile, for incident beam with wavelength larger than the
   period of grating, the transmission of light decreases abruptly. The
   optical performance is governed by scattering effects from micro
   G-Fresnel lens. Our results provide very useful information in the field
   of optical imaging with high resolution and optical precision
   measurement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the robust H-infinity filtering problem is investigated
   for networked stochastic systems with norm bounded uncertainties and
   imperfect multiple transmitted measurements. The considered imperfect
   measurements contain randomly occurring sensor nonlinearities and packet
   dropouts, which are represented by multiple independent Markov chains
   with partially unknown transition probabilities. A one to one mapping is
   constructed to map the multiple independent Markov chains to an
   augmented one for facilitating the resultant system analysis. A
   sufficient condition is established to guarantee the exponential
   mean-square stability with fast decay rate and a certain H-infinity
   performance level of the filtering error systems. Then, the parameters
   of the full-order filter are expressed in terms of linear matrix
   inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is shown to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   therefore focused on fatigue cracking issues associated with wheel loads
   due to heavy truck traffic. The bridge assessment model required five
   components: a vehicle load model, a fatigue damage accumulation model, a
   residual strength model, a reliability model and an SHM decision model.
   Each of these components is discussed within the article with specific
   reference to previous research on steel-free bridge deck systems. The
   proposed model is used to develop a decision threshold for monitoring
   the oldest steel-free bridge deck in service.}},

Abstract = {{TiC-based ceramic-metal composites, or cermets, are widely used in
   applications requiring wear and corrosion resistance. In the present
   work, a family of novel TiC-stainless steel (grade 304L) cermets has
   been developed using vacuum melt infiltration (1500 degrees C/1 h), with
   steel binder contents varied from 5 to 30 vol\%. Microstructural
   analysis showed a homogenous distribution of TiC within the steel
   binder, with mean TiC grain sizes of similar to 6 mu m. Increasing the
   steel content resulted in an increase in the indentation fracture
   resistance and a decrease in the hardness. The reciprocating wear
   resistance of the cermets was assessed using a ball-on-flat geometry,
   using a WC-Co sphere dry sliding on the polished cermet surface. It was
   shown that there is an increase in the specific wear rate with both
   increasing load and binder content. Similarly, a higher coefficient of
   friction was observed with higher steel binder contents. The morphology
   of the worn surface was investigated using scanning electron microscopy,
   and associated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, to more fully
   understand the operative wear mechanisms. Evidence of a transition from
   two- to three-body abrasive wear was observed, together with the
   formation of a tribolayer, indicating that adhesive wear was also
   occurring. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Security was not considered when current wireless sensor nodes were
   designed. As a result, providing high level of security on current WSNs
   platforms is unattainable, especially against attacks based on key
   resolving and node compromise. In this paper, we scrutinize the security
   holes in current WSNs platforms and compare the main approaches to
   implementing their cryptographic primitives in terms of security, time,
   and energy efficiency. To secure these holes and provide more
   efficiency, we propose SN-SEC, a 32-bit RISC secure wireless sensor
   platform with hardware cryptographic primitives. The choice of
   cryptographic primitives for SN-SEC is based on their compatibility with
   the constrained nature of WSNs and their security. SN-SEC is implemented
   using very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language.
   Experimental results using synthesis for Spartan-6 low-power FPGA show
   that the proposed design has a very reasonable computational time and
   energy consumption compared to well-known WSN processers.}},

Abstract = {{Human beings are, in general, risk-averse and willing to go to great
   lengths to reduce failure consequences. However, if the underlying
   issues are not understood, effective action cannot properly be taken. A
   landslide hazard assessment framework capable of estimating regional
   probabilities of slope failure can be used to aid a vast number of
   communities currently living in landslide ``danger zones{''}. Such a
   framework would provide a tool with which community resources can be
   optimized and ensure that appropriate preparedness and mitigation
   strategies are in place. Maximum slope angles, as estimated using
   digital elevation models (DEMs), are one of the most important
   indicators for landslide hazard assessment. This paper uses local
   averaging theory to determine how the resolution of DEMs affects
   regional landslide probability estimates. Emphasis is on a regional
   landslide hazard assessment, measured by the probability that one or
   more slopes of at least a critical minimum scale will fail within the

   results showed that most of the peptide fractions (SF2-SF4) displayed
   significantly higher (p < 0.05) oxygen radical absorbing capacity values
   (1315-1541 mu M TE/g) than the SPH (819.3 mu M TE/g). Most of the
   peptide fractions also significantly (p < 0.05) scavenged
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and superoxide free radicals when compared
   to the non-fractionated SPH. However, metal chelating activity of the
   SPH was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the peptide
   fractions. Overall, the free radical scavenging capacity of the peptides
   increased with hydrophobicity, except for hydroxyl radicals. Glutathione
   exhibited superior antioxidant abilities in most assays except for
   chelating and reducing of metal ions, where SPH and its purified
   fractions showed better activities. SPH and the peptide fractions
   strongly inhibited linoleic acid oxidation in the following order SPH =
   SF2 = SF3 > SF1 > SF4, especially at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL peptide
   concentrations. Therefore, salmon peptides may serve as useful
   ingredients to improve shelf life of lipid-containing foods and also for
   the formulation of nutritional products aimed at oxidative stress
   reduction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two most important geometric parameters that describe the mechanics
   of grinding are the uncut chip thickness and the contact length.
   Currently, analytical approaches are used to estimate these parameters.
   The accuracy of these approaches, however, is limited because they do
   not take into account the random shape, size, and protrusion height and
   placement of the abrasive grains around the circumference of the
   grinding wheel. In this paper, a simulation technique was used to gain
   new insight into the effect of the stochastic nature of grinding wheels
   on the geometric properties of the grinding process. The simulator was
   used to calculate the number of active grains, uncut chip thickness, and
   contact length for a stochastic wheel model of Radiac Abrasive's
   WRA-60-J5-V1 grinding wheel. These values were then mapped to every
   grain on the grinding wheel and used to determine the instantaneous
   material removal rate of the wheel and workpiece surface finish. There
   was excellent agreement between the predicted and experimentally
   measured surface topology of the workpiece. The results suggest that
   only 10-25 \% of the grains on the grinding wheel are active and that
   the average grinding chip may be as much as ten times thicker and ten
   times shorter than would be produced by a grinding wheel with a regular
   arrangement of cutting edges as assumed by existing analytical
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by different species of Leishmania
   parasites and its available treatments have not yet provided a strong
   consistent result. The weak response of current chemotherapeutics is due
   to their deficient effects on stealth parasites inside macrophages,
   rapid clearance from the site of action and systemic side effects in
   high doses. Liposomal formulation of anti-leishmanial drugs could
   overcome these problems. In this study, different liposomal formulations
   of three famous anti-leishmanial drugs: Glucantime, miltefosine and
   paromomycin were prepared by a modified freeze-drying double emulsion
   method. Liposome size, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency were
   evaluated, and their imaging was carried out by means of atomic force
   microscopy. Three formulations were evaluated in vivo by subcutaneous
   injection into skin lesions caused by Leishmania major in BALB/c mice.
   Encapsulation efficiency of prepared liposomes was up to 90\%; however,
   they inherited a bimodal size distribution that caused their
   encapsulation efficiency to decrease to 50\% during filtering
   sterilization. Besides, the effect of surface charge was significant on
   preparation procedure, size and encapsulation efficiency. All three
   formulations reduced amastigote counts and lesion size but only
   miltefosine-loaded formulations had significant therapeutic effects
   compared with control group (p<0.05).}},

Abstract = {{The use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials in various
   applications such as aerospace, automotive, sport equipment, and oil and
   gas industries has been growing in a steady rate in recent years. The
   potential use of perforated FRP tubes (pipes) in oil and gas
   industry-related applications can become significantly greater, provided
   that the influence of the harsh environmental conditions specific to the
   industry could be tolerated by the materials used to form such tubes,
   with minimal degradation to system's mechanical and physical properties.
   Unfortunately, there is not adequate database and information in the
   literature in regards to the long-term response of perforated FRP tubes.
   The purpose of this study is therefore to investigate whether FRP could
   be confidently used in structural applications that are primarily
   subjected to compressive loading and exposed to harsh environments,
   without significant deterioration of their physical and mechanical
   properties. For that, three sets of perforated glass fiber-reinforced
   plastic (GFRP) pipes were fabricated and subjected to accelerated aging
   conditions in an acid. Subsequently, the pipes were tested to failure
   under an axially applied compressive load. Results showed a considerable
   decrease in the load carrying capacity and axial stiffness of perforated
   pipes having certain D/t ratios, as a result of the aging.}},

Abstract = {{Nonylphenol is an endocrine disruptor with harmful effects including
   feminization and carcinogenesis on various organisms. This study aims to
   investigate the distribution and ecological risks of nonylphenol in the
   Daliao River Estuary, China. Nonylphenol, together with other phenolic
   endocrine disruptors (bisphenol A, 4-t-butylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol, and
   2,4-dichlorophenol), was detected in surface water and sediment on three
   cruises in May 2009, June 2010, and August 2010, respectively. A large
   flooding occurred during our sampling campaign in August and its effect
   on nonylphenol concentrations and fluxes in the estuary was therefore
   evaluated. The results showed that nonylphenol with a concentration
   range between 83.6-777 ng l(-1) and 1.5-456 ng g(-1) dw in surface water
   and sediment was the most abundant among the phenolic compounds,
   accounting for 59.1-81.0 and 79.9-92.1 \% of the total phenolic
   concentration in surface water and sediment, respectively. The
   concentrations recorded in May and June were comparable, whereas those
   in August were considerably higher, mainly due to the flush of flooding.
   The flooding also caused a 50 times increase in nonylphenol flux from
   the estuary into the adjacent Bohai Sea. Nonylphenol concentrations in
   the estuary have exceeded the threshold level of undesirable effects
   with a potential risk of harm to local species, especially benthic
   organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether alterations in knee joint muscle
   activation patterns during gait were related to structural severity
   determined by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiographic grades, for those with
   a moderate knee OA classification.
   Scope: Eighty-two individuals with knee OA, classified as moderate using
   a functional and clinical criterion were stratified on KL-grade (KL II,
   KL III and KL IV). Thirty-five asymptomatic individuals were matched for
   age and walking velocity. Lower limb motion and surface electromyograms
   from rectus femoris plus lateral and medial sites for the gastrocnemii,
   vastii and hamstring muscles were recorded during self-selected walking.
   Gait velocity and characteristics from sagittal plane knee angular
   displacement waveforms were calculated. Principal component analysis
   extracted amplitude and temporal features from electromyographic
   waveform. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group,
   muscle) and interactions (alpha = 0.05) for these features. No
   differences in anthropometrics, velocity, knee muscle strength and
   symptoms were found among the three OA groups (p > 0.05). Specific
   features from medial gastrocnemius, lateral hamstring and quadriceps
   amplitude and temporal patterns were significantly different among OA
   groups (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Systematic alterations in specific knee joint muscle
   activation patterns were associated with increasing structural severity
   based on KL-grades whereas other alterations were associated with the
   presence of OA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Liner systems are increasingly being used to protect the environment
   from contaminated waste. At the same time, society is increasingly
   insisting on estimates of the probability that these liner systems will
   fail to achieve their design objectives, one of which is to limit
   hydraulic flow from the contaminated region to acceptably small levels.
   This paper presents a methodology to estimate the probability of
   excessive hydraulic flow, considering the spatial variability of the
   soil composing the liner (its mean, variance, and correlation length) as
   well as the liner thickness. Semiempirical equations predicting the mean
   and variance of the effective hydraulic conductivity of the liner, based
   on theory and calibrated by random finite-element method simulations,
   are presented and used to investigate the probability that a liner
   exceeds regulatory hydraulic flow requirements. The proposed methodology
   is illustrated by an example. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{This work provides preliminary data on the effect of torrefaction on the
   apparent density of biomass. It also examines how the shape of wood is
   affected by torrefaction. Experiments conducted on cylinders of poplar
   wood showed that torrefaction reduced both density and volume of the
   wood, and the extent of reduction increased with increase in severity of
   torrefaction. The shape of the wood appears to have some effect on the
   extent of density change. The shrinkage in radial direction was 34\%,
   while reduction in longitudinal direction was 6.58.8\%. The mass yield
   decreased with torrefaction severity. (c) 2013 Canadian Society for
