Abstract = {{This study was aimed at testing the applicability of modified Weber
   number scaling with Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil, and developing a
   Reynolds number scaling approach for oil droplet size prediction for
   high viscosity oils. Dispersant to oil ratio and empirical coefficients
   were also quantified. Finally, a two-step RosinRammler scheme was
   introduced for the determination of droplet size distribution. This new
   approach appeared more advantageous in avoiding the inconsistency in
   interfacial tension measurements, and consequently delivered concise
   droplet size prediction. Calculated and observed data correlated well
   based on Reynolds number scaling. The relation indicated that chemical
   dispersant played an important role in reducing the droplet size of ANS
   under different seasonal conditions. The proposed Reynolds number
   scaling and two-step Rosin-Rammler approaches provide a concise,
   reliable way to predict droplet size distribution, supporting decision
   making in chemical dispersant application during an offshore oil spill.

   reaction in glass-ionomer cements}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{256-259}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Glass ionomer cements (GICs) have been successfully used in dental
   applications for many decades, and new cement compositions are
   continuously being developed to expand the utility of GICs into broader
   applications including orthopaedics. To evaluate the clinical handling
   of GICs, two main measures of the setting reaction are currently used:
   working time and setting time. Attenuated total reflectance fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) has potential as a powerful
   new tool for real-time characterization of these setting reactions,
   providing information on evolving chemical structure while allowing for
   greater sensitivity and reduced human variability. ATR-FTIR was used to
   examine the effect of calcium polyphosphate addition at 0-50 wt\% to two
   GICs: a zinc-silicate cement and a germanium zinc silicate cement. The
   slowing of the initial setting reaction with CPP addition to the
   germanium zinc silicate cements corresponded to a large increase in the
   injectability window, as demonstrated using a preliminary
   mechanically-based injectability test protocol, opening new
   possibilities for clinical applications. We propose that ATR-FTIR is a
   valuable tool for evaluating the setting reaction of glass ionomer
   cements to supplement existing measurements of working and setting time.

Abstract = {{Seeking better surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waveguides is of critical
   importance to construct the frequency-agile terahertz (THz) front-end
   circuits. We propose and investigate here a new class of
   semiconductor-based slot plasmonic waveguides for subwavelength THz
   transport. Optimizations of the key geometrical parameters demonstrate
   its better guiding properties for simultaneous realization of long
   propagation lengths (up to several millimeters) and ultra-tight mode
   confinement (similar to lambda(2)/530) in the THz spectral range. The
   feasibility of the waveguide for compact THz components is also studied
   to lay the foundations for its practical implementations. Importantly,
   the waveguide is compatible with the current complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication technique. We believe the
   proposed waveguide configuration could offer a potential for developing
   a CMOS plasmonic platform and can be designed into various components
   for future integrated THz circuits (ITCs).}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the feasibility of a novel adiabatic magnesium
   hydride (MgH2) reactor concept based on thermochemical heat storage. In
   such a concept, the heat of reaction released during the absorption of
   hydrogen is stored by a thermochemical material in order to be reused in
   a subsequent desorption stage. Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) has been
   selected as the suitable material for integration into the MgH2 storage
   system due to its thermodynamic properties. An analytical formulation of
   hydrogen absorption time is used to determine the range of the
   geometrical characteristics of the two storage media, their properties
   and their operating conditions. The advantage of the proposed new
   concept is the possibility to reduce the mass of the heat storage media
   by a factor of 4 compared to phase change material, improving then the
   gravimetric system capacity as well as its total cost. The second
   advantage is an improved flexibility of the operating pressure
   conditions for MgH2 absorption reaction and Mg(OH)(2) dehydration
   reaction that enables shorter hydrogen absorption times by ensuring
   larger temperature gradients between the two storage media. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Semiconducting single-walled carbon nano tube (s-SWNT) light sensitized
   devices, such as infrared photodetectors and solar cells, have recently
   been widely reported. Despite their excellent individual electrical
   properties, efficient carrier transport from one carbon nanotube to
   another remains a fundamental challenge. Specifically, photovoltaic
   devices with active layers made from s-SWNTs have suffered from low
   efficiencies caused by three main challenges: the overwhelming presence
   of high-bandgap polymers in the films, the weak bandgap offset between
   the LUMO of the s-SWNTs and the acceptor C-60, and the limited exciton
   diffusion length from one SWNT to another of around 5 nm that limits the
   carrier extraction efficiency. Herein, we employ a combination of
   processing and device architecture design strategies to address each of
   these transport challenges and fabricate photovoltaic devices with
   s-SWNT films well beyond the exciton diffusion limit of 5 nm. While our
   solution processing method minimizes the presence of undesired polymers
   in our active films, our interfacial designs led to a significant
   increase in current generation with the addition of a highly doped C-60
   layer (n-doped C-60), resulting in increased carrier separation
   efficiency from the s-SWNTs films. We create a dense interconnected
   nanoporous mesh of s-SWNTs using solution shearing and infiltrate it
   with the acceptor C-60. Thus, our final engineered bulk heterojunction
   allows carriers from deep within to be extracted by the C60 registering
   a 10-fold improvement in performance from our preliminary structures.}},

Abstract = {{A variance detection (VD)-based impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB)
   system has the potential of mitigating narrowband interference (NBI),
   even in multipath environments. However, as a highly nonlinear system,
   which involves fourth-order multiplications, comprehensive analysis and
   evaluations of its performances have not been seen so far. In this
   paper, we address the issues by developing a log-normal random
   distribution model for the VD-based IR-UWB receiver and deriving the
   analytical bit-error-rate formulas for the system in both additive white
   Gaussian noise and CM1 multipath channels with and without NBIs for the
   first time. Furthermore, through both theoretical analysis and
   simulations, we show that the presented VD-based receivers can
   outperform the conventional energy-detection-based and the fourth-order
   detection-based receivers and have a stronger inherent ability to
   mitigate destructive performance degradation caused by strong NBIs. This
   makes the VD-based IR-UWB system a good candidate as a non-coherent
   IR-UWB receiver for low power and low complexity applications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{125}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about how valvular tissues grow and remodel in response
   to altered loading. In this work, we used the pregnancy state to
   represent a non-pathological cardiac volume overload that distends the
   mitral valve (MV), using both extant and new experimental data and a
   modified form of our MV structural constitutive model. We determined
   that there was an initial period of permanent set-like deformation where
   no remodelling occurs, followed by a remodelling phase that resulted in
   near-complete restoration of homeostatic tissue-level behaviour. In
   addition, we observed that changes in the underlying MV interstitial
   cell (MVIC) geometry closely paralleled the tissue-level remodelling
   events, undergoing an initial passive perturbation followed by a gradual
   recovery to the pre-pregnant state. Collectively, these results suggest
   that valvular remodelling is actively mediated by average MVIC
   deformations (i.e. not cycle to cycle, but over a period of weeks).
   Moreover, tissue-level remodelling is likely to be accomplished by
   serial and parallel additions of fibrillar material to restore the mean
   homeostatic fibre stress and MVIC geometries. This finding has
   significant implications in efforts to understand and predict MV growth
   and remodelling following such events as myocardial infarction and
   surgical repair, which also place the valve under altered loading
   conditions.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Emergency department overcrowding is a widespread problem and often
   leads to ambulance offload delay. If no bed is available when a patient
   arrives, the patient has to wait with the ambulance crew. A recent
   Canadian innovation is the offload zone-an area where multiple patients
   can wait with a single paramedic-nurse team allowing, the ambulance crew
   to return to service immediately. Although a reduction in offload delay
   was anticipated, it was observed that the offload zone is often at
   capacity. In this study we investigate why this is the case and use a
   continuous time Markov chain to evaluate how interventions can prevent
   congestion in the offload zone. Specifically we demonstrate conditions
   where the offload zone worsens offload delay and conditions where the
   offload zone can essentially eliminate offload delay. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Spent K-Cups were liquefied into crude bio-oil in a water-ethanol
   co-solvent mixture and reaction conditions were optimized using response
   surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD). The
   effects of three independent variables on the yield of crude bio-oil
   were examined, including the reaction temperature (varied from 255
   degrees C to 350 degrees C), reaction time (varied from 0 min to 25 min)
   and solvent/feedstock mass ratio (varied from 2:1 to 12:1). The optimum
   reaction conditions identified were 276 degrees C, 3 min, and
   solvent/feedstock mass ratio of 11:1, giving a mass fraction yield of
   crude bio-oil of 60.0\%. The overall carbon recovery at the optimum
   conditions was 93\% in mass fraction. The effects of catalyst addition
   (NaOH and H2SO4) on the yield of crude bio-oil were also investigated
   under the optimized reaction conditions. The results revealed that the
   presence of NaOH promoted the decomposition of feedstock and
   significantly enhanced the bio-oil production and liquefaction
   efficiency, whereas the addition of H2SO4 resulted in a negative impact
   on the liquefaction process, decreasing the yield of crude bio-oil. (C)

Abstract = {{CT ECGI Electromechanical Imaging. Introduction: The interplay between
   electrical activation and mechanical contraction patterns is
   hypothesized to be central to reduced effectiveness of cardiac
   resynchronization therapy (CRT). Furthermore, complex scar substrates
   render CRT less effective. We used novel cardiac computed tomography
   (CT) and noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) techniques in
   an ischemic dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF) animal model to evaluate
   electrical and mechanical coupling of cardiac function, tissue
   viability, and venous accessibility of target pacing regions.
   Methods and Results: Ischemic DHF was induced in 6 dogs using coronary
   occlusion, left bundle ablation and tachy RV pacing. Full body ECG was
   recorded during native rhythm followed by volumetric first-pass and
   delayed enhancement CT. Regional electrical activation were computed and
   overlaid with segmented venous anatomy and scar regions. Reconstructed
   electrical activation maps show consistency with LBBB starting on the RV
   and spreading in a ``U-shaped{''} pattern to the LV. Previously reported
   lines of slow conduction are seen parall showeel to anterior or inferior
   interventricular grooves. Mechanical contractiond large septal to
   lateral wall delay (80 +/- 38 milliseconds vs. 123 +/- 31 milliseconds,
   P = 0.0001). All animals showed electromechanical correlation except dog
   5 with largest scar burden. Electromechanical decoupling was largest in
   basal lateral LV segments.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated a promising application of CT in combination
   with ECGI to gain insight into electromechanical function in ischemic
   dyssynchronous heart failure that can provide useful information to
   study regional substrate of CRT candidates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance and structural changes in cement-treated

   Specimens from plastic and compacted soil-cement mix designs were
   exposed to different f/t scenarios to study the influence of f/t
   dimensionality (i.e.,one-dimensional versus three-dimensional exposure)
   and specimens' age at the time of f/t exposure on changes in their
   performance. Changes in hydraulic conductivity, unconfined compressive
   strength, and longitudinal resonant frequency of the specimens were
   studied under each exposure scenario. An examination of the
   microstructure of the f/t exposed and control specimens using
   transmitted light optical microscopy was also performed to evaluate how
   the soil-cement matrix was disrupted after exposure to f/t cycling.
   Observations showed increases in water content of the mix design (when
   wet of optimum water content), as well as increased specimen age at the
   time of exposure may increase f/t susceptibility. On the other hand,
   comparison of the performance of the specimens exposed to 1D and 3D f/t
   exposure did not show any significant variation. Microstructural
   analysis of petrographic thin section samples from control and f/t
   exposed specimens showed that while optical microscopy can detect matrix
   disintegration for highly damaged specimens, it is not able to identify
   structural degradation at early stages of damage development.}},

Abstract = {{Sinoatrial node (SAN) dysfunction increases with age, although not all
   older adults are affected in the same way. This is because people age at
   different rates and individuals of the same chronological age vary in
   health status from very fit to very frail. Our objective was to
   determine the impacts of age and frailty on heart rate (HR) and SAN
   function using a new model of frailty in ageing mice. Frailty, which was
   quantified in young and aged mice using a frailty index (FI), was
   greater in aged vs. young mice. Intracardiac electrophysiology
   demonstrated that HR was reduced whereas SAN recovery time (SNRT) was
   prolonged in aged mice; however, both parameters showed
   heteroscedasticity suggesting differences in health status among mice of
   similar chronological age. Consistent with this, HR and corrected SNRT
   were correlated with, and graded by, FI score. Optical mapping of the
   SAN demonstrated that conduction velocity (CV) was reduced in aged
   hearts in association with reductions in diastolic depolarization (DD)
   slope and action potential (AP) duration. In agreement with in vivo
   results, SAN CV, DD slope and AP durations all correlated with FI score.
   Finally, SAN dysfunction in aged mice was associated with increased
   interstitial fibrosis and alterations in expression of matrix

Abstract = {{This work explores the incorporation of Mo2C additions into
   TiC0.3N0.2-Ni3Al cermets from a thermal analysis perspective. The
   individual powder components were first characterised through
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA). It was observed that increasing concentrations of Mo2C decreased
   the onset temperature of both melting and solidification of the Ni3Al.
   Higher concentrations of Mo2C showed this decrease to be the result of
   peak convolution and that a secondary peak developed in both the melting
   and solidification peaks. This second peak is likely associated with the
   formation of a Mo-rich alloy phase, present in all microstructures
   containing both TiC0.3N0.7 and Mo2C. Additionally, weight loss observed
   in pure Mo2C powder, and attributed to the sublimation of MoO3, is not
   observed in the cermets prepared within this paper. It is thus suggested
   that Mo is incorporated into the Ni3Al through the reduction of MoO3,
   which explains the enhanced dissolution of Mo2C observed in previous
   studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium carbide (TiC) based cermets are commonly used as wear
   resistance and corrosion resistance components. In the present work, the
   effects of microstructure of TiC-316L stainless steel cermets are

   binder content and TiC grain size varied. Binder contents from 5 to 30
   vol.\% were examined, with samples fabricated using a simple vacuum
   melt-infiltration procedure at temperatures between 1475 degrees C and
   1550 degrees C (held for up to 240 minutes). Two primary Vickers
   indentation-cracking patterns arise in these materials, namely median or
   Palmqvist cracks, and this response relates to both the volume fraction
   of ductile metal binder present and the binder ligament dimension.
   Focused ion beam microscopy has been utilised for sub-surface evaluation
   of the cracks, to confirm the anticipated crack patterns. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to evaluate water resources use efficiency
   (WRUE), which focuses on the entire water consumption process by
   utilizing data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist index (MI).
   A comprehensive analysis of WRUE both on the spatial and temporal scale
   has been conducted. For the spatial scale, the difference of WRUEs among
   cities is presented, and the negative factors by analyzing and
   decomposing relative water resources use efficiency (RWRUE) are
   examined. Similarly, the dynamic changes of WRUE over time is presented
   to analyze the temporal scale. Moreover, a real-world case study in
   Guansu Province, China, from 2003 to 2013 is employed to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed WRUE analysis. Results show that the
   decision makers can determine the comprehensive and accurate WRUE and
   negative factors of WRUE in Gansu. Furthermore, the results provide
   alternative recommendations to decision makers to plan for efficient use

Abstract = {{The diffusional solidification (DS) of a mixed powder system, consisting
   of pure Ni base metal powder and BNi-2 braze powder, suitable for
   wide-gap brazing was investigated using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) and parallel microstructural examination. It was
   determined that very little interdiffusion between the powders developed
   in the solid state prior to braze powder melting. Once liquid formed,
   rapid DS occurred such that, when the powders were loosely mixed
   together, only 20 to 50 wt pct of the potential liquid fraction actually
   developed, leading to poor densification. Separating the braze and Ni
   into a layered structure leads to less DS, increased liquid formation
   (i.e., 35 to 80 wt pct of the potential liquid fraction) and improved
   densification. The rate of isothermal solidification in layered
   structures consisting of 30 and 40 wt pct BNi-2 braze material was
   determined using DSC. After 30 minutes of braze time at 1323 K (1050 A
   degrees C), complete IS occurred, thus avoiding the formation of a
   continuous network of large borides. The final microstructure of the IS
   mixtures consisted of a continuous matrix of solid solution Ni, with
   isolated and dispersed borides.}},

Title = {{Economic analysis for smart sprayer application in wild blueberry fields}},
Journal = {{PRECISION AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The wild blueberry industry is spending over \$80 million CAD per year
   on agrochemicals for 93 000 ha under production in North America. A
   pressing need to reduce agro-chemical usage and production cost has
   resulted in the development of a smart sprayer for spot-application of
   agrochemicals in wild blueberry fields. This paper encompasses the
   economic analysis to determine the potential savings for
   spot-applications of agrochemicals using a smart sprayer. The economic
   analysis compared the smart sprayer with two other commercially
   available sprayers (basic and swath control). The swath control sprayer
   and smart sprayer both featured GPS auto-steer and boom section control
   to reduce over-spray in already applied areas based on GPS position. The
   basic sprayer used a foam marker for guidance with no swath control
   management. The smart sprayer featured a machine vision system that
   automatically detected target areas in the field further reducing
   agrochemical input by shutting individual nozzles off in non-target
   areas in the field. The cost analysis was performed to compare the
   different features of the sprayer technologies, i.e., base sprayer,
   additional technology, training, usage, repair and maintenance. The
   additional components installed on the smart sprayer were justified in
   terms of agrochemicals/water savings via spot-applications, tractor fuel
   and operator's time. The application total cost was \$2052 ha(-1) using
   the basic sprayer, \$1799 ha(-1) using the swath control sprayer, and
   \$1138 ha(-1) using the smart sprayer over a 2 year production cycle of
   the selected fields that were used in this study. The payback period
   ranged from 2.0 years (60 ha field size) to 9.8 years (20 ha field size)
   using the swath control sprayer. The payback period ranged from 11
   months (60 ha field size) to 3.5 years (20 ha field size) when using the
   smart sprayer. Results revealed that the smart sprayer had significant
   advantage from both an environmental and economic perspective over the
   other two sprayers.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, the development of a clinical-viable aluminum-free glass
   ionomer cement has been limited by either (i) suitable working times for
   injection, but inadequate strength for clinical consideration, or
   conversely, (ii) acceptable strengths with inadequate working
   characteristics for practical utility. Recent studies, however, point to
   the inclusion of germanium in these materials as a promising step toward
   the balancing of clinical handling characteristics with mechanical
   properties, but no evidence yet exists as to their biocompatibility. In
   the present study a pilot group of New Zealand White rabbits was
   implanted with a novel aluminum-free zinc-silicate glass ionomer cement
   (Zn-Ge GIC) in a subchronic osseous defect model, in order to evaluate
   the host response to these materials, with a focus on bone healing and
   remodeling. The Zn-Ge GIC used in this pilot elicited a tissue response

Abstract = {{Light Curing Units (LCUs) are used daily in almost every dental office
   to photocure resins, but because the light is so bright, the user is
   unable to tell visually if there are any differences between different
   LCUs. This study evaluated the light output from six dental LCUs: Elipar
   Deep Cure-S (3M ESPE), Bluephase G2 (Ivoclar Vivadent), Translux 2Wave
   (Heraeus Kulzer), Optilight Prime (Gnatus), Slim Blast (First Medica)
   and Led.B (Guilin Woodpecker) with a fully charged battery, after 50,
   and again after 100, 20 second light exposures. For each situation, the
   radiant power was measured 10 times with a laboratory-grade power meter.
   Then, the emission spectrum was measured using a fiber-optic
   spectrometer followed by an analysis of the light beam profile. It was
   found there were significant differences in the LCU power and the
   irradiance values between the LCUs (p < 0.01). The Optilight Prime and
   Slim Blast LCUs showed a significant reduction in light output after a
   50 and 100 exposures, while Bluephase G2 exhibited a significant
   reduction only after 100 exposures (p < 0.01). The Bluephase G2 and
   Translux 2 Wave delivered an emission spectrum that had two distinct
   wavelength emission peaks. Only the Elipar Deep Cure-S and Bluephase G2
   LCUs displayed homogeneous light beam profiles, the other LCUs exhibited
   highly non-homogeneous light beam profiles. It was concluded that
   contemporary LCUs could have very different light output
   characteristics. Both manufacturers and researchers should provide more
   information about the light output from LCUs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A low power operand decomposition multiplication architecture
   implementation is modified to further reduce its power dissipation and
   delay. First, the multiplier's implementation was modified to generate
   the partial products using NAND gates instead of AND and OR gates in
   order to reduce the number of transistors (area utilized) and to reduce
   the delay. Then, new types of adders and (4: 2) compressors, that accept
   negatively weighted bits are used to reduce the number of inverters.
   Therefore, the resulting multiplier architecture reduces the number of
   transistors significantly. These modifications result in 20\% and 36\%
   reduction in power consumption and energy delay product (EDP),

Abstract = {{In this paper, the durability of flax and glass fiber-reinforced polymer
   (FRP) composites externally bonded to concrete beams is studied. A total
   of 100 plain concrete beam specimens (75 mm x 100 mm x 400 mm) were
   prepared and bonded with flax and glass FRP strips to the tension side
   of the beams. The specimens were designed to have an adhesive debonding
   failure of the FRP from the concrete. The specimens were aged in water
   and dry heat conditions at 20 and 60 degrees C for 21, 42, and 63 days
   and then were tested under three-point bending. A set of specimens were
   also aged by freeze/thaw cycles. The load-deflection behaviors of the
   specimens were evaluated and the effects of heat, moisture, and
   freeze/thaw cycles on the peak load and ductility of the specimens were
   quantified. The study shows that the peak load retentions of the
   specimens with bonded flax and glass FRPs immersed in 60 degrees C water
   for 63 days is 72\% and 80\% of their counterparts kept in dry heat
   condition, respectively. An analysis of variance was also performed to
   assess the significance of the aging effects on the physical and
   mechanical properties of the specimens. Also, a cross-sectional
   analytical modeling was performed to compute the FRP tensile force,
   strain, and bond strength of the specimens. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Magneto-optical permittivity tensor spectra of undoped InSb, n-doped and
   p-doped InSb crystals were determined using the terahertz time-domain
   spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and the Fourier transform far-infrared
   spectroscopy (far-FTIR). A Huge polar magneto-optical (MO) Kerr-effect
   (up to 20 degrees in rotation) and a simultaneous plasmonic behavior
   observed at low magnetic field (0.4 T) and room temperature are
   promising for terahertz nonreciprocal applications. We demonstrate the
   possibility of adjusting the the spectral rage with hugeMOby increase in
   n-doping of InSb. Spectral response is modeled using generalized
   magneto-optical Drude-Lorentz theory, giving us precise values of free
   carrier mobility, density and effective mass consistent with electric
   Hall effect measurement. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content, except

Abstract = {{Transesterification is the most common method of producing biodiesel
   from vegetable oils. A comparative study on the optimization of reaction
   variables for refined canola oil, unrefined canola oil, and unrefined
   camelina oil using a four-factor (temperature, time, molar ratio of
   methanol to oil, and catalyst loading) face-centered central composite
   design (FCCCD) was carried out. The optimum settings of these four
   factors that jointly maximize product, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
   and biodiesel yields for each of refined canola, unrefined canola and
   unrefined camelina were determined. Results showed that the optimized
   conditions were associated with the fatty acid profile and physical
   properties of the parent oils. The optimum temperature of vegetable oil
   with low polyunsaturation degree was higher than that of oils with high
   polyunsaturation degree. High free fatty acid content in parent oils led
   to low optimized catalyst concentration, and the decreased reaction rate
   could be compensated by increased reaction temperature due to
   significant interaction effect between reaction temperature and catalyst
   loading in the transesterification process. The highest biodiesel yields
   from the optimum setting for refined canola oil, unrefined canola oil,
   and unrefined camelina oil were 97.7\%, 95.2\%, and 95.6\%,
   respectively. This study provided guidelines on how to optimize
   different reaction variables taking economic viability and feedstock
   availability into consideration when producing biodiesel at plant scale.

Abstract = {{Process accidents in the early 1980s have drawn process safety into the
   main stream. In the 1990s, risk-based approaches were developed to bring
   safety into design as well as economic considerations. In the 2000s, the
   inherent safety approach began to be practiced on a limited basis, and
   process safety evolution made significant progress. As process systems
   continue to become more complex and operations move into remote and
   harsh environments, traditional risk analysis may no longer be
   sufficient. Dynamic risk assessment is the basis for the next generation
   of risk and management approaches that help to enable safer complex
   process systems operating in extreme environments. This article
   investigates the main contributions in the area of dynamic risk
   assessment. Then, an overall framework for dynamic risk management of
   process facilities is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is an effective and
   widely used time-domain method for solving electromagnetic problems.
   Conventionally, its solutions are obtained numerically in a
   march-on-in-time manner. In this paper, based on the eigenmatrix theory,
   we derive the analytical expression for the FDTD solution. The FDTD
   solution is analytically expressed in terms of spatial modes modulated
   by discrete time sequences related to the eigenvalues of the FDTD system
   equation. Based on our results, we propose an alternative approach to
   the FDTD solutions and it could open a new horizon for applying advanced
   signal processing techniques as well as offering the possibility of
   storing the FDTD results in an analytical form for a structure after
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the effect of a 3D simulated metal inert gas
   (MIG) welding induced heat affected zone (HAZ), residual stress and
   distortion fields on the behaviour of aluminum stiffened plates under
   compressive loading. A two-step, thermo-structural finite element model
   was developed for the simulation of the welding process and the model
   was verified using the available experimental results. The welding
   induced HAZ, residual stress and distortion were then studied for
   tee-bar stiffened aluminum plates of various geometries. The effect of
   these welding induced imperfections on the load vs. shortening curves,
   buckling mode, and the post-buckling behaviour of each stiffened plate
   geometry were investigated. It was found that welding induced tensile
   and compressive residual stresses ranged from 72 to 77\% and 18-36\% of
   the base metal yield stress, respectively. The width of the HAZ around
   the weld line increased as the plate slenderness increased. The
   reduction in budding strength of the tee-bar aluminum stiffened plates
   due to the presence of the HAZ and residual stress was as much as 10\%
   and 16.5\% respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Numerical analysis of longwall mining layout for a Wyoming Trona mine}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{94-108}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{At Solvay Mine, located in southwestern Wyoming, a subhorizontal trona
   seam is mined at depths of between 460 and 490 m using mechanized
   room-and-pillar and longwall mining methods. The stratigraphy at the
   mine generally consists of horizontally laminated (i.e., bedded)
   sedimentary rocks comprised mostly of shales and sandstones with
   significantly contrasting mechanical properties. Most notably, a 43-82
   m-thick massive, brittle sandstone unit (Tower Sandstone), located
   approximately 100 m above the mining level, has a tendency to promote
   stress arching within the overburden rock that can bridge over
   panel-scale mine instabilities and can lead to violent multi-panel
   collapse failure. One such violent collapse is the 5.1 magnitude seismic
   event due to a 1 x 2 km multi-panel failure on February 3, 1995. It has
   proven difficult to account for this arching behavior with conventional
   mine design methods, such as the tributary area method. Therefore, over
   the past two decades or more, Solvay Mine has been utilizing numerical
   modeling techniques along with field instrumentation/monitoring as part
   of an integrated program to gain an enhanced understanding of the
   complex response of the overlying stratigraphy (i.e., arching) to
   mining. In 2005 and 2006, several longwall panels in the northwest and
   southeast areas of the mine were instrumented and monitored during
   mining. Two- and three-dimensional numerical models were developed and
   calibrated on the basis of the instrumentation data, and these models
   were then used for mine design verification (e.g., pillar and panel
   dimensions). This mining case study illustrates the complex excavation
   response due to the contrasts in stratigraphy at Solvay Mine and
   presents a numerical modeling study that captures the dominant aspects
   of these conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and validation of an upgraded grinding
   wheel scanner system that controls the position of a Nanovea CHR-150
   Axial Chromatism sensor along the x- and y-directions of the wheel
   surface to measure and characterize wheel surface topography. The
   scanner features a novel homing system that enables the wheel to be
   removed from the scanner, used on a grinding machine and then re-mounted
   and re-homed so that the same location on the wheel surface can be
   repeatedly measured and monitored. The average standard deviation for
   homing was 27.6 mu m and 19.3 mu m in the x- and y-directions,
   respectively, which is more than adequate for typical area scans of 25
   mm(2). After homing, the scanner was able to repeatedly measure features
   that were similar in size to an abrasive grain (similar to 200 mu m
   diameter) with an average error of 9.3 mu m and 5.9 mu m in the x- and
   y-directions, respectively. The resulting topography measurements were
   compared with Scanning Electron Microscope images to demonstrate the
   accuracy of the scanner. A custom particle filter was developed to
   process the resulting data and a novel analysis technique involving the
   rate of change of measured area was proposed as a method for
   establishing the reference wheel surface from which desired wheel
   topography results can be reported such as the number of cutting edges,
   cutting edge width and cutting edge area as a function of radial depth.

Abstract = {{1 Weeds are one of the most limiting factors in the commercial
   production of lowbush blueberries Vaccinium angustifolium (Ericaceae).
   Sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and hairy fescue (Festuca tenuifolia)
   are prominent weeds in lowbush blueberry fields.
   2 Because the granivorous insects Harpalus rufipes (Carabidae) and
   Gryllus pennsylvanicus (Gryllidae) are common in lowbush blueberry
   fields when sheep sorrel and hairy fescue are dispersing seeds, we
   examined how granivorous insects can contribute to the biocontrol of
   these weeds.
   3 In the laboratory, H. rufipes and G. pennsylvanicus consumed a
   significant number of seeds of sheep sorrel and hairy fescue, and a
   field experiment found that insects probably consume a significant
   number of sheep sorrel and hairy fescue seeds in blueberry fields.
   4 Additional experiments found that H. rufipes was highly susceptible to
   field rates of phosmet and acetamiprid, although not to field rates of
   spirotetramat, which are insecticides that may be used in blueberry
   fields when the beetle is active.
   5 Natural populations of granivorous insects probably provide a valuable
   ecological service in commercial lowbush blueberry fields and should be
   conserved in the development of integrated weed management programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Three instrumented bicycles were used to measure black carbon (BC) and
   PM2.5 concentrations in a midsized city in southern Brazil. The
   objective of this study was to map the spatial distribution of BC and
   PM2.5, to identify air pollution hotspots and to assess factors that may
   affect the concentrations of these pollutants, e.g. traffic volume,
   number of heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDV), position of traffic signals
   and street incline. The cyclists collected data in the city centre along
   streets of different traffic density during nine sampling sessions in
   the weekday morning and afternoon rush hours, between March 13 and April
   28, 2015. The sampling by bicycle covered an area of 2.70 km(2), over
   variable elevation, and travelled a total distance of 215 km. BC and
   PM2.5 exhibited a large spatial variability on a scale of tens of metres
   and the concentrations were positively correlated with traffic counts,
   but exhibited a stronger relationship with the number of HDDV. These
   results imply that older buses and diesel-powered trucks may be the main
   driver behind the high pollution levels in the city's inner core. We
   observed a strong relationship between BC concentrations at junctions
   managed by traffic signals and the quantity of HDDV. The mean BC
   concentration was found to be 8.10 mu g m(-3) near traffic signals
   located on an inclined street (HDDV > 100 vehicles h(-1)) compared to
   traffic signals on flat terrain (6.00 mu g m(-3)), which can be
   attributed to the higher acceleration required at the start of motion.
   This pattern was less evident for PM2.5 concentrations. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper investigates into the heat transfer from the wall to solids
   moving inside an indirectly heated rotary reactor with flights. The
   cluster renewal mechanistic model was used to develop a model for
   estimating the effective heat transfer coefficient (EHTC) from wall to
   solids. The overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) considered the heat
   transfer from the reactor wall to solids, and that from the wall to
   gases in the reactor whose wall temperature is maintained at constant
   temperature. Predictions from the OHTC model showed a good agreement
   with values measured in the reactor fed with brass particles. The model
   for estimating the EHTC was compared with the published experimental
   values of Herz et al. (2012), and showed a better agreement than the
   existing models. The developed model could therefore be applied for
   designing rotary torrefier or used for overall performance model of
   rotary torrefier. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Self-reconstruction refers to an ability of certain fully coherent
   optical beams to recover their spatial profiles after scattering by
   obstacles. In this communication, we extend the self-reconstruction

   experimentally that any partially coherent beam can self-reconstruct its
   intensity profile and state of polarization upon scattering from an
   opaque obstacle provided the beam coherence area is reduced well below
   the obstacle area. We stress that our self-reconstruction technique is
   independent of the obstacle shape and it is scalable to the case of
   multiple obstacles or even of inhomogeneous media as long as a
   characteristic obstacle area or a medium inhomogeneity scale is well in
   excess of the beam coherence area or length, respectively. We anticipate
   the technique to be instrumental in applications ranging from beam
   shaping to image transfer and trapped particle manipulation in turbid

Abstract = {{Many jurisdictions, including Nova Scotia (NS), have implemented
   policies and programs around energy. The NS government has targeted
   energy efficiency and more renewable energy as two main policy areas.
   The NS Department of Agriculture has taken initiative to provide support
   to implement energy conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy
   opportunities in recent years but have these programs and policies been
   effective? A baseline energy use survey was conducted in 2005 and
   responses from mail surveys in 2012 (n = 273, 11.4\% response rate) were
   used to measure the change in NS farm energy use data reported for 2004
   and 2011. There have been significant reductions in energy use on NS
   farms. On average, NS farmers spent \$8790 on energy expenses in 2011
   compared to \$11,228 in 2004. Adjusting for inflation, this is a 32\%
   decrease, despite energy commodity pricing increases beyond the
   inflation rate. This is likely due to a decrease in energy use and a
   shift from gasoline use to diesel use. By the end of 2012, 36.0\% of NS
   farmers (more than 860) had received some level of support to evaluate
   their energy options. This includes 410 energy audits compared to only
   36 by the end of 2005. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improved estimates of bubble dynamics in industrial gas-liquid fluid
   systems are important for accurately modeling multiphase flow. In many
   gas-liquid industrial systems at elevated pressure, bubbles exist in a
   polydisperse size population. This work experimentally characterizes the
   effects of bubble swarm polydispersity and gas holdup on drag using a
   monofibre optical probe in an ethanol contaminated aqueous system,
   providing an evaluation of current swarm drag models under industrially
   relevant pressures and high gas holdup conditions (up to 37\% gas
   fraction). At atmospheric pressure, the rise velocity and
   swarm-corrected drag of individual bubbles within a polydisperse
   distribution of bubbles was found to be well-predicted by the swarm
   correction model of Lockett and Kirkpatrick (1975). An improved fit to
   the reported data was found using a piecewise isolated single bubble
   drag coefficient correlation. At elevated pressures (6.5 MPa), swarm
   hindrance effects were not observed for detected bubbles and the rise
   velocity and drag coefficient of individual bubbles within a
   polydisperse distribution were well predicted without the use of a swarm
   correction model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supported molybdenum/molybdenum-phosphides as inexpensive catalysts for
   bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) were in-house prepared using different
   support materials, i.e., Al2O3, activated carbon (AC), MgAl2O4, and

   investigated using a 100 mL bench-scale reactor operating at 300 degrees
   C with an initial hydrogen pressure of 50 bar for 3 h with a pyrolysis
   oil (PO). The catalytic efficiencies for bio-oil HDO for the catalysts
   were compared with the expensive but commercially available Ru/C
   catalyst. Addition of small amount of P to the Mo catalysts supported on
   either AC and Al2O3 led to increased degree of deoxygenation (DOD) and
   oil yield compared with those without P. MoP supported on AC (MoP/AC)
   demonstrated bio-oil HDO activity comparable to the Ru/C catalyst.

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Reconstruction of cartilage defects in the head
   and neck can require harvesting of autologous cartilage grafts, which
   can be associated with donor site morbidity. To overcome this
   limitation, tissue-engineering approaches may be used to generate
   cartilage grafts. The objective of this study was to decellularize and
   characterize human nasoseptal cartilage with the aim of generating a
   biological scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering.
   Study Design: Laboratory study using nasoseptal cartilage.
   Methods: Remnant human nasoseptal cartilage specimens were collected and
   subjected to a novel decellularization treatment. The decellularization
   process involved several cycles of enzymatic detergent treatments. For
   characterization, decellularized and fresh (control) specimens underwent
   histological, biochemical, and mechanical analyses. Scanning electron
   microscopy and biocompatibility assay were also performed.
   Results: The decellularization process had minimal effect on
   glycosaminoglycan content of the cartilage extracellular matrix.
   Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis revealed the near-complete removal
   of genomic DNA from decellularized tissues. The effectiveness of the
   decellularization process was also confirmed on histological and
   scanning electron microscopic analyses. Mechanical testing results
   showed that the structural integrity of the decellularized tissue was
   maintained, and biocompatibility was confirmed.
   Conclusion: Overall, the current decellularization treatment resulted in
   significant reduction of genetic/cellular material with preservation of
   the underlying extracellular matrix structure. This decellularized
   material may serve as a potential scaffold for cartilage tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced sagittal plane range of motion (ROM) has been reported in

   comparison to an asymptomatic group. Sagittal plane hip ROM was
   calculated using skin surface marker trajectories captured during
   treadmill walking at self-selected speed. Passive hip ROM was measured
   using standardized position and recording procedures with a goniometer.
   Sagittal plane extension, flexion, and overall ROM were measured

   determined significant differences between groups and between passive
   and dynamic ROM (=0.05). Pearson correlations determined relationships

   were found for flexion and extension ROM (p<0.05). For extension, the
   severe OA group had less dynamic and passive ROM compared to the other
   groups and greater passive than dynamic ROM (p<0.05). For flexion,
   significant differences in passive ROM existed between all three groups
   (p<0.05) whereas no differences were found for dynamic flexion (p<0.05).
   Significant correlations between dynamic and passive hip extension were
   found in the moderate (r=0.596) and severe OA (r=0.586) groups, and no
   correlation was found in the asymptomatic group (r=0.139). Passive ROM
   explains variance in dynamic ROM measurements obtained during gait in
   individuals with moderate and severe hip OA which have implications for
   the design of treatment strategies targeting walking pathomechanics. (c)

   addresses a problem in the repairable spare parts remanufacturing
   industry to find the cost-optimal production strategy incorporating

   carry out replacements in order to honor warranty commitments. Key
   production decisions, such as when remanufacturing should commence, how
   long the warranty period should be, and how many returned components
   should be reconditioned are considered. The availability of
   reconditioned components and their discounted costs are also
   incorporated in the mathematical model. The goal is to investigate the
   interaction between these decisions and their impacts on the
   manufacturing system and the customer. An application to the
   remanufacturing of rotable spare parts in the airline industry is

Title = {{On Physical Internet Logistics: Modeling the Impact of Consolidation on
   Transportation and Inventory Costs}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{1517-1527}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The physical Internet (PI) is a conceptual, innovative, and contemporary
   modular distribution logistics system that has garnered the interest of
   both researchers and practitioners as an alternative to conventional
   logistics. It aims to be more environmentally friendly, more socially
   responsible, and also more profitable. The key concept behind the PI
   logistics system is the routing of highly modular containers through
   transit centers (called PI hubs) to obtain a very efficient transport
   network that exploits consolidation opportunities. A systems model of
   the traditional and PI networks is developed as an aggregation of
   optimal point-to-point dispatch models between pairs of cities. This is
   then used to characterize the behavior of the traditional and PI
   logistics systems for several different logistics system key performance
   indicators. Based on the modeling assumptions in this paper, it is
   concluded that the benefits of the PI are in reducing the inventory cost
   and the total logistics system cost. However, a fewer truck trips are
   required in the traditional system, which also has a lower total order
   delivery time. While the transportation cost in the PI and traditional
   systems are comparable, the total cost of the PI system is significantly
   lower.
   Note to Practitioners-The PI is a contemporary conceptualization of a
   highly modular logistics network that mimics the routing of packets over
   a network of hubs in the virtual Internet. PI logistics may pose great
   opportunities for economies of scale in freight transportation and
   warehousing, and for improving the environmental performance of shipper
   or carrier companies. We therefore present a novel cost-minimizing
   mathematical model within the PI setting that includes shipment
   consolidation and dispatch decisions. To show the utility of our models,
   we contrast the performance results of two comparable systems: one in
   the PI and the other in traditional logistics network. Based on the
   simulation results for the case of a European PI logistics network, it
   is seen that the PI system has a higher degree of load consolidation,
   i.e., combining two or more shipments on a vehicle to be linehauled to
   the same destination, and proves cost efficient on the average, but at
   the expense of longer delivery times for individual shipments. In the
   fast-changing landscape of global supply and demand management,
   logistics manifests itself as one of the most crucial cost and service
   drivers of supply chain performance in virtually all manufacturing,
   merchandising, or service firms. In this paper, we expose the potential
   benefits and drawbacks of the PI for the logistics sector by devising
   better decision tools for managers.}},

Title = {{Contralateral pelvic drop during gait increases knee adduction moments
   of asymptomatic individuals}},
Journal = {{HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{27-35}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The current study purpose was to investigate the effects of
   contralateral pelvic drop gait on the magnitude of the knee adduction
   moment (KAM) within asymptomatic individuals.
   Methods: 15 participants walked on a dual belt instrumented treadmill
   while segment motions and ground reaction forces were recorded.
   Participants completed typical gait trials and pelvic drop gait trials.
   The net external KAM was calculated using inverse dynamics. Peak and
   impulse were identified. Frontal plane hip abduction/adduction and
   pelvic drop were determined. Correlations and paired t-tests were used
   for statistical hypothesis testing (alpha = 0.05).
   Results: Peak hip adduction angle reached 4 degrees (+/- 6 degrees)
   during pelvic drop trials compared to 0 ( 6) in the typical gait trials
   (p < 0.05) equating to 4 degrees of pelvic drop. KAM impulse was higher
   in the pelvic drop trial (0.16 Nm s/kg +/- 0.04) compared to the typical
   gait trial (0.13 Nm s/kg +/- 0.05) (p < 0.001). Peak KAM was higher in
   the pelvic drop trial (0.55 Nm/kg +/- 0.15) compared to the typical gait
   trial (0.40 Nm/kg +/- 0.109) (p < 0.001). Correlations between change in
   KAM and change in hip adduction moment and pelvic drop were r > 0.80 (p
   < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Pelvic drop gait increased KAM peak and impulse. Results
   have implications for understanding relationships between frontal plane
   hip movement and the knee adduction moment during gait. (C) 2016

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Oil and gas industry spends millions of dollars every year dealing with
   problems caused by erosion. Erosion is a complex phenomenon and in order
   to recommend ways to mitigate its effect, it is essential to have a full
   understanding of the tribo-mechanisms involved. In the present study,
   erosion tests were conducted on AISI 1018, AISI 1080, API X42, API X70
   and API X100 steels using aluminum oxide as erodent. Particle velocities
   and attack angles employed were as follows: 36, 47, 63 and 81 m s(-1) at
   30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively. Erosion
   rate decreases with increasing impact angle and increases with
   increasing particle velocity. Several mechanisms are found to be
   responsible for the behavior of these steels under the experimental
   conditions employed in this work. Heavy plastic deformation and
   fracture, ploughing, delamination and different forms of metal cutting
   are identified as operative mechanisms during erosion. Empirical erosion
   mechanism maps are constructed showing the variation in erosion regimes,
   as a function of impact angle and normalized velocity. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Source apportionment of PM2.5 in Tangshan, China-Hybrid approaches for
   primary and secondary species apportionment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid approach for the
   source apportionment of primary and secondary species of PM2.5 in the
   city of Tangshan. The receptor-based PMF (Positive Matrix Factorization)
   is integrated with the emission inventory (EI) to form the first hybrid
   method for the source apportionment of the primary species. The hybrid
   CAMx-PSAT-CP (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions -
   Particulate Source Apportionment Technology - Chemical Profile) approach
   is then proposed and used for the source apportionment of the secondary
   species. The PM2.5 sources identified for Tangshan included the soil
   dust, the metallurgical industry, power plants, coal-fired boilers,
   vehicles, cement production, and other sources. It is indicated that the
   PM2.5 pollution is a regional issue. Among all the identified sources,
   the metallurgy industry was the biggest contribution source to PM2.5,
   followed by coal-fired boilers, vehicles and soil dust. The other-source
   category plays a crucial role for PM2.5, particularly for the formation
   of secondary species and aerosols, and these other sources include
   non-specified sources such as agricultural activities, biomass
   combustion, residential emissions, etc. The source apportionment results
   could help the local authorities make sound policies and regulations to
   better protect the citizens from the local and regional PM2.5 pollution.
   The study also highlights the strength of utilizing the proposed hybrid
   approaches in the identification of PM2.5 sources. The techniques used
   in this study show considerable promise for further application to other
   regions as well as to identify other source categories of PM2.5. (C)

Title = {{The effect of extreme weather conditions on commercial fishing

Abstract = {{Extreme weather factors, a key aspect of the commercial fishing
   operating environment, can present danger to fish harvesters and fishing
   vessels. The extreme environmental conditions in Atlantic Canada, most
   often associated with the passage of extratropical cyclones and icy
   waters, can be characterized using wind speed, precipitation, air and
   sea surface temperature, Laplacian of pressure, and ice presence over
   the study area. This research aims to identify the extreme weather
   conditions that may affect fishing activity levels and fishing
   incidents. Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial
   Regression, Fractional Logit Regression, and Random Parameters Negative
   Binomial Regression were applied to recognize patterns in historical
   fishing activity levels, incident data, and extreme weather factors in
   Atlantic Canada. The results suggest that there is a strong relationship
   between the studied weather factors and fishing activity levels overall
   (extreme weather conditions usually result in decreased fishing activity
   levels in the study area). Furthermore, different weather factors can
   have different effects on various vessel sizes. Wind speed is a
   significant factor in determining fishing activity levels for vessels
   smaller than 45 feet; but activity levels of vessels larger than 45 feet
   are only affected by ice presence. There are correlations between harsh
   weather factors and fishing incidents with respect to activity levels.
   More specifically, incident rates (i.e. number of fishing incidents over
   fishing activity levels) increase with low air temperature, ice
   presence, strong winds, and high Laplacian of pressure. These results
   can help mariners and fisheries management to make more informed
   decisions with respect to fishing safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Development and evaluation of a novel alginate-based in situ gelling
   system to modulate the release of anthocyanins}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{500-508}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Several health benefits have been associated with the consumption of
   anthocyanins (ACNs). These compounds are absorbed in the upper digestive
   tract (stomach and initial sections of the small intestine). However, an
   insufficient residence time of ACNs in these organs could result in
   limited absorption and contribute to degradation. In this paper, a novel
   alginate-based in situ gastroretentive gelling system is described as a
   platform to modulate the release and increase the retention time of ACNs
   from haskap berries in sites where their absorption and stability are
   favored. Thirteen formulations were assessed, where their composition
   differed by the concentrations of alginate, sodium bicarbonate, and
   calcium carbonate. Freeze-dried ACN-rich extract from haskap berries was
   incorporated into selected formulations. The ACN release profile
   indicated that the Peppas (power law) equation had the best fit to the
   experimental data and diffusion was most likely the dominant release
   mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{327}},
Pages = {{160-170}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{This study employs experimental techniques to measure the changing
   internal resistance of flooded, flat plate lead-acid batteries during
   container formation, revealing a novel indicator of formation
   completeness. In order to measure internal resistance during formation,
   d.c. current pulses are superimposed over the constant formation current
   at set intervals, while change in voltage is measured. The resulting
   ``pulsed{''} internal resistance is divided into ohmic and interfacial
   components by measuring the ohmic resistance with short d.c. pulses as
   well as with a.c. injection. Various constant-current container
   formations are carried out using different current levels, plate
   thicknesses, and pulsing techniques, yielding an array of resistance
   trends which are explained using Butler-Volmer kinetic theory. Ohmic and
   interfacial resistance trends are shown both theoretically and
   experimentally to eventually decay to a predictable steady-state value
   as the formation proceeds, suggesting that this internal resistance
   method can be used to detect the completion of the formation. The same
   principles are shown to apply to recharge cycles as well, but with
   potentially limited practical implications in comparison to formation.

Abstract = {{We characterized the feeding ecologies of common bivalves Macoma
   calcarea, Nuculana radiata, and Ennucula tenuis, and polychaetes
   Leitoscoloplos pugettensis and Nephtys spp. from the Bering Sea using
   relative proportions of fatty acids (FA profiles), FAs indicative of
   distinct organic matter sources (FA markers), and stable carbon isotope
   values of FA markers. We measured FAs from these invertebrates and from
   surface sediment scrapes collected during March to July in 2009 and
   2010. The bivalve species had indistinguishable trophic signatures, as
   inferred by overlapping FA profiles and delta C-13 values for algal
   marker FAs, and similar proportions of FA markers. FA d13C values from
   bivalve taxa were most similar to FA delta C-13 values from particulate
   organic matter (POM) from surface sediments. In contrast, delta C-13
   values for the algal marker eicosapentaenoic acid in the polychaetes
   were higher relative to those from the bivalves and sediment from the
   same locations (mean difference of 3.6\%), suggesting low direct dietary
   contributions of benthic POM from surface sediments. L. pugettensis, a
   head-down deposit-feeding polychaete, had a higher contribution from
   bacterial sources to its total FA pool relative to the bivalves and to
   Nephtys spp., a predatory polychaete, based on a bacterial FA marker.
   Distinct FA profiles between the polychaetes imply different
   proportional contributions of dietary FA sources, including greater
   contribution of microbially altered FAs to L. pugettensis and greater
   contribution of ice algal FAs to Nephtys spp. Our findings revealed
   resource partitioning among select benthic invertebrates and suggest
   that responses to climate-induced changes in sub-Arctic production may
   be species specific.}},

Abstract = {{In general, given an oceanic thermal front, there is a strong positive
   correlation between sea surface temperature (SST) gradients and surface
   winds, and the marine atmospheric boundary layer is unstable over the
   warm side of the oceanic thermal front. The Gulf Stream is a notable
   example of an oceanic thermal front, and its warm side is often detected
   as enhanced backscatter in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
   However, in some ``anomalous{''} SAR images, low backscatter is
   sometimes observed on the warm side of the front, which seems
   inconsistent. Therefore, we propose a mechanism to interpret the
   generation of the low backscatter, based on interactions between ocean
   surface wind waves and intense nonlinear Ekman divergence. This
   mechanism is verified by showing that patterns in an observed anomalous
   SAR image are in good agreement with those in the simulated radar
   signature. In addition, this methodology and analysis demonstrate that
   SAR is potentially important for detecting and diagnosing small scale
   air-sea interactions and upper ocean dynamics with strong vertical
   transports induced by submesoscale processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigate relationships between the nanoscale
   structure of collagen fibrils and the macroscale functional response of
   collagenous tissues. To do so, we study two functionally distinct
   classes of tendons, positional tendons and energy storing tendons, using
   a bovine forelimb model. Molecular-level assessment using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), functional crosslink assessment using
   hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) analysis, and ultrastructural
   assessment using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to study
   undamaged, ruptured, and cyclically loaded samples from the two tendon
   types. HIT indicated differences in both crosslink type and crosslink
   density, with flexor tendons having more thermally stable crosslinks
   than the extensor tendons (higher T-Fmax of >90 vs. 75.1 +/- 2.7 degrees
   C), and greater total crosslink density than the extensor tendons
   (higher t(1/2) of 11.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.0 h after NaBH4 treatment).
   Despite having a lower crosslink density than flexor tendons, extensor
   tendons were significantly stronger (37.6 +/- 8.1 vs. 23.1 +/- 7.7 MPa)
   and tougher (14.3 +/- 3.6 vs. 6.8 +/- 3.4 Mj/m(3)). SEM showed that
   collagen fibrils in the tougher, stronger extensor tendons were able to
   undergo remarkable levels of plastic deformation in the form of discrete
   plasticity, while those in the flexor tendons were not able to
   plastically deform. When cyclically loaded, collagen fibrils in extensor
   tendons accumulated fatigue damage rapidly in the form of kink bands,
   while those in flexor tendons did not accumulate significant fatigue
   damage. The results demonstrate that collagen fibrils in functionally
   distinct tendons respond differently to mechanical loading, and suggests
   that fibrillar collagens may be subject to a strength vs. fatigue
   resistance tradeoff.
   Statement of Significance
   Collagen fibrils-nanoscale biological cables-are the fundamental
   load-bearing elements of all structural human tissues. While all
   collagen fibrils share common features, such as being composed of a
   precise quarter-staggered polymeric arrangement of triple-helical
   collagen molecules, their structure can vary significantly between
   tissue types, and even between different anatomical structures of the
   same tissue type. To understand normal function, homeostasis, and
   disease of collagenous tissues requires detailed knowledge of collagen
   fibril structure-function. Using anatomically proximate but structurally
   distinct tendons, we show that collagen fibrils in functionally distinct
   tendons have differing susceptibilities to damage under both tensile
   overload and cyclic fatigue loading. Our results suggest that the
   structure of collagen fibrils may lead to a strength versus fatigue
   resistance tradeoff, where high strength is gained at the expense of
   fatigue resistance, and vice versa. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Volume = {{180}},

Abstract = {{Elemental compositions of biomass are essential for designing energy
   conversion systems. Only a few correlations to estimate the elemental
   compositions using the proximate analysis of raw biomass have been
   published so far. Recently researches on biomass torrefaction have been
   increasing significantly, which require performing an elemental analysis
   of the torrefied biomass. Torrefaction affects both the proximate and
   elemental analyses of biomass. Therefore, this study examines if the
   existing correlations can be deployed or not for estimating carbon,
   hydrogen, and oxygen compositions of the torrefied biomass. For this,
   estimation errors were calculated for the existing correlations using
   data from the torrefied biomass. Results suggest that existing
   correlations were not suitable for predicting the elemental compositions
   of the torrefied biomass. New correlations were proposed using a wide
   range biomass, including both raw and torrefied biomass (447 samples).
   New correlations C = -35.9972 + 0.7698VM + 1.3269FC + 0.3250ASH; H =
   55.3678 0.4830VM 0.5319FC 0.5600ASH, and O = 223.6805 1.7226VM 2.2296FC
   2.2463ASH were selected for future use. These correlations have the MAE
   of 2.58\%, 0.41\%, 2.60\%, the AAE of 5.23\%, 9.94\%, 8.79\%, the ABE of
   0.45\%, 2.82\%, 2.01\%, and the R-2 of 0.83, 0.70, 0.84 corresponding to
   the measured values of C, H, and O, respectively. The selected
   correlations were also validated and compared with the existing
   correlations using another set of data that includes raw, washed,
   torrefied, and carbonized biomass. Selected new correlations could be
   used for predicting carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen compositions in the raw
   and torrefied biomass, especially those biomasses which have negligible
   nitrogen and sulfur contents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{360}},

Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a new population-based
   evolutionary algorithm (EA). Although the exploitation level of BBO is
   good researchers found some weaknesses in its exploration. This study
   proposes a new hybridization between BBO and simulated annealing (SA) to
   enhance its performance. In this proposed algorithm, the inferior
   migrated islands will not be selected unless they pass the Metropolis
   criterion of SA and so the new algorithm is called MpBBO. The
   performance of MpBBO is evaluated using 36 benchmark functions with five
   different cooling strategies of SA and then compared with the original
   and essentially modified BBO models. The results show the exponential,
   inverse, and inverse linear cooling strategies provide best solutions,
   but they are the slowest. Among these three strategies, the exponential
   cooling rate can compromise between the solution quality and CPU time
   compared with the others. Also, the inverse cooling rate is competitive
   and wins when the mutation stage is completely disabled. The F-test and
   T-test show that MpBBO has significant differences. Further, it has been
   observed, through sensitivity analysis, that MpBBO behaves like BBO and
   SA. The parameters of SA and BBO can affect the performance of MpBBO,
   which has more immunity against trapping into local optimums. Moreover,
   the superiority of MpBBO appears when it is compared with non simplified
   migration-based BBO models as well as other hybrid/non-hybrid EAs. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{9053-9060}},

Abstract = {{Lead service lines (LSLs) are a major source of drinking water lead, and
   high iron levels are frequently observed along with elevated lead
   release. A model distribution system, dosed with orthophosphate, was
   used to evaluate the effect of corroded iron distribution mains on lead
   release from recovered LSLs. Lead release was higher by 96 mu g L-1, on
   average, from LSLs supplied by corroded iron compared to the inert
   reference material (PVC). This effect may be explained by deposition of
   semiconducting iron oxide particles within LSLs. When galvanic cells
   with lead and magnetite (Fe3O4) electrodes were short-circuited, lead
   release increased 8-fold and a current averaging 26 mu A was observed.
   In effluent from LSLs with an upstream iron main, colloidal lead and
   iron occurred in the same size fraction possibly due to release of
   colloidal particles from LSL corrosion scale enriched with iron. Under
   these circumstances, high molecular weight (>669 kDa) Pb-208 and Fe-56
   elution profiles, observed via size-exclusion chromatography, were
   highly correlated (average R-2 = 0.97). Increasing orthophosphate from
   0.5 to 1.0 mg L-1 (as PO43-) accompanied an average reduction in lead
   release of 6 mu g L-1 month(-1) but did not significantly reduce the
   effect of an upstream iron main.}},

Title = {{Bowstring Stretching and Quantitative Imaging of Single Collagen Fibrils
   via Atomic Force Microscopy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Collagen is the primary structural protein in animals. Serving as
   nanoscale biological ropes, collagen fibrils are responsible for
   providing strength to a variety of connective tissues such as tendon,
   skin, and bone. Understanding structure-function relationships in
   collagenous tissues requires the ability to conduct a variety of
   mechanical experiments on single collagen fibrils. Though significant
   advances have been made, certain tests are not possible using the
   techniques currently available. In this report we present a new atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) based method for tensile manipulation and
   subsequent nanoscale structural assessment of single collagen fibrils.
   While the method documented here cannot currently capture force data
   during loading, it offers the great advantage of allowing structural
   assessment after subrupture loading. To demonstrate the utility of this
   technique, we describe the results of 23 tensile experiments in which
   collagen fibrils were loaded to varying levels of strain and
   subsequently imaged in both the hydrated and dehydrated states. We show
   that following a dehydration-rehydration cycle (necessary for sample
   preparation), fibrils experience an increase in height and decrease in
   radial modulus in response to one loading-unloading cycle to strain
   <5\%. This change is not altered by a second cycle to strain >5\%. In
   fibril segments that ruptured during their second loading cycle, we show
   that the fibril structure is affected away from the rupture site in the
   form of discrete permanent deformations. By comparing the severity of
   select damage sites in both hydrated and dehydrated conditions, we
   demonstrate that dehydration masks damage features, leading to an
   underestimate of the degree of structural disruption. Overall, the
   method shows promise as a powerful tool for the investigation of
   structure-function relationships in nanoscale fibrous materials.}},

Abstract = {{Load and price forecasting are key challenges for current electricity
   market participants. Load and price in electricity markets have complex
   peculiarities, such as nonlinearity, being nonstationary and irregular.
   Accurate short- term forecasting, such as hourly electricity price
   forecasting (EPF) for the next month gives pivotal information to power
   producers and consumers to enhance precise techniques to maximize their
   profit. This paper deals with short-term hourly EPF for the next month
   (January 2006), using the historical hourly data for the year 2005 as a
   training set. A new approach of multilayer neural networks is applied in
   composite topologies in order to improve forecasting accuracy. The
   intent is to study the behavior of diverse composite topologies to
   compare the best performance indices evaluated by the mean absolute
   percentage error and mean square error. The performance of different
   topologies is compared to identify the best connection architecture. The
   data used in the forecasting are hourly historical data of the
   temperature, electricity load, and natural gas price from the Australian

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The range and variability of flow velocities in which horizontal axis
   tidal stream turbines operate introduces the requirement for a power
   regulation method in the system. Overspeed power regulation (OSPR) has
   the potential to improve the structural robustness and decrease the
   complexity associated with active pitch power regulation methods, while
   removing the difficulties of operating in stalled flow. This paper
   presents the development of a methodology for the design of blades to be
   used in such systems. The method requires a site depth, maximum flow
   velocity and rated power or flow speed as input parameters. The pitch
   setting, twist and chord distribution were set as input parameters,
   variable through the use of alteration functions. Rotor performance has
   been broken down into OSPR performance metrics which consider
   coefficients of power and thrust, and cavitation inception. Three
   visual-numerical tools have been developed: the OSPR performance metrics
   were used in conjunction with a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis
   approach to develop a design space; cavitation inception analyses gave
   plots of converging cavitation and pressure terms for each blade
   section; the local angle of attack and torque distribution across the
   blade designs were plotted at key turbine operation states. Alterations
   to pitch setting and twist distribution are shown to have most impact
   upon the design requirement of increased gradient in the rotor
   speed-efficiency relationship in the overspeed region; coupled with such
   alterations, targeted changes to the chord distribution have been shown
   to increase the maximum efficiency. The prevention of cavitation has
   been highlighted as a driver for speed-limiting design alterations.
   While facilitating blade design, the methodology also produces
   experiential knowledge which can be stored, and shared in graphical
   format. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the world, regional and national registries exist to find
   stem cell donors for patients in need. The OneMatch Stem Cell and Marrow
   Network, Canada's public stem cell registry, was initiated in 1989 and
   has recruited well over 400,000 registrants. Given recent trends in the
   selection of adult donors by transplant centres, the registry strives
   for a composition that is increasingly male, has broad ethnic diversity
   and is predominantly comprised of young donors. In this paper, we
   describe two linear programming models to identify an optimal recruiting
   strategy for the OneMatch adult registry. Results suggest that there are
   trade-offs between increasing the number of ideal registrants (males
   under 36) and increasing the ethnic diversity of the registry. Making
   the registry younger and more male can be accomplished very quickly by
   significantly increasing the proportion of young Caucasian males. In the
   longer term, the ethnic composition of the registry can be made more
   diverse, but to do so requires either targeted recruiting strategies or
   a natural increase in the overall ethnic diversity of the Canadian
   population. A recruiting effort in excess of 25,000 individuals per
   annum is necessary to achieve sufficient flexibility to accomplish
   meaningful change to the registry composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The door-opening task is a key step for the indoor rescue and monitoring
   of a mobile manipulator. However, the contact effect between the gripper
   and the door handle may produce excessive internal forces to damage
   mechanical devices because of position errors or the imprecise modelling
   of the robot and operation environment. To successfully suppress the
   excessive internal forces and assure the proper posture of the mobile
   manipulator under holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, a robust
   adaptive position/force control algorithm was proposed to track the
   desired posture and force in opening a door to avoid the complexity of
   compliant mechanism and the unpredictability of the contact stiffness in
   traditional impedance control. Dynamic simulation studies with MATLAB
   and RecurDyn were used to verify the dynamic model of the system and
   obtain the expected positions and forces during door opening. Simulation
   results and experiments show that the proposed method is robust in
   modelling errors, joint frictions and environment disturbances and meets
   the requirement for opening a door with a handle and suppressing
   excessive internal forces. This study offers reference data and the
   control method for future real-world door-opening operation in different
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The fiber-reinforced composite materials with periodic cylindrical
   inclusions of a circular cross-section arranged in a hexagonal array are

   problem for such composites are obtained using the asymptotic
   homogenization method. The lubrication theory is applied for the
   asymptotic solution of the unit cell problems in the cases of inclusions
   of large and close to limit diameters, and for inclusions with high
   conductivity. The lubrication method is further generalized to the cases
   of finite values of the physical properties of inclusions, as well as
   for the cases of medium-sized inclusions. The analytical formulas for
   the effective coefficient of thermal conductivity of the
   fiber-reinforced composite materials of a hexagonal structure are
   derived in the cases of small conductivity of inclusions, as well as in
   the cases of extremely low conductivity of inclusions. The three-phase
   composite model (TPhM) is applied for solving the unit cell problems in
   the cases of the inclusions with small diameters, and the asymptotic
   analysis of the obtained solutions is performed for inclusions of small
   sizes. The obtained results are analyzed and illustrated graphically,
   and the limits of their applicability are evaluated. They are compared
   with the known numerical and asymptotic data in some particular cases,

Abstract = {{The study examined the main and interactive effects of soil-applied
   fertilizers {[}nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)] from a
   12-year (six production cycles) field experiment conducted at Kemptown,
   Nova Scotia (Canada). It also recommends the optimum rate for improved
   growth and harvestable yield of wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium
   Ait.). The fertilizers were applied in a single application at the onset
   of shoot emergence in early spring of each sprout year at rates of 0,
   12, 30, 48, and 60 kg.ha(-1) N using urea (2000 only) or ammonium
   sulfate, 0, 18, 45, 78, and 90 kg.ha(-1) P using triple super phosphate,
   0, 12, 30, 48, and 60 kg.ha(-1) K using potassium chloride. Response
   surface analysis of the data indicated that 35 kg.ha(-1) N, 40 kg.ha(-1)
   P, and 30 kg.ha(-1) K were optimum for fruit production and maintaining
   stem lengths <20 cm, and resulted in an average of 54\% more floral
   buds, 25\% more berries per stem, and 13\% greater yield than previous
   recommend rates of 20 kg.ha(-1) N, 10 kg.ha(-1) P, and 15 kg.ha(-1) K.
   The higher fertilizers rates cost an extra \$80/ha but increased net
   profits by \$490/ha. Findings of this study could contribute toward
   better farm profitability in areas with similar growing conditions. They
   also suggest that modifications to existing fertilizer rates be made for
   Central Nova Scotia wild blueberry.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the surging demands of multimedia services,
   quality-of-experience (QoE) is becoming an important metric to evaluate
   network quality from users' perspective. In this paper, resource
   optimisation to achieve optimal tradeoff between QoE and energy
   consumption in bidirectional orthogonal frequency-division
   multiple-access relaying networks is addressed so as to provide
   satisfactory multimedia delivery quality and support green
   communications. We first formulate a QoE-energy efficiency tradeoff
   optimisation where QoE requirements and relaying traffic balance are
   considered and prove that QoE-energy efficiency is quasiconcave on QoE,
   which suggests the existence of a unique global optimal tradeoff point.
   We then propose an optimisation framework to achieve the optimal
   tradeoff efficiently. With the framework, we develop resource allocation
   approaches for two specific relaying strategies, that is, two-phase
   decode-and-forward relaying with dynamic XOR network coding and
   compute-and-forward relaying with physical network coding via structured
   codes. Numerical results validate theoretical findings and demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed optimisation solution for achieving
   the tradeoff between QoE and energy consumption. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Due to the recent development in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs), the Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have become a major area
   of interest for the developers and researchers. Human body exhibits
   postural mobility due to which distance variation occurs and the status
   of connections amongst sensors change time to time. One of the major
   requirements of WBAN is to prolong the network lifetime without
   compromising on other performance measures, i.e., delay, throughput and
   bandwidth efficiency. Node prioritization is one of the possible
   solutions to obtain optimum performance in WBAN. IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA
   standard splits the nodes with different user priorities based on
   Contention Window (CW) size. Smaller CW size is assigned to higher
   priority nodes. This standard helps to reduce delay, however, it is not
   energy efficient. In this paper, we propose a hybrid node prioritization
   scheme based on IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA to reduce energy consumption and
   maximize network lifetime. In this scheme, optimum performance is
   achieved by node prioritization based on CW size as well as power in
   respective user priority. Our proposed scheme reduces the average back
   off time for channel access due to CW based prioritization.
   Additionally, power based prioritization for a respective user priority
   helps to minimize required number of retransmissions. Furthermore, we
   also compare our scheme with IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA standard (CW assisted
   node prioritization) and power assisted node prioritization under
   postural mobility in WBAN. Mathematical expressions are derived to
   determine the accurate analytical model for throughput, delay, bandwidth
   efficiency, energy consumption and life time for each node
   prioritization scheme. With the intention of analytical model
   validation, we have performed the simulations in OMNET++/MIXIM
   framework. Analytical and simulation results show that our proposed
   hybrid node prioritization scheme outperforms other node prioritization
   schemes in terms of average network delay, average throughput, average
   bandwidth efficiency and network lifetime.}},

   in the summer. This evolution leads several observers, scientists, media
   and government officials, to consider the possibility of developing new
   shipping routes along Arctic routes, as these routes are much shorter
   between Europe and Asia. The literature displays a strong discourse
   about interest from Asian countries for these potential shipping routes.
   This paper tackles with this idea and examines to what extent Asian
   shipping companies, the ultimate economic agents, are really interested
   in Arctic shipping routes. The image the research portrayed is that only
   a minority of Asian shipping companies are indeed interested, and those
   that are interested stress the destinational dimension of Arctic
   shipping, not transit shipping. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All

   operated inside this fluidic environment and a performance deviation of
   similar to 15\% was measured compared to an open MEMS configuration.

Title = {{Projecting In-stream Dissolved Organic Carbon and Total Mercury
   Concentrations in Small Watersheds Following Forest Growth and
   Clearcutting}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Forest is an important vegetation type on the globe, and clearcutting is
   the main forest management method. This paper presents a process-based
   model developed to project the impact of forest growth and clearcutting
   on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total mercury (THg) export from
   forest-dominated watersheds over two forest-growing cycles. The
   modelling of THg is based on the observation that THg export from
   terrestrial to aquatic eco-systems occurs with the binding and
   subsequent in-stream transport of THg by DOC. From the results generated
   with the integrated model, DOC and THg export follows two main trends;
   (i) a multiple-year trend, associated with forest harvesting and
   re-growth patterns over the lifetime of the forest, and (ii) an annual
   trend, associated with the seasonal dynamics in forest litter production
   and decomposition. During a forest rotation, DOC and THg concentration
   decreases following clearcutting, reaches a minimum at about 15 years
   after forest regeneration and then gradually increases with forest
   ageing. Large debris pools left on site following clearcutting can
   provide a significant pulse in DOC production and within-watershed THg
   export during the first 2-3 years after harvest. In a single year, the
   integrated model predicts that DOC- and THg-concentration peaks after
   leaf fall in autumn, decreases to a minimum in April, increases to
   another maximum in June and finally decreases to a second minimum just
   before leaf fall. This seasonal cycle is repeated every year. Conifer
   species and wetland-dominated watersheds are anticipated to release a
   greater amount of DOC and THg to aquatic ecosystems than deciduous and
   dryland-dominated watersheds. The long-term and seasonal DOC production
   is consistent with field measurements.}},

Title = {{Degradation and hemostatic properties of polyphosphate coacervates}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{328-341}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Sodium polyphosphate is a linear polymer formed from phosphate units
   linked together by sharing oxygen atoms. Addition of calcium to a
   solution of sodium polyphosphate results in phase separation and
   formation of a polyphosphate coacervate best described as a polymeric
   rich viscoelastic material. Polyphosphate coacervate is an interesting
   candidate as a biomaterial based on its ability to bind with different
   cations and to be loaded with drugs. Here, in vitro degradation and
   hemostatic properties of polyphosphate coacervates are comprehensively
   evaluated. We show that polyphosphate coacervates degrade and dissolve
   at a fast rate, losing half of their original mass in a week and
   transforming to mainly pyrophosphate after 4 weeks. This burst
   dissolution phase happens earlier for the coacervate prepared from very
   short chain polyphosphate but overall using longer polyphosphate chains
   does not increase the coacervate longevity significantly. Substitution
   of Ca with Sr or Ba does not affect the hydrolysis of coacervates but
   slows down their dissolution into the media. In a whole blood clotting
   assay, coacervates profoundly decrease the clotting time especially when
   very long chain polyphosphates are used. While coacervate chain length
   and divalent cation type were found to significantly affect prothrombin
   time and thromboplastin time compared to the control, no discernible
   trends were observed. Platelets adhere in large numbers to coacervates,
   especially those containing long chain polyphosphate, but the cell
   morphology observed suggests that they might not to be fully activated.
   Overall, the long chain polyphosphate coacervate holds a great potential
   as a resorbable hemostatic agent.}},

Abstract = {{The photonic density of states (PDOS) is one of the key physical
   quantities governing the lasing behavior for photonic band-edge lasers.
   The PDOS is conventionally altered by exploiting the high-Q band-edge
   mode within a device, which is typically achieved by increasing the
   contrast of periodic refractive index variation (Delta n) or increasing
   the periodic number of the photonic crystals. In this paper, we propose
   a different approach to achieve a high-Q band edge mode within an active
   compound dielectric waveguide grating (CWDG). We demonstrate that the
   lasing threshold and intensity can be flexibly tuned by changing the
   filling factors of the CWDG. This design can effectively improve the
   performance of electrically pumped photonic band-edge lasers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The oxidation behavior of a fine Ni superalloy (NiSA) powder, Inconel
   625, within an alumina support powder during heating has been determined
   using combined thermogravimetry (TG) and evolved gas analysis (EGA). A
   gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer (GCMS) was used for EGA. The GCMS
   was able to semi-quantitatively measure the rate at which air was
   removed from the furnace due to a He purge, where no pre-evacuation was
   used. It also was able to measure the effectiveness of a three cycle
   evacuation and He purge in reducing the oxygen content in the furnace
   and identify an important alumina off-gassing process that exposed the
   NiSA powder to H2O and CO2. The parallel use of the TG signal was able
   to quantitatively determine the relationship between NiSA oxidation and
   relative concentrations of the oxidizing gases created by the differing
   furnace pre-conditions and the alumina powder off-gassing process. It
   was concluded that the developed TG-GCMS method can be widely applied to
   quantitatively study oxygen pick-up in metal powders under industrially
   relevant processing conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   using the Monte Carlo simulation process. The major drawback of this
   approach is the intensive computational time required, mainly due to the
   finite element analysis and the Monte Carlo simulation process.
   Therefore, a simplified model or solution, which can bypass the
   computationally intensive and time-consuming numerical analyses, is
   desirable. The present study investigates the feasibility of using
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) to develop such a simplified model.
   ANNs are well known for their strong capability in mapping the input and
   output relationship of complex non-linear systems. The RFEM is used to
   generate possible solutions and to establish a large database that is
   used to develop and verify the ANN model. In this paper, multi-layer
   perceptrons, which are trained with the back-propagation algorithm, are
   used. The results of various performance measures indicate that the
   developed ANN model has a high degree of accuracy in predicting the
   reliability of heterogeneous slopes. The developed ANN model is then
   transformed into relatively simple formulae for direct application in
   practice. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Variation in global chemical composition of PM2.5: emerging results from
   SPARTAN}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The Surface PARTiculate mAtter Network (SPARTAN) is a long-term project
   that includes characterization of chemical and physical attributes of
   aerosols from filter samples collected worldwide. This paper discusses
   the ongoing efforts of SPARTAN to define and quantify major ions and
   trace metals found in fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Our methods infer
   the spatial and temporal variability of PM2.5 in a cost-effective
   manner. Gravimetrically weighed filters represent multi-day averages of
   PM2.5, with a collocated nephelometer sampling air continuously. SPARTAN
   instruments are paired with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sun
   photometers to better understand the relationship between ground-level
   PM2.5 and columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD).
   We have examined the chemical composition of PM2.5 at 12 globally
   dispersed, densely populated urban locations and a site at Mammoth Cave
   (US) National Park used as a background comparison. So far, each SPARTAN
   location has been active between the years 2013 and 2016 over periods of
   2-26 months, with an average period of 12 months per site. These sites
   have collectively gathered over 10 years of quality aerosol data. The
   major PM2.5 constituents across all sites (relative contribution +/- SD)
   are ammoniated sulfate (20\% +/- 11 \%), crustal material (13.4\% +/-
   9.9 \%), equivalent black carbon (11.9\% +/- 8.4 \%), ammonium nitrate
   (4.7\% +/- 3.0 \%), sea salt (2.3\% +/- 1.6 \%), trace element oxides
   (1.0\% +/- 1.1 \%), water (7.2\% +/- 3.3 \%) at 35\% RH, and residual
   matter (40\% +/- 24 \%).
   Analysis of filter samples reveals that several PM2.5 chemical
   components varied by more than an order of magnitude between sites.
   Ammoniated sulfate ranges from 1.1 mu g m(-3) (Buenos Aires, Argentina)
   to 17 mu g m(-3) (Kanpur, India in the dry season). Ammonium nitrate
   ranged from 0.2 mu g m(-3) (Mammoth Cave, in summer) to 6.8 mu g m(-3)
   (Kanpur, dry season). Equivalent black carbon ranged from 0.7 mu g m(-3)
   (Mammoth Cave) to over 8 mu g m(-3) (Dhaka, Bangladesh and Kanpur,
   India). Comparison of SPARTAN vs. coincident measurements from the
   Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE)
   network at Mammoth Cave yielded a high degree of consistency for daily
   PM2.5 (r(2) = 0.76, slope = 1.12), daily sulfate (r(2) = 0.86, slope =
   1.03), and mean fractions of all major PM2.5 components (within 6 \%).
   Major ions generally agree well with previous studies at the same urban
   locations (e.g. sulfate fractions agree within 4\% for 8 out of 11
   collocation comparisons). Enhanced anthropogenic dust fractions in large
   urban areas (e.g. Singapore, Kanpur, Hanoi, and Dhaka) are apparent from
   high Zn : Al ratios.
   The expected water contribution to aerosols is calculated via the
   hygroscopicity parameter kappa(v) for each filter. Mean aggregate values
   ranged from 0.15 (Ilorin) to 0.28 (Rehovot). The all-site parameter mean
   is 0.20 +/- 0.04. Chemical composition and water retention in each
   filter measurement allows inference of hourly PM2.5 at 35\% relative
   humidity by merging with nephelometer measurements. These hourly PM2.5
   estimates compare favourably with a beta attenuation monitor (MetOne) at
   the nearby US embassy in Beijing, with a coefficient of variation r(2) =
   0.67 (n = 3167), compared to r(2) = 0.62 when kappa(v) was not
   considered. SPARTAN continues to provide an open-access database of
   PM2.5 compositional filter information and hourly mass collected from a
   global federation of instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction can upgrade the properties of biomass, making it similar to
   coal. This study develops an innovative indirectly heated two-stage
   rotating drum-type torrefier where biomass moves due to the rotation of
   inclined cylindrical reactors. The rotary reactors consist of three
   rectangular flights placed axially along the reactor. This paper mainly
   investigates the mean residence time and filling factor of reactors
   operated at steady and plug flow conditions. Semi-empirical expressions
   using dimensionless correction constants for the mean residence time and
   the filling factor were proposed. Experiments keeping a constant solid
   flow rate at the dryer inlet were conducted in order to measure filling
   factor and mean residence time at different angular speeds and
   inclinations of reactors (dryer and torrefier). Mean residence times of
   5.8 min at 8 rpm and 38, and of 27.5 min at 4 rpm and 18 were found in
   the dryer (diameter: 64 mm, length: 610 mm), whereas they were 4.7 and
   21.4 min in the torrefier (diameter: 100 mm, length: 762 mm) at
   respective operating conditions. Filling factors of 3.0 \% at 8 rpm and
   38, and 14.3 \% at 4 rpm and 18 were found in the dryer, whereas they
   were 0.8 \% and 3.6 \% in the torrefier at the corresponding angular
   speed and inclination. Measured and predicted mean residence times were
   also compared and validated against those of other investigators. The
   proposed expressions, which include the effects of different operating
   and geometrical parameters, have strong predictive power and may be
   useful in scaling-up a rotary torrefier.}},

Title = {{Fractionation of stable carbon isotopes of tissue fatty acids in
   Atlantic pollock (Pollachius virens)}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of diet to tissue fractionation of fatty acid (FA)
   stable carbon isotopes are essential for the development of techniques
   employing these biomarkers. In this work, Atlantic pollock (Pollachius
   virens) was used as a model species to investigate fractionation arising
   from metabolic processes during assimilation of dietary FA into serum
   and liver; we also examined fractionation occurring from-mobilization of
   FA from liver during fasting. Pollock were fed diets containing FA of
   known isotopic composition, and serum and liver were collected
   postprandially and after fasting. Lipids were isolated from these
   tissues, and four polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3,
   and 22:6n-3, within triacylglycerols (TAG), a specific lipid class
   associated with fat storage, were analyzed for their stable carbon
   isotope ratios. For 18: 2n-6, 20: 5n-3, and 22: 6n-3, there was no
   discrimination between diet and serum in postprandially sampled fish,
   suggesting that fractionation did not occur during hydrolysis and
   esterification for most PUFA examined here during digestion and transfer
   into serum. There was a similar lack of fractionation for all four FA
   between fasted liver and serum, indicating that the assembly of these FA
   into TAG and their release into serum were not associated with
   fractionation. However, apparent fractionation was variable and
   inconsistent for all FA between diet and postprandial liver, indicating
   a failure of liver TAG to fully reflect the new diet. These data will
   allow delta C-13 values of three PUFA in postprandial serum to be
   incorporated into mixing models to estimate recent diet in gadoids.
   Further controlled feeding studies, under conditions that elicit
   physiological responses that are similar to those of fish in their
   natural environment, will be necessary before reliable estimates of
   longer-term diet, derived from delta C-13 in liver FA, will be possible.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an energy optimization technique to schedule
   three types of household appliances (user dependent, interactive
   schedulable and unschedulable) in response to the dynamic behaviours of
   customers, electricity prices and weather conditions. Our optimization
   technique schedules household appliances in real time to optimally
   control their energy consumption, such that the electricity bills of end
   users are reduced while not compromising on user comfort. More
   specifically, we use the binary multiple knapsack problem formulation
   technique to design an objective function, which is solved via the
   constraint optimization technique. Simulation results show that average
   aggregated energy savings with and without considering the human
   presence control system are 11.77\% and 5.91\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Spider silks are outstanding biomaterials with mechanical properties
   that outperform synthetic materials. Of the six fibrillar spider silks,
   aciniform (or wrapping) silk is the toughest through a unique
   combination of strength and extensibility: In this study, a wet-spinning
   method for recombinant Argiope trifasciata aciniform spidroin (AcSpl) is
   introduced. Recombinant AcSp1 comprising three 200 amino acid repeat
   units was solubilized in a 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
   (HFIP)/water mixture, forming a viscous alpha-helix enriched spinning
   dope, and wet-spun into an ethanol/water coagulation bath allowing
   continuous fiber production. Post-spin stretching of the resulting
   wet-spun fibers in water significantly improved fiber strength, enriched
   beta-sheet conformation without complete alpha-helix depletion, and
   enhanced birefringence. These methods allow reproducible aciniform silk
   fiber formation, albeit with lower extensibility than native silk,
   requiring conditions and methods distinct from those previously reported
   for other silk proteins. This provides an essential starting point for
   tailoring wet spinning of aciniform silk to achieve desired properties.}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A closed-form, multiple-scales, analytic approximation of a
   Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic model is developed to describe water hammer
   pressure wave attenuation in polymer pipe. The analytical results show
   that the evolution of water hammer for the single-pipe experiment
   considered in this paper is described by the Kelvin-Voight model as a
   weak strain-rate feedback occurring over three timescales. The wave
   transit and frictional timescales are augmented by a third intermediate
   timescale governed by the weakness of the strain-rate feedback. The
   scaling analysis also shows that, for weak strain-rate feedback, it is
   possible to use an optimization approach to estimate the scale of
   Kelvin-Voight parameters without experimental data. The optimal choice
   for weakness of the strain-rate feedback also determines the extent to
   which a weak strain-rate feedback description may be appropriate to
   describe an experimental design.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed Energy East pipeline project has raised concerns about
   potential oil spills in Saint John, New Brunswick. While environmental
   conditions could pose challenges for using mechanical recovery methods
   if a spill occurs, chemical dispersant could be an alternative. However,
   the application of chemical dispersant in shallow water and costal zones
   remains an issue of debate. Furthermore, the effectiveness of chemical
   dispersant under different seasonal conditions is yet to be determined.
   This study attempts to describe a modelling effort to understand the
   probable distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons in Port Saint John
   following a hypothetical release of crude oil to which dispersant is
   applied during different seasons. A three-dimensional model was used to
   simulate the transport of oil with a release of 1,000 m(3) of Arabian
   light crude in the summer and winter. A stochastic approach took into
   account the uncertainties of environmental inputs. The results were a
   significant reduction of oil ashore, and enhanced biodegradation with
   dispersant application. However, these effects were accompanied by an
   increase of oil in the sediment and water column, which is a concern.
   While the results are only conclusive for the selected scenarios of
   summer and winter, the method could be applied to other months and
   seasons to support more detailed analysis regarding dispersant
   application.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical technique is proposed for isolating the

   the other on the Kirchhoff-Love shell theory, and is aimed at offering
   the possibility of analyzing the pseudo-Rayleigh component in its pure
   form, an approach that has certain rather important advantages over
   analyzing the component as a part of the overall radiated hydrodynamic
   pattern. The technique is applied to the analysis of the radiation by
   two elastic shells with parameters that are common in industry, and the
   high computational efficiency of the technique is demonstrated. (C) 2016

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Hard chromium coatings are widely used for high performance components
   due to their superior wear and corrosion resistance. In this study, 416
   stainless steel bars were chromium electroplated commercially with
   different thickness. Mechanical properties and residual stress were
   measured using a nano-indentation system and X-ray diffraction,
   respectively. Image analysis technique was used to measure inherent
   crack density. Residual stress in the coating increases with increasing
   thickness leading to an increase in inherent crack density. An
   indentation study was carried out to investigate the mechanical damage
   of hard chromium coating as a function of thickness. Different failure
   modes were observed when hard chromium coatings were indented with a
   spherical indenter including Hertzian cone cracks, radial cracks, bend
   cracks, lateral cracks and coating delamination. Three thickness regions
   of distinctive cracking modes were identified. Thin coating region
   exhibited through-thickness Hertzian cracks. Hertzian and coating-bend
   rings, cone, surface radial cracks and coating bottom surface radial
   cracks were observed in intermediate coating region. This region
   exhibited highest cracking damage density. In thick coatings Hertzian
   cracks were observed. It was found that two factors affect the cracking
   damage: residual stress that increaseswith increasing thickness and
   bending stresses that decrease with increasing thickness. The resultant
   effect was maximized at intermediate coating thickness. (C) 2016

   theory of EHD drying with particular emphasis on yet existing gaps in
   the knowledge.
   Key findings and conclusions: Essential phenomena pertinent to
   high-voltage electric field and electric wind were examined in terms of
   heat and mass transfer at the gas-solid interface. The gaps in the
   knowledge caused by simplifying assumptions in theoretical and
   experimental studies, as well as omitting some crucial
   electrically-induced transport phenomena were identified. These include:
   (i) quantifying energy balance in EHD drying, (ii) uncovering
   electrically-induced mechanisms of mass transfer in solid, gas and
   gas-solid boundary layer; (iii) identifying interactions and possibly
   synergetic effects between electric charge and heat/mass transfer
   processes; (iv) determining whether average electric wind velocity
   adequately represents spatial distribution of wind velocity in
   non-uniform electric field, (v) explaining of some experimental
   findings, such as temperature drop at the liquid-gas interface,
   distortion of the free water surface and tangential component of
   electric wind at the material plane. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With the increasing industrial requirements such as bigger size object,
   stable operation, and complex task, multilateral teleoperation systems
   extended from traditional bilateral teleoperation are widely developed.
   In this paper, the integrated control design is developed for
   multilateral teleoperation systems, where n master manipulators are
   operated by human to remotely control n slave manipulators cooperatively
   handling a target object. For the first time, the control objectives of
   multilateral teleoperation including stability, synchronization,
   transparency, and internal force distribution are clarified
   systematically. A novel communication architecture is proposed to cope
   with communication delays, where the estimated environmental parameters
   are transmitted from the slave side to the master, to replace the
   traditional environmental force measurement in the communication
   channel. A kind of nonlinear adaptive robust control technique is used
   to deal with nonlinearities, unknown parameters, and modeling
   uncertainties existing in the master, slave, and environmental dynamics,
   so that the excellent tracking performance is achieved in both master
   and slave sides. The coordinated motion/force control is designed in the
   slave side by the optimal internal force distribution among n slave
   manipulators, and the impedance control is designed in the master side
   to realize the target transparency behavior. In summary, the proposed
   control algorithm can achieve the guaranteed robust stability, the
   excellent synchronization and transparency performance, and the optimal
   internal force distribution simultaneously for multilateral
   teleoperation systems under arbitrary time delays and various modeling
   uncertainties. The simulation is carried out on a 2-master/2-slave
   teleoperation system, and the results show the effectiveness of the
   proposed control design. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient resource usage is important for cost-effective microalgae
   production, where the incorporation of waste streams and recycled water
   into the process has great potential. This study builds upon emerging
   research on nutrient recycling in thraustochytrid production, where

   future cultures. This research investigates the nitrogen flux of
   recycled hydrolysate derived from enzymatic lipid extraction of
   thraustochytrid biomass. Results indicated the proteinaceous content of
   the recycled hydrolysate can offset the need to supply fresh nitrogen in
   a secondary culture, without detrimental impact upon the produced
   biomass. The treatment employing the recycled hydrolysate with no
   nitrogen addition accumulated 14.86 g L-1 of biomass in 141 h with 43.3
   \% (w/w) lipid content compared to the control which had 9.26 g L-1 and
   46.9 \% (w/w), respectively. This improved nutrient efficiency and
   wastewater recovery represents considerable potential for enhanced
   resource efficiency of commercial thraustochytrid production.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS \& HARD MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{74-83}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Titanium carbide (TiC) based cermets are commonly used in wear and
   corrosion resistance applications. The microstructural evolution, and
   related compositional instability, of TiC-based cermets prepared with a
   316-L stainless steel binder is described in the present work. Samples
   were fabricated using a simple vacuum melt infiltration procedure, with
   5 to 30 vol.\% binder. Infiltration temperatures ranged from 1475
   degrees C to 1550 degrees C, held for up to 240 min, typically resulting
   in sintered samples with densities in excess of 99\% of theoretical. It
   is demonstrated that irregularly shaped grains (concave/hollow) can
   arise after sintering, especially at 1475 degrees C, which is discussed
   in terms of the `instability of the solid-liquid interface' theory. It
   is, demonstrated that a complex, multi-layer core-rim structure arose
   for the cermets, with accommodation of selected steel constituents into
   the rim of the TiC grains. In particular, it is shown that the Mo in the
   original 316-L stainless steel is essentially fully depleted from the
   metallic binder phase, forming a Mo-rich inner-rim layer on the TiC
   grain cores. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This review quantitatively examines and compares the heat transfer

   jet impingement. The characteristics that have been examined include
   heat flux values, coolant temperatures, and coolant flowrates; which
   serve as indicators of the heat transfer limitations and power
   requirements of each cooling solution. A direct comparison against
   anticipated server heat loads has shown that some form of liquid cooling
   is necessary in high performance computing applications; where
   individual processor heat loads are expected to reach 300 W by the year
   2020. While in the case of general purpose computing, where individual
   processor heat loads are expected to reach 190 W, air cooling remains a
   viable option; although other factors such as operating costs, chip
   reliability, and waste heat recovery may still encourage the use of
   liquid cooling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lead service line replacement (LSLR) is an important strategy for
   reducing lead exposure via drinking water, but jurisdictional issues can
   sometimes interfere with full replacement of the lead line. The effects
   of full and partial LSLR on lead levels were assessed using 5 x 1-L
   sample profiles collected at more than 100 single-unit residences.
   Profiles comprised four sequential standing samples (L1-L4) and a free
   flowing sample (L5) drawn after a 5 min flush of the outlet. At 45 sites
   with full lead service lines, 90th percentile lead levels in standing
   samples ranged from 16.4 to 44.5 mu g L-1 (L1 and L4, respectively). In
   the free-flowing sample (L5), 90th percentile lead was 9.8 mu g L-1.
   Within 3 days, full LSLR had reduced L3-L5 lead levels by more than
   50\%, and within 1 month, lead levels were significantly lower in every
   liter of the sample profile. Conversely, partial LSLR more than doubled
   premises plumbing (L1, L2) lead release in the short term and did not
   reduce L1, L2 lead release in the long term. Even 6 months after partial
   LSLR, 27\% of first-draw lead levels were greater than 15 mu g L-1 (the
   U.S. EPA action level), compared with 13\% pre-replacement.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a continuous, nonlinear model (FLOG-CN) linking carbon
   mineralization and nitrogen mineralization-immobilization with respect
   to time that successfully reproduced the complex CO2-C and SMN dynamics
   for a collection of 70 paired C and N soil datasets. Application of the
   model to diverse C and N datasets showed that incorporating latency into
   the model of C mineralization, and using C to drive N dynamics, allows
   heterogeneous data from many different soil amendments to be described
   by the same model. We successfully modeled complex CO2-C and SMN
   dynamics of widely different shapes and from a variety of soil
   amendments containing plant and animal residues. The re-interpretation
   of these datasets with the FLOG-CN models improved the quantitative
   analysis of C and N dynamics, yielding new insights into how amendment
   characteristics and experimental conditions influence the timing and
   quantity of C and N mineralized. Model parameters were responsive to
   varying soil characteristics (pH, C, N, C:N), amendment N:C, amendment
   rate, incubation temperature, and N additions. Stepwise regression was
   used to predict model parameters using metadata available for 56 of
   these datasets. Significant relationships were developed to estimate
   model parameters independently using measured system properties or other
   model parameters that could be independently estimated. Estimates of C
   and N dynamics both fell along a 1:1 line indicating that the model
   parameters could be adequately described by the measured properties, but
   the available metadata was not able to describe C dynamics with high
   precision. Nitrogen mineralization-immobilization was strongly related
   to amendment N:C, and switched between the two processes at an amendment
   N:C between 0.077 and 0.085 (C:N between 11.7 and 12.9). We believe that
   the modeling approach described here will allow quantitative and
   objective comparisons of diverse C and N datasets that have been
   hindered by subjective descriptions of the past. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{High levels of iron in distributed drinking water often accompany
   elevated lead release from lead service lines and other plumbing.
   Lead-iron interactions in drinking water distribution systems are
   hypothesized to be the result of adsorption and transport of lead by
   iron oxide particles. This mechanism was explored using point-of-use
   drinking water samples characterized by size exclusion chromatography
   with UV and multi-element (ICP-MS) detection. In separations on two
   different stationary phases, high apparent molecular weight (>669 kDa)
   elution profiles for Fe-56 and Pb-208 were strongly correlated (average
   R-2 = 0.96, N = 73 samples representing 23 single-unit residences).
   Moreover, Fe-56 and Pb-208 peak areas exhibited an apparent linear
   dependence (R-2 = 0.82), consistent with mobilization of lead via
   adsorption to colloidal particles rich in iron. A UV254 absorbance peak,
   coincident with high molecular weight Fe-56 and Pb-208, implied that
   natural organic matter was interacting with the hypothesized colloidal

Abstract = {{Temperature and pH value can affect the short-range order of
   proto-structured and additive-free amorphous calcium carbonates (ACCs).
   Whereas a distinct change occurs in proto-vaterite (pv) ACC above 45
   degrees C at pH 9.80, proto-calcite (pc) ACC (pH 8.75) is unaffected
   within the investigated range of temperatures (7-65 degrees C). IR and
   NMR spectroscopic studies together with EXAFS analysis showed that the
   temperature-induced change is related to the formation of
   proto-aragonite (pa) ACC. The data strongly suggest that the binding of
   water molecules induces dipole moments across the carbonate ions in
   pa-ACC as in aragonite, where the dipole moments are due to the symmetry
   of the crystal structure. Altogether, a (pseudo-)phase diagram of the
   CaCO3 polyamorphism in which water plays a key role can be formulated
   based on variables of state, such as the temperature, and solution
   parameters, such as the pH value.}},

Abstract = {{Computational modelling, combined with experimental investigations, is a
   powerful method for investigating complex cardiac electrophysiological
   behaviour. The use of rabbit-specific models, due to the similarities of
   cardiac electrophysiology in this species with human, is especially
   prevalent. In this paper, we first briefly review rabbit-specific
   computational modelling of ventricular cell electrophysiology,
   multi-cellular simulations including cellular heterogeneity, and acute
   ischemia. This mini-review is followed by an original computational
   investigation of variability in the electrophysiological response of two
   experimentally-calibrated populations of rabbit-specific ventricular
   myocyte action potential models to acute ischemia. We performed a
   systematic exploration of the response of the model populations to
   varying degrees of ischemia and individual ischemic parameters, to
   investigate their individual and combined effects on action potential
   duration and refractoriness. This revealed complex interactions between
   model population variability and ischemic factors, which combined to
   enhance variability during ischemia. This represents an important step
   towards an improved understanding of the role that physiological
   variability may play in electrophysiological alterations during acute
   ischemia. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{A two dimensional model for torrefaction of large biomass particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Torrefaction is defined as a thermal pre-treatment process performed
   within a temperature range of 200-300 degrees C, at low-heating rates
   (<20 degrees C/min) and for residence times between 15-60 min in inert
   environments. A phenomenological model of the torrefaction process of
   large biomass particles is developed in this work. Mass and energy
   balance coupled to a kinetic model take into account two steps of the
   biomass decomposition. First of the two steps, considers simultaneous
   production of vapor and solids from raw biomass. The vapor phase
   comprises a mixture of condensable and non-condensable gases, while the
   solid phase consists of torrefied biomass. The second step involves
   decomposition of volatiles into gases and secondary char. The model
   analyzes torrefaction behavior of both large and small biomass
   particles, predicting their final solid and gas yields, temperatures
   distribution, internal pressure and velocity of the gas phase within the
   particles. The model also predicts maximum conversions for given
   particle sizes and temperatures during the process. For given set of
   conditions small particles showed higher (similar to 77\%) than that
   (similar to 52\%) for large particles. Maximum interstitial gas
   velocities inside the large particle (25 mm in diameter and 65 mm in
   length) was about 1.2 mm/s and pressure gradients of about 2000 kPa and
   it occurred after 20 min in the process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents real time information based energy management
   algorithms to reduce electricity cost and peak to average ratio (PAR)
   while preserving user comfort in a smart home. We categorize household
   appliances into thermostatically controlled (tc), user aware (ua),
   elastic (el), inelastic (iel) and regular (r) appliances/loads. An
   optimization problem is formulated to reduce electricity cost by
   determining the optimal use of household appliances. The operational
   schedules of these appliances are optimized in response to the
   electricity price signals and customer preferences to maximize
   electricity cost saving and user comfort while minimizing curtailed
   energy. Mathematical optimization models of tc appliances, i.e.,
   air-conditioner and refrigerator, are proposed which are solved by using
   intelligent programmable communication thermostat ( iPCT). We add extra
   intelligence to conventional programmable communication thermostat
   (CPCT) by using genetic algorithm (GA) to control tc appliances under
   comfort constraints. The optimization models for ua, el, and iel
   appliances are solved subject to electricity cost minimization and PAR
   reduction. Considering user comfort, el appliances are considered where
   users can adjust appliance waiting time to increase or decrease their
   comfort level. Furthermore, energy demand of r appliances is fulfilled
   via local supply where the major objective is to reduce the fuel cost of
   various generators by proper scheduling. Simulation results show that
   the proposed algorithms efficiently schedule the energy demand of all
   types of appliances by considering identified constraints (i.e., PAR,
   variable prices, temperature, capacity limit and waiting time).}},

Abstract = {{Remanufacturing processes such as refurbishing and reconditioning can
   extend the life of a product returned from the field. This provides
   financial opportunities and allows manufacturers to engage in
   sustainable practices. However, the inability to access a sufficient
   quantity of reconditioned components from end-of-life products can force
   the concurrent utilization of new components. This paper deals with the
   determination of an optimal warranty policy where a mixture of new and
   reconditioned components are used to carry out replacements upon failure
   for products under warranty. A mathematical optimization model is
   developed to maximize the manufacturer's expected total profit based on
   four decision variables: the warranty length, the sale price, the age of
   reconditioned components, and the proportion of reconditioned components
   to be used. A numerical procedure is used to compute the optimal
   solution. Numerical results are provided and discussed to demonstrate
   the validity and the added value of the proposed approach. Copyright (c)

   second contribution, Adaptive Cooperation in Energy (ACE) efficient
   depth based routing and Enhanced-ACE (E-ACE) are presented. In the
   proposed model, feedback mechanism indicates success or failure of data
   transmission. If direct transmission is successful, there is no need for
   relaying by cooperative relay nodes. In case of failure, all the
   available relays retransmit the data one by one till the desired signal
   quality is achieved at destination. Simulation results show that the ACE
   and E-ACE significantly improves network performance, i.e., throughput,
   when compared with other incremental relaying protocols like Cooperative
   Automatic Repeat reQuest (CARQ). E-ACE and ACE achieve 69\% and 63\%
   more throughput respectively as compared to CARQ in hard underwater
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary intake of probiotic bacteria has been shown to impart health
   effects, however, maintaining viable cells in foods and during passage
   of the adverse conditions in the upper gastro-intestinal tract is often
   a problem. The objective of this research was to develop and
   characterize novel food-grade phase-separated gelatin-maltodextrin
   (G-MD) microspheres, where the gelatin was cross-linked with
   transglutaminase (TGase), to determine if encapsulated probiotic lactic
   acid bacteria were protected during exposure to simulated upper
   gastrointestinal tract conditions. The stability, size, structure and
   protective ability of G-MD microspheres as a function of different TGase
   concentrations and gelatin bloom strengths were tested. The G-MD
   microspheres made with gelatin A 300 bloom and a TGase concentration of
   10 U/g prevented pepsin-induced degradation of the microspheres in
   simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0, 2 h, 37 degrees C), resulting in
   significantly (p < 0.05) higher numbers of survivors due to the
   buffering effect of intact microspheres (average diameter 46 pm). After
   sequential incubation in simulated gastric (1 h) and intestinal juices
   (pH 7.4, 4 h, 37 degrees C), survivor levels of each of the three
   encapsulated Lactobacillus sp. (3C2-10, 21C2-10 and 21C2-12) were
   reduced by 0.2-1 log(CFU/g) as compared to 3-4 log (CFU/g) for the free
   non-encapsulated cells. This study presents a new protein based
   microencapsulation method, which using all food-grade ingredients
   protects probiotic lactic add bacteria during exposure to adverse
   environmental conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the 24-h PM2.5 (i.e., the fine particles with aerodynamic
   diameter of <= 2.5 mu m) samples were collected at two different
   functional subdivisions in the city of Tangshan during the period of
   July 2012 to April 2013. The months of July, October, January, and April
   were chosen to represent four different typical seasons. The total PM2.5
   mass was measured. PM2.5 samples were used for the analysis of inorganic
   elements, ions, Organic Carbon (OC) and Elemental Carbon (EC). PM2.5
   concentration in the industrial subdivision were generally higher than
   those in the residential subdivision. The annual mean PM2.5
   concentrations were 196 mu g m(-3) for the industrial subdivision and
   116 mu g m(-3) for the residential subdivision. The coefficients of
   divergence (CD) calculated for spring, summer, autumn and winter were
   0.67, 0.35, 0.65, and 0.33, respectively. The Enrichment Factor Method
   (EFM) was used to help determine the original sources of these inorganic
   elements. Secondary water-soluble ions (SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) were the
   major water soluble ions in the PM2.5 of Tangshan, and they are present
   in the atmosphere as (NH4)(2)SO4 and NH4NO3. The Sulfur Oxidation Ratio
   (SOR) and Nitrogen Oxidation Ratio (NOR) show that the precursor
   conversion ratio was highest in summer. At both subdivisions, winter had
   the highest monthly average OM concentration while summer had the
   lowest.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic considerations for the design of deep foundations against

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1167-1175}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Current foundation design practice for serviceability limit states
   involves proportioning the foundation to achieve an acceptably small
   probability that the foundation settlement exceeds some target maximum
   total settlement. However, it is usually differential settlement that
   leads to problems in the supported structure. The design question, then,
   is how should the target maximum total settlement of an individual
   foundation be selected so that differential settlement is not excessive?
   Evidently, if the target maximum total settlement is increased, the
   differential settlement between foundations will also tend to increase,
   so that there is a relationship between the two, although not
   necessarily a simple one. This paper investigates how the target maximum
   total settlement specified in the design of an individual foundation
   relates to the distribution of the differential settlement between two
   identical foundation elements, as a function of the ground statistics
   and the distance between the two foundations. A probabilistic theory is
   developed, and validated by simulation, which is used to prescribe
   target maximum settlements employed in the design process to avoid
   excessive differential settlements to some acceptable probability.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of predator diets, including how diets might change through
   time or differ among predators, provides essential insights into their
   ecology. Diet estimation therefore remains an active area of research
   within quantitative ecology. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis
   (QFASA) is an increasingly common method of diet estimation. QFASA is
   based on a data library of prey signatures, which are vectors of
   proportions summarizing the fatty acid composition of lipids, and diet
   is estimated as the mixture of prey signatures that most closely
   approximates a predator's signature. Diets are typically estimated using
   proportions from a subset of all fatty acids that are known to be solely
   or largely influenced by diet. Given the subset of fatty acids selected,
   the current practice is to scale their proportions to sum to 1.0.
   However, scaling signature proportions has the potential to distort the
   structural relationships within a prey library and between predators and
   prey. To investigate that possibility, we compared the practice of
   scaling proportions with two alternatives and found that the traditional
   scaling can meaningfully bias diet estimators under some conditions. Two
   aspects of the prey types that contributed to a predator's diet
   influenced the magnitude of the bias: the degree to which the sums of
   unscaled proportions differed among prey types and the identifiability
   of prey types within the prey library. We caution investigators against
   the routine scaling of signature proportions in QFASA.}},

Abstract = {{Tendons exposed to tensile overload show a structural alteration at the
   fibril scale termed discrete plasticity. Serial kinks appear along
   individual collagen fibrils that are susceptible to enzymatic digestion
   and are thermally unstable. Using atomic force microscopy we mapped the
   topography and mechanical properties in dehydrated and hydrated states
   of 25 control fibrils and 25 fibrils displaying periodic kinks,
   extracted from overloaded bovine tail tendons. Using the measured
   modulus of the hydrated fibrils as a probe of molecular density, we
   observed a non-linear negative correlation between molecular density and
   kink density of individual fibrils. This is accompanied by an increase
   in water uptake with kink density and a doubling of the coefficient of
   variation of the modulus between kinked, and control fibrils. The
   mechanical property maps of kinked collagen fibrils show radial
   heterogeneity that can be modeled as a high-density core surrounded by a
   low-density shell. The core of the fibril contains the kink structures
   characteristic of discrete plasticity; separated by inter-kink regions,
   which often retain the D-banding structure. We propose that the shell
   and kink structures{''} mimic characteristic damage motifs observed in
   laid rope strands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fragmentation and loss of old-growth forest has led to the decline
   of many forest-dwelling species that depend on old-growth forest as
   habitat. Emblematic of this issue in many areas of the managed boreal
   forest in Canada is the threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou (Gmelin, 1788)). We develop a methodology to help determine when
   and how timber can be harvested to best satisfy both industrial timber
   supply and woodland caribou habitat requirements. To start, we use
   least-cost paths based on graph theory to determine the configuration of
   woodland caribou preferred habitat patches. We then developed a
   heuristic procedure to schedule timber harvesting based on a trade-off
   between merchantable wood volume and the remaining amount of habitat and
   its connectivity during a planning cycle. Our heuristic can attain 84\%
   of the potential woodland caribou habitat that would be available in the
   absence of harvesting at the end of a 100 year planning horizon.
   Interestingly, this is more than that which is attained by the current
   plan (50\%) and a harvesting plan that targets high volume stands
   (32\%). Our results indicate that our heuristic procedure (i.e., an
   ecologically tuned optimization approach) may better direct industrial
   activities to improve old-growth habitat while maintaining specified
   timber production levels.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared thermographic validation is shown for a closed-form analytical
   heat conduction model for non-uniformly heated, laminate bodies with an
   insulated domain boundary. Experiments were conducted by applying power
   to rectangular electric heaters and cooled by natural convection in air,
   but also apply to constant-temperature heat sources and forced
   convection. The model accurately represents two-dimensional laminate
   heat conduction behaviour giving rise to heat spreading using
   one-dimensional equations for the temperature distributions and heat
   transfer rates under steady-state and pseudo-steady-state conditions.
   Validation of the model with an insulated boundary (complementing
   previous studies with an infinite boundary) provides useful predictions
   of heat spreading performance and simplified temperature uniformity
   calculations (useful in log-mean temperature difference style heat
   exchanger calculations) for real laminate systems such as found in
   electronics heat sinks, multi-ply stovetop cookware and interface
   materials for supercooled salt hydrates. Computational determinations of
   implicit insulated boundary condition locations in measured data,
   required to assess model equation validation, were also demonstrated.
   Excellent goodness of fit was observed (both root-mean-square error and
   R (2) values), in all cases except when the uncertainty of low
   temperatures measured via infrared thermography hindered the statistical
   significance of the model fit. The experimental validation in all other
   cases supports use of the model equations in design calculations and
   heat exchange simulations.}},

Title = {{Functional Testing of Subcutaneous Piezoelectrically Actuated Hearing
   Aid: Comparison With BAHA and Potential for Treating Single-sided
   Deafness}},
Journal = {{OTOLOGY \& NEUROTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the performance of a subcutaneous
   piezoelectrically actuated hearing aid (SPAHA) with the bone-anchored
   hearing aid (BAHA) and assess its effectiveness as a treatment option
   for conductive loss and single-sided deafness (SSD).
   Background: To validate the use of the SPAHA as a bone conduction
   implant, its performance was compared with a widely used bone conduction
   implant, the BAHA. Maximum dynamic range, power consumed to deliver
   standard speech signals and total harmonic distortion (THD) was
   assessed. The transcranial attenuation was also measured to assess the
   SPAHA's potential to treat SSD.
   Method: Functional testing of the SPAHA and BAHA was conducted using
   cadaver heads. Ipsilateral and contralateral promontory velocity and the
   power consumption by the devices were measured at 111 different
   frequencies in the range of 200 to 9600 Hz. Performance metrics were
   derived from these measurements.
   Result: The maximum dynamic range for SPAHA was within 10 dB of that of
   BAHA. The THD for the SPAHA was at most 3\%, slightly better than the
   BAHA. The power consumption by the SPAHA, whereas highly variable, was
   not statistically different than that of the BAHA. Transcranical
   attenuation in case of SPAHA was 5 to 10 dB across the measured
   frequency range.
   Conclusion: From observed dynamic range and THD, the speech quality
   delivered by the SPAHA should equal or exceed that delivered by the
   BAHA. To attain equivalent hearing sensation at lower frequencies, the
   drive voltage for SPAHA would have to be significantly higher than that
   for BAHA. For typical speech inputs the power consumption requirements
   of the SPAHA should be roughly equal to those of the BAHA. Given its
   performance at high frequencies, the SPAHA seems well-suited to treating
   SSD.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The micropiled raft (MPR) offers an efficient foundation system that
   combines the advantages of micro piles and piled rafts that can be used
   as primary foundation system or to enhance an existing raft foundation.
   In this paper, a calibrated and verified finite element model (FEM) with
   centrifuge tests was used to carry out a numerical investigation on the
   performance of MPR in sand. A total of 78 different cases were analyzed
   in this study to assess the behavior of MPR in sand taking into account
   a number of factors that may influence its behavior such as: the number
   of micropiles (MPs), the spacing to micropile diameter (S/D-mp), the
   raft thickness, type of loading and soil density. The outcomes of this
   investigation should help in understanding the effect of these factors
   on the MPR axial stiffness, including; differential settlement; load
   sharing between the MPs and the raft; and the raft bending moment.
   Moreover, the ability of the PDR method to evaluate the axial stiffness
   of a MPR for the preliminary design stage is examined. It was found that
   the MPR system has the ability to increase the tolerable bearing
   pressure by 190\% compared to an isolated raft system. In addition, an
   adjustment factor (COPR) for PDR method was introduced to account for
   the raft flexibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the substitution of Na2O for SrO in a series of nine

   sodium content during glass firing, and allowed for improvements in
   composition property relationships. Increased substitution of sodium
   resulted in decreases in glass density, glass transition, and non
   bridging oxygen fraction in the glass. Strontium ion release kinetics
   were governed by Fickian diffusion and were not altered by the
   substitution of sodium for strontium in the glass. Boron ion release
   varied from pure Fickian diffusion controlled to a parabolic release
   demonstrating precipitation with high sodium contents. (C) 2016

Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Adding adsorbent into the coagulation process is an emerging treatment
   solution for targeting hard-to-remove dissolved organic compounds from
   both drinking water and industrial wastewater. The impact of adding
   powdered activated carbon (PAC) or organoclay (OC) adsorbents with
   ferric chloride (FeCl3) coagulant was investigated in terms of potential
   changes to the coagulated flocs formed with respect to size, structure,
   and breakage and regrowth properties. The ability of dissolved air
   flotation (DAF) and sedimentation (SED) clarification processes to
   remove hybrid adsorbent-coagulant flocs was also evaluated through
   clarified water quality analysis of samples collected in bench-scale jar
   test experiments. The jar tests were conducted using both a synthetic
   fresh water and oily wastewater test water spiked with dissolved
   aromatic compounds phenol and naphthalene. Results of the study
   demonstrated that addition of adsorbent reduced the median coagulated
   floc size by up to 50\% but did not affect floc strength or regrowth
   potential after application of high shear. Experimental results in fresh
   water demonstrated that sedimentation was more effective than DAF for
   clarification of both FeCl3-PAC and FeCl3-OC floc aggregates. However,
   experimental tests performed on the synthetic oily wastewater showed
   that coagulant-adsorbent floc aggregates were effectively removed with
   both DAF and sedimentation treatment, with lower residual turbidity
   achieved in clarified water samples than with coagulation treatment
   alone. Addition of OC or PAC into the coagulation process resulted in
   removals of over half, or nearly all of the dissolved aromatics,
   respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of hydrothermodynamic (HTD) processing in the range of
   temperatures 70-95 degrees C and holding times 0-10 min on physical and
   chemical qualities of cranberry puree was investigated using response
   surface methodology (RSM). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of pH, Brix,
   viscosity, particle size, anthocyanin content, PAC content, total
   phenolic content and antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays)
   showed that fitted models obtained with RSM were adequate and accurate.
   Temperatures and holding time showed negative effect on the anthocyanin
   content, but positive effects on all the other responses, indicating
   that most bioactive compounds in cranberry were stable under HID
   processing. The optimal combination of operating conditions was 91
   degrees C and 6 min of holding time, which provided maximal overall
   desirability of the product at 0.676. Comparison with three commercially
   available cranberry juices showed that HTD processed cranberry puree
   contained 26.8-86.8\% more anthocyanins, 51.6-91.6\% higher content of
   PACs and 30.6-86.3\% higher content of total phenolics. This study
   demonstrated a strong potential of HTD technology to produce a cranberry
   puree with better texture properties and higher nutritional value. (C)

Abstract = {{The focusing performance of a modulated polarized Airy beam is explored
   by using the Richards and Wolf vectorial diffraction model in a high
   numerical aperture system. The multiple foca appeared on the focal plane
   or along the optical axis when a complex amplitude modulating function
   was introduced. Two focusing spots with long-focal-depth were
   additionally observed due to the Airy beam and complex amplitude
   modulation. The distance between the focuses were changed from 1.15
   lambda to 3.56 lambda with FWHM of 0.9 lambda for one-dimensional linear
   polarized incident beam and from 1.15 lambda to 3.64 lambda for
   two-dimensional beam. The multiple focusing spots are expected to apply
   in the field of optical trapping and particle acceleration. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a wireless positioning method based on Deep
   Learning. To deal with the variant and unpredictable wireless signals,
   the positioning is casted in a four-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN)
   structure pre-trained by Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) that is
   capable of learning reliable features from a large set of noisy samples
   and avoids hand-engineering. Also, to maintain the temporal coherence, a
   Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based fine localizer is introduced to smooth
   the initial positioning estimate obtained by the DNN-based coarse
   localizer. The data required for the experiments is collected from the
   real world in different periods to meet the actual environment.
   Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to
   substantial improvement on localization accuracy in coping with the
   turbulent wireless signals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite of significant research on the mechanical properties of
   fibre-reinforced polymer composites made of natural fibres, long-term
   performance of the natural fibre composites against moisture and other
   environmental conditions is not well-known. In this paper, accelerated
   durability tests were conducted in order to investigate the long-term
   performance of flax fibre composites in comparison with glass fibre
   composites. A total of 490 tensile specimens were prepared and exposed
   to four different environmental conditions namely dry heat, water
   (distilled), salt water (3.5\% by weight), and alkaline (pH = 12.5)
   solutions. The temperature of the solutions was controlled at 20, 50,
   and 60 degrees of Celsius (degrees C). Tensile tests were performed
   after 21, 42, 83, and 125 days exposure to the environmental conditions.
   Overall, the tensile strength of both flax and glass composites
   significantly decreased with increasing temperature and exposure time,
   however initial elastic modulus of both materials was not affected. Flax
   composites showed a bilinear stress strain behaviour and the secondary
   slope of the curve become slightly softer after the environmental
   conditionings, although glass composites almost retained their linear
   behaviour. In terms of tensile strength retention percentage, flax
   composites not only were not worse than glass composites but also they
   had even slightly better strength retention percentage. (C) 2016

Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{A finite element study was performed to investigate the effect of
   vertical loading on the in-plane lateral behavior and strength of
   concrete masonry infills bounded by steel frames. An experimental
   program was also conducted and results were used to verify the finite
   element model. Parameters considered in the finite element study
   included the vertical load level and application method, infill aspect
   ratio, infill compressive strength, and bounding frame stiffness.
   Results showed that when applied as a uniformly distributed load on the
   frame beam, an optimal load level was identified and the vertical load,
   when applied within this load level, was found to be beneficial to the
   lateral stiffness and strength of the infilled frame. When applied as
   point loads on columns, the vertical load was shown to reduce the
   lateral strength of the infilled frame. Based on the regression analysis
   on finite element results, a simplified analytical model was proposed to
   account for the effect of vertical loading through the use of a
   modification factor on the lateral stiffness and strength of infilled
   steel frames. The proposed model was shown to provide results in good
   agreement with finite element values over a wide range of load levels,
   infill material strengths, and frame stiffnesses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   measurement uncertainty}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{23-35}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of LiDAR measurement uncertainty and its propagation into
   derived geospatial products is important for conscientious application
   of LiDAR products to environmental modeling, planning and decision
   making. This study simulates theoretical error limits of LiDAR
   elevations based on survey acquisition parameters and terrain conditions
   and applies a Monte Carlo simulation approach to determine the
   uncertainty in a DEM, grid based slope and aspect maps, watershed area
   and a stream network delineation. A cell-by-cell assessment of the DEM
   for hydrological network extraction is also provided through the
   Gyasi-Agyei et al. (1995) suitability metric. Results show that DEM
   uncertainty generally ranged between 0.025 and 0.060 m, slope
   uncertainty ranged between 0.6 and 1.5 degrees, and aspect uncertainty
   ranged between 2.7 and 24.1 degrees for the given case study site. DEM
   uncertainty and slope uncertainty were correlated with the incidence
   angle between the laser pulse and the terrain, described with a
   piecewise linear function. Uncertainty in aspect showed a correlation
   with terrain slope and could be described with a decreasing power
   function. The variation in watershed area was less than 1\% of total
   watershed area indicating it was not sensitive to LiDAR measurement
   errors for the selected case study site. Stream network length
   variability was 1.5\% of total length, but increased as the analyzed
   area decreased. Areas of 1 ha showed relative standard deviations of
   stream network length of similar to 26\%. These results can be used to
   optimise LiDAR survey data collection configuration and in the design of
   tools to ensure the objectives and uncertainty requirements of projects
   requiring terrain derivative products are successfully achieved. (C)

Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{There is currently a lack of biomarkers to help properly assess novel
   immunotherapies at both the preclinical and clinical stages of
   development. Recent work done by our group indicated significant volume
   changes in the vaccine draining right lymph node (RLN) volumes of mice
   that had been vaccinated with DepoVax (TM), a lipid-based vaccine
   platform that was developed to enhance the potency of peptide-based
   vaccines. These changes in lymph node (LN) volume were unique to
   vaccinated mice.
   To better assess the potential of volumetric LN markers for multiple
   vaccination platforms, we evaluated 100 tumor bearing mice and assessed
   their response to vaccination with either a DepoVax based vaccine (DPX)
   or a water-in-oil emulsion (w/o), and compared them to untreated
   controls. MRI was used to longitudinally monitor LN and tumor volumes
   weekly over 4 weeks. We then evaluated changes in LN volumes occurring
   in response to therapy as a potential predictive biomarker for treatment
   success.
   We found that for both vaccine types, DPX and w/o, the \% RLN volumetric
   increase over baseline and the ratio of RLN/LLN were strong predictors
   of successful tumor suppression (LLN is left inguinal LN). The area
   under the curve (AUC) was greatest, between 0.75-0.85, two (\% RLN) or
   three (RLN/LLN) weeks post-vaccination. For optimized critical
   thresholds we found these biomarkers consistently had sensitivity > 90\%
   and specificity > 70\% indicating strong prognostic potential.
   Vaccination with DepoVax had a more pronounced effect on draining lymph
   nodes than w/o emulsion vaccines, which correlated with a higher
   anti-tumor activity in DPX-treated mice.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fixed pitch passively adaptive tidal turbine blades made of
   non-homogeneous composite materials have the potential to reduce blade
   and structural loads, shed power above design conditions, reduce
   cavitation inception, and reduce the effects of fatigue loading. Due to
   the flexibility of these blades, a fluid-structure interaction design
   methodology is required. This paper outlines the development of a
   coupled finite element (FEM)-blade element momentum theory (BEMT) design
   tool developed to iterate between the structural (deformation and
   stresses) and hydrodynamic (power and thrust loads) responses of
   passively adaptive blades. Such a FEM-BEMT design methodology provides
   an early stage tool with minimal computational requirements compared to
   computational fluid dynamics-FEM coupled codes. Both the BEMT and FEM

Abstract = {{Traditional die-to-die (DTD) clock skew compensation topologies
   prerequisite matched delay lines or equal through-silicon via (TSV)
   delays. Unlike previous techniques, the proposed mismatch-insensitive
   skew compensation architecture can maintain a synchronous clock signal
   between two dies, while completely eliminating any skew arising from
   code-dependent mismatch in delay lines or unequal TSV delays. The
   performance of our design is verified in theory and simulation in light
   of mismatch/finite resolution of delay lines, clock jitter, phase
   detector dead zone, TSV delay, and buffer mismatch. Postsynthesis timing
   verification of this cell-based design was done in a 65-nm CMOS process.
   Under similar worse case mismatch conditions, the residual skew in the
   proposed architecture was delimited to 32 ps at 1 GHz, compared with 116
   ps for a recent DTD topology, while consuming only 2.1 mW.}},

Abstract = {{Lycopene exhibits strong antioxidant activity due to its unsaturated
   molecular bonds, which also contributes to its susceptibility for
   degradation. Encapsulation techniques can reduce lycopene degradation,
   increasing its potential applications in functional foods and
   nutraceuticals. The objective of this study was to optimise the
   encapsulation of lycopene from watermelon in alginate microparticles
   using the inverse gelation method. Box-Behnken design was used for the
   optimisation of three variables: concentrations of alginate (w/v \%) and
   CaCl2 (g L-1), and gelation time (min). Two types of alginate were
   investigated (low viscosity and high viscosity) and optimised separately
   using encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity as responses.
   Results indicated that the models had a good fit to the experimental
   data and the optimal conditions varied depending on the type of
   alginate. In general, particles prepared with low-viscosity alginate
   exhibited higher encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity and could
   be used for further research.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the transient pressurization of a pre-existing,
   fingerlike crack in a poroelastic, permeable rock due to a fluid
   injection, the problem previously considered in the nonporoelastic
   reservoir context in the companion paper (Sarvaramini and Garagash,
   2015, ``Breakdown of a Pressurized Fingerlike Crack in a Permeable
   Solid,{''} J. Appl. Mech., 82(6), p. 061006). Large-scale fluid leak-off
   from the crack and the associated pore-fluid diffusion within the
   permeable rock formation lead to dilation of the pore volume, which acts
   to additionally confine/ close the crack. The influence of this
   so-called `` poroelastic backstress{''} on the evolution of the fluid
   pressure in the crack and the onset of the fracture propagation are
   investigated. We first revisit the existing solution to an auxiliary
   problem of a poroelastic crack subjected to a step pressure increase and
   generalize it to account for the full-space fluid leak-off diffusion.
   This solution is then used to formulate the solution to the transient
   pressurization of the crack due to a constant rate of fluid injection
   via the Green's function approach. Comparison to the reference solution
   for a fingerlike crack in a nonporoelastic reservoir shows that the
   poroelasticity has a minor effect on the fluid pressure evolution in the
   crack. However, the evolution of the fracture volume and the onset of
   the fracture propagation are shown to be significantly hindered by the
   poroelastic backstress at large enough injection time when fluid
   diffusion becomes fully two-or three-dimensional.}},

Abstract = {{A review of available literature and current governance approaches
   related to the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water
   quality (including drinking water) was developed. The paper identifies
   gaps in literature and (or) current governance approaches that should be
   addressed to guide decision-makers in the development of appropriate
   regulatory regimes that will enable assessment of the impacts of
   hydraulic fracturing on water quality. The lack of credible and
   comprehensive data are shown to have been a major setback to properly
   investigate and monitor hydraulic fracturing activities and their
   potential risks on the environment and water quality. A review of
   current governance approaches demonstrates that some jurisdictions have
   implemented baseline and post-operation water quality monitoring
   requirements; however, there are large variations in site-specific
   monitoring requirements across Canada and the United States. In light of
   recent information, a targeted approach is suggested based on risk
   priorities, which can prioritize sample collection and frequency, target
   contaminants, and the needed duration of the sampling. The steps
   outlined in this review help to interface with the public concerns
   associated with water quality, and appropriately ensure that public
   health is protected through appropriate water safety planning.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion of the plasmonic behavior at an interface between a
   dielectric and a conducting medium (e.g. metal, doped semiconductor,
   graphine, or superconductor) is studied considering the free electron
   gas in the conducting medium be moving along the interface. The
   derivation of the dispersion equation is provided, including the damping
   and the electrons drift. It is shown that the electrons behave as a
   compressible gas giving rise to new features and new surface plasmon
   wave solutions of the dispersion equation. A normalized form of the
   derived dispersion equation is obtained. It is then employed to study
   the general properties numerically using typical semiconductor material
   parameters found recently experimentally. Results are discussed in the
   light of possible novel applications of these physical effects such as,

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: To illustrate the ability of high frequency ultrasound
   (HFUS) using a transducer array to demonstrate a variety of simulated
   clinical scenarios involving the ossicular chain.
   Background: HFUS (>20 MHz) is a relatively new area of ultrasonic
   imaging that provides an order of magnitude better image resolution than
   the conventional low-frequency systems. HFUS may be a real-time imaging
   system that could be used in the clinic and would complement computed
   tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance the
   decision-making process for patients with middle ear pathology.
   Methods: Using a commercially available HFUS scanner, we imaged a
   variety of simulated clinical scenarios to demonstrate the ability of
   HFUS to image middle ear pathology.
   Results: We were able to clearly demonstrate real-time visualization of
   ossicular pathology in human temporal bones, whereas there are some
   limitations in the current technique to be addressed before it is used
   in vivo.
   Conclusion: HFUS allows excellent visualization of middle ear anatomy
   and pathology through an intact tympanic membrane (TM), and these
   experiments go some way towards giving the otologist access to high
   resolution, real-time imaging of the middle ear in the clinic.}},

Title = {{Effect of Round Window Reinforcement on Hearing: A Temporal Bone Study
   With Clinical Implications for Surgical Reinforcement of the Round
   Window}},
Journal = {{OTOLOGY \& NEUROTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Round window reinforcement leads to conductive hearing loss.
   Background: The round window is stiffened surgically as therapy for
   various conditions, including perilymphatic fistula and superior
   semicircular canal dehiscence. Round window reinforcement reduces
   symptoms in these patients. However, it also reduces fluid displacement
   in the cochlea and might therefore increase conductive hearing loss.
   Methods: Perichondrium was applied to the round window membrane in nine
   fresh-frozen, nonpathologic temporal bones. In four temporal bones
   cartilage was applied subsequently. Acoustic stimuli in the form of
   frequency sweeps from 250 to 8000Hz were generated at 110 dB sound
   pressure level. A total of 16 frequencies in a 1/3-octave series were
   used. Stapes velocities in response to the acoustic stimuli were
   measured at equally spaced multiple points covering the stapes footplate
   using a scanning laser Doppler interferometry system. Measurements were
   made at baseline, after applying perichondrium, and after applying
   cartilage.
   Results: At frequencies up to 1000 Hz perichondrium reinforcement
   decreased stapes velocities by 1.5 to 2.9 dB compared with no
   reinforcement (p value = 0.003). Reinforcement with cartilage led to a
   further deterioration of stapes velocities by 2.6 to 4.2 dB at
   frequencies up to 1000 Hz (p value = 0.050). The higher frequencies were
   not affected by perichondrium reinforcement (p value = 0.774) or
   cartilage reinforcement (p value = 0.644).
   Conclusion: Our results seem to suggest a modest, clinically negligible
   effect of reinforcement with perichondrium. Placing cartilage on the
   round window resulted in a graded effect on stapes velocities in keeping
   with the increased stiffness of cartilage compared with perichondrium.
   Even so, the effect was relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 250 million tires are discarded each year in the United
   States and 20 million in Canada. Finding sustainable ways to dispose
   these tires continues to be a problem throughout the world not only in
   North America. Disposal issues along with a continuing increase in tire
   production have resulted in an increase in tire stockpiles, 30 \% of
   these tires end up occupying valuable landfill space. Tire Derived
   Aggregates (TDA) made from scrap tires have a compacted dry unit weight
   of 6.9 kN/m(3) and a specific gravity of 1.06 making their use as
   lightweight fill material especially for highway embankments over soft
   soils very advantageous. Using TDA as fill material not only provide a
   new construction material but also help to provide sustainable solution
   for several environmental and economic problems. Previous studies have
   shown that the addition of Tire Derived Aggregates (TDA) to sand results
   in a fill material which is characterized by its higher shear strength
   compared to that of 100 \% sand. While there have been several studies
   investigating various properties and situations involving TDA's, there
   remain areas that still require exploration. The effect of
   soil/aggregate gradation on shear strength is one of particular
   interest. All of the research conducted to date investigated only the
   sand gradation mixed with uniform TDA gradation. None of the conducted
   research investigated the interaction between the gradation of the two
   materials and its effect on the performance of the fill mixture. The
   main goal of this paper is to gain an understanding of this interaction
   in aim of producing better fill mixtures with enhanced characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents green service level agreement (GSLA) awareness for
   the hybrid and traditional routing mechanisms by proposing a
   mathematical model for the amount of route greenness, and proposing two
   algorithms for the adoption of GSLA. The effect of the adoption of GSLA
   on a network that on average has green energy available for longer
   duration of a day is modeled by defining a one-step two-by-two Markov
   matrix and representing the transformation through a state machine. This
   work also examines a re-provisioning algorithm to deal with the effect
   of re-provisioning of the established lightpaths in case of a change in
   the topology of a network. To study the effect of adopting GSLA, two
   Scenarios with different arrival rates of connections and four
   performance parameters such as average emission per lambda, average
   connection length, GSLA satisfaction and success rate are defined and
   analyzed over NSFnet. Results reveal that adopting the GSLA by routing
   mechanisms decreases the resource efficiency with both light and heavy
   traffic in return for less reduction in emission as compared to green
   and hybrid routing mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limited battery capacity of sensor nodes, a minimization of
   energy consumption is a potential research area in underwater wireless
   sensor networks (UWSNs). However, energy hole and coverage hole
   creations lead performance degradation of UWSNs in terms of network
   lifetime and throughput. In this paper, we address the energy hole
   creation issue in depth-based routing techniques, and devise a technique
   to overcome the deficiencies in existing techniques. Besides addressing
   the energy hole issue, the proposition of a coverage hole repair
   technique is also part of this paper. In areas of the dense deployment,
   sensing ranges of nodes redundantly overlap. Our proposed technique
   takes a benefit of redundant overlapping and repairs a coverage hole
   during network operation. Simulation results show that our two
   techniques cohesively conserve nodes' energy, which ultimately maximizes
   the network lifetime and throughput at the cost of increased delay.}},

Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. In
   addition to the high risk of fatality, fish harvesters are also at risk
   of a wide range of non-fatal injuries during their work at sea. Weather
   factors are an intrinsic part of fish harvesters' operating environment
   and they consider the most dangerous situations at sea to be associated
   with weather-related factors. This research aims to answer questions
   regarding the effects of extratropical cyclone weather conditions on the
   severity level of maritime incidents to provide more insight for fish
   harvesters and/or marine traffic decision makers such as the Canadian
   Coast Guard. To achieve these goals, weather and incident data in
   Atlantic Canadian waters were matched spatially and temporally then
   analyzed to explore their relationships. Logistic Regression was used to
   examine how weather factors affect the severity level of fishing vessel
   incidents. Ice concentration, wind speed, sea surface temperature, and
   darkness were the most significant environmental factors with respect to
   severity level of fishing incidents. When only incidents associated with
   cyclones were taken into consideration, Laplacian of pressure as an
   indicator of cyclone's intensity replaced ice concentration as a
   significant factor. Logistic Regression was also applied for individual
   fishery types, revealing that distinct fisheries can be affected by
   different weather factors. Improving our understanding of extreme events
   and revising safety related policies in commercial fishing is
   particularly important under climate change scenarios as fish
   harvesters' reliance on traditional weather patterns becomes
   increasingly questionable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The divergence and directivity of a laser with a periodic Yagi-Uda
   optical antenna array modulated surface are investigated by finite
   element method. The nanoparticle optical antenna arrays are optimized to
   achieve the high directivity and the small divergence by using of
   Helmholtz's reciprocity theorem. When the nanoparticle antenna replaced
   by a Yagi-Uda antenna with same size, the directivity and the
   signal-to-noise ratio of the modulated laser beam are notably enhanced.
   The main reason is that the directors of the Yagi-Uda antennas induce
   more energy to propagate towards the antenna transmitting direction. The
   results can provide valuable guidelines in designing collimated laser,
   which can be widely applied in the field of biologic detection, spatial

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted on a latent heat energy storage
   system (LHESS) consisting of a tank filled with phase change material
   (PCM), dodecanoic acid, coupled with a finned tube heat exchanger. The
   study included charging experiments under controlled experimental
   conditions with parametric alterations on the HTF flow rate and inlet
   temperature. Discharging experiments using municipal water looked at the
   discharge time and heat transfer rates based on an alteration of the HTF
   flow rate. The characterization of the LHESS showed that increasing the
   HTF inlet temperature during charging resulted in significantly faster
   melting time. A decrease of 3.5 hours was observed when increasing the
   HTF temperature from 60 to 70 degrees C, while another decrease of 2
   hours was observed with an increase from 70 to 80 degrees C. Increasing
   the HTF flow rate during charging from 0.7 to 1.5 L min(-1) did not have
   any significant effects on heat transfer rates, however an increase from
   1.5 to 2.5 L min(-1) resulted in higher heat transfer rates and
   decreased melting time by 1 hour. The increase of flow rate did not have
   a significant impact during the discharge process. Further work on the
   system is expected to encompass a real-time solar investigation of this
   tank. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The binary phase filters have been used to achieve an optical needle
   with small lateral size. Designing a binary phase filter is still a
   scientific challenge in such fields. In this paper, a hybrid genetic
   particle swarm optimization (HGPSO) algorithm is proposed to design the
   binary phase filter. The HGPSO algorithm includes self-adaptive
   parameters, recombination and mutation operations that originated from
   the genetic algorithm. Based on the benchmark test, the HGPSO algorithm
   has achieved global optimization and fast convergence. In an
   easy-to-perform optimizing procedure, the iteration number of HGPSO is
   decreased to about a quarter of the original particle swarm optimization
   process. A multi-zone binary phase filter is designed by using the
   HGPSO. The long depth of focus and high resolution are achieved
   simultaneously, where the depth of focus and focal spot transverse size
   are 6.05 lambda and 0.41 lambda, respectively. Therefore, the proposed
   HGPSO can be applied to the optimization of filter with multiple
   parameters. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Growth and structure of flocs following electrocoagulation}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{162-168}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{The growth and structure of iron precipitate flocs produced in salt
   water from a bench-scale electrocoagulation (EC) system was
   investigated. During floc growth, changes in the scattering exponent, an
   indicator of a flocs' degree of compaction, were reflected by changes in
   the particle size (diameter of a volume equivalent sphere). Flocs
   initially formed loose, open structures that spanned broad size ranges,
   suggesting low repulsion between particles. The initial aggregates then
   broke and reformed into more compact structures. Comparing plots of
   scattering exponent against time, it was found that operating at higher
   currents caused this process to occur more quickly; however, the plots
   were all similar in shape, suggesting that the structural progression of
   the EC flocs was not affected. The final floc structures had an average
   scattering exponent of 2.34 (standard deviation 0.02), which is
   consistent with literature for flocs produced from iron-based chemical
   coagulants despite differences in electrolyte ionic strength. Analysis
   via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggested that EC flocs also
   exhibited amorphous, fractal structures. Operating at higher currents
   (providing larger iron concentrations) resulted in larger flocs. The
   average steady-state floc sizes when operating at 0.087, 0.174, and
   0.261 A were 93, 147, and 191 mu m, respectively. Floc size
   distributions also reached steady-state more quickly due to the higher
   frequency of particle collisions. Using a stainless steel (SS) cathode
   rather than an aluminum one resulted in 15\% larger flocs (154 mu m and
   134 mu m, respectively). However, given that experimental conditions
   (mixing and current) were otherwise equivalent, more research is
   required to determine the cause of this difference. The results of this
   work were consistent with literature regarding chemical coagulation (CC)
   and may have implications for the design of downstream clarification
   processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Our daily electromagnetic environment is becoming increasingly complex
   with the rapid development of consumer electronics and wireless
   communication technologies, which in turn necessitates the development
   of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, especially for
   transparent components. We engineered a transparent EMI shielding film
   with crack-template based metallic mesh (CT-MM) that shows highly
   homogeneous light transmission and strong microwave shielding efficacy.
   The CT-MM film is fabricated using a cost-effective lift-off method
   based on a crackle template. It achieves a shielding effectiveness of
   similar to 26 dB, optical transmittance of similar to 91\% and
   negligible impact on optical imaging performance. Moreover, high-quality
   CT-MM film is demonstrated on a large-calibre spherical surface. These
   excellent properties of CT-MM film, together with its advantages of
   facile large-area fabrication and scalability in processing on
   multi-shaped substrates, make CT-MM a powerful technology for
   transparent EMI shielding in practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Demand Side Management (DSM) through optimization of home energy
   consumption in the smart grid environment is now one of the well-known

   scheduling options and enhanced load categorization in a smart grid
   environment. The CHEMA model consists of six layers and has been modeled
   in Simulink with an embedded MATLAB code. A single Knapsack optimization
   technique is used for scheduling and four different cases of cost
   reduction are modeled at the second layer of CHEMA. Fault identification
   and electricity theft control have also been added in CHEMA.
   Furthermore, carbon footprint calculations have been incorporated in
   order to make the users aware of environmental concerns. Simulation
   results prove the effectiveness of the proposed model.}},

Title = {{Forensic assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at the former

   techniques}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{212}},

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were assessed spatially and
   temporally within and adjacent to a former coking and steel
   manufacturing facility in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada. Concentrations of
   PAHs were measured in surface soils, marine and estuary sediments prior
   to and during remediation of the Sydney Tar Ponds (STPs) site which was
   contaminated by nearly a century of coking and steel production.
   Previous studies identified PAHs in surficial marine sediments within
   Sydney Harbour, which were considered to be derived from STP discharges.
   Numerous PAH fingerprint techniques (diagnostic ratios, principal
   component analysis, quantitative and qualitative analysis) were applied
   to soil and sediment samples from the STPs and surrounding area to
   identify common source apportionment of PAHs. Results indicate coal
   combustion (from historical residential, commercial and industrial uses)
   and coal handling (from historic on-site stockpiling and current coal
   transfer and shipment facilities) are likely the principal source of
   PAHs found in urban soils and marine sediments, consistent with current
   and historical activities near these sites. However, PAH fingerprints
   associated with STP sediments correlated poorly with those of urban
   soils and marine sediments, but were similar to coal tar, historically
   consistent with by-products produced by the former coking operations.
   This study suggests PAH contamination of Sydney Harbour sediments and
   urban soils is largely unrelated to historic coking operations or recent
   remediation of the STPs site, but rather a legacy of extensive use of
   coal for a variety of activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aims: Electromechanical de-coupling is hypothesized to explain
   non-response of dyssynchrony patient to cardiac resynchronization
   therapy (CRT). In this pilot study, we investigated regional
   electromechanical uncoupling in 10 patients referred for CRT using two
   non-invasive electrical and mechanical imaging techniques (CMR tissue
   tracking and ECGI).
   Methods and results: Reconstructed regional electrical and mechanical
   activation captured delayed LBBB propagation direction from septal to
   anterior/inferior and finally to lateral walls as well as from LV apical
   to basal. All 5 responders demonstrated significantly delayed mechanical
   and electrical activation on the lateral LV wall at baseline compared to
   the non-responders (P<.05). On follow-up ECGI, baseline electrical
   activation patterns were preserved in native rhythm and global LV
   activation time was reduced with biventricular pacing.
   Conclusions: The combination of novel imaging techniques of ECGI and CMR
   tissue tracking can be used to assess spatial concordance of LV
   electrical and mechanical activation to gain insight into
   electromechanical coupling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is associated with respiratory symptoms that are reported to
   improve with weight loss, but this is poorly reflected in spirometry,
   and few studies have measured respiratory mechanics with oscillometry.
   We investigated whether early changes in lung mechanics following weight
   loss are detectable with oscillometry. Furthermore, we investigated
   whether the changes in lung mechanics measured in the supine position
   following weight loss are associated with changes in sleep quality.
   Nineteen severely obese female subjects (mean body mass index, 47.2 +/-
   6.6 kg/m(2)) were evaluated using spirometry, oscillometry,
   plethysmography, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and 5
   weeks after bariatric surgery. These tests were conducted in both the
   upright and the supine position, and pre- and postbronchodilation with
   200 mu g of salbutamol. Five weeks after surgery, weight loss of 11.5
   +/- 2.5 kg was not associated with changes in spirometry and
   plethysmography, with the exception of functional residual capacity.
   There were also no changes in upright respiratory system resistance
   (Rrs) or reactance following weight loss. Importantly, however, in the
   supine position, weight loss caused a substantial reduction in Rrs. In
   addition, sleep quality improved significantly and was highly correlated
   with the reduction in supine Rrs. Prior to weight loss, subjects did not
   respond to the bronchodilator when assessed in the upright position with
   either spirometry or oscillometry; however, with modest weight loss,
   bronchodilator responsiveness returned to the normal range. Improvements
   in lung mechanics occur very early after weight loss, mostly in the
   supine position, resulting in improved sleep quality. These improvements
   are detectable with oscillometry but not with spirometry.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the economics of microalgae production for the recovery of
   microbial oil requires a comprehensive exploration of the measures
   needed to improve productivity as well as to reduce the overall
   processing costs. One avenue for cost reduction involves recycling the
   effluent waste water remaining after lipid extraction. This study
   investigates the feasibility of recycling those wastes for growing
   thraustochytrid biomass, a heterotrophic microalgae, where wastes were
   generated from the enzymatic extraction of the lipids from the cell
   biomass. It was demonstrated that secondary cultures of the tested
   thraustochytrid grown in the recycled wastes performed favorably in
   terms of cell and oil production (20.48 g cells L-1 and 40.9 \% (w/w)
   lipid) compared to the control (13.63 g cells L-1 and 56.8 \% (w/w)
   lipid). Further, the significant uptake of solubilized cell material (in
   the form of amino acids) demonstrated that the recycled waste has the
   potential for offsetting the need for fresh medium components. These
   results indicate that the implementation of a nutrient recycling
   strategy for industrial microalgae production could be possible, with
   significant added benefits such as conserving water resources, improving
   production efficiency, and decreasing material inputs.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of barefoot running
   on initial loading rate (LR), lower extremity joint kinematics and
   kinetics, and neuromuscular control in habitually shod runners with an
   emphasis on the individual response to this unfamiliar condition.
   Kinematics and ground reaction force data were collected from 51
   habitually shod runners during overground running in a barefoot and shod
   condition. Joint kinetics and stiffness were calculated with inverse
   dynamics. Inter-individual initial LR variability was explored by
   separating individuals by a barefoot/shod ratio to determine acute
   responders/non-responders.
   Mean initial LR was 54.1\% greater in the barefoot when compared to the
   shod condition. Differences between acute responders/non-responders were
   found at peak and initial contact sagittal ankle angle and at initial
   ground contact. Correlations were found between barefoot sagittal ankle
   angle at initial ground contact and barefoot initial LR.
   A large variability in biomechanical responses to an acute exposure to
   barefoot running was found. A large intra-individual variability was
   found in initial LR but not ankle plantar-dorsiflexion between footwear
   conditions. A majority of habitually shod runners do not exhibit
   previously reported benefits in terms of reduced initial LRs when
   barefoot. Lastly, runners who increased LR when barefoot reduced LRs
   when wearing shoes to levels similar seen in habitually barefoot runners
   who do adopt a forefoot-landing pattern, despite increased dorsiflexion.

Abstract = {{This paper studies the flexural performance of sandwich panels composed
   of a soft polyurethane foam core and glass-fiber-reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) skins. A robust numerical model is developed to predict the full
   load-deflection and strain responses of the panel. It is based on
   equilibrium and strain compatibility and accounts for the excessive
   shear deformation and material nonlinearity of the core. It also
   accounts for geometric nonlinearity in the form of localized deflection
   of the loaded skin using the principals of beam-on-elastic foundation
   and the change in core thickness due to its softness. The model
   incorporates various failure criteria, namely core shear failure, core
   flexural tension or compression failure, compression skin crushing or
   wrinkling, or tensile rupture of skin. The model has the advantage of
   being able to isolate quantitatively the individual contributions of
   flexure, shear, and localized skin deformations, to overall deflection.
   A parametric study is performed to examine the effects of core density
   and skin thickness on panel behavior. It is shown that as the core
   density increases from 32 to 192kg/m3, the contribution of shear to
   overall deflection reduces from about 90 to 10\%. It also appears that
   the optimal core density of the sandwich panels is within 96 to
   128kg/m3, which represents the lowest density necessary to achieve the
   highest ultimate strength and stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{A host of research opportunities with innumerable clinical applications
   are open to biomedical glasses if one considers their potential as
   therapeutic inorganic ion delivery systems. Generally, applications have
   been limited to repair and regeneration of hard tissues while
   compositions are largely constrained to the original bioactive glass
   developed in the 1960s. However, in oncology applications the
   therapeutic paradigm shifts from repair to targeted destruction. With
   this in mind, the composition-structure-property-function relationships
   of vanadium-containing zinc-silicate glasses
   (0.51SiO(2)-0.29Na(2)O-(0.20-X)ZnO-XV2O5, 0X0.09) were characterized in
   order to determine their potential as therapeutic inorganic ion delivery
   systems. Increased V2O5 mole fraction resulted in a linear decrease in
   density and glass transition temperature (T-g). Si-29 MAS NMR peak
   maxima shifted upfield while V-51 MAS NMR peak maxima were independent
   of V2O5 content and overlapped well with the spectra NaVO3. Increased
   V2O5 mole fraction caused ion release to increase. When human liver
   cancer cells, HepG2, were exposed to these ions they demonstrated a
   concentration-dependent cytotoxic response, mediated by apoptosis. This
   work demonstrates that the zinc-silicate system studied herein is
   capable of delivering therapeutic inorganic ions at concentrations that
   induce apoptotic cell death and provide a simple means to control
   therapeutic inorganic ion delivery.}},

Title = {{Genes involved in Listeria monocytogenes biofilm formation at a
   simulated food processing plant temperature of 15 degrees C}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{63-74}},

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic foodborne bacterium whose
   persistence in food processing environments is in part attributed to its
   biofilm formation. Most biofilm studies have been carried out at 30-37
   degrees C rather than at temperatures found in the food processing
   plants (i.e., 10-20 degrees C). The objective of the present study was
   to mine for novel genes that contribute to L. monocytogenes biofilm
   formation at 15 degrees C using the random insertional mutagenesis
   approach. A library of 11,024 L monocytogenes 568 (serotype 1/2a) Himarl
   insertional mutants was created. Mutants with reduced or enhanced
   biofilm formation at 15 degrees C were detected in microtiter plate
   assays with crystal violet and safranin staining. Fourteen mutants
   expressed enhanced biofilm phenotypes, and harbored transposon
   insertions in genes encoding cell wall biosynthesis, motility,
   metabolism, stress response, and cell surface associated proteins.
   Deficient mutants (n = 5) contained interruptions in genes related to
   peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, or lipoproteins. Enhanced mutants produced
   significantly (p < 0.05) higher cell densities in biofilm formed on
   stainless steel (SS) coupons at 15 degrees C (48 h) than deficient
   mutants, which were also more sensitive to benzalkonium chloride. All
   biofilm deficient mutants and four enhanced mutants in the microtiter
   plate assay (fIaA, cheR, lmo2563 and lmo2488) formed no biofilm in a peg
   lid assay (Calgary biofilm device) while insertions in lmo1224 and
   lmo0543 led to excess biofilm in all assays. Two enhanced biofilm
   formers were more resistant to enzymatic removal with DNase, proteinase
   K or pectinase than the parent strain. Scanning electron microscopy of
   individual biofilms made by five mutants and the parent on SS surfaces
   showed formation of heterogeneous biofilm with dense zones by immotile
   mutants, while deficient mutants exhibited sparse growth. In conclusion,
   interruptions of 9 genes not previously linked to biofilm formation in L
   monocytogenes (lmo2572, lmo2488 (uvrA), lmo1224, lmo0434 (inlB), lmo0263
   (inlH), lmo0543, lmo0057 (EsaA), lmo2563, lmo0453), caused enhanced
   biofilm formation in the bacterium at 15 degrees C The remaining mutants
   harbored interruptions in 10 genetic loci previously associated with
   biofilm formation at higher temperatures, indicating some temperature
   driven differences in the formation of biofilm by L monocytogenes. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a thorough characterization of the thermal properties and
   thermal reliability of the eutectic mixture of decanoic acid with
   tetradecanoic acid, as a phase change material (PCM) of potential
   interest for passive temperature control in buildings. From the
   temperature-composition binary phase diagram we found that the eutectic
   composition is 0.82 +/- 0.02 mole fraction (78 +/- 2 mass\%) decanoic
   acid. We thoroughly characterized the thermal properties of the eutectic
   mixture. The eutectic composition has a high latent heat of fusion Delta
   H-fus = 153 +/- 15 J g(-1) and a melting temperature T-onset = 20.5 +/-
   1.5 degrees C. The heat capacity measured as a function of temperature
   for the solid and liquid phases just below and above the melting point
   is 1.9 and 2.1 +/- 0.2 J K-1 g(-1), respectively. The average value of
   the thermal conductivity of the solid phase measured between -33 and 9
   degrees C is kappa(s) = 0.20 +/- 0.02 W m(-1) K-1 and for the liquid
   phase, the thermal conductivity is kappa(l) = 0.23 +/- 0.03 W m(-1) K-1
   for 28 and 38 degrees C. The mixture has a good long-term thermal
   stability as indicated by negligible changes in Delta H-fus and T-onset
   after 3000 melt-freeze cycles. The parameters determined in this work
   allow more accurate modeling and optimization of the behavior of the
   eutectic mixture in preparation for implementation as a thermal energy
   storage PCM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Binary gratings with high or low metal filling ratios in a grating
   region have been demonstrated as successful candidates in enhancing the
   emittance of emitters for thermophotovoltaics since they could support
   surface plasmons (SPs), the Rayleigh-Wood anomaly (RWA), or cavity
   resonance (CR) within their geometries. This work shows that combining a
   tungsten binary grating with a low and high filling ratio to form a
   pyramid grating can significantly increase the emittance, which is
   nearly perfect in the wavelength region from 0.6 to 1.72 mu m, while
   being 0.1 at wavelengths longer than 2.5 mu m. Moreover, the emittance
   spectrum of the hybrid tungsten grating is insensitive to the angle of
   incidence. The enhancement demonstrated by magnetic field and Poynting
   vector patterns is due to the interplay between SPs and RWA modes at
   short wavelengths, and CR at long wavelengths. Furthermore, a combined
   grating made of nickel is also proposed providing enhanced emittance in
   a wide angle of incidence.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates, both experimentally and computationally,
   influence of the stacking sequence on the low-velocity impact response
   of a new fiber metal laminated (FML) concept, formed with magnesium
   alloy sheets and a new class of true 3D fiberglass fabric (3DFGF). Two
   different thicknesses of the 3DFGF and four different configurations of
   FMLs are considered. In particular, the stiffness, strength, energy
   absorption and failure modes of these configurations of FMLs against
   impact are compared. To make the comparison unbiased, the impact
   capacities of FMLs are normalized with respect to their weight and cost,
   which are the two significant parameters that govern the selection of
   design of mechanical systems. In addition to the experiments, a
   finite-element model is constructed using the commercial finite-element
   code ABAQUS/Explicit, in conjunction with its VUMAT facility, to analyze
   the impact response of the FMLs. Good agreements between the
   experimental and computational results are obtained, demonstrating that
   the model can be used to predict the response of such FMLs and further
   optimize the configuration and response of such sophisticated systems.

Title = {{Hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance imaging ventilation defects in
   asthma: relationship to airway mechanics}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In patients with asthma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
   direct measurements of regional ventilation heterogeneity, the etiology
   of which is not well-understood, nor is the relationship of ventilation
   abnormalities with lung mechanics. In addition, respiratory resistance
   and reactance are often abnormal in asthmatics and the frequency
   dependence of respiratory resistance is thought to reflect ventilation
   heterogeneity. We acquired MRI ventilation defect maps, forced
   expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1), and airways resistance (Raw)
   measurements, and used a computational airway model to explore the
   relationship of ventilation defect percent (VDP) with simulated
   measurements of respiratory system resistance (R-rs) and reactance
   (X-rs). MRI ventilation defect maps were experimentally acquired in 25
   asthmatics before, during, and after methacholine challenge and these
   were nonrigidly coregistered to the airway tree model. Using the model
   coregistered to ventilation defect maps, we narrowed proximal (9th) and
   distal (14th) generation airways that were spatially related to the MRI
   ventilation defects. The relationships for VDP with Raw measured using
   plethysmography (r = 0.79), and model predictions of R-rs>14 (r = 0.91,
   P < 0.0001) and R-rs>9 (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001) were significantly
   stronger (P = 0.005; P = 0.03, respectively) than with FEV1 (r = -0.68,
   P = 0.0001). The slopes for the relationship of VDP with simulated lung
   mechanics measurements were different (P < 0.0001); among these, the
   slope for the VDP-X-rs0.2 relationship was largest, suggesting that VDP
   was dominated by peripheral airway heterogeneity in these patients. In
   conclusion, as a first step toward understanding potential links between
   lung mechanics and ventilation defects, impedance predictions were made
   using a computational airway tree model with simulated constriction of
   airways related to ventilation defects measured in mild-moderate
   asthmatics.}},

Abstract = {{Dramatic multiyear fluctuations in water temperature and seasonal sea
   ice extent and duration across the Bering-Chukchi continental shelf have
   occurred in this century, raising a pressing ecological question: Do
   such environmental changes alter marine production processes linking
   primary producers to upper trophic-level predators? We examined this
   question by comparing the blubber fatty acid (FA) composition and stable
   carbon isotope ratios of individual FA (delta C-13(FA)) of adult ringed
   seals (Pusa hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), spotted seals
   (Phoca largha), and ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata), collectively
   known as ``ice seals,{''} sampled during an anomalously warm, low sea
   ice period in 2002-2005 in the Bering Sea and a subsequent cold, high
   sea ice period in 2007-2010. delta C-13(FA) values, used to estimate the
   contribution to seals of carbon derived from sea ice algae (sympagic
   production) relative to that derived from water column phytoplankton
   (pelagic production), indicated that during the cold period, sympagic
   production accounted for 62-80\% of the FA in the blubber of bearded
   seals, 51-62\% in spotted seals, and 21-60\% in ringed seals. Moreover,
   the delta C-13(FA) values of bearded seals indicated a greater
   incorporation of sympagic FAs during the cold period than the warm
   period. This result provides the first empirical evidence of an
   ecosystem-scale effect of a putative change in sympagic production in
   the Western Arctic. The FA composition of ice seals showed clear
   evidence of resource partitioning among ringed, bearded, and spotted
   seals, and little niche separation between spotted and ribbon seals,
   which is consistent with previous studies. Despite interannual
   variability, the FA composition of ringed and bearded seals showed
   little evidence of differences in diet between the warm and cold
   periods. The findings that sympagic production contributes significantly
   to food webs supporting ice seals, and that the contribution apparently
   is less in warm years with low sea ice, raise an important concern: Will
   the projected warming and continuing loss of seasonal sea ice in the
   Arctic, and the associated decline of organic matter input from sympagic
   production, be compensated for by pelagic production to satisfy both
   pelagic and benthic carbon and energy needs?}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, H-1 NMR has been used to study epoxides in lipid
   oxidation and industrial processes, but the peak assignments reported
   for monoepoxides and diepoxides have been inconsistent. Lack of clear
   assignments for chemical shifts of epoxides derived from polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (PUFA) has also limited the use of H-1 NMR in detecting and
   quantifying these products during both oxidative degradation and
   industrial epoxidation. In this study, H-1 NMR was used to characterize
   the epoxides synthesized from trilinolein, trilinolenin, canola oil, and
   fish oils by reaction with formic acid and hydrogen peroxide.
   Assignments for epoxides derived from PUFA in canola oil and fish oil
   were between 2.90-3.23 ppm and 2.90-3.28 ppm, distinct from other
   chemical groups in these oils. Chemical shifts of epoxy groups moved
   downfield with an increasing number of epoxy groups in the fatty acid
   chain. Hence, peaks for diepoxides appeared at 3.00, 3.09, and 3.14 ppm
   and for triepoxides at 3.00, 3.16, and 3.21 ppm. Results also suggested
   that stereoisomers of diepoxides and triepoxides were formed during the
   epoxidation process under the conditions of this study. These new
   assignments for di- and tri-epoxide stereoisomers were supported by
   GC-MS analysis of their methyl esters, H-H COSY experiments, and a
   re-evaluation of several previous epoxide-related studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the profound
   impact germanium has on the setting reaction of zinc silicate glass
   ionomer cements (GICs).
   Methods. Five <45 mu m glass powder compositions (0.48-xSiO(2), xGeO(2),
   0.36 ZnO, 0.16 CaO; where x = 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.48 mol. fraction) were
   synthesized. Glass degradation was assessed under simulated setting
   conditions using acetic acid from 0.5 to 60 min, monitoring the
   concentrations of ions released using ICP-OES. Subsequently, GICs were
   prepared by mixing fresh glass powders with polyacrylic acid (PAA, Mw =
   12,500 g/mol, 50 wt\% aq. solution) at a 1:0.75 ratio. Cement structure
   and properties were evaluated using ATR-FTIR and rheology (for 60 min),
   as well as 24 h biaxial flexural strength.
   Results. Reduced Si:Ge ratios yielded faster degrading glasses, yet
   contrary to expectation, the corresponding ATR-FTIR spectra indicated
   slower crosslinking within the GIC matrix. Rheology testing found the
   initial viscosity cement pastes reduced with decreased Si:Ge, and Ge
   containing cements all set significantly slower than the Si based GIC.
   Interestingly, biaxial flexural strength remained consistent regardless
   of setting behavior.
   Significance. This counter-intuitive combination of behaviors is
   attributed to the presence of a chemical complex species specific to
   Ge-containing glasses that delays, but does not hinder, the formation of
   the GIC matrix. These findings embody chemical complex species as a
   mechanism to decouple glass reactivity from cement setting rate, a
   mechanism with the potential to enhance the utility of GICs in both
   dental and orthopaedic applications. (C) 2016 Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic power transfer using piezoelectric devices is a promising
   wireless power transfer technology for biomedical implants. However, for
   sub-dermal implants where the separation between the transmitter and
   receiver is on the order of several acoustic wavelengths, the ultrasonic
   power transfer efficiency (PTE) is highly sensitive to the distance
   between the transmitter and receiver. This sensitivity can cause large
   swings in efficiency and presents a serious limitation on battery life
   and overall performance. A practical ultrasonic transcutaneous energy
   transfer (UTET) system design must accommodate different implant depths
   and unpredictable acoustic changes caused by tissue growth, hydration,
   ambient temperature, and movement. This paper describes a method used to
   compensate for acoustic separation distance by varying the transmit (Tx)
   frequency in a UTET system. In a benchtop UTET system we experimentally
   show that without compensation, power transfer efficiency can range from
   9\% to 25\% as a 5 mm porcine tissue sample is manipulated to simulate
   in situ implant conditions. Using an active frequency compensation
   method, we show that the power transfer efficiency can be kept uniformly
   high, ranging from 20\% to 27\%. The frequency compensation strategy we
   propose is low-power, non-invasive, and uses only transmit-side
   measurements, making it suitable for active implanted medical device
   applications.}},

   significantly enhance glucose uptake in L6 skeletal muscle cells grown
   in culture. The maximum enhancement of glucose uptake (40\%) was
   demonstrated in cells treated with the FFC fraction at 1 ng/mL without

Abstract = {{Wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) fields in the north east
   Canada are naturally grown in a course textured thin layer of soil and
   below this layer is a soilless layer of gravel. The root zone depth of
   this crop varies from 10 to 15 cm. Investigating the depth to the gravel
   layer below the course textured soil is advantageous, as it affects the
   water holding capacity of the root zone. Water and nutrient management
   are the two primary determinants of crop yield and the amount of
   leaching. The objective of this study was to estimate the depth to the
   gravel layer using DualEM-2 instrument. A C++ program written in Visual
   Studio 2010 was used to develop mathematical models for estimating the
   depth to the gravel layer from the outputs of DualEM-2 sensor. Two wild
   blueberry fields were selected in central Nova Scotia, Canada to
   evaluate the performance of DualEM-2 instrument in estimating the
   rootzone depth above the gravel layer. The mid points of squares created
   by grid lines were used as the sampling points at each experimental
   site. The actual depth to the interface was measured manually at
   selected grid points (n = 50). The apparent ground conductivity (ECa)
   values of DualEM-2 were recorded and the depth to the interface was
   estimated for the same sampling points within the selected fields. The
   fruit yield samples were also collected from the same grid points to
   identify the impact of the depth to the gravel layer on crop yield.
   After calibrations, comprehensive surveys were conducted and the actual
   and estimated depths to the interface were established. The interpolated
   maps of fruit yield, and the actual (z(in)) and estimated () depths to
   the interface were created in ArcGIS 10 software. Results indicated that
   the z(in) was significantly correlated with for the North River (R (2) =
   0.73; RMSE = 0.27 m) and the Carmel (R (2) = 0.45; RMSE = 0.20 m) sites.
   Results revealed that the areas with shallow depth to the gravel layer
   were low yielding, indicating that the variation in the depth to the
   gravel layer can have an impact on crop productivity. Non-destructive
   estimations of the depth to the gravel layer can be used to develop
   erosion control strategies, which will result in an increased crop
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Pipelines are the most flexible, economic, and convenient way for oil
   and gas transportation. Material degradation by slurry erosion is a
   common feature in oil transmission pipeline. In the present work, slurry
   erosion of AISI 1018, AISI 1080, API X42, and API X70 steels is
   investigated in terms of slurry velocity and target material
   microstructure. The slurry velocity and impact angle employed were 0.2,
   0.29, 0.36, and 0.43m s(-1) and 90 deg, respectively. It is found that
   erosion rate increases with increasing slurry velocity. Scanning
   electron microscopy was employed to investigate the eroded surface and
   subsurface of the steels. Plastic deformation, microcutting, and
   fracture are identified as dominant erosion mechanisms. Pearlitic
   microstructure exhibits superior erosion resistance compared to ferrite
   depending upon slurry velocity and microstructural orientation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to develop a powder metallurgy (PM)
   counterpart to the wrought aluminum alloy 2618 utilizing
   press-and-sinter technology. Each starting blend was prepared from a
   strategic combination of prealloyed aluminum coupled with elemental and
   master alloy additions and was processed through uni-axial die
   compaction coupled with controlled atmosphere sintering. All of the PM
   alloys responded well to sintering with near full theoretical density
   realized. The most desirable PM product contained minor additions of tin
   and silicon. Whereas tin imparted enhanced densification, silicon
   promoted appreciable gains in hardness and tensile properties. It was
   also determined that the beneficial effects of silicon persevered after
   prolonged thermal exposure at 260 degrees C provided that a nominal
   concentration of 0.2 wt\% was maintained. The final press-and-sinter PM
   product offered mechanical properties and thermal stability that were
   comparable to the wrought target. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Glass ionomer cements have been discussed across broad and progressive
   applications from dentistry to orthopedics. However, in orthopedic
   applications, adverse patient outcomes that have been clinically linked

   demonstrate a critical need for the development of new aluminum-free
   materials. Accordingly, the present study uses an Ames Screen to
   evaluate the preliminary genotoxicity profiles of a series of promising
   new germanium-containing, aluminum-free GICs. The results herein reveal
   that in addition to the already demonstrated superior handling
   characteristics and suitable mechanical strength, these cements are
   non-mutagenic to bacteria strains Salmonella typhimurium (TA98) and
   Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA). The results of this study provide strong
   positive evidence regarding the genotoxicity of these novel GICs,
   warranting further investigation into the biocompatibility of these
   materials for numerous in vivo applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Variations in mechanical properties (stiffness and hardness) were
   measured as a function of case depth in ion-exchange glasses using
   nanoindentation. A simple silicate composition, 30Li(2)O-70Si(2)O, was
   exchanged (Li+ <-> K+) at several different temperatures, below and
   above the glass transition, to evaluate the effect of exchange
   temperature on mechanical properties throughout the ion-exchange layer.
   Significant enhancements in Young's modulus and hardness were found near
   the edge in ion-exchanged glasses and attributed to compressive stress
   and the mixed-alkali effect. Indent size effect-like behaviors were
   observed in the untreated and ion-exchange samples alike near the sample
   edge; this was explained by surface-condition sensitivity and
   compressive stress found within this region. The elastic recovery and
   resistance to plastic deformation were calculated to assess the effect
   of ion exchange on elastic and plastic mechanical responses.
   Microhardness measurements of the exchanged samples were also made for

Abstract = {{TiC-based cermets are heavily utilised in applications demanding good
   resistance to both wear and corrosion. In the current work,
   TiC-stainless steel (grade 316L) cermets have been developed, with the
   TiC grain size varied through heat-treatment, for steel binder contents
   between 10 and 30 vol\%. Micro structural analysis showed mean TiC grain
   sizes of 4 and 10 pm, respectively, for fine- and coarse grained
   cermets, with the grain size nominally consistent as a function of
   binder content. Sliding wear resistance was assessed in a reciprocating
   motion, using a WC-Co counter face sphere paired against the TiC
   cermets. Overall, the fine-grained cermets exhibit better wear
   resistance and hardness. The specific wear rate was seen to increase
   with applied load and/or binder content, for both fine- and
   coarse-grained materials. SEM and FIB microscopy were used to assess the
   microstructural changes occurring during wear. A two- to three-body
   abrasive wear transition was apparent, together with the formation of a
   surface tribolayer, which highlights a further evolution to an adhesive
   wear mechanism. The tribolayer showed incorporation of a high
   concentration of O, which increased with the applied load, together with
   a predominance of the binder constituents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   directly with Sc concentration but varied inversely with SPS temperature
   owing to in-situ aging of the raw powders. Hardness losses could be
   recovered through a post-SPS heat treatment into the T6 condition.
   Industrially processed slugs of Al-0.4Sc-T6 exhibited full densification

Pages = {{671-681}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductance of an interface, between aluminum surfaces, was
   measured at pressures ranging from 0.172 to 2.76 MPa. The conductance
   was measured for a bare interface as well as with several commercial
   thermal interface materials (TIMs) applied. A steady state TIM
   characterization device was developed in house. A total of six different
   TIMs were tested using this device: Tgrease 880, Tflex 720, Tmate 2905c,
   Tpcm HP105, Cho-Therm 1671, and Cho Therm T500. The characterized TIMs
   showed a very strong dependence on clamping pressure. The conductance of
   samples at 2.76 MPa were shown to be between 135\% and 515\% greater
   than the conductance at 0.172 MPa. Many of the samples showed a near
   linear increase in conductance while others leveled off at higher
   pressures. The steady state characterization device was found to have
   high experimental uncertainty when characterizing high conductance TIM
   samples (specifically Tgrease 880). It was determined that this
   uncertainty was mainly the result of inadequate cooling. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, we analyse incremental cooperative communication for
   wireless body area networks (WBANs) with different numbers of relays.
   Energy efficiency (EE) and the packet error rate (PER) are investigated
   for different schemes. We propose a new cooperative communication scheme
   with three-stage relaying and compare it to existing schemes. Our
   proposed scheme provides reliable communication with less PER at the
   cost of surplus energy consumption. Analytical expressions for the EE of
   the proposed three-stage cooperative communication scheme are also
   derived, taking into account the effect of PER. Later on, the proposed
   three-stage incremental cooperation is implemented in a network layer
   protocol; enhanced incremental cooperative critical data transmission in
   emergencies for static WBANs (EInCo-CEStat). Extensive simulations are
   conducted to validate the proposed scheme. Results of incremental
   relay-based cooperative communication protocols are compared to two
   existing cooperative routing protocols: cooperative critical data
   transmission in emergencies for static WBANs (Co-CEStat) and
   InCo-CEStat. It is observed from the simulation results that incremental
   relay-based cooperation is more energy efficient than the existing
   conventional cooperation protocol, Co-CEStat. The results also reveal
   that EInCo-CEStat proves to be more reliable with less PER and higher
   throughput than both of the counterpart protocols. However, InCo-CEStat
   has less throughput with a greater stability period and network
   lifetime. Due to the availability of more redundant links, EInCo-CEStat
   achieves a reduced packet drop rate at the cost of increased energy
   consumption.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a Realistic Scheduling Mechanism (RSM) to
   reduce user frustration and enhance appliance utility by classifying
   appliances with respective constraints and their time of use
   effectively. Algorithms are proposed regarding functioning of home
   appliances. A 24 hour time slot is divided into four logical sub-time
   slots, each composed of 360 min or 6 h. In these sub-time slots, only
   desired appliances (with respect to appliance classification) are
   scheduled to raise appliance utility, restricting power consumption by a
   dynamically modelled power usage limiter that does not only take the
   electricity consumer into account but also the electricity supplier.
   Once appliance, time and power usage limiter modelling is done, we use a
   nature-inspired heuristic algorithm, Binary Particle Swarm Optimization
   (BPSO), optimally to form schedules with given constraints representing
   each sub-time slot. These schedules tend to achieve an equilibrium
   amongst appliance utility and cost effectiveness. For validation of the
   proposed RSM, we provide a comparative analysis amongst unscheduled
   electrical load usage, scheduled directly by BPSO and RSM, reflecting
   user comfort, which is based upon cost effectiveness and appliance
   utility.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model was developed to
   simulate the welding process of extruded and non-extruded aluminum
   tee-bar stiffened plates joined together by friction stir welding (FSW),
   metal inert gas (MIG) butt and MIG fillet welding. The three-dimensional
   residual stress and distortion fields as well as the heat affected zones
   (HAZ) for all three welding methods were obtained and compared. The
   load-shortening curves for stiffened plates and the ultimate moment
   capacity of a hull girder made up of the stiffened plates were analyzed.
   The results showed that MIG welding resulted in tensile and compressive
   residual stress of as much as 88\% and 30\% of the material yield
   strength, and a considerable level of distortion while residual stresses
   and distortions formed in the friction stir welding model were
   negligible. The load-shortening responses showed that extruded stiffened
   plates joined by FSW attained a 26\% higher buckling load than the
   non-extruded stiffened plates joined by MIG fillet welding, which in
   turn resulted in a 28\% higher ultimate moment capacity of the hull
   girder fabricated using FSW on extruded elements. The results also
   indicated that the presence of the residual stress and HAZ had the most
   significant effect on hull girders fabricated by MIG fillet welding on
   non-extruded plates where respective reductions of 10.5\% and 7.5\% in
   the ultimate moment capacity of the hull girders as a result of residual
   stresses and HAZ were observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A radiopaque temporary liquid embolic agent was synthesized from
   polyphosphate (PP) coacervates and optimized using a design of

   (0-15 mol\%), barium substitution (0-15 mol\%), PP concentration and
   degree of polymerization of the polyphosphate (D-p). The viscosity,
   radiopacity and cell viability of the resulting coacervates were
   measured for 60 formulations and response surface modeling was used to
   determine the optimum coacervate that maximized radiopacity and cell
   viability. The optimum coacervate made from PP with a large D-p (9.5 g
   NaPP/100 mL, 2.2 mol\% Sr, 9 mol\% Ba and 3.8 mol\% Ca) was taken
   forward to a pilot animal trial. In this rabbit model, PP embolic agent
   successfully occluded the central auricular artery with promising
   biocompatibility. Further study is required to optimize the cohesiveness

   agent.
   Statement of significance
   This article describes the development of a new radiopaque temporary
   liquid embolic agent from the optimization using design of experiments
   to a pilot animal study. Embolization is a minimally invasive
   interventional radiology procedure used to block blood flow in a
   targeted blood vessel. This procedure is used to treat many conditions
   including: tumors, aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Currently,
   no inherent radiopaque embolic agents are available in the clinic, which
   would allow for direct imaging of the material during the procedure and

Title = {{Individual Responses to a Barefoot Running Program: Insight Into Risk of
   Injury}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{777-784}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Barefoot running is of popular interest because of its
   alleged benefits for runners, including reduced injury risk and
   increased economy of running. There is a dearth in understanding whether
   all runners can gain the proposed benefits of barefoot running and how
   barefoot running may affect long-term injury risk.
   Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine whether
   runners can achieve the proposed favorable kinematic changes and
   reduction in loading rate after a progressive training program that
   included barefoot running. It was hypothesized that not all individuals
   would experience a decrease in initial loading rate facilitated by
   increased ankle plantar flexion after a progressive barefoot running
   program; it was further hypothesized that relationships exist between
   changes in initial loading rate and sagittal ankle angle.
   Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study.
   Methods: A total of 26 habitually shod runners completed an 8-week,
   progressively introduced barefoot running program. Pre- and
   postintervention barefoot and shod kinematics, electromyography, and
   ground-reaction force data of the lower limb were collected. Ankle and
   knee kinematics and kinetics, initial loading rates, spatiotemporal
   variables, muscle activity during preactivation, and ground contact were
   assessed in both conditions before and after the intervention.
   Individual responses were analyzed by separating runners into
   nonresponders, negative responders, and positive responders based on no
   change, increase, and decrease in barefoot initial loading rate,
   respectively.
   Results: No biomechanical changes were found in the group after the
   intervention. However, condition differences did persist during both
   preactivation and ground contact. The positive-responder group had
   greater plantar flexion, increased biceps femoris and gluteus medius
   preactivation, and decreased rectus femoris muscle activity between
   testing periods. The negative responders landed in greater barefoot
   dorsiflexion after the intervention, and the nonresponders did not
   change. An overall change in ankle flexion angle was associated with a
   change in initial loading rate (r(2) = 0.345, P = .002) in the barefoot
   but not shod condition.
   Conclusion: Eight weeks of progressive barefoot running did not change
   overall group biomechanics, but subgroups of responders (25\% of the
   entire group) were identified who had specific changes that reduced the
   initial loading rate. It appears that changes in initial loading rate
   are explained by changes in ankle flexion angle at initial ground
   contact.
   Clinical Relevance: Uninstructed barefoot running training does not
   reduce initial loading rate in all runners transitioning from shod to
   barefoot conditions. Some factors have been identified that may assist
   sports medicine professionals in the evaluation and management of
   runners at risk of injury. Conscious instruction to runners may be
   required for them to acquire habitual barefoot running characteristics
   and to reduce risk of injury.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to lead in drinking water poses a risk for various adverse
   health effects, and significant efforts have been made to monitor and
   eliminate lead exposure in drinking water. This study focused on the
   localization of lead exposure from 71 drinking water fountains in
   nonresidential buildings in order to determine the source of elevated
   lead and understand the effects of fountains associated with lead
   concentration in drinking water. Drinking water fountains containing
   lead-lined cooling tanks and brass fittings were found to release lead
   concentrations in excess of 10g/L, and fountains with low or infrequent
   usage and those with cooling tanks produced the highest concentrations
   (in excess of 20g/L) of lead. One particular fountain model found at
   several locations throughout the institution was associated with some of
   the highest lead concentrations measured throughout the study. This
   fountain was recalled in the United States, but not in Canada. This
   article adds to existing research demonstrating that drinking water
   fountains are a potentially significant and underappreciated source of
   lead exposure in nonresidential buildings. (C) 2015 American Society of

Journal = {{PROCESS SAFETY PROGRESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-114}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This article discusses technical and practical aspects of the limiting
   oxygen concentration (LOC) including a detailed appraisal of possible
   sources of measurement error. LOC values obtained in the classical 5-cm
   diameter, vertical tube apparatus have been described as nonconservative
   owing to flame quenching. However, much of the difference between
   classical LOC values and those obtained in closed vessels using ASTM
   E2079 is due to the change in the definition of ignition. Formerly
   defined as propagation of a visible flame through a vertical tube at
   least 1.5 m tall, which in a closed tube would typically generate an
   overpressure in excess of 100\%, ignition is now defined as an
   overpressure that exceeds 7\%. The small pressure rise criterion tends
   to underestimate the LOC in smaller test vessels, especially for tests
   made at elevated pressures and temperatures. More use should be made of
   ASTM E2079's flexibility regarding the use of larger pressure rise
   criteria. Having lost sight of the flame, it is important not to lose
   sight of the objective, namely to select test criteria that correctly
   predict the flammable limits pertaining to large volumes of gas mixture.
   Additional reference quality LOC data are needed both to improve the
   definition of ignition with respect to test vessel volume and to
   investigate the accuracy of LOC estimation techniques. Any large-scale
   reference quality test program should investigate the effect of low
   levels of forced turbulence on measured LOC values. The NFPA Explosion
   Protection Systems Technical Committee recently supported the
   development of two Tentative Interim Amendments (TIAs) to NFPA 69
   Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems. The first TIA resolves issues
   with the table of LOC values for gases, which had been modified and
   over-corrected in the 2008-2014 editions. The second TIA introduces a
   simple method for estimating the LOCs of single gases and gas mixtures
   based on the equation LOC=LFL x S, where LFL is the lower flammable
   limit and S the molar stoichiometric ratio of oxygen to fuel. An
   Appendix describes the two TIA recommendations while a second Appendix
   describes how the estimating methods have been incorporated into ASTM's
   CHETAH Program. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Volume = {{219}},

Abstract = {{Recycling of biosolids phosphorus (P) to agricultural systems is an
   economic and environmentally sustainable practice that has received more
   attention in recent years. However, the dynamics and bioavailability of
   biosolids P in acidic soils have not well documented. This study
   examined various soil test P (STP), including Mehlich 3 P (M3P), water
   extractable P (WEP), and the P saturation index (PSI), and total soil P
   as functions of the rate and frequency of application of an alkaline
   treated biosolids (ATB). The ATB (N-Viro) was produced from Advanced
   Alkaline Stabilization process, which was applied to grow corns in the
   sandy loam soil in the field trial. Treatments were arranged as split
   plot in a complete randomize block design with four replications and
   included a control, 2 Mg lime ha(-1), 7, 14, 28 and 42 Mg ATB ha(-1) on
   wet basis (DW=67.5\%). The management practices from 2008 to 2012 were
   annual vs. single ATB applications. The results show that applying high
   rates of ATB such as 28 and 42 Mg ATB ha(-1) annually can increase
   approximately 30\% Mehlich 3 P and 6.0\% water extractable P
   concentrations, respectively, than low rates treatment. Although no
   significant soil P accumulation was observed in this study, applying
   high rates of ATB resulted in an 8.4\% increase in soil total P (TP)
   compared with other treatments during the period 2010-2013 but not in
   2009. The increasing ATB rates under annual applications resulted in
   higher soil PSI within each year, but the P related environmental
   concerns based on the current ATB application strategy at the research
   site were limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Camelina sativa has recently attracted great interest as an energy crop
   for biodiesel production in North America. To assess the feasibility of
   biodiesel production from camelina, the cultivation conditions, camelina
   oil fatty acid profile, alkali-catalyzed transesterificaiton process and
   fuel properties of camelina biodiesel were investigated. Unrefined
   camelina oil, containing 10\%, 33.2\% and 56.8\% saturated,
   monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids respectively, was used
   to synthesize biodiesel. The conversion rate of C. sativa oil to its
   methyl esters was 96\% under optimal reaction conditions. Most fuel
   properties of the resulting camelina biodiesel were in good agreement
   with specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials
   (ASTM D6751) and European standard (EN 14214), such as kinematic
   viscosity, acid number, flash point, sulfur content, total glycerol
   content. Its cetane number (49.7) was satisfactory according to ASTM
   D6751, but not for EN 14214. Camelina biodiesel exhibited poor oxidative
   stability (1,9 h) resulting from the high percentage of polyunsaturated
   fatty acid methyl esters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work was to determine the anthocyanin retention and
   physicochemical properties of haskap powder prepared by Refractance
   Window (TM) (RW) drying. In general, the RW-dried powder particles had a
   smooth surface with similar thickness, consistent with the preparation
   method, and had a solubility of 75.63\% in water. The RW-dried powder
   (consisting of 98\% haskap berries) retained approximately 93.8\% of
   anthocyanins from the original frozen fruits, as assessed by the
   pH-differential method. This result is in good agreement with HPLC
   analysis that indicated 92.9\% retention. Three anthocyanins were
   identified in frozen berries and RW-dried powder: cyanidin 3-glucoside,
   cyanidin 3-rutinoside, and peonidin 3-glucoside. Surprisingly, cyanidin
   3-rutinoside exhibited the lowest retention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia, pose a
   human health risk when present in drinking water. To minimize health
   risks, the Nova Scotia Treatment Standards for surface water and
   groundwater under the direct influence of surface water require a 3-log
   reduction for Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. This study
   determined the protozoan risk of municipal surface source waters in Nova
   Scotia, through the use of a pre-screening risk analysis of water
   supplies, followed by subsequent water quality analysis of the seven
   highest risk supplies. The water supplies were monitored monthly for 1
   year to obtain baseline data that could be used for a quantitative
   microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The QMRA model outcomes were compared
   to the Health Canada health target of 10(-6) disability-adjusted life
   years/person/year. QMRA modeling shows that the treatment facilities
   meet the required log reductions and disability-adjusted life year
   target standards under current conditions. Furthermore, based on the
   results of this work, Nova Scotia should maintain the current 3-log
   reduction standard for Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. The
   results of this study show that a pre-screening step can help to inform
   water sources that are particularly vulnerable to protozoan
   contamination, which can lead to more focused, cost-effective sampling,

Abstract = {{A built-in single event upsets (SEUs) detector is presented in this
   paper. This detector utilizes charge sharing to detect an SEU in a
   sequential cell, and the detection process is analyzed through Accuro
   simulations in a 65 nm technology. The normal operation of this detector
   would not induce obvious performance degradation of the target circuit.
   Through using this detector, error correction can be achieved based on
   dual modular redundancy (DMR) while the related power is about 20.4 \%
   lower than that induced by triple modular redundancy (TMR).}},

Abstract = {{Biomass is seen as a viable alternative energy source for replacing
   fossil fuel. However, the inherent properties of raw biomass, including
   high moisture content, low energy density, hydrophilic behavior, and
   fibrous nature, limit its use. Thus, pretreatment becomes an important
   step in the path of biomass to energy conversion routes. Torrefaction is
   One such emerging pretreatment process, which makes biomass hydrophobic,
   more energy dense, and easier to grind. This paper investigates the
   torrefaction process in a continuous two-stage, indirectly heated.rotary
   torrefier under the volatile gases medium. The rotary reactor is
   operated at different angular speeds, inclinations, and temperatures,
   and the produced torrefied solid product is characterized for physical
   and chemical compositions. The observed characteristics of the torrefied
   biomass produced under the volatile gases medium indicate that nitrogen
   supply can be avoided. Experimental= results showed that torrefaction
   temperature has a more significant effect than angular speed and
   inclination. At 320 degrees C, 4 rpm, and 1 degrees, fixed carbon in
   torrefied poplar is double that in raw poplar, with a solid mass yield
   of 80.2\% and an increase in volumetric energy density of 8.9\%. The
   energy balance showed the net system efficiency to be above 88\%.}},

Title = {{Optimising deep mixed soil zones in land reclamation projects}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-GROUND IMPROVEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The use of deep soil mixing technologies has become increasingly common
   in North America following its widespread development and adoption in
   Japan and Scandinavia. This research project considered how design of
   soft soils stabilised with deep soil mixing may be optimised to satisfy
   global slope stability requirements to assist the construction of large
   reclaimed land projects. The land reclamation case that was studied in
   the present paper deals with raising the elevation of a terrestrial area
   above a tidal or flood zone, where the water table is close or at the
   original grade. In this work, the effect of several key design
   parameters on the global factor of safety against slope failure for a
   land reclamation project was studied using limit equilibrium slope
   stability analyses. The parametric analyses considered design
   parameters, including the thickness of the soft soil layer, as well as
   the strength, width and location of a stabilised soil zone. The purpose
   of this work is to provide guidelines for the preliminary design of
   ground improvements for future land reclamation projects using deep soil
   mixing methods by identifying design parameters that have the most
   significant impact on the global factor of safety.}},

Abstract = {{Canada has two national civil codes of practice that include
   geotechnical design provisions: the National Building Code of Canada and
   the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code. For structural designs, both of
   these codes have been employing a load and resistance factor format
   embedded within a limit states design framework since the mid-1970s.
   Unfortunately, limit states design in geotechnical engineering has been
   lagging well behind that in structural engineering for the simple fact
   that the ground is by far the most variable (and hence uncertain) of
   engineering materials. Although the first implementation of a
   geotechnical limit states design code appeared in Denmark in 1956, it
   was not until 1979 that the concept began to appear in Canadian design
   codes, i.e., in the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code, which later
   became the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). The geotechnical
   design provisions in the CHBDC have evolved significantly since their
   inception in 1979. This paper describes the latest advances appearing in
   the CHBDC along with the steps taken to calibrate its recent
   geotechnical resistance and consequence factors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of both an experimental and a finite element

   twin plate girders braced with only torsional braces, the critical
   buckling moment has the most significant increase when the number of
   interior braces increases from two to three. For a given girder section,
   the increase in the critical moment capacity by increasing the
   cross-frame member size is minimal. The lateral torsional buckling
   moment equation as well as the brace force design procedure contained in
   the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code were examined. A relationship
   between the ratio of provided-to-required torsional stiffness and the

Abstract = {{This study was designed to identify the effects of variable

   from the ARs operated with low chloride concentrations in terms of
   microbial regrowth. However, there was a significant increase in iron
   concentrations after chlorination in the high chloride ARs. Further,
   more iron release was observed in these ARs at 1.0mg/L compared to
   0.2mg/L chlorine residual. Higher chlorine doses were required to
   achieve goal residuals for those ARs with higher chloride concentration

Abstract = {{Techno-economic feasibility of retrofitting solar combisystems to houses
   in the Canadian housing stock (CHS) is investigated using the Canadian
   Hybrid Residential End-Use Energy and Emissions Model (CHREM). Solar
   combisystem architecture and sizing is based on the systems and
   guidelines provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA) Solar
   Heating and Cooling (SHC) Programme Task 26. Houses with sufficient roof
   area facing south, south-east or south-west, and a basement or
   mechanical room to contain solar combisystem components, including the
   thermal storage tank, auxiliary boiler and pumps, are considered
   eligible to receive the retrofit. A hydronic heat delivery system is
   used to supply heat to the thermal zones. Solar collector area is sized
   to match the nominal capacity of the existing heating system in each
   house. Reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions are evaluated. Results show that close to 40\% of houses in
   the CHS are eligible for solar combisystem retrofit, and if all eligible
   houses are retrofitted, the annual energy consumption and GHG emissions
   of the CHS would be reduced by about 19\%. The tolerable capital cost
   varies significantly amongst provinces, and governmental subsidies or
   incentive programs may be required to promote solar combisystems in some
   provinces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order for microalgae-based processes to reach commercial production
   for biofuels and high-value products such as omega-3 fatty acids, it is
   necessary that economic feasibility be demonstrated at the industrial
   scale. Therefore, process optimization is critical to ensure that the
   maximum yield can be achieved from the most efficient use of resources.
   This is particularly true for processes involving heterotrophic
   microalgae, which have not been studied as extensively as phototrophic
   microalgae. An area that has received significant conceptual praise, but
   little experimental validation, is that of nutrient recycling, where the
   waste materials from prior cultures and post-lipid extraction are reused
   for secondary fermentations. While the concept is very simple and could
   result in significant economic and environmental benefits, there are
   some underlying challenges that must be overcome before adoption of
   nutrient recycling is viable at commercial scale. Even more, adapting
   nutrient recycling for optimized heterotrophic cultures presents some
   added challenges that must be identified and addressed that have been
   largely unexplored to date. These challenges center on carbon and
   nitrogen recycling and the implications of using waste materials in
   conjunction with virgin nutrients for secondary cultures. The aim of
   this review is to provide a foundation for further understanding of
   nutrient recycling for microalgae cultivation. As such, we outline the
   current state of technology and practical challenges associated with
   nutrient recycling for heterotrophic microalgae on an industrial scale
   and give recommendations for future work.}},

Abstract = {{Digby, Nova Scotia, is a largely rural area with a wealth of renewable
   energy resources, principally wind and tidal. Digby's electrical load is
   serviced by an aging 69 kV transmission line that often operates at the
   export capacity limit because of a local wind energy converter (WEC)
   field. This study examines the potential of smart charging of electric
   vehicles (EVs) to achieve two objectives: (1) add load so as to increase
   export capacity; (2) charge EVs using renewable energy.
   Multiple survey instruments were used to determine transportation energy
   needs and travel timing. These were used to create EV charging load
   timeseries based on ``convenience{''}, ``time-of-day{''}, and idealized
   ``smart{''} charging. These charging scenarios were evaluated in
   combination with high resolution data of generation at the wind field,
   electrical flow through the transmission system, and electricity load.
   With a 10\% adoption rate of EVs, time-of-day charging increased local
   renewable energy usage by 20\% and enables marginal WEC upgrading. Smart
   charging increases charging by local renewable energy by 73\%. More
   significantly, it adds 3 MW of load when power exports face constraints,
   allowing enough additional renewable electricity generation capacity to
   fully power those vehicles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{12-20}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of initial dent depth on the response of pipes
   subjected to cyclic bending loads with relatively large magnitudes is
   investigated experimentally. The initiation and propagation of the
   resulting cracks in the damaged region of the pipe are found to cause
   fatigue failure, augmented by the progressive accumulation of the
   cross-section ovalization during the cyclic loading. The empirical
   formula proposed by Kyriakides and Shaw {[}1] is modified based on the
   experimental results, in order to predict the number of cycles causing
   the local instability of pipe's cross-section. Moreover, it is shown
   that the experimental curve of the ovalization and the number of cycles
   necessary to produce buckling can be divided into three stages: initial,
   secondary and tertiary stages. Finally, an empirical equation, similar
   to the Bailey-Norton creep relationship, is proposed for simulating the
   initial and secondary stages of the aforementioned curve. The results
   produced by the proposed empirical relationship are found to be in good
   agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{44-51}},

Abstract = {{Anthocyanin degradation and formation of polymeric color of blueberry
   puree in novel hydrothermodynamic (HTD) processing was studied.
   Anthocyanin degradation was non-significant in the range of temperatures
   from 2.5 to 80 degrees C, becoming significant above 80 degrees C (p <
   0.05). Analysis of kinetic data indicated a first-order reaction for the
   degradation of blueberry anthocyanins with energy of activation 66.37
   kJ/mol and half-lives (t(1/2)) of 346.6, 1873, 123.8, 80.6 and 38.7 min
   at temperatures of 70, 80, 87.5, 95 and 105 degrees C respectively.
   Polymeric color formation followed zero-order kinetics, progressively
   increasing with temperature. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase
   (POD) were completely deactivated at 80 degrees C, which can be the
   reason of better shelf-life stability (t(1/2) = 533.2 and 216.6 days at
   4 and 20 degrees C, respectively). The beneficial aspect of technology
   on anthocyanin degradation and storage stability could be attributed to
   unique combination of temperature-pressure regimes of HTD processing.

Abstract = {{Lithium-rich Li{[}LixM1-x]O-2 (M = Ni, Mn, Co) materials have been
   claimed to be two phase by some researchers and to be one phase by
   others when all the available lithium is extracted electrochemically. To
   clear up this confusion, the Li-rich samples
   {[}Li{[}Li-0.12(Ni0.5Mn0.5)(0.88)]O-2 and
   Li{[}Li-0.23(Ni0.2Mn0.8)(0.77)]O-2 with different particle sizes were
   synthesized for in situ X-ray diffraction experiments. In situ X-ray
   diffraction measurements revealed two-phase behavior of 10 mu m
   particles and one-phase behavior for samples with submicrometer
   particles. The phase separation in samples with large particles agrees
   with literature proposals of oxygen release from a surface layer and the
   observation of distinct surface and bulk phases. The small particle
   samples are so small that they are entirely composed of the surface
   phase found in the large particle samples. These results strongly
   suggest that the size of particles can significantly affect the
   structural evolution testing and electrochemical performance of the Li-
   and Mn-rich materials. It is proposed that the surface phase
   continuously grows during charge discharge cycling, which leads to
   voltage fade in large particle samples. Meanwhile, in situ X-ray
   diffraction measurements were also performed for the layered Li Ni Mn Co
   oxides with varying nickel contents, including NMC811
   (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2), NMC442 (LiNi0.42Mn0.42Co0.16O2),

   Li{[}Li-0.23(Ni0.2Mn0.8)(0.77)]O-2. Samples. with higher nickel content
   showed much faster contraction of unit cell volume as a function of cell
   voltage, which suggests that the core shell structures with a
   nickel-rich core (e.g., NMC811) and a Mn-rich shell (e.g.,
   Li1.23Ni0.154Mn0.616O2) should not crack during charge discharge

   425 degrees C for various sintering times. Microstructure analysis and
   mechanical properties of the consolidated components in the T1 and T6
   states were evaluated. Densities between 97.5 and 99.7\%TD were obtained
   across all hold times. After sintering for 60 min, microhardnesses of 91
   +/- 8 and 143 +/- 6 HV were attained in the T1 and T6 conditions,
   respectively. The T1 samples had a flexural strength of 659 +/- 37 MPa
   and a flexural strain of 5.7 +/- 0.3\%, compared to 552 +/- 43 MPa and
   3.8 +/- 0.2\% in the T6 temper. The mechanical properties of the T6
   components were lower than those found in the literature. Extensive
   solution heat treatments of 2 and 4 h were performed prior to aging. (C)

Abstract = {{Scene recognition aims to find a semantic explanation of a scene, i.e.,
   it helps intelligent machines to know where they are. It can be widely
   applied into various tasks in computer vision and robotics. Most of
   pioneer methods extracted a set of low-level features and put them into
   classifier directly to identify scene category. But it has been proved
   that low-level features do not work well. Currently researchers aim to
   overcome the semantic gap between the low-level vision features and
   high-level semantic categories to improve the recognition performance.
   Therefore, much attention has been put on transforming low-level
   descriptors into richer intermediate representations. This paper
   proposed a novel method based on intermediate feature representation to
   solve the problem of recognizing the semantic category of scene image.
   This proposed method uses sparse coding on SIFT features and presents a
   spatial layout sensitive pooling method. The space layout for pooling is
   based on three rectangles with size of 1{*}1,1{*}4 and 4{*}1 in each
   image. They are derived from inherent characteristics of the scene
   images by regularly dividing the image in horizontal and vertical
   direction. This spatial pooling strategy is easier and it can get
   optimal representation of scene images. Extreme learning machine (ELM)
   is used as a classifier. ELM has shown great ability to fit nonlinear
   classification boundaries. Experimental results have shown that this
   proposed method not only extracts lower dimension image feature but also
   outperforms other similar state-of-the-art methods in terms of
   recognition performance.}},

   denoted as TVp is proposed with the condition 0 <= p <= 1. It's
   difficulty to handle the TVp-regularized problem for image deblurring on
   account of the nonconvex part in the objective function, then we tackle
   this problem by a weighted TV (WTV) minimization where the weights are
   updated iteratively to locally approximate the TVp-regularized issue.
   The complexity of WTV minimization is solved by a revised split Bregman
   approach. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the improved
   performance of the proposed algorithm with p < 1 relative to traditional
   deblurring methods on a variety of images.}},

Abstract = {{At sea, a vessel is subjected to waves. If the ship is towing a
   submerged body containing sensory equipment, then any ship motion at the
   surface can impart unwanted disturbances on the towed body via the tow
   line. To help compensate for these disturbances, a winch on-board the
   host vessel can be operated in response to the surface ship's motion by
   reeling in or reeling out the tow line. A corresponding method, however,
   is needed to determine how much cable the winch controller should pay in
   or out to effectively attenuate unwanted towed-body motion. This paper,
   therefore, proposes and explores four different approaches that, using
   various combinations of sensor measurements such as ship inertial
   measurement unit data and measured tow-line angle, can be used to try to
   establish appropriate winch control actions for motion compensation of
   marine towed bodies. Small-scale towed-body experiments using a
   spherical tow body as well as computer simulations are carried out to
   test the control approaches and, by analyzing the corresponding motion
   reduction achieved by each of these winch control strategies, the most
   effective method is identified.}},

Abstract = {{Time domain passivity control, a well known control scheme widely used
   for teleoperation systems, normally works under the constraint of zero
   division. Small force or velocity signals can cause the occurrence of
   zero division which ultimately leads the system to be unstable. This
   paper presents a novel switching time domain passivity control scheme
   for multilateral teleoperation systems which not only ensures the
   stability of the system but also avoids zero division. In contrast to
   bilateral teleoperation systems, the multilateral teleoperation system
   is much more complex as it involves increased number of master and slave
   hardware, multiple operators and transmission of multiple signals over
   the communication network. A new framework for the communication channel
   has been proposed which incorporates the use of weighting coefficients
   to give masters and slaves authority depending upon the requirements of
   the operation. As the switching time domain passivity control keeps the
   system passive all the time, the stability is guaranteed. The proposed
   control scheme is valid for n masters and n slaves. Simulations with two
   masters and two slaves are carried out to verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Seepage analyses are routinely performed as part of levee analyses.
   While finite-element analysis is being used with increasing frequency,
   semi-analytical solutions such as ``blanket theory{''} are still
   commonly used, especially for simplified reliability analysis in
   conjunction with first-order methods. Unfortunately, the simplified
   approaches do not properly account for the spatial variability inherent
   in geologic materials when considering the blanket thickness. In this
   paper, random field theory is used to determine the influence of a
   confining layer of random thickness on levee under seepage and exit
   gradients. Results indicate that neglecting spatial variation in blanket
   thickness does not cause significant error in computed exit gradients
   and flow quantities obtained from simple reliability analysis using
   blanket theory.}},

   processing for time-, and frequency -selective channel variations. The
   pilot signal is added to an OFDM data signal in the time domain and
   allows for variable power allocation to the pilot. The structure of the
   signal shows up as a tone comb in the frequency domain which allows for
   doppler tracking. It is shown that exact tone interpolation for the data
   carriers can be achieved as long as the channel's impulse response does
   not exceed the duration of a period of the pilot signal. Finally, pilots
   can be allocated in a frequency-division mode to multiple transmitters
   for MIMO or joint detection applications, avoiding the problem of pilot
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) is a recent development that uses
   modelling and simulation with forecast conditions to exploit building
   thermal mass in an effort to improve indoor thermal comfort and reduce
   energy use/cost compared with traditional rule-based control strategies.
   This paper investigates a range of recent MPC strategies and the
   direction in which this new technology is trending. The findings
   indicate that there is little evidence that directly compares the
   performance of specific optimization algorithms, forecast and simulation
   parameters (timestep, horizon), and climate forecast accuracy for the
   same scenario. An analysis of 19 case studies highlights the advantages
   of MPC compared with conventional control strategies, but also
   identifies areas that need further improvement. These areas include the
   optimization strategy, the effects of forecast disturbance assessment,
   and desirable traits of existing buildings under consideration for MPC
   implementation. This paper develops a set of target parameters for the
   types of buildings for which MPC will have the most impact and suggests
   methods for overcoming shortfalls identified in recently published
   studies.}},

   non-linear tele-robotic system where the slave's environment is unknown.
   First, the non-linear tele-robotic system is approximated by a class of
   Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models. A fuzzy control law is then adopted to
   stabilize the tele-robotic system. Further, the selected control law
   allows deriving the design conditions for determining the bilateral
   control gains of the state convergence architecture which has been used
   in this study as a framework for establishing communication between the
   master and slave sides. MATLAB simulations on one-degree-of-freedom
   (DoF) non-linear tele-robotic system are included to prove the validity
   of the proposed fuzzy bilateral controller.}},

Title = {{Effect of Juice Extraction Methods on the Physicochemical
   Characteristics of Haskap Berry (Lonicera caerulea L.) Products}},

Abstract = {{Background: Haskap berries (Lonicera caerulea L.) are known for their
   health benefits and high levels of bioactive compounds. They are
   processed into different products such as juice, syrup and pressed
   berries. There is an opportunity to enhance the quality of these
   products by improving the juice extraction process.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of conventional and modified juice
   extraction processes on the physicochemical characteristics of haskap
   berry products.
   Methods: Haskap berries were conventionally extracted
   (thawing-pressingosmotic treatment-pressing) (process A), until 60, 70,
   80 and 82 \% juice yield. A modified method (process B) was also
   explored, where thawing and osmotic treatment were merged into one step
   followed by a one-time press. The physicochemical characteristics of the
   end products were compared.
   Results: The syrup showed significantly higher total soluble solids
   (TSS) (30.25-38.55 Brix) than the juice (10.05-14.35 Brix). There was a
   negative correlation between the TSS and the titratable acidity (TA)
   which increased with the extraction yield. The TA was 1.89-2.18,
   1.50-1.82 and 1.311.50 g citric acid/100 g in the juice (process A),
   syrup (process A) and sugar solution (process B), respectively. The
   pressed berries from process B showed higher total anthocyanin content
   than those of process A. The extracted liquids and pressed berries from
   the 60 and 70 \% yields had similar qualities. Vitamin C content of the
   whole frozen fruit (89.11 mg/100 g fresh weight) decreased by 60.21,
   79.36 and 82.18 \% in the juice, syrup and pressed berries, respectively
   in process A. Process B, however, could retain significantly more
   vitamin C in the obtained products.
   Conclusion: Pressing the haskap berries to 70 \% juice yield with
   process B is recommended for saving time and energy and for more
   nutritious products.}},

   dividing each interest candidate into several rectangular subregions (or
   local regions), each of which is independently trained with a local
   naive Bayesian classifier. Therefore, the object location is considered
   the candidate with the maximal response of a global classifier, which is
   a combination of the WLCs. Furthermore, we incorporate the particle
   filter into CT to account for the motion of the object and to better
   estimate the object location. The experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness and robustness of our proposed tracking algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to develop a novel consensus control
   algorithm for multi-agent systems (MAS) experiencing constant and

   The topology of the communication network of the system is modeled by an
   algebraic graph theory. The multi-agent dynamics is based on double
   integrator systems in discrete time domain. Bernoulli distribution
   principle is applied to system dynamics in order to deal with the
   uncertain packet data loss. The sufficient conditions for the
   stabilization of controller are formed by using Lyapunov-based
   methodologies and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques. The
   feasibility of the generated LMIs are analyzed to verify the stability
   of controller design. The control gain of the system is calculated if
   the solution of LMIs lie within the feasibility region, which ensures
   the MAS to achieve consensus. Simulation results with three agents are
   shown to verify the consensus of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effects of age and seat height on lower limb
   biomechanics and electromyography (EMG) during a sit-to-stand (STS).
   Methods: 10 older and 10 younger adults performed five STS trials from
   normal knee height and raised height. Bilateral lower limb and trunk
   motion, ground reaction forces and EMG were measured. Two-way analysis
   of variance tested for main effects (group, height) and interactions
   (alpha = 0.05). Results: Older adults had significantly greater peak and
   integrated EMG of most muscles (27-125\%). Normal seat height had
   significantly greater peak angles, hip and knee flexion moments, and
   peak and integrated EMG of most muscles. Conclusion: Despite similar
   biomechanics, older adults had greater EMG activity, supporting greater
   relative muscular demands during STS. The raised seat height reduced hip
   and knee biomechanical demands and muscle activity. This study is the
   first to provide evidence of age-related changes in muscle activation
   during a STS from different seat heights.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain the highest energy density, lithium ion batteries based on
   layered Li-Ni-Mn-Co oxides need to be charged to above 4.5 V without
   sacrificing lifetime. Lithium-rich core-shell (CS) structured positive
   electrodes having a high energy density core material with poor
   stability against the electrolyte can be protected by a thin layer of a
   stable shell material. In this work, the effects of the initial shell
   thickness, sintering temperature and interdiffusion during sintering on
   the electrochemical performance of CS cathodes were studied for the
   first time to our knowledge. Full cell coin cells of selected CS samples
   with electrolyte additives showed good capacity retention. This work
   will help guide the design of next generation positive electrode
   materials using CS and coating strategies. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

Journal = {{INFOR}},

Pages = {{1-18}},
Abstract = {{As municipal and regional initiatives for the collection of recyclable
   products, such as plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc., are increasing
   across the globe, designing collection networks to minimize collection
   costs and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions are becoming
   important. In this study, a two-phase mathematical decomposition model
   for the collection of multiple recyclable products using compaction
   trailers is presented. In the first phase of the decomposition,
   compaction trailer routes for each product type are generated by
   repeatedly solving instances of the route-generation subproblem. In the
   second phase, a mixed integer linear programming is formulated for route
   selection and solved to determine the optimal combination of scenarios
   generated in the first phase to minimize total collection costs. A case
   study was conducted in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia using this
   approach for the collection of clear polyethylene terephthalate and
   aluminium cans. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization
   methodology can reduce current collection costs by 53.7\%. The route
   configuration corresponding to this solution uses compaction trailers to
   pick-up approximately 85.1\% of the two recyclable products investigated
   in this study, with the remaining collected using conventional trailers.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the economic importance of forest products industries in

   growing number of mathematical and simulation models are being presented
   for the SC in this sector, an integrated formal structure is evidently
   required for guiding the development of and evaluating these models.
   Therefore, in this research, we systematically review and identify
   existing frameworks for modelling SCs with the interest of highlighting
   the ones relevant to the forest products SCs. While we find no framework
   specific to the forest products industry, we identify a number of

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},

Pages = {{250-257}},
Abstract = {{Brewers monitor density attenuation during fermentation to detect
   process deviations and to approximate other fermentation parameters. The
   most common relationship used to monitor fermentations is Balling's
   formula. It has been argued by many researchers that this relationship
   no longer adequately describes fermentation within modern breweries.
   This study monitored conversion of sugars into fermentation products in
   an attempt to assess the accuracy of historical and current theories.
   Experiments were conducted at laboratory scale using a standard assay
   with both sugar consumption and major product generation assessed at a
   high sampling frequency. The results were used to assess the accuracy of
   product formation models (such as Balling's) and to examine how product
   and substrate ratios changed over the fermentation. It was found that
   the majority of yeast and glycerol formation occurred within the first
   half of fermentation. Additionally, yeast cells held in suspension were
   fairly consistent in sugar consumption rate throughout the fermentation.
   Finally, it was found that while the consumption of each brewing sugar
   was highly ordered, there was a great deal of overlap between sugar
   utilization during the fermentation. This information will hopefully
   allow brewers to make informed decisions and to enable the use of
   accurate estimations of alcohol, yeast, and sugar contents for their
   final product.}},

   the more general induction heating issues in the semi-solid metal
   forming by taking into account the conditions of radiation and
   convection during the heating combined with cooling process at the
   surface of samples, hence the spatial-temporal variation of temperature
   on the whole sample volume. The Lab experiment for a cylinder aluminum
   alloy and numerical approaches for the physical model of a 2D heat
   transfer equation with the boundary conditions of convection and
   radiation were carried on. It is interesting to find that with a smaller
   rank of heating frequency 21-24KHz on the aluminum alloy, the
   distribution of the temperature is very homogenous on all samples from
   the center to surface areas, i.e. on the whole heated volume. We also
   observed that the quality of our samples after the induction heating
   process was very good and the `foot elephant' pattern did not happen.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of thermal management of tablet computers
   (tablet PCs) using phase change materials (PCMs) encapsulated in
   aluminized laminated film under continuous operation. The experimental
   setup consists of original tablet PC parts and a simplified dummy
   printed circuit board (PCB) with a thermal response similar to the
   original PCB. Two PCMs were used in the experiments, n-eicosane and
   PT-37 (a commercial PCM from PureTemp). These PCMs have similar melting
   temperatures (n-eicosane - 35.6 degrees C; PT-37 - 36.3 degrees C) but
   different latent heats of fusion (n-eicosane 236 kJ/kg; PT-37 - 206
   kJ/kg). Two encapsulations with different sizes (6 `' x 2.6 `', 7 `' x
   1.5 `') but the same thickness (0.0792 `' (2 mm)) were used in this
   study. The effects of inclination and power input level on the thermal
   behavior of the tablet were investigated. Experiments showed that PCM
   encapsulated in laminate film led to lower back cover temperature for
   constant heat flux applications. As much as a 20 degrees C temperature
   reduction of the back cover hotspot was achieved with encapsulated PCM.
   It was also observed that better thermal behavior was achieved both by
   the melting of PCMs and heat spreading through the laminate film. It was
   found that the rate of PCM melting is directly related to the power
   input. No significant effect on PCM melting and temperature history was
   observed in relation to the system inclination.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical study aimed at understanding the impact
   of the mushy zone constant, Amish, on simulated phase change heat
   transfer with varying geometries (inclination angles, and fin
   additions). This parameter is found in the Carman-Koseny equation, which
   is used in the modified heat capacity-porosity formulation for modeling
   phase change; this approach models fluid flow within the mushy region as
   flow through a porous medium. The melting of dodecanoic acid inside a
   rectangular thermal storage unit was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics
   4.4 with Amush being varied for each geometry. The predicted numerical
   melt front positions were directly compared to published experimental
   results {[}18 - 20]. Results have shown that the influence of Amush on
   the melting rate of the PCM is reduced with increasing inclination
   angles of the enclosure; where the melt interface is perpendicular to
   the direction of gravity. This has been attributed to the reduced
   velocity magnitudes that appear near the melt interface in such
   geometries. The addition of the fins showed that near the fin region
   Amush does not play an important role. However, it was observed that the
   model over predicts the velocity near the fin in the one fin model,
   which caused a mismatch between numerical and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares two common numerical strategies for modeling flow
   and heat transfer through mini- and micro channel heat sinks: the unit
   cell approach and a complete three dimensional unified approach.
   Conjugate heat transfer and laminar flow through a copper-water heat
   sink over a 2x2 cm(2) heat source have been modelled using the finite
   element method within COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0; with the primary
   objective being to identify the channel width at which the two models
   yield similar temperature and pressure predictions. Parametric studies
   that varied channel widths showed that as these widths were reduced, and
   the total number of channels increased, temperature and pressure
   predictions from both models converged to similar values. Relative
   differences as low as 5.4 and 1.6 \% were attained at a channel width of
   0.25 mm for maximum wall temperatures and channel pressure drops,
   respectively. Based upon its computational efficiency and conservative
   over prediction of wall temperatures, the unit cell approach is
   recommended as a superior design tool for parametric design studies at
   channel widths of less than 0.5 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Time domain passivity control, a well known control scheme widely used
   for teleoperation systems, normally works under the constraint of zero
   division. Small force or velocity signals can cause the occurrence of
   zero division which ultimately leads the system to be unstable. This
   paper presents a novel switching time domain passivity control scheme
   for multilateral teleoperation systems which not only ensures the
   stability of the system but also avoids zero division. In contrast to
   bilateral teleoperation systems, the multilateral teleoperation system
   is much more complex as it involves increased number of master and slave
   hardware, multiple operators and transmission of multiple signals over
   the communication network. A new framework for the communication channel
   has been proposed which incorporates the use of weighting coefficients
   to give the masters and slaves authority depending upon the requirements
   of the operation. As the switching time domain passivity control keeps
   the system passive all the time, the stability is guaranteed. The
   proposed control scheme is valid for n masters and n slaves. Simulations
   with two masters and two slaves are carried out to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{State convergence belongs to the class of non-passive schemes and offers
   a complete framework for bilaterally controlling the tele-robotic
   systems. Contrary to many other schemes, it allows modeling the
   tele-robotic systems on state space and provides guaranteed performance
   of their closed loop behavior. In this study, we have used the state
   convergence scheme to design a bilateral controller for a nonlinear
   telerobotic system where the slave is working in an unknown environment.
   The nonlinear tele-robotic system is first approximated by a
   Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model. A fuzzy control law is then employed to
   derive the design conditions following the method of state convergence
   in order to ensure that the slave follows the master and the desired
   dynamic behavior of the tele-robotic system is achieved. Further, the
   existing state convergence based linear bilateral controller is found to
   be a special case of the proposed state convergence based fuzzy
   bilateral controller. A one-degree-of-freedom (DoF) nonlinear
   tele-robotic system is finally simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment
   to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Bilateral teleoperation systems have been extensively developed over
   decades. Communication delay is one of the most challenging control
   design problems. Additionally, nonlinearity, parameter variation, and
   uncertainty in the environment dynamics and robot model are also
   challenging issues that should be taken into account for excellent
   control performance. In our work, we propose a globally stable nonlinear
   adaptive robust control structure is proposed, dealing with the
   following problems. Firstly, this new control structure can tolerate
   arbitrary, long, and time-varying delays. Secondly, a nonlinear adaptive
   robust control scheme is proposed to stabilize the system under
   nonlinearities, unknown parameters, modeling errors and uncertainties in
   the system, in order to ensure excellent tracking performance on both
   sides. Thirdly, an environmental torque estimator is designed to
   estimate immeasurable torques by a least square adaptive law. Moreover,
   a novel structure of communication block is developed. The master
   trajectory is sent to the slave side. However, from the slave side to
   the master side, estimated parameters of the environmental torque are
   transmitted back. This structure is designed to enhance the control
   performance of the adaptive robust controller. To ensure the desired
   transparency performance, an impedance control structure is developed on
   the master side. The proposed approach can guarantee robust stability,
   excellent transparency and synchronization under arbitrary time-varying
   delays. In simulation, two 2-DoF robotic manipulators are considered to
   verify the effectiveness of the control design.}},

   GROWTH AND BERRY YIELD}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, wild blueberry growers apply fertilizer uniformly without
   considering the substantial variation in soil characteristics,
   topographic features, and berry yield. Occurrence of heavy rainfall
   events, gentle to severe topography along with high proportion of bare
   spots and weed patches emphasize the need for variable rate split (VRS)
   fertilization. The VRS fertilization has a potential to improve
   fertilizer use efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. Two
   commercial wild blueberry fields were selected in central Nova Scotia.
   Fields were divided into three sections {[}VRS section, uniform rate
   split (URS) section, and uniform rate (UR) section]. Fertilization was
   performed by following the global positioning system (GPS) guided
   prescription map. Soil samples and plant growth parameters were
   collected during the vegetative year and berry yield samples were
   collected during the crop year. The experimental design used for this
   study was split-plot design and the analysis of all collected data were
   performed using SAS (SAS, 2010) at 5\% level of significance. Plant
   density and plant height were non-significantly different under all
   slope zones of VRS, URS, and UR treatment sections. Plants in URS and UR
   sections were taller than VRS sections in low lying areas. Although
   there were non-significant differences for berry yield in all slope
   zones of VRS, URS, and UR fertilizer treatments, the mean berry yield
   was higher in VRS section as compared to the other sections. Significant
   correlations were observed between soil properties and plant growth
   parameters under all treatment sections. The VRS fertilization saved
   39\% and 42\% fertilizer in Cooper (field-1) and North River (field-2)
   fields, respectively. Based on the results of this study, it can be
   concluded that the VRS fertilization in wild blueberry fields could
   reduce fertilizer usage without affecting the crop productivity.}},

Title = {{DEVELOPMENT OF A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR WILD BLUEBERRY HARVESTER FRUIT
   LOSSES DURING HARVESTING USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK}},

Abstract = {{Wild blueberry is one of the most important fruit crops of Canada that
   produces more than 50\% of the world's blueberries. Understanding and
   predicting the relationships between the machine operating parameters,
   fruit losses, topographic features, and crop characteristics can aid in
   better berry recovery during mechanical harvesting. This article
   suggested a modeling approach for prediction of fruit losses during
   harvesting using artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression
   (MR) techniques. Four wild blueberry sites were selected and completely
   randomized factorial (3 x 3) experiments were conducted at each site.
   One hundred sixty-two plots (0.91 x 3 m) were made at each site, in the
   path of operating harvester. Total fruit yield and losses were collected
   from each plot within selected sites. The harvester was operated at
   specific levels of ground speed (1.20, 1.60, and 2.00 km h(-1)) and head
   rotational speed (26, 28, and 30 rpm). The slope, plant height, and
   fruit zone were also recorded from each plot.
   The collected data were normalized, and 70\% of the data were utilized
   for calibration, and 30\% for validation of developed models using ANN
   and MR techniques. Results of root mean square error (RMSE) suggested
   that the tanh-sigmoid transfer function between the hidden layer and
   output layer was the best fit for this study. The developed models were
   validated internally and externally and the best performing
   configurations were identified based on RMSE, coefficient of efficiency,
   percent variation, and coefficient of determination. Results of scatter
   plot among the RMSE and epoch suggested that an epoch size (iterative
   steps) of 15,000 was appropriate to predict fruit losses using ANN
   approach. Results revealed that the prediction accuracy of MR model was
   lower (R-2 = 0.46; RMSE = 0.14\%) than the ANN model (R-2 = 0.84; RMSE =
   0.075\%) for calibration dataset. Results reported that the ANN model
   predicted fruit losses with higher (R-2 = 0.63; RMSE = 0.11\%) accuracy
   when compared with MR model (R-2 = 0.37; RMSE = 0.15\%) for external
   validation dataset. Overall, results of this study suggested that the
   ANN model was able to accurately and reliably predict fruit losses
   during harvesting. These results can help to identify the factors
   responsible for fruit losses and to suggest optimal harvesting scenarios
   to improve harvesting efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The chemical instability of extracted anthocyanins (ACNs)
   limits their application and broader use as food colorants and
   health-promoting functional ingredients. Encapsulation technology can
   improve ACN stability and widen their potential applications.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to optimize the
   microencapsulation of ACNs from haskap berries (Lonicera caerulea L.) in
   calcium-alginate particles by the extrusion/gelation method.
   METHODS: Response Surface Methodology (RSM) by Box-Behnken (BB) design
   was used for the optimization, followed by the desirability function.
   Three input variables were evaluated: concentrations of sodium alginate
   (x(1), w/w \%) and calcium chloride (x(2), w/v \%), and gelation time
   (x(3), min). The responses were encapsulation efficiency (y(1), \%) and
   particle size (y(2), mu m).
   RESULTS: There was a good fit for the model where encapsulation
   efficiency was used as a separate response (R-2 = 97.98\%), however, the
   model for particle size did not give as good an agreement (R-2 =
   63.86\%). The desirability function was used to optimize the two
   responses simultaneously and the optimum conditions were determined as
   9.0\% (w/w) alginate solution, 2.0\% (w/v) CaCl2, and 10 min in the
   gelation solution.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate the application of RSM followed by
   a desirability function to optimize encapsulation parameters for a
   combined response, where several measures are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Today, energy is the most valuable resource, new methods and techniques
   are being discovered to fulfill the demand of energy. However, energy
   demand growth causes a serious energy crisis, especially when demand is

   handled by integrating Demand Side Management (DSM) with traditional
   Smart Grid (SG) through two way communication between utility and
   customers. The main objective of DSM is peak load reduction where SG
   targets cost minimization and user comfort maximization. In this study,
   our emphasis is on cost minimization and load management by shifting the
   load from peak hours toward the off peak hours. In this underlying
   study, we adapt hybridization of two optimization approaches, Bacterial
   Foraging (BFA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Simulation results verify
   that the adapted approach reduces the total cost and peak average ratio
   by shifting the load on off peak hours with very little difference
   between minimum and maximum 95\% confidence interval.}},

Abstract = {{Due to growing concerns over climate change, more and more countries are
   looking to renewable energy sources to generate electricity. Therefore,
   wind turbines are increasing in popularity. The amount of mechanical
   power that can be extracted from the wind by a turbine rotor depends on
   the characteristics of wind turbine. Furthermore, the aim of the
   characteristics of any wind turbine is to provide an expectation of how
   to design the generator's control system in order to track these
   characteristics and extract maximum power from the wind. The
   characteristics of wind turbines is the focus of this paper. A new wind
   turbine characteristics methodology is proposed and summarized in a new
   flowchart. A Matlab program was written to evaluate the performance
   coefficient of wind turbine. Unlike the conventional simulations which
   use the wind turbine block in the MATLAB /SIMULINK library, a drive
   train model and aerodynamic model have been supplemented to get the
   characteristics of wind turbines.}},

Abstract = {{Finding optimal settings of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) has
   been extensively solved by many scenarios with adopting different
   traditional and modern optimization algorithms. For the sack of
   simplicity, all the conducted studies in the literature are restricted
   on a condition that all DOCRs are numerical, static, or
   electromechanical. There is a fact that when jumping from
   electromechanical or static relays to numerical relays the former
   devices could be used as a second wall of protection instead of just
   throwing them. With a very extreme condition, which may not happen in
   the real-world applications, all buses will have double primary DOCRs,
   which where act as backup DOCRs for other buses. That is, the dimension
   of any given problem is duplicated and becomes very hard to be feasibly
   and optimally solved. This paper covers this uncommon scenario, and a
   new hybrid algorithm with some additional sub-algorithms is developed to
   solve the IEEE 6-bus test system. Moreover, both numerical with
   electromechanical DOCRs and numerical with static DOCRs are considered
   in this study.}},

Abstract = {{The economic load dispatch (ELD) problem of electric power systems has
   been solved by many techniques including traditional and modern
   optimization algorithms. The main problem of achieving this task is that
   all precise specifications of the generating units are required. Also,
   in practice, many power systems are operated without considering the ELD
   strategy due to the lack of experience to deal with this part, which is
   embedded as a package in the energy management system (EMS), and/or the
   difficulty of constructing precise constrained objective functions
   matched with the real generating units. Based on a fact that most power
   systems maintain their daily records, the estimated economic load

   novel method can be applied without using any special software, and it
   is an optimization free technique. Moreover, this technique does not

Abstract = {{Forecasting electricity price allows market participants to make
   informed and sound decisions. Selecting the best training variables is
   often involved in forecasting in order to obtain optimal prediction.
   Support Vector Regression (SVR) provides an effective method to fit data
   and find minimal risk slack variables around a fit line. The best fit
   depends on the selected input feature set and the tuning of
   hyper-parameters. In this paper, various SVM optimization solvers were
   utilized to train and optimize the SVM parameters to speed up the
   quadratic programming convergence and increase the forecasting accuracy.
   Various kernels were used with the SVM Regression model and a comparison
   of their performance was made. Our experiments demonstrated that the RBF
   Kernel is the most efficient. The paper contributes to enhancing the
   quality of SVR electricity price forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with a semidefinite program (SDP) to solve the
   optimal power flow (OPF) problem for integrating renewable energy
   sources (RESs) with demand participation in electric grids. The electric
   generation from renewables as a supplier is randomly realized using an
   algorithm. The demand participation is provided by demand-side resources
   with renewables to curtail the actual loads, which means that the
   penetration of renewable generation is raised. Thus, a balance between
   supply and demand response of the grid is maintained. The optimization
   problem, accommodating the renewable generation, is introduced as a
   convex problem. The convex problem is represented in the form of
   semidefinite program. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimal power flow
   problem, convex semidefinite relaxation has been proposed to solve the
   optimization problem. We also perform contingency scenarios and test
   these scenarios by solving the semidefinite relaxation to obtain
   feasible solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Hospital acquired infections (HAIs) are the major
   contributors of mortality associated with burn injuries. The aim of this
   research was to document the antecedents affiliated with major burn
   injuries, hospitalization and mortality in burn patients. Methods: We
   performed a single center prospective study of patients admitted during
   3 months period (April-June 2014) in burn wards of government hospital.
   There were 100 patients in this investigation which were observed
   weekly. The inclusion criterion was based on the shifting of patients
   from emergency to the wards after initial treatment of more than 24 h.
   Variables included were age and gender of the patient, the percent total
   body surface area (\% TBSA) burn, the cause of the burn. Results: Mean
   age of patients was 30.29 years. More females (55.67\%) were admitted
   than males (44.32\%). The total body surface area (\% TBSA) burnt were
   from 15\%-95\% respectively moreover children were more sensitive to
   hospital acquired infections (HAIs) and mortality rate was 34\% in
   children with mean age of 5 years and disability of body parts were 42\%
   among 75\% were females. Whereas the most common (HAIs) were primary
   bloodstream (PBS) with mean value of 30.50, wound infections (WIS) were
   at second prevalence with mean value of 27.50, followed by sepsis (S)
   and pneumonia (P) 10.33, eye infections (EIs) 4.833 and urinary tract
   infections (UTIs) 2.667. Factors significantly (p-value = 0.000)
   associated with increased duration of hospitalization caught HAIs
   mortality include the age and gender of the patient, the cause of burn,
   inhalation injury, the region affected and \% TBSA burnt. Conclusion: It
   concluded that the mortality was very much dependent on age and gender
   of the patient, burn causes, affected area as well as \% TBSA burnt are
   considerable factors in determining the relationship of HAIs and whether
   the patients will survive or knuckle to injuries. Better compliance
   techniques, stricter control over disinfection and sterilization
   practices and usage of broad spectrum antibiotics, and reduction of the
   environmental contamination are required to reduce the HAIs rates among
   burn patients.}},

   the Ziegler-Nichols improved open-loop step response method and its
   variants and the closed-loop step response method are employed to get
   the nominal values of PID parameters. Secondly, the parameters are
   further tuned using the unconstrained nonlinear optimization technique

Abstract = {{This paper presents an inter-relay interference (IRI) cancellation
   scheme in amplify-and-forward (AF) cellular-type networks with
   successive downlink forwarding. In these half duplex alternate relaying
   systems with two hops, the wireless medium in both hops is always
   utilized through the simultaneous transmissions of the base station (BS)
   and one of the relays which in turn causes IRI. In this work, the
   processing to mitigate IRI is performed exclusively at the BS using
   channel state information (CSI) between the BS and the multiple relays
   supporting corresponding receivers. The proposed linear precoding
   exploits the principles of signal alignment at the BS and considers
   recursive characteristics of IRI. The scheme performance is affected by
   the noise accumulation which is controlled in this paper by (i)
   scheduling relays as to benefit from spatial attenuation of signals and
   (ii) periodically re-initializing BS transmissions where some of the
   time slots are not utilized for the BS transmissions. Simulation results
   show the ability of the new scheme to fully cancel IRI as well as
   demonstrate the performance trade-offs between the hit error rate (BER)
   improvements and the loss in throughput efficiency due to flushing.}},

   electricity price. Medium term time horizon of electricity price
   forecasting is very useful and of great importance. It has many
   applications such as future maintenance scheduling of the power plants,
   risk management, plan future contracts, purchasing raw materials and
   determine the market pricing. To forecast the electricity price, some
   factors are very important, such as choosing the most useful price
   features that influence the market price, and choosing the proper
   prediction model that is able to predict the price variations behavior
   using the historical data. The proposed SVM method and the other
   employed methods are evaluated using the data from the New England ISO
   which are published at their official website.}},

   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method free of unstable modes: it
   is applied to the coarse mesh regions with larger space steps and to the
   fine mesh regions with small space steps. As a result, a single
   relatively large FDTD time step can be used in both regions and only
   spatial interpolation of fields at the interface between coarse mesh and
   subgridded fine mesh regions are needed. Numerical examples are
   presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to present a design of a voltage controller
   via state-feedback control. An efficient power system model to measure
   voltage and frequency is introduced. The model including uncertainties
   is admitted to be timedependent, with a priori known upper and lower
   bounds. A method to solve the stabilization problem of the power system
   model subject to uncertain time-dependent parameters, which is
   quadratically stabilizable via linear state feedback is also introduced.
   The local information of each conventional generation unit is determined
   in a decentralized manner by the controller. The voltage controller
   utilizes its own local measurement only, and each local area utilizes in
   its own utility only. The voltage controller is also designed under the
   assumption that only the outputs are available for measurement. In order
   to find the quadratic stabilizability of the system via state feedback,
   one needs to solve a convex optimization problem which is characterized
   by Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the corresponding
   feedback gain of the voltage controller is constructed based on the
   feasible solution of the LMIs optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{Li{[}Ni0.6Mn0.2Co0.2]O-2 (NMC622) is one of the most attractive positive
   electrode materials for Li-ion cells. Ultra high precision coulometry,
   impedance spectroscopy, gas evolution and long-term cycling were used to
   explore the combined impact of several electrolyte additives and an
   Al2O3 surface coating on NMC622/graphite cells tested to 4.4 V at 40
   degrees C. An excellent correlation between the short-term coulombic
   efficiency measurements and the long-term cycling results was noted. An
   electrolyte containing 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate: ethyl methyl
   carbonate (3: 7 by weight) with additives 2 wt\% prop-1-ene-1,3 sultone
   (PES) + 1 wt\% methylene methane disulfonate (MMDS) + 1 wt\% tris
   (trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TTSPi) (this electrolyte is called PES 211)
   was found to give the best performance in both coated and uncoated
   NMC622/graphite cells. The surface coating was found to improve
   coulombic efficiency, reduce impedance and improve capacity retention in
   all cases studied. However, uncoated NMC622/graphite cells with PES211
   were found to perform better than coated NMC622/graphite cells which
   used any other electrolyte. The special synergy between Al2O3-coated
   NMC622 and PES211 needs to be understood so that even better coatings
   and electrolyte combinations can be developed. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic vehicle transaction model developed with
   data from a retrospective survey conducted in Halifax, Canada. The study
   investigated four types of vehicle transaction decisions, including
   first-time vehicle purchase, vehicle acquisition, vehicle disposal, and
   vehicle trade. A panel-based latent segment logit (PLSL) model was
   developed to account for repeated transaction decisions and to capture
   unobserved heterogeneity among the sample households. The study took a
   life-oriented approach by examining the lead and lagged effects of
   longer term changes and life-cycle events. The PLSL model was estimated
   for two latent segments, and the model results suggest that profound
   heterogeneity exists, as evident in parametric values of the two
   segments. The life-cycle event represented by the birth of a child might
   trigger vehicle acquisition in Segment 1. In contrast, that life-cycle
   event might deter an acquisition decision in Segment 2. The model
   confirmed historical deposition effects of key life events. For
   instance, a 2-year lagged effect on vehicle acquisition was seen with
   the birth of a child. Moreover, the model results revealed that
   first-time vehicle purchase behavior was considerably different from the
   decision to acquire a vehicle. For example, for the longer-term change
   represented by the addition of a job, significant heterogeneity across
   the two segments for a first-time vehicle purchase decision was seen and
   a 3-year lagged effect was confirmed. A positive relationship for the
   decision to acquire a vehicle in both segments was found for the same
   variable, and a 1-year lagged effect was confirmed. Finally, the study
   provided important behavioral insights for targeting specific groups of
   the population to promote sustainable travel behavior.}},

Abstract = {{A reconfigurable Fresnel lens approach for 3D imaging on crossed
   electrode array is described. A Fresnel lens can provide a focus
   comparable to traditional beamforming if the Fresnel focus is used in
   one direction, combined with conventional beamforming in the other
   direction. For example, in azimuth the Fresnel pattern is applied on
   transmit and dynamic beamforming is completed on receive. A second
   feature to our crossed electrode design arises from the fact that
   although a Fresnel lens can create a tight lateral focus, inherently
   long axial pulses result in poor axial resolution. This is because the
   phase delays are quantized to 0 or 180 degrees, and at wide steering
   angles the element path distance spans multiple wavelengths. We have
   developed a split and delay subaperture technique that maintains axial
   resolution throughout the image. At 0, 15 and 25 degrees the axial
   resolution using a single aperture was 64, 180 and 321 um. After
   splitting the aperture into 8 sub-apertures the resolution is 53, 64 and
   77 um. The beamwidths using this technique are comparable to a
   traditional array and agree well with simulation suggesting that this
   Fresnel approach shows promise for 3D imaging.}},

Abstract = {{A digital variable sampling high-frequency beamformer implementing

   using a semi-kerfed 64 element 45 MHz phased array with 1. element
   pitch. The grating lobe suppression is facilitated with the sign
   coherence factor (SCF) and split-aperture transmit beamforming
   techniques. A new split-aperture transmit technique called
   ``sub-aperture probing{''} (SAP) is described, experimentally validated,
   and compared to previously developed split-aperture techniques with
   respect to grating lobe suppression. Grating lobe levels were suppressed
   to be 49 and 60 dB below the main lobe when using 2 split-apertures with
   a SCF weighting factor of 1 and 2. These levels were further suppressed
   to 51 and 66 dB below the main lobe when splitting the aperture into 4
   evenly sized apertures. When using SAP with 16 elements for the
   sub-aperture, grating lobes were suppressed to 49 and 64 dB below the
   main lobe. SAP with 8 elements yielded improved results compared to SAP
   with 16 elements; suppressing grating lobe levels to 49 and 65 dB below
   the main lobe for the associated SCF weighting coefficients. Finally the
   grating lobe suppression performance was tested on a wire target
   embedded in a tissue phantom and the signal to tissue speckle levels
   were characterized.}},

Abstract = {{Wild blueberry is a high value cash crop in northeastern North America.
   In the last two decades, improved management practices have changed crop
   characteristics. Currently, the wild blueberry industry is facing
   increased harvesting losses (15\%-25\%) due to changes in crop
   conditions. This study was designed to examine the effect of plant
   characteristics on picking efficiency of the wild blueberry harvester.
   Four wild blueberry fields were selected in Nova Scotia and New
   Brunswick, Atlantic Provinces of Canada. Plant height (PH) and plant
   density (PD) were classified into four different categories, i.e., tall
   plant - low plant density, tall plant - high plant density, short plant
   - low plant density, and short plant - high plant density, and stem
   thickness (ST) was used as a covariate. Nine yield plots (0.9 x 3 m) for
   each combination of PH and PD were selected randomly at each
   experimental field. The PH, PD, and ST were recorded manually from each
   selected plot. Factorial experiments with four replications were
   designed to identify the combined effect of ground speed (1.2, 1.6, and
   2.0 km h(-1)) and header revolutions (26, 28, and 30 rpm) on berry
   losses at each category of PH and PD. Berry losses were collected from
   each plot within the selected fields. Factorial analysis of covariance
   (ANCOVA) using general linear model (GLM) procedure showed that the
   interaction of ground speed and header rpm was significant (p = 0.05) in
   each category of plant characteristics. Results of multiple means
   comparison showed that the lower ground speed and header rpm resulted in
   significantly lower losses when compared with higher ground speed and
   header rpm. The study findings also suggested a suitable combination of
   ground speed and header rpm for each class of plant characteristics to

Abstract = {{Localization is essential to consider in relation to wireless sensor
   networks issues. Establishing mobility in the localization process
   creates improvements in various regards. Static path planning is one of
   a number of mobility models that are used in localization in wireless
   sensor networks. Most static path planning models depend on
   trilateration or triangulation concepts in direct connection fashion
   between unknown nodes and anchors for successful node localization;
   however, such methods are insufficient in cases of mobility
   discontinuity. Considering scenarios where the mobile anchor has limited
   movement, in this paper we propose using the DV-Hop technique to
   increase the localization ratio in static path planning models in
   wireless sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a time scheduling scheme for generalized K-user
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Y channels where multiple
   terminals communicate with each other in a bi-directional manner via the
   relay. The objective is to decrease the system configuration
   requirements in terms of antenna numbers at the relay station and user
   nodes. Specifically, the scheme splits the user nodes into multiple
   groups and spreads the transmissions over a larger number of time slots
   (TSs) compared with the original MIMO Y channel scheme. While the latter
   scheme uses only one medium access control (MAC) and one broadcast (BC)
   phase, the proposed time scheduling arranges bi-directional data
   exchanges using specialized precoding in two or more MAC and BC phases
   between smaller number of users. As a result, the required numbers of
   antennas at the relay and the user nodes are decreased at the expense of
   reduced effective throughput. The lower complexity antenna
   configurations in MIMO Y channels will make the whole system more
   amenable to practical implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Due to smart grid applications the consumers and producers are able to
   meet the demand of each others and thus take part in demand side
   management and demand response program. Hence smart grid leads to
   optimization of energy consumption and reduce high cost in today
   extensive demand of energy. In this research work we are reducing
   electricity consumption cost and load consumption using scheduling the
   appliances. The twenty appliances are used to schedule their energy
   consumption and load using heuristics techniques i.e. binary particle
   optimization, genetic algorithm and wind driven optimization, using the
   same data set for each technique and their results are compared with
   each other in order to find which technique do better optimization.
   Simulations are performed in matlab to show the cost and load reduction
   by the above three techniques and validate the experiment. The
   simulation results show that binary particle swarm optimization perform
   better than the other two techniques and wind driven optimization is
   better than genetic algorithm but not able to perform as binary particle
   swarm optimization, similarly genetic algorithm is least efficient as
   compared to both methods. Our research work is beneficial to meet the
   demand side management and help in reducing electricity cost and load
   for consumers.}},

   planned to design in such a way that they can monitor and transfer

   deployment strategies with quality data routing. Application like oil
   spillage monitoring requires cylindrical deployment of sensor nodes. So,
   there is a need of proposing new protocols which can minimize and

Abstract = {{The characteristics of underwater sensor networks are unique and they
   are much different from terrestrial networks but the importance of both
   cannot be neglected. However it is much more difficult to sustain a
   workable environment underwater due to its harsh characteristics which
   make tasks such as batteries replacement, nodes repairing and other
   similar factors difficult. Thus the need to efficiently utilize the
   energy of the nodes remain a key aspect in the advancement of Underwater
   Sensor Networks (UWSNs). Due to reasons as such we present an improved
   version of DB-EBH which was previously an advancement on EBH. Just like
   the previous two techniques, IT DB-EBH is also a hybrid network. The
   nodes are selected on basis of Selection Criteria Phase. Direct
   transmission is only used when a node cannot identify a neighbor in its
   transmission range and outside a defined threshold value.}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the digital control problems and issues during the
   controller design and suggests the solutions to resolve them. For this
   purpose, digital controller designed on the basis of digital redesign or
   emulation technique is applied to a buck converter working in continuous
   conduction mode. Nonlinearities due to the ADC and DAC quantizers,
   loop-delay, etc. are introduced into the control loop and their adverse
   effects on performance are interrogated. The nonlinearities are
   suppressed by retuning the digital controller. The order of the
   controller may increase and require more resources for its
   implementation. The quantizers' nonlinearities add quantization noise
   into the loop and may cause offsets and limit cycle oscillations (LCOs).
   The overall phase margin gets reduced due to the delay thus keeping the
   bandwidth limited and leading the system towards instability. The
   well-tuned loop remains asymptotically stable if the nonlinearities are
   neglected. MATLAB/Simulink environment is used to address all the
   issues.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new routing protocol MobiSink (mobile sink) for underwater
   sensor networks (UWSNs). We deploy the sink mobility in four horizontal
   regions of the network. The mobile sink moves in its own region to
   collect data from the transmission range sensor nodes. The transmission
   range of a node is calculated after fixed interval of time for mobile
   sink. In MobiSink nodes also take help of transmission range neighbors
   to communicate with sink cooperatively, if sink is out of range. The
   mobility pattern of sink and cooperative routing achieved better results

   routing in our proposed scheme and use mobile sinks to balance load on
   all nodes. We also use the concept of clustering to reduce multi hoping
   which results in more energy consumption. The selected Cluster Heads

Abstract = {{Many routing protocols are proposed regarding energy efficiency in

   subregions of equal size and search sparse and dense regions of the
   network field with the help of sparsity search algorithm (SSA) and
   density search algorithm (DSA). SEEC improves network lifetime through
   sink mobility in sparse regions and clustering in dense regions of the
   network. SEEC also achieves network stability with optimal number of
   clusters formation in dense regions of the network where each dense
   region logically represents a static cluster. The division of the
   network region into subregions control routing hole problem in the
   UWSNs. SEEC minimizes network energy consumption with balanced scheme
   operations. Effectiveness of our proposed protocol is verified by

Abstract = {{Large propagation delay, high error rate, low bandwidth and limited
   energy in Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs) attract the attention of
   most researchers. In UWSNs, efficient utilization of energy is one of
   the major issue, as the replacement of energy sources in such
   environment is very expensive. In this paper, we have proposed a Cluster
   Depth Based Routing (cDBR) that is based on existing Depth Based Routing
   (DBR) protocol. In DBR, routing is based on the depth of the sensor
   nodes: the nodes having less depth are used as a forward nodes and
   consumes more energy as compared to the rest of nodes. As a result,
   nodes nearer to sink dies first because of more load. In cDBR, cluster
   based approach is used. In order to minimize the energy consumption,
   load among all the nodes are distributed equally. The energy consumption
   of each node is equally utilized as each node has equal probability to
   be selected as a Cluster Head (CH). This improves the stability period
   of network from DBR. In cDBR Cluster Heads (CHs) are used for forwarding
   packets that maximizes throughput of the network. We have compared our
   results with DBR and Energy Efficient DBR (EEDBR). The simulation result
   validates that cDBR achieves better stability period and high throughput
   comparatively to DBR and EEDBR.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater typically receives various degrees of treatment, including
   disinfection, to meet the water quality guidelines before being
   discharged into the receiving water body. In some jurisdictions,
   seasonal rather than year-round disinfection has been adopted, since
   disinfection in winter months is often unnecessary. Halifax Harbour has
   been historically polluted due to the discharge of raw sewage and other
   wastes. Although water quality in the harbor has greatly improved as a
   result of clean-up projects and with the implementation of full
   treatment systems, seasonal disinfection has been proposed recently and
   there is a concern that this could lead to degradation of water quality.
   This paper studies the potential impacts of seasonal wastewater
   disinfection by predicting the fecal coliform concentrations in the
   harbor using a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic/contaminant
   transport model. The results show that seasonal disinfection has caused
   elevated concentrations of fecal coliforms in many parts of the harbor
   and the swimming guidelines have been exceeded at one of the beaches for
   most of the winter months. The seasonal disinfection also forced the
   fecal coliform concentration above the shell-fishing limit in the Outer
   Harbour and could lead to shell fish contamination. It is recommended
   that alternatives to full seasonal disinfection should be considered to
   protect the environment and public health.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationships between soil properties, topographic
   features, and their impact on fruit yield is an important component of
   site-specific nutrient management. This article presents research that
   investigates the relationship between soil properties and fruit yield to
   provide a better understanding of their variation with respect to change
   in slope within selected wild blueberry fields. Two wild blueberry
   fields were selected and completely randomized experiments were
   constructed at each site. The selected sites were divided into five
   slope categories: 0 < 5 degrees (Category 1), 5 degrees < 9 degrees
   (Category 2), 9 degrees < 13 degrees (Category 3), 13 degrees < 16
   degrees (Category 4), and => 16 degrees (Category 5). Soil samples were
   collected from each slope category and analyzed for pH, texture,
   electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic matter (SOM), and inorganic
   nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO3--N). The slope, volumetric moisture content (theta
   v), and fruit yield data were also collected from each slope category.
   Soil variables, slope and fruit yield data were replicated ten times in
   each slope category.
   The significant correlation between the SOM, EC, theta v, NH4+-N,
   NO3--N, clay content, fruit yield, and slope suggested that wild
   blueberry yield is greatly influenced by variations in slope and soil
   properties. Multiple regression models explained > 75\% (p < 0.001) of
   the variability in fruit yield as a result of slope and soil properties.
   Regression analysis reported that slope alone explained >57\% of the
   variability in fruit yield within selected fields. Soil properties and
   fruit yield were significantly different in various slope categories.
   Multiple means comparison suggested higher fertility and fruit yield in
   the low slope category, with a decreasing trend with increasing slope.
   Negative correlations of slope with soil properties and fruit yield and
   their variation in different slope categories emphasize the need to
   develop slope based management zones for site-specific fertilization in
   wild blueberry fields. Site-specific fertilization can enhance input use
   efficiency, increase profit margins and reduce environmental risks.}},

Title = {{RESPONSE OF WILD BLUEBERRY FRUIT LOSS TO SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN CROP
   CHARACTERISTICS AND SLOPE OF THE FIELD}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{493-504}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of spatial variability in fruit yield, crop characteristics,
   fruit loss, and slope of the field is critical for planning and
   implementing the operational recommendation for mechanical harvesting.
   Improved management practices have caused significant changes in crop
   conditions, which reduce the picking performance of the harvester as the
   harvester was designed in early 1980s. The goal of this work was to
   characterize and quantify the spatial pattern of variability in crop
   characteristics, fruit yield, and slope the field in relation to fruit
   loss during mechanical harvesting. Completely randomized experiments
   were designed and plots (0.91 x 3 m) were constructed in selected
   fields. Total fruit loss (pre- and post-harvest) and fruit yield were
   collected from each plot within selected fields. Slope, plant height,
   and fruit zone were also recorded from each plot to examine the impact
   of their spatial variability on fruit loss.
   The coefficient of variations (CVs) for fruit yield, berry loss, slope,
   plant height, and fruit zone suggested moderate to high variability
   (CV>15\%) within selected fields. Correlation analysis showed higher
   fruit loss in high yielding areas and vice versa. Fruit yield, berry
   loss, slope, plant height, and fruit zone had large spatial variation
   (range of influence similar to 20 to 50 m) within selected fields.
   Kriged maps revealed substantial variation in these parameters.
   Variability in fruit loss corresponding with the spatial variations in
   crop characteristics, fruit yield, and slope suggested that the fruit
   loss during mechanical harvesting were influenced by the spatial
   variations in these parameters. Adjustments in operational settings
   (ground speed, head revolutions, head height, etc.) of the harvester in
   accordance with the spatial variations have the potential to increase
   profit margins for blueberry industry.}},

Abstract = {{Several reports have indicated a positive correlation between the
   consumption of anthocyanins (ACN) and biomarkers relating to the
   improvement of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results from in vitro
   studies often do not translate into clinical evidence. Potential causes
   of these discrepancies are experimental conditions that lack
   physiological relevancy; extensive degradation of these compounds in
   vivo due to changes in pH and metabolism; and a short residence time in
   the absorption window in relation to the absorption rate. Here,
   gastroretentive systems (GRS) are proposed as a strategy to overcome the
   limitations in ACN delivery and to reduce the existing bench-to-subject
   gap. This review summarizes recent literature on the use of ACN for the
   management and control of T2D, followed by GRS platforms to promote a
   sustained release of ACN for increased health benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of three process incidents recently
   investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board (CSB): (i) Kleen Energy
   natural gas explosion (Middletown, CT), (ii) Hoeganaes Corporation iron
   dust flash fires and hydrogen explosion (Gallatin, TN), and (iii)
   Chevron Richmond refinery pipe rupture and fire (Richmond, CA). The
   starting point for the analysis is identification of the main hazardous
   materials, activities or conditions underlying the specific incident
   losses. These are, respectively: (i) Kleen Energy - purging of process
   pipelines with natural gas, (ii) Hoeganaes Corporation - accumulations
   of combustible iron dust in work areas, and (iii) Chevron Richmond
   refinery - a pipeline damage mechanism known as sulfidation corrosion.
   While the three incidents have many aspects in common, chief among the
   similarities are the key process safety concepts of inherently safer
   design (ISD), recognition of warning signs (precursor events), and
   safety culture. Each incident is analyzed for evidence of these
   concepts.
   The analysis is drawn from the relevant CSB investigation reports with
   the primary objective of illustrating the strong experiential learning
   that case histories of actual incidents can provide. While the lessons
   learned from these incidents are useful in and of themselves, capturing
   these lessons by incorporation in a safety management framework extends
   their usefulness to the prevention and mitigation of other potential
   process incidents. A typical process safety management system is
   employed in the current work to accomplish this secondary objective.
   Overall conclusions are made concerning the effectiveness of ISD,
   precursor recognition, and safety culture with respect to risk reduction
   in the process industries. It is anticipated that this work will help in
   communication of lessons learned to both the research and practice
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The clearing function models the non-linear relationship between WIP and
   throughput and has been proposed for production planning in environments
   with queuing (congestion) effects. However, incorporating clearing
   function concept in multi-product manufacturing networks is challenging.
   The traditional approach has been to model the clearing function at the
   bottleneck machine only. However, since the bottleneck shifts as the
   product release mix changes, this approach has its limitations. In this
   paper, the weakness of the bottleneck approach is highlighted using the
   mean-value analysis for the closed queuing network case. (C) 2016, IFAC

   Segmentation-Based Logit Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2565}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Abstract = {{A latent segmentation-based logit (LSL) modeling framework investigated
   the travel tool ownership of the elderly population in the greater
   Toronto area, Ontario, Canada. This study utilized data from the 2006
   Transportation Tomorrow Survey conducted in the greater Toronto area.
   The study developed five mutually exclusive travel tool ownership
   combinations or bundles for older adults. One of the unique features of
   this study is the development of an LSL model to capture unobserved
   heterogeneity in the older adults' travel tool ownership decisions. The
   LSL model captures unobserved heterogeneity by allocating individuals to
   discrete latent segments through a latent segment allocation model. The
   model results suggest that the LSL model is estimated for two latent
   segments in which less frequent trip makers are more likely to belong to
   Segment 1 and more frequent trip makers have a higher probability of
   belonging to Segment 2. Moreover, the model results suggest that
   considerable heterogeneity exists among the older adults in the two
   segments. For instance, older adults residing in a neighborhood with a
   higher percentage of owned dwellings prefer to own multiple travel tools
   in one latent segment and reveal an opposite relationship in another
   segment. Moreover, older adults living closer to regional business
   centers have a higher probability of owning a monthly transit pass in
   one segment and exhibit an opposite relationship in another segment.
   This diversity in travel behavior should be addressed within the
   transportation and land use policies to ensure an effective and
   equitable transportation system for older adults.}},

Title = {{Life-Oriented Approach of Modeling Commute Mode Loyalty and Transition
   Behavior}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2565}},
Pages = {{37-47}},
Abstract = {{This study developed a dynamic model for individuals' commute mode
   choice over their lifetime by using retrospective survey data. The study
   conceptualized that individuals reassessed their choice of commute mode
   when they relocated to a new residential location. Following the
   reappraisal, people either continued using the same mode, which was
   considered mode loyalty, or made a transition to a new mode, which was
   considered mode transition in this study. The study developed a panel
   based random-parameters logit model. One key feature of this study is a
   life-oriented approach to accommodate the effects of life-cycle events,
   longer-term changes, life-oriented sociodemographic transitions, and
   accessibility transitions. The model results suggest that the
   high-income group tends to be car loyal. No car ownership over the
   lifetime and the addition of a job increase the probability of transit
   loyalty. Individuals with no children in the household and residing in
   an area with high walk and bike usage have a higher probability to be
   loyal to active transportation. A decrease in household income and
   tenure transition from owned to rental are likely to trigger a
   transition from car to transit. However, the presence of children and
   the addition of a car increase the transition propensity from transit to
   car. The model results suggest that the use of life-oriented
   characteristics to explain longer-term commute mode loyalty and
   transition behavior provides important behavioral insights into the
   dynamics of individuals' travel behavior over their lifetime.}},

Title = {{Fuzzy Model Based Bilateral Control Design of Nonlinear Tele-Operation
   System Using Method of State Convergence}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{4119-4135}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a state convergence (SC)-based
   bilateral controller for a nonlinear teleoperation system, which has
   been approximated by a Takagi Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model. The selection of
   SC is made due to the advantages offered by this scheme both in the
   modeling and control design stages. The modeling stage considers
   master/slave systems, which can be represented by the nth order
   differential equations, while the control design stage offers an easy
   way to determine the control gains required for assigning desired closed
   loop dynamics to teleoperation system. After the master/slave systems
   are represented by TS fuzzy models, a stabilizing fuzzy law is adopted
   which allows deploying the SC scheme with all its benefits to design the
   fuzzy bilateral controller. In this way, not only the simplicity of the
   design scheme is ensured but also the existing SC scheme is able to
   control a nonlinear teleoperation system based on its TS fuzzy model
   description. As an additional advantage, the SC-based existing linear
   bilateral controller can be easily derived from the SC-based proposed
   fuzzy bilateral controller. Various cases of master/slave systems
   originally reported in terms of their linear model representation and
   communication in the absence/presence of time delay are all discussed in
   the corresponding fuzzy framework. The MATLAB simulations, considering a
   one-degree-of-freedom teleoperation system, are performed to validate
   the proposed methodology for controlling a nonlinear teleoperation
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional non-renewable electrical energy production has become an
   increasing concern due to its high costs, limited resources, and
   negative impacts. Scientists have begun to focus their research on
   renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is generally a clean source
   of supplying electrical loads, especially in remote and rural areas.
   Wind energy is one of the most commonly and rapidly growing renewable
   energy sources. This paper proposes two area and three area models of
   wind turbine systems connected as a new source of energy and their
   simulated models using a Simulink toolbox under Matlab. Also two reduced
   order models for each one are proposed using model order formulation
   technique (MOFT). These reduced order models are tested and their
   responses compared to the original models and proved a better
   performance. These models are compared with the reduced models using
   MATLAB code and the results show better performance of the proposed
   reduced models using MOFT over those using MATLAB code.}},

Title = {{Microsimulation-Based Emissions Modeling for a Major Infrastructure
   Renewal Plan: Assessment of Network Attributes and Land Use Effects on
   Vehicular Emissions}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2570}},
Pages = {{127-138}},
Abstract = {{This study demonstrated a comprehensive microsimulation-based emissions
   modeling framework for a 15.37-km-long road network in the downtown core
   of Halifax, Canada. The study developed a sequential microscopic traffic
   simulation and emissions modeling tool to estimate vehicular emissions
   at a finer-grain spatial resolution using instantaneous speed profiles.
   The study evaluated the effects of a major infrastructure renewal plan
   that focuses on rebuilding part of the expressway in the downtown core
   (e.g., the replacement of multigrade signalized intersections at the
   Cogswell interchange with roundabouts and associated improvements).
   Emissions were estimated for six major criteria pollutants, including
   greenhouse gas (GHG), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
   sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter with a diameter of 10 p,m or
   less (PM-10), and particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less
   (PM-2.5). The results showed significant changes in emission patterns
   caused by the infrastructure renewal plan. The study evaluated the
   sensitivity of different traffic attributes as well as their combined
   effect on emissions' variation. The results revealed that the plan
   increased emissions (from 4.246\% to 28.571\%) in the entire network.
   However, area-level evaluation suggested a reduction in emissions (from
   0.018\% to 19.855\%) in the roundabout area compared with the multigrade
   signalized intersections. A land use regression model was also developed
   to examine the potential effect of land use and built environment
   attributes on emissions. The microscopic emissions model's results will
   assist transportation planners in considering strategies to mitigate air
   pollution in the final design and implementation of the infrastructure
   renewal plan.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of anthocyanins in food products is limited by their

   differed in physicochemical properties. Kinetic and thermodynamic
   parameters for anthocyanin degradation in accelerated shelf life studies
   at 70, 80, and 90 degrees C were determined using the Arrhenius model.
   The half-life (t(1/2)) varied from 0.96h (freeze-dried extract) to 108
   days (encapsulated extract). Our results demonstrate that freeze-dried
   berry encapsulates effectively retard anthocyanin degradation during

Abstract = {{Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) helps to regulate the

   N-succinylchitosan (SC) nanoparticles, with and without heparin, at two
   levels of initial loading, followed by further characterization of the
   particles. Release studies were conducted using radiolabeled bFGF-loaded
   nanoparticles. Both types of nanoparticles loaded similar amounts of
   bFGF (60.2 and 68.6\% for CS and SC, respectively). The release profile
   varied greatly among the samples, and a burst release was observed in
   most cases, with the release amount approaching its final value in the
   first 6 h. The final amount released varied from 1.5 to 18\% of the
   amount of bFGF-entrapped. The concomitant encapsulation of heparin and
   the use of SC as a nanoparticle matrix contributed to the largest amount
   of bFGF release (18\%) over the time investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen is a major constituent in many life forms; in mammals, collagen
   appears as a component of skin, bone, tendon and cartilage, where it
   performs critical functions. Vibrational spectroscopy methods are
   excellent for studying the structure and function of collagen-containing
   tissues, as they provide molecular insight into composition and
   organization. The latter is particularly important for collagenous
   materials, given that a key feature is their hierarchical, oriented
   structure, organized from molecular to macroscopic length scales. Here,
   we present the first results of high-resolution FTIR polarization
   contrast imaging, at 1.1 mu m and 20 nm scales, on control and
   mechanically damaged tendon. The spectroscopic data are supported with
   parallel SEM and correlated AFM imaging. Our goal is to explore the
   changes induced in tendon after the application of damaging mechanical
   stress, and the consequences for the healing processes. The results and
   possibilities for the application of these high-spatial-resolution FTIR
   techniques in spectral pathology, and eventually in clinical
   applications, are discussed.}},

   is to minimize the human machine interaction force while carrying

   model the human Machine interface. A cascade force control method is
   adopted with high-level controller generating the reference position
   command while low level controller doing motion tracking. Adaptive
   robust control(ARC) algorithm is developed for both two controllers to
   deal with the effect of parametric uncertainties and uncertain
   nonlinearities of the system. The proposed adaptive robust cascade force
   controller can achieve small human-machine interaction force and good
   robust performance to model uncertainty which have been validated by

Abstract = {{We theoretically investigate slow light generation using stimulated
   Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a short highly nonlinear liquid-filled
   photonic crystal fiber (PCF). We study optical properties of hollow-core
   PCFs, filled with liquids exhibiting strong optical nonlinearities. We
   propose a design of carbon-disulfide-filled fiber with an effective area
   of 1.8 mu m(2), nonlinear coefficient larger than 7300W(-1) km(-1),
   confinement loss of 0.007 dB/km and total loss lower than 0.3 dB/m over
   the C-band. Relative to standard single mode fibers, the proposed fiber
   reduces power x fiber length requirement for a given gain (delay) by
   nearly three orders of magnitude (830 times). Furthermore, using just a
   1-m long fiber, we demonstrate that pulses can be slowed down to c/50
   with a required power level of only 25 mW. We show that our PCF is about
   7 times more efficient than the previously reported fiber designs. (C)

   potential, potentiodynamic polarisation and cyclic polarisation. Results
   indicate that the lowest binder content results in greater potential to
   resist corrosion. It is demonstrated that the Ni3Al binder undergoes
   dissolution for the examined conditions, which was confirmed through the
   high amount of Al and Ni in the electrolyte solutions following testing.
   It was also confirmed from the electrochemical experiments and the SEM
   that localised corrosion was visible.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial immune network algorithm (AINA) combined with position
   tracking control method is used for multi-robot formation path planning.
   The proposed algorithm avoids obstacles and recovers formation for
   follower robot after passing around obstacles. Different methods are
   adopted to calculate the steering direction and the linear velocity of
   the follower robot. Steering direction of the follower robot is computed
   with AINA. AINA has abilities of self-recognition and diversity, and
   solves the problems of local minima and immature convergence. The
   optimal steering direction selected with AINA quickly tends towards the
   steering direction of leader robot, and successfully avoids obstacles.
   The linear velocity of follower robot is computed with position tracking
   control method. It is computed based on the state of leader robot,
   current position of follower robot, and position of virtual robot. It
   guarantees that the position errors of follower robot quickly converge
   to zeros. The asymptotic stability of the entire formation system is
   proven with Lyapunov theory. Numerous experiments validate that the
   proposed algorithm successfully avoids obstacles and quickly tracks the
   leader robot for follower robot.}},

Title = {{EFFECT OF SPLIT FERTILIZATION ON SUBSURFACE WATER QUALITY IN WILD
   BLUEBERRY FIELDS}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-88}},
Abstract = {{The majority of wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifloium Ait.) fields are
   situated in acidic soils, having poor water holding capacities, weed
   patches, gentle to severe topography, and substantial proportion of bare
   spots, which emphasize the need for variable rate split (VRS)
   fertilization. Two commercial wild blueberry sites were selected in Nova
   Scotia, Canada to evaluate the impact of VRS fertilization on subsurface
   water contamination. The sites were divided into three sections {[}VRS
   section, uniform rate split (URS) section, and uniform rate (UR)
   section]. Prescription maps were generated with ArcGIS 10.1 software
   based on slope variation for VRS fertilization. Fertilization was
   performed based on the prescription maps using variable rate (VR)
   spreader. Fifty-four lysimeters were installed in VRS, URS, and UR
   treatment sections to collect subsurface water samples. Subsurface water
   samples were collected after every heavy rainfall event (>15 mm), and
   were analyzed for nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen
   (NH4+-N) concentrations. Leaf samples were collected from each
   fertilizer treatment and analyzed for macro and micro nutrients. Results
   suggested that the VRS treatment significantly decreased (p < 0.05)
   NO3--N and NH4+-N concentrations in subsurface water samples when
   compared to URS and UR treatments. Overall for the Cooper site, mean
   NO3--N leaching under the VRS treatment section were 45\% and 47\% lower
   as compared to the URS and UR treatment sections, respectively. However,
   mean values of NH4+-N concentration under the VRS treatment section of
   the North River site were 38\% and 45\% lower as compared to the URS and
   UR treatment sections, respectively. Results revealed that the VRS
   treatment did not have any negative effect on leaf nutrient
   concentrations. The VRS fertilization saved almost 40\% in this study.
   Results demonstrated that the VRS fertilization in wild blueberry fields
   can increase fertilizer use efficiency and reduce water contamination
   via subsurface leaching.}},

Abstract = {{A highly conductive electrolytic nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) plating bath
   was formulated as an alternative to electroless Ni-P deposition for
   aluminium wire bonding application. The Ni-P deposits were electroplated
   from nickel citrate baths containing sodium chloride, citric acid,
   nickel sulphate and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) using the DC plating. In
   comparison with Watts bath, the formulated highly conductive citrate
   bath had almost twice of cathodic current efficiency in low-current
   density regions and exhibited more uniform plating thickness. In
   addition, the formulated citrate bath did not have any boric acid as a
   component; and hence, eliminating the waste disposal issue related to
   boric acid.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{45-52}},
Abstract = {{Powder metallurgy can be used to produce near-net-shape magnesium parts
   and also allows unique chemical compositions to be achieved that can
   lead to new alloys with novel properties. However, the surface layer
   formed on the magnesium powders during processing acts as a barrier to
   diffusion and sintering is less effective. The layer, formed by
   reactions with the atmosphere, contains oxides, hydroxides and carbonate
   hydrates of magnesium. To overcome this barrier, small additions of
   calcium or yttrium metal powders were made to the Mg matrix. The oxides
   of Ca and Y are thermodynamically more stable than magnesium oxide, and
   will disrupt the surface layer. The present work reports the results of
   investigation by differential scanning calorimetry, and focussed ion
   beam (FIB) microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), on the
   effect of calcium and yttrium additions during the sintering of
   magnesium powder. FIB examination of sintered Mg-1 wt-\% Ca show that
   secondary phases are located along grain boundaries as well as inside
   porosity, which confirms the characteristic mechanism of magnesium
   sintering. A TEM specimen made by a FIB liftout process was also
   examined by TEM and EDS and indicates that the sintering process was
   successful, with the elemental distribution being as predicted by
   sintering.}},

Abstract = {{A salmon protein hydrolysate (SPH) was produced from consecutive
   enzymatic hydrolysis of salmon muscle proteins with pepsin followed by
   trypsin + chymotrypsin. The SPH was separated into four (SF1-SF4)
   reverse-phase HPLC peptide fractions. The SF3 peptide fraction was the
   most active against both angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin
   activities during in vitro tests. SPH and SF3 inhibited ACE activity
   uncompetitively but renin inhibition was non-competitive. SPH and SF3
   were orally administered (200 and 30 mg/kg body weight, respectively) to
   spontaneously hypertensive rats, followed by systolic blood pressure
   (SBP) measurements. The SF3 significantly (p < 0.05) reduced SBP by a
   maximum value of -42.1 +/- 3.4 mmHg when compared to -21.1 +/- 4.5 mmHg
   for SPH 2 h after oral administration. Mass spectrometry analysis showed
   some differences in the peptide ion composition, which may have
   contributed to the observed differences in SBP-reducing effects of SPH

Abstract = {{Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are a family of cardioprotective hormones
   with numerous beneficial effects in cardiovascular system. The NP family
   includes several peptides including atrial NP (ANP), B-type NP (BNP),
   C-type NP (CNP) and Dendroaspis NP (DNP). These peptides elicit their
   effects by binding to three distinct cell surface receptors called
   natriuretic peptide receptors A, B and C (NPR-A, NPR-B and NPR-C). NPR-A
   (which binds ANP, BNP and DNP) and NPR-B (which is selective for CNP)
   are particulate guanylyl cyclase (GC)-linked receptors that mediate
   increases in cGMP upon activation. cGMP can then target several
   downstream signaling molecules including protein kinase G (PKG),
   phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) and phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). NPR-C, which
   is able to bind all NPs with comparable affinity, is coupled to the
   activation of inhibitory G-proteins (G(i)) that inhibit adenylyl cyclase
   (AC) activity and reduce CAMP levels. NPs are best known for their
   ability to regulate blood volume and fluid homeostasis. More recently,
   however, it has become apparent that NPs are essential regulators of
   cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Evidence for this comes
   from numerous studies of the effects of NPs on cardiac electrophysiology
   and ion channel function in different regions and cell types within the
   heart, as well as the identification of mutations in the NP system that
   cause atrial fibrillation in humans. Despite the strong evidence that
   NPs regulate cardiac electrophysiology different studies have reported
   varying effects of NPs. The reasons for disparate observations are not
   fully understood, but likely occur as a result of several factors,
   including the fact that NP signaling can be highly complex and involve
   multiple receptors and/or downstream signaling molecules which may be
   differentially activated in different conditions. The goal of this
   review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the different effects of
   NPs on cardiac electrophysiology that have been described and to provide
   rationale and explanation for why different results may be obtained in
   different studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   SMALL WATERSHED}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Both agricultural land uses and residential on-site wastewater systems
   (OWS) have the potential to be non-point sources of phosphorus (P) in
   rural watersheds. Watershed-scale computer models are a commonly used
   tool for evaluating the impacts of increased human development on P
   dynamics and for evaluating how beneficial management practices (BMPs)
   can reduce P loading. Many agricultural field BMPs have been evaluated
   using watershed-scale models; however, no studies have compared their
   efficacy to OWS BMPs in a mixed land use watershed. The objectives of
   this research were to (1) use the P on-site wastewater simulator
   (POWSIM) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate
   different agricultural and residential development scenarios in the
   Thomas Brook watershed in Nova Scotia, Canada, and evaluate their
   impacts on sediment and total P (TP) loads and TP concentrations and (2)
   simulate and evaluate different individual and combinations of select
   agricultural and OWS BMPs. A 50-year simulation period was used for both
   the development and BMP scenarios. The development scenarios evaluated
   included increasing the residential population and conversion of hay
   fields or pastures to corn-based cropping regimes. The agricultural BMPs
   evaluated were (1) corn and rotational crop replacement with no-till
   agricultural land uses and (2) no-till corn. Decreased failure rates,
   increased watercourse setbacks, disposal field replacement, and the use
   of high P sorption filter media were the OWS BMPs evaluated. The
   agricultural development scenarios increased cumulative sediment and P
   loads at the watershed outlet, while the residential scenarios increased
   the frequency of hyper-eutrophic conditions in the stream during the
   last 20 simulated years. Agricultural crop replacement BMPs produced the
   highest reductions in cumulative sediment (13\% to 46\%) and TP loads
   (26\% to 34\%) but had no observable change on the in-stream trophic
   status. The OWS BMPs produced small reductions in TP loading (2\% to
   15\%), no sediment load reductions, but had a positive effect on the
   trophic status. The best ranked combination of agricultural and OWS BMPs
   resulted in a cumulative TP load reduction of 58\%, and the dominant
   trophic state at the end of the 50-year period was mesotrophic, as
   compared to eutrophic for the reference simulation. The best combination
   BMP scenario included replacing corn and rotational crops with pastures,
   using high P sorption filter media (5000 mg P kg(-1) media), and
   lowering of the OWS failure rate to 5\%. The results of these modeling
   scenarios showed that agricultural BMPs were most effective in reducing
   cumulative P loads, while OWS BMPs were effective in mitigating
   in-stream eutrophication impacts. This study highlights the importance
   of identifying specific water quality issues that need to be targeted
   prior to implementing a watershed BMP strategy. Further model refinement
   and testing are required with improved field measurements to improve
   model confidence before the model should be used for planning and design
   purposes.}},

   surface finish. For the grinding conditions used in this research, it
   was observed that the proposed dressing model is able to accurately
   predict the resulting workpiece surface finish for all dressing
   conditions tested. Furthermore, similar trends were observed between the

Journal = {{SHIPS AND OFFSHORE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{228-244}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulation based on finite element modelling is used to study
   the influence of residual stress and distortion on the behaviour of tee-
   and angle-stiffened plates under axial compression. Residual stress and
   distortion due to welding of the stiffener to the plate are calculated
   by three-dimensioanl thermo-elasto-plastic finite element analysis. The
   behaviour of 14 stiffened plates under compressive axial loads is
   evaluated both with and without welding-induced residual stress and the
   results are compared with classification society design equations. The
   results show that the ultimate strength of angle- and tee-stiffened
   plates may be reduced by as much as 12.5\% due to the presence of
   welding-induced residual stress. Comparison of load-shortening curves
   generated by finite element analysis with those derived from
   International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) design
   equations for both types of stiffener shows that for ultimate strength,
   the two methods compare well. In the post-ultimate portion of the
   load-shortening curves, IACS design equations are found to overestimate
   the post-ultimate capacity of stiffened plates which may affect the
   accuracy of ultimate strength calculations for ship hull girders.}},

Title = {{Reliability analysis with Metamodel Line Sampling}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for reliability analysis of engineering
   structures, referred to as Metamodel Line Sampling (MLS). The approach
   utilizes a metamodel of the performance function, within the framework
   of the Line Sampling method, to reduce computational demands associated
   with the reliability analysis of engineering structures. Given a
   metamodel of the performance function, the failure probability is
   estimated as a product of a metamodel-based failure probability and a
   correction coefficient. The correction coefficient accounts for the
   error in the metamodel estimate of failure probability introduced by the

Abstract = {{Fluorescence spectroscopy shows promise as a tool for monitoring

   applications. Prediction of DBP formation via fluorescence spectroscopy
   was investigated using drinking water treatment plant (WTP) samples and
   experimental data from bench-scale advanced oxidation processes applied
   to a natural water matrix. L-1-Regularized linear regression (lasso),
   boosted regression tree ensembles, principal components regression,
   supervised principal components, and fluorescent regional integration
   models were applied to data comprising instantaneous haloacetic acid
   (HAA) and trihalomethane (THM) concentrations and DBP formation
   potentials (HAAfp and THMfp) paired with fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrices. L-1-Regularized linear regression yielded
   the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), assessed by cross-validation, on
   HAA and HAAfp data collected at the WTP (7.7 mu g L-1, N = 22). Boosted
   regression tree ensemble predictions had the lowest MAE on WTP THM and
   THMfp data (13.5 mu g L-1, N = 37). L-1-Regularized linear regression
   and supervised principal components, respectively, exhibited the
   greatest prediction accuracy (MAE 14.9 and 9.5 mu g L-1, N = 60) for
   HAAfp and THMfp data generated via bench-scale advanced oxidation
   processes. Linear models based on either fluorescent regional
   integration or (unsupervised) principal components were consistently
   less accurate than the highest-performing methods for DBP prediction.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{1. Knowledge of animal diets can provide important insights into life
   history and ecology, relationships among species in a community and
   potential response to ecosystem change or perturbation. Quantitative
   fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) is a method of estimating diets
   from data on the composition, or signature, of fatty acids stored in
   adipose tissue. Given data on signatures of potential prey, a predator
   diet is estimated by minimizing the distance between its signature and a
   mixture of prey signatures. Calibration coefficients, constants derived
   from feeding trials, are used to account for differential metabolism of
   individual fatty acids. QFASA has been widely applied since its
   introduction and several variants of the original estimator have
   appeared in the literature. However, work to compare the statistical
   properties of QFASA estimators has been limited.
   2. One important characteristic of an estimator is its robustness to
   violations of model assumptions. The primary assumptions of QFASA are
   that prey signature data contain representatives of all prey types
   consumed and the calibration coefficients are known without error. We
   investigated the robustness of two QFASA estimators to a range of
   violations of these assumptions using computer simulation and recorded
   the resulting bias in diet estimates.
   3. We found that the Aitchison distance measure was most robust to
   errors in the calibration coefficients. Conversely, the Kullback-Leibler
   distance measure was most robust to the consumption of prey without
   representation in the prey signature data.
   4. In most QFASA applications, investigators will generally have some
   knowledge of the prey available to predators and be able to assess the
   completeness of prey signature data and sample additional prey as
   necessary. Conversely, because calibration coefficients are derived from
   feeding trials with captive animals and their values may be sensitive to
   consumer physiology and nutritional status, their applicability to
   free-ranging animals is difficult to establish. We therefore recommend
   that investigators first make any improvements to the prey signature
   data that seem warranted and then base estimation on the Aitchison
   distance measure, as it appears to minimize risk from violations of the
   assumption that is most difficult to verify.}},

Pages = {{42-46}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pressurized, inflated balls used in professional sports are regulated so
   that their behaviour upon impact can be anticipated and allow the game
   to have its distinctive character. However, the dynamics governing the
   impacts of such balls, even on stationary hard surfaces, can be
   extremely complex. The energy transformations, which arise from the
   compression of the gas within the ball and from the shear forces
   associated with the deformation of the wall, are examined in this paper.
   We develop a simple mechanistic model of the dependence of the
   coefficient of restitution, e, upon both the gauge pressure, P-G, of the
   gas and the shear modulus, G, of the wall. The model is validated using
   the results from a simple series of experiments using three different
   sports balls. The fits to the data are extremely good for P-G > 25 kPa
   and consistent values are obtained for the value of G for the wall
   material. As far as the authors can tell, this simple, mechanistic model
   of the pressure dependence of the coefficient of restitution is the
   first in the literature.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ebullated bed reactors are commonly found within resid hydroprocessors
   used to thermally crack and catalytically hydrogenate atmosphere and

   historically experienced very high solids-free gas holdups above 30\%,
   displacing heavy feed and limiting product throughput, with significant
   focus placed on the effects of the internal recycle geometry on column
   performance. A fully functional 3D CFD framework for simulating the gas
   separation region is presented here, capable of capturing tangential and
   rotational fluid motion and transient gas separation dynamics. The model
   is applied to a first-generation recycle cup separator design and is
   used to explore operational parameters (fluid velocity, bubble
   size/holdup, recycle rate, and foam generation) and the choice of
   momentum coupling strategy on gas entrainment and separation efficiency.
   The results provide a framework for comparison and evaluation of future
   designs as well as fundamental insight in the separation dynamics in the
   freeboard region of this reactor, with efforts ongoing to compare and

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{79-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is an important risk factor for knee osteoarthritis
   initiation and progression. However, it is unclear how obesity may
   directly affect the mechanical loading environment of the knee joint,
   initiating or progressing joint degeneration. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the interacting role of obesity and moderate
   knee osteoarthritis presence on tibiofemoral contact forces and muscle
   forces within the knee joint during walking gait.
   Methods: Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed on 80
   asymptomatic participants and 115 individuals diagnosed with moderate
   knee osteoarthritis. Each group was divided into three body mass index
   categories: healthy weight (body mass index < 25), overweight (25 <=
   body mass index <= 30), and obese (body mass index > 30). Tibiofemoral
   anterior posterior shear and compressive forces, as well as quadriceps,
   hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscle forces, were estimated based on a
   sagittal plane contact force model. Peak contact and muscle forces
   during gait were compared between groups, as well as the interaction
   between disease presence and body mass index category, using a
   two-factor analysis of variance.
   Findings: There were significant osteoarthritis effects in peak shear,
   gastrocnemius and quadriceps forces only when they were normalized to
   body mass, and there were significant BMI effects in peak shear,
   compression, gastrocnemius and hamstrings forces only in absolute,
   non-normalized forces. There was a significant interaction effect in
   peak quadriceps muscle forces, with higher forces in overweight and
   obese groups compared to asymptomatic healthy weight participants.
   Interpretation: Body mass index was associated with higher absolute
   tibiofemoral compression and shear forces as well as posterior muscle
   forces during gait, regardless of moderate osteoarthritis presence or
   absence. The differences found may contribute to accelerated joint
   damage with obesity, but with the osteoarthritic knees less able to
   accommodate the high loads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model predictive control strategy method is developed for a LEED
   silver community college building that contains an advanced common loop
   heat pump HVAC system. MPC is performed using persistence based climate
   forecasting with two scenarios examined: fixed temperature setpoint
   pairs; and a dead band of 1 degrees C between the heating/cooling
   setpoint. EnergyPlus acts as the ``real{''} building and is linked with
   R software for model predictive control via the Building Controls
   Virtual Test Bed. A statistical based building response model is created
   in R using training data from a calibrated EnergyPlus model. A brute
   force optimization strategy is used for solving the objective function.
   A piece-wise objective function maintains thermal comfort during
   occupied periods with a focus on reducing energy consumption during
   other periods. Results when using fixed setpoint pairs exhibit a 4\%
   reduction in HVAC energy consumption, and deadband setpoints exhibit a
   9\% reduction in HVAC energy consumption, compared with reactive rule
   based control. Of interest is that the type of energy savings (thermal
   energy vs electricity) varies depending upon the setpoint options. The
   results are promising given the strict thermal comfort requirement
   employed, minimal search space, use of simplistic persistence
   forecasting, and the sophisticated HVAC system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Pages = {{223-232}},
Abstract = {{Floc size distribution is of high operational importance as it governs
   the transport and removal of contaminants from drinking water. The
   complex nature of turbulent flow in treatment plants has limited the
   research to quantify the dynamics of flocculation. This paper describes
   the use of a submersible digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM)
   technique for the measurement of the spatial distribution of floc sizes
   in a direct filtration treatment facility. The DIHM tool was positioned
   at thirteen different locations in a flocculation tank and holograms
   were recorded for at least 10 minutes at each location. The acquisition
   of morphological details of flocs (e.g., floc counts, size distributions
   and floc velocities relative to the fluid motion) from the reconstructed
   DIHM images is discussed. The results of the spatial distribution of
   floc sizes indicated that the volume equivalent floc diameter measured
   in the flocculation tank was mostly of large-sized aggregates greater
   than 100 mu m, which can have adverse impacts on the performance of a
   direct filtration process. The relative motion of flocs calculated from
   the DIHM analysis ranged from 0.002 to 0.008 m s(-1). Results showed
   that the investigated DIHM technique could be used as an operational
   tool to evaluate flocculation performance in terms of floc sizes, which
   is otherwise difficult to characterize in most treatment plants. The
   information acquired from this tool is important to understand the fate
   and transport of flocs during flocculation for process optimization that
   can lead to minimize chemical and energy usage in treatment plants.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphosphate is a highly water-soluble linear polyanion comprised of
   phosphate groups. A phase separation happens when divalent cations are
   added to polyphosphate solutions resulting in the formation of
   polyphosphate coacervates. Such coacervates could potentially be used as
   a glass precursor or in a variety of bioapplications including
   microencapsulation. In all of these applications, viscoelastic
   properties of polyphosphate coacervates directly affect their usage.
   Here, we show that these polyphosphate coacervates act as extremely
   viscous Newtonian liquids at low shear rates, with their viscosity
   highly dependent on the polyphosphate degree of polymerization (D-p) and
   type of divalent cations (Ca2+, Sr-2+, or Ba2+) used for their
   preparation. For Ca2+-only polyphosphate coacervates, specific viscosity
   is directly related to D-p(1.46) at 20 degrees C, similar to highly
   concentrated polymer solutions where chain entanglement is not
   important. For very long chain polyphosphate coacervates, however,
   elastic properties are dominant presumably caused by physical chain
   entanglement. Replacement of a fraction of Ca2+ with Sr2+ or Ba2+
   results in coacervates having significantly more elastic characters and
   profoundly higher viscosity than their Ca2+-only counterparts. Overall,
   varying polyphosphate chain length and divalent cation type allows one
   to modify these materials for a desired application. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Parametric Study of Strain Rate Effects on Nanoparticle-Reinforced
   Polymer Composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Crashworthiness, energy absorption capacity, and safety are important
   factors in the design of lightweight vehicles made of fiber-reinforced
   polymer composite (FRP) components. The relatively recent emergence of
   the nanotechnology industry has presented a novel means to augment the
   mechanical properties of various materials. As a result, recent attempts
   have contemplated the use of nanoparticles to further improve the
   resiliency of resins, especially when resins are used for mating FRP
   components. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the response of
   nanoreinforced polymer composites, subjected to various rates of
   loading, is of paramount importance for developing reliable structures.
   In this paper, the effects of nanoreinforcement on the mechanical
   response of a commonly used epoxy resin subjected to four different
   strain rates, are systematically investigated. The results are then
   compared to those of the neat resin. To characterize the mechanical
   properties of the nanocomposite, a combination of the strain
   rate-dependent mechanical (SRDM) model of Goldberg and his coworkers and
   Halpin-Tsai's micromechanical approach is employed. Subsequently, a
   parametric study is conducted to ascertain the influences of particle
   type and their weight percentage. Finally, the numerical results are
   compared to the experimental data obtained from testing of the neat and
   the nanoreinforced epoxy resin.}},

Abstract = {{Noninvasive cardiac electrophysiological (EP) imaging aims to
   mathematically reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of cardiac
   sources from body-surface electrocardiographic (ECG) data. This
   ill-posed problem is often regularized by a fixed constraining model.
   However, a fixed-model approach enforces the source distribution to
   follow a pre-assumed structure that does not always match the varying
   spatiotemporal distribution of actual sources. To understand the
   model-data relation and examine the impact of prior models, we present a
   multiple-model approach for volumetric cardiac EP imaging where multiple
   prior models are included and automatically picked by the available ECG
   data. Multiple models are incorporated as an Lp-norm prior for sources,
   where p is an unknown hyperparameter with a prior uniform distribution.
   To examine how different combinations of models may be favored by
   different measurement data, the posterior distribution of cardiac
   sources and hyperparameter is calculated using a Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo (MCMC) technique. The importance of multiple-model prior was
   assessed in two sets of synthetic and real-data experiments, compared to
   fixed-model priors (using Laplace and Gaussian priors). The results
   showed that the posterior combination of models (the posterior
   distribution of) as determined by the ECG data differed substantially
   when reconstructing sources with different sizes and structures. While
   the use of fixed models is best suited in situations where the prior
   assumption fits the actual source structures, the use of an
   automatically adaptive set of models may have the ability to better
   address model-data mismatch and to provide consistent performance in
   reconstructing sources with different properties.}},

Abstract = {{A study of real-time performance of phase-change material (PCM) for
   solar thermal energy storage was conducted using a commercially
   available 2.78m(2) (aperture) flat-plate solar thermal collector and a
   custom 60 L latent heat storage tank filled with dodecanoic acid as the
   PCM. A water-glycol heat transfer solution was circulated, and the
   charging performance of the system was observed in relation to incoming
   solar radiation. Municipal water was run in the cold loop of the heat
   exchanger to simulate domestic water use and to discharge the system.
   Temperature distribution within the PCM material was recorded using an
   array of thermocouples deployed throughout the storage tank.
   Characterization of two storage systems using identical mass of PCM and
   water indicated that the latent heat energy storage system (LHESS) would
   benefit from an improved heat exchanger design. Water-based storage had
   higher charging and discharging rates but a lower overall storage
   capacity. The dodecanoic acid LHESS was capable of outperforming an
   equivalent water storage system by absorbing 20\% more thermal energy. A
   14-hour solar charge in July 2014 melted the vast majority of PCM,
   raised storage temperatures to over 70 degrees C, and transferred 12 MJ
   of energy, with a peak power rate of 0.55 kW. The results suggest that
   LHESS can offer potentially important reduction in thermal storage
   volumes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapeutic-loaded bone cement may be an effective method of drug
   delivery for the management of cancer-related vertebral fractures that
   require cement injection for pain relief. Recent advancements in the
   development of aluminum-free glass ionomer cements (GICs) have rendered
   this class of biomaterials clinically viable for such applications. To
   expand the therapeutic benefits of these materials, this study examined,
   for the first time, their drug delivery potential. Through incrementally
   loading the GIC with methotrexate (MTX) by up to 10-wt\%,
   composition-property relationships were established, correlating MTX
   loading with working time and setting time, as well as compressive
   strength, drug release, and cytotoxic effect over 31 days. The most
   significant finding of this study was that MTX was readily released from
   the GIC, while maintaining cytotoxic activity. Release correlated
   linearly with initial loading and appeared to be diffusion mediated,
   delivering a total of 1-2\% of the incorporated drug. MTX loading in
   this range exerted minimal effects to handling and strength, indicating
   the clinical utility of the material was not compromised by MTX loading.
   The MTX-GIC systems examined herein are promising materials for combined
   structural delivery applications.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of ions into a local delivery matrix is one method of
   managing degradation and subsequent release of the incorporated
   therapeutic agents. Of interest in this study was whether we could
   modify the structural nature of calcium polyphosphate (CPP) glass and
   the subsequent therapeutic potential of this local delivery matrix with
   inclusion of strontium (Sr). We found that adding 10 mol\% Sr
   significantly increased the density and chain length of the glass. There
   was no significant impact of Sr doping on the subsequent loading of
   vancomycin into the matrix, or the matrix porosity. The noted
   differences in structural stability, ion release, and vancomycin release
   between the un-doped CPP matrices and 10 mol\% Sr-doped CPP matrices in
   vitro are likely a result of a decrease in glass disorder upon Sr
   addition to the glass and preferential retention of Sr over Ca during
   matrix degradation. This study has provided further evidence that Sr
   incorporation may serve to both manipulate antibiotic release from the
   amorphous CPP matrix and provide a potential source of therapeutic ions
   for enhanced bone regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, EHD was applied for apple slices drying through a
   multiple needle-to-plate electrode with a fixed 25 mm gap, using
   different combinations of voltage and air velocity at room temperature.
   Effects of EHD on drying kinetics, color degradation, and energy
   consumption were studied. High voltage significantly increased drying
   rate by 1.5-4 times at high (5 m/s) and low (1 m/s) air velocity,
   respectively. Combined EHD-convective drying was more efficient for
   moisture removal than sole EHD drying. The most significant effect of
   EHD on drying rate was observed at the highest voltage and low air
   velocity. Effect of EHD on color was insignificant at voltages below 10
   kV, but higher voltage intensified progressively color degradation.
   Energy, used in EHD drying, was negligibly small (1-2\%) as compared to
   the total energy consumption of AC/DC converter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{299}},
Pages = {{562-569}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption capacity of phenol and naphthalene by powdered activated
   carbon (PAC), a commercial organoclay (OC) and a lab synthesized
   organoclay (BTMA) was studied using batch adsorption experiments under
   variable feed water quality conditions including single- and multi-
   solute conditions, fresh water, saline water and oily-and-saline water.
   Increasing salinity levels was found to reduce adsorption capacity of
   OC, likely due to destabilization, aggregation and subsequent removal of
   organoclay from the water column, but did not negatively impact
   adsorption capacity of PAC or BTMA. Increased dispersed oil
   concentrations were found to reduce the surface area of all adsorbents.
   This decreased the adsorption capacity of PAC for both phenol and
   naphthalene, and reduced BTMA adsorption of phenol, but did not
   negatively affect naphthalene removals by either organoclay. The
   presence of naphthalene as a co-solute significantly reduced phenol
   adsorption by PAC, but had no impact on organoclay adsorption. These
   results indicated that adsorption by PAC occurred via a surface
   adsorption mechanism, while organoclay adsorption occurred by
   hydrophobic or pi electron interactions. In general, PAC was more
   sensitive to changes in water quality than either of the organoclays
   evaluated in this study. However, PAC exhibited a higher adsorption
   capacity for phenol and naphthalene compared to both organoclays even in
   adverse water quality conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The modeling and simulation of domestic hot water systems, including
   solar thermal and co-generation technologies, relies on accurate, high
   time-step resolution water consumption profiles. Due to the expensive
   nature of field studies, previous profiles have been limited in number
   of participants, or have been generated synthetically using
   probabilistic modelling techniques. The Solar City program in Halifax
   has measured hot water flow rate and temperature data in 119 homes at a
   time-step of 1 min; and includes a survey of occupancy rates and other
   relevant meta-data. In this paper, we discuss the data acquisition and
   processing (with a focus on flow rate data), and conduct analysis to
   reveal consumption trends and produce a new set of time-step profiles
   for modeling and simulation. Average hot water consumption per household
   is 172 L/day with a strong dependency on number of occupants. The hourly
   profile peaks twice daily, and shifts by several hours on Sunday. The
   average draw temperature was found to be 51.8 degrees C, which is lower
   than the default value of 55 degrees C applied by many building
   modeling/simulation packages. The average cold water supply temperature
   was found to be roughly sinusoidal about 12.4 degrees C with
   approximately one-month lag compared to ambient air temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of increasing substitutions of La2O3:Na2O on the structure
   (B-11 MAS NMR) and properties, specifically strontium (Sr) ion release
   from five quaternary borate glass compositions (B2O3-SrO-Na2O-La2O3) was
   studied. To examine component ion release, samples were extracted under
   simulated physiological conditions at 37 degrees C for five extraction
   time points (24, 72, 168,336 and 720 h). A linear release profile for
   strontium was provided by composition LB102
   (70B(2)O(3)-20Sr0-6Na(2)O-4La(2)O(3)) for up to 720 h. B-11 MAS NMR was
   used to investigate the impact of La2O3:Na2O substitution on the boron
   structure and speciation. Substitutions appeared to have minor effects
   on borate speciation, with the only change being a decrease in the
   proportion of BO4 at maximum La2O3 loading
   (70B(2)O(3)-20SrO-10La(2)O(3)). These data further demonstrate the
   possible utility of high boron glasses as controllable degradable
   materials for the delivery of therapeutic metal ions, such as strontium.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose mathematical optimization models of household

   while preserving the user preferences. User comfort is modelled in a
   simple way, which considers appliance class, user preferences and
   weather conditions. The wind-driven optimization (WDO) algorithm with
   the objective function of comfort maximization along with minimum
   electricity cost is defined and implemented. On the other hand, for
   maximum electricity bill and peak reduction, min-max regret-based
   knapsack problem (K-WDO) algorithm is used. To validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, extensive simulations are
   conducted for several scenarios. The simulations show that the proposed
   algorithms provide with the best optimal results with a fast convergence
   rate, as compared to the existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In the operation of a smart grid (SG), day-ahead load forecasting (DLF)
   is an important task. The SG can enhance the management of its
   conventional and renewable resources with a more accurate DLF model.
   However, DLF model development is highly challenging due to the
   non-linear characteristics of load time series in SGs. In the
   literature, DLF models do exist; however, these models trade off between
   execution time and forecast accuracy. The newly-proposed DLF model will
   be able to accurately predict the load of the next day with a fair
   enough execution time. Our proposed model consists of three modules; the
   data preparation module, feature selection and the forecast module. The
   first module makes the historical load curve compatible with the feature
   selection module. The second module removes redundant and irrelevant
   features from the input data. The third module, which consists of an
   artificial neural network (ANN), predicts future load on the basis of
   selected features. Moreover, the forecast module uses a sigmoid function
   for activation and a multi-variate auto-regressive model for weight
   updating during the training process. Simulations are conducted in
   MATLAB to validate the performance of our newly-proposed DLF model in
   terms of accuracy and execution time. Results show that our proposed
   modified feature selection and modified ANN (m(FS + ANN))-based model
   for SGs is able to capture the non-linearity(ies) in the history load
   curve with 97.11\% accuracy. Moreover, this accuracy is achieved at the
   cost of a fair enough execution time, i.e., we have decreased the
   average execution time of the existing FS + ANN-based model by 38.50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Legislation aimed at protecting the marine ecosystems has direct impacts
   on environmental management of port and harbour operations. As such,
   environmental management of harbours requires a great deal of technical
   and financial resources to operate effectively. In Canada, this
   technical expertise and governance has been provided by the federal
   government for federally owned harbours. These harbours have been
   increasingly divested to provincial, municipal, or private owners, but
   are often contaminated from historical industrial activities and pose
   potential risks to marine ecosystems. Following divestiture there may be
   consequences associated with change of governance, because new harbour
   managers may lack technical and financial resources to follow existing
   management protocols. Harbour uses often do not change appreciably once
   divested, thus impacts to sediments, or requirements for maintenance and
   upgrades will typically continue following change of authority. Policies
   to implement education and training are therefore essential following
   change of authority for new custodians to properly understand historical
   contamination impacts and associated environmental liabilities. Adhering
   to established management protocols will enable new harbour managers to
   more effectively manage potential environmental liabilities associated
   with divested harbours. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Compare gluteal muscle activation patterns and
   three-dimensional hip joint movements among those with severe hip
   osteoarthritis (OA), moderate OA and a healthy group during walking.
   Scope: 20 individuals with severe OA, 20 with moderate OA and 20 healthy
   individuals were recruited. Three-dimensional hip motion and surface
   electromyograms from gluteus maximus and medius were collected during
   treadmill walking at a self-selected speed. Angular displacement
   characteristics were calculated for three-dimensional hip motions.
   Principal component analysis extracted amplitude and temporal features
   from electromyographic waveforms. Analysis of Variance models and
   student t-tests using Bonferroni corrections determined between group
   differences in these gait features (alpha = 0.05). Conclusions: Sagittal
   plane hip range of motion was significantly reduced with increasing
   severity of OA (p < 0.05) where as frontal and transverse plane range of
   motion was reduced in the severe OA group only (p < 0.05). Activation
   patterns of gluteus medius and maximus did not differ between the
   healthy group and those with moderate hip OA (p > 0.05). Individuals
   with severe OA walking with more prolonged gluteus maximus activation
   and prolonged and less dynamic gluteus medius activation compared to the
   other two groups (p < 0.05). This study highlights the changing function
   of the hip joint during walking with increasing hip OA severity. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the effect of obesity and its potential interaction
   with knee OA presence on the electromyography patterns of the major knee
   joint periarticular muscles during walking. Scope: One hundred and
   eighteen asymptomatic adults and 177 adults with moderate knee
   osteoarthritis were subdivided into categories of healthy weight (n =
   77; 20 kg/m(2) < BMI < 25 kg/m(2)), overweight (n = 117; 25 kg/m(2) <=
   BMI < 30 kg/m(2)), and obese (n = 101; BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) based on their
   body mass index (BMI). All individuals underwent a three-dimensional
   gait analysis. Surface electromyograms from the lateral and medial
   gastrocnemii, lateral and medial hamstrings, vastus lateralis, vastus
   medialis, and rectus femoris were recorded during self-selected speed
   walking. Principal component analysis was used to extract major features
   of amplitude and temporal pattern variability from the electromyograms
   of each muscle group (gastrocnemii, quadriceps, hamstrings separately).
   Analysis of variance models tested for main BMI category effects and
   interaction effects for these features (alpha = 0.05). Statistically
   significant BMI category (i.e. obesity) effects were found for features
   that described more prolonged activations of the gastrocnemii and
   quadriceps muscles during the stance phase of gait with obesity (P <
   0.05). Conclusions: Obesity was associated with prolonged activation of
   quadriceps and gastrocnemii, which can result in prolonged knee joint
   contact loading, and thereby may contribute to the predisposition of
   knee OA development and progression in obese individuals. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Knee adduction moment discrete features (peaks and impulses)
   are commonly reported in knee osteoarthritis gait studies, but they do
   not necessarily capture loading patterns. Principal component analysis
   extracts dynamic patterns, but can be difficult to interpret. This
   methodological study determined relationships between external knee
   adduction moment discrete measures and principal component analysis
   features, and examined whether amplitude-normalization methods
   influenced differences in those with knee osteoarthritis who progressed
   to surgery versus those that did not.
   Methods: 54 knee osteoarthritis patients had three-dimensional
   biomechanical measures assessed during walking. Knee adduction moments
   were calculated and non-normalized and amplitude-normalized waveforms
   using two common methods were calculated. Patterns were extracted using
   principal component analysis. Knee adduction moment peak and impulse
   were calculated. Correlation coefficients were determined between two
   knee adduction moment patterns extracted and peak and impulse. T-tests
   evaluated between-group differences. Findings: An overall magnitude
   pattern was correlated with peak (r = 0.88-0.90, p<0.05) and impulse (r
   = 0.93, p<0.05). A pattern capturing a difference between early and
   mid/late -stance knee adduction moment was significantly correlated with
   peak (r = 0.27-0.40, p<0.05), but explained minimal variance.
   Between-group peak differences were only affected by
   amplitude-normalization method.
   Interpretation: Findings suggest that the overall magnitude knee
   adduction moment principal pattern does not provide unique information
   from peak and impulse measures. However, low correlations and minimal
   variance explained between the pattern capturing ability to unload the
   joint during mid-stance and the two discrete measures, suggests that
   this pattern captured a unique waveform feature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A framework for multi-objective facility layout design}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{167-176}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The most commonly used metric for facility layout design in the academic
   literature is the flow-distance metric, a weighted average between the
   material transfer and the distance travelled. Researchers and
   practitioners, however, have recognized that other metrics are also
   important. Facility layout designs obtained using the flow-distance
   metric exclusively have been criticized because they completely ignore
   empty material transfer, which generally increases work-in-process and
   equipment costs. Therefore, facility layout design (block layout design
   in particular) based exclusively on the flow-distance metric is
   insufficient. In this paper, we present a framework that utilizes the
   recent advancements in the facility planning literature to generate
   block layout designs based on three objectives: flow-distance, average
   work-in-process, and the number of required material handling devices.
   Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of standard problems,
   and the tradeoffs between the different objectives are studied. Our
   study indicates that it is critical to pursue multi-objective analysis
   and optimization for the actual implementation of the layouts. (C) 2015

Title = {{Optimal opportunistic indirect grouping of preventive replacements in
   multicomponent systems}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{281-291}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For complex systems operating in critical environments, original
   equipment manufacturers, operators and/or regulators often specify
   replacement intervals for major components before failure can occur. The
   fixed costs to teardown the overall system can be an important
   constituent of the total costs. Thus, when a preventive maintenance is
   scheduled to replace a given component, it may well be desirable to
   replace one or more other components that are within their replacement
   window (interval), so as to avoid repeating the teardown costs in a
   short while. This paper presents a novel network tree formulation of
   this opportunistic indirect grouping of periodic events problem. We show
   that, given a fixed time horizon and a moderately large number of major
   components, the replacement optimization problem can be represented as a
   tree of possible replacement combinations. Although these trees can
   become enormous, we have developed a Python implementation of a
   depth-first shortest path algorithm that can be very effective because
   many of the nodes of this tree do not need to be examined. Even when
   several million nodes need to be examined, only a few of them, typically
   a few hundreds, need to be maintained in memory at any one time. For
   larger number of components and longer time horizons, the trees can
   still become so large that it is impossible to examine it completely. In
   this case, the depth first search still rapidly finds a sequence of
   improving solutions and can be a very good heuristic for the problem.

Abstract = {{Communities across Canada rely heavily on natural resources for their

   benefited and suffered, because of its proximity to a pulp and paper

   there have been increasing impacts to the local environment and human
   health. Environmental reports funded by the mill were reviewed and
   compared against provincial and federal regulatory compliance standards.
   Reports contrasted starkly to societal perceptions of local impacts and
   independent studies. Most environmental monitoring reports funded by the
   mill indicate some levels of compliance in atmospheric and effluent
   emissions, but when compliance targets were not met, there was a lack of
   regulatory enforcement. After decades of local pollution impacts and
   lack of environmental compliance, corporate social responsibility
   initiatives need implementing for the mill to maintain its social

Abstract = {{The overall behavior of a micropiled raft foundation (MPR) system is
   similar to a piled raft foundation where the load is transferred by both
   the raft and micropiles. However, there is no guidance available
   regarding the design of MPRs or indication of their performance. In this
   study, geotechnical centrifuge testing was conducted to investigate the
   behavior of MPR foundations in clay and evaluate their performance
   characteristics. The study evaluated the performance of MPRs compared to
   the isolated raft in terms of raft total and differential settlements;
   raft contact pressure; raft bending moment; and load sharing between the
   raft and the micropiles. The results showed that for the MPR
   configuration considered in the study, the raft carried 48\% of the
   applied load. It was found that the Poulos-Davis-Randolph (PDR) method
   can be used to evaluate the performance of MPR for preliminarily design
   purposes with approximately 17\% error.}},

Title = {{Evaluating Impact Resonance Testing As a Tool for Predicting Hydraulic
   Conductivity and Strength Changes in Cement-Stabilized Soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper the impact resonance (IR) test method is used as a
   nondestructive tool to examine the curing progression, freeze/thaw (f/t)
   resistance, and healing potential of cement-stabilized soils. Resonant
   frequency (RF) measurements on specimens moist cured for up to 241 days
   indicate that the main portion of the hydration process is completed
   after about 60 days. Results of RF measurements on immature (i.e., cured
   for 16 days) and mature (i.e., cured for over 110 days) specimens
   exposed to 12 cycles of f/t indicate that the initial f/t exposure had a
   significant effect on the degradation of the structure. After the
   initial f/t cycle, some specimens exhibited continued reductions in RF
   values to as low as 10\% of the initial measurements, while several
   specimens showed signs of recovery leading to minor increases in the RF
   values. Changes in RF values are compared with the hydraulic
   conductivity changes measured on the same specimens reported in a
   previous publication by the authors. Based on the results, a
   prescreening scheme is proposed that can significantly reduce the time
   required for f/t studies of cement-stabilized soils. Also, RF
   measurements after 120 days of a post-exposure healing period show a
   significant potential for recovery in RF values for f/t exposed
   specimens. However, the recoveries in RF values are not proportional to
   the hydraulic conductivity recovery of the specimens. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Effect of lighting conditions and ground speed on performance of
   intelligent fertilizer spreader for spot-application in wild blueberry}},
Journal = {{PRECISION AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{654-667}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wild blueberry fields have a significant proportion of bare spots/weed
   patches, scattered throughout the field, emphasizing the need for
   targeted fertilizer applications. The existing prescription map-based
   variable rate (VR) spreader cannot take account of the presence of
   small, irregularly shaped bare spots/weed patches during fertilization
   as only each half of the boom (3.66 m; 6 nozzles) is controlled-not each
   individual nozzle. The objective of this study was to modify the
   existing VR spreader for spot-application (SA) of fertilizer only in
   plant areas. The sensing and control system developed was capable of
   discriminating bare spots/weeds from plants, and shifting the
   independent control from 6 nozzles (3.66 m) to each pair of nozzles
   (1.22 m). The modified VR granular (MVRG) fertilizer spreader was able
   to use a prescription map and the sensing and control systems
   simultaneously within a field, to avoid fertilization in variable sized
   bare spots/weed patches. The performance of the MVRG fertilizer spreader
   was evaluated under two different lighting conditions and three ground
   speeds. Twelve bare spots/weed patches and plant areas were randomly
   selected in the wild blueberry field and weighed sticky collectors were
   placed to collect clay filler which was used as an analogue of
   fertilizer. The MVRG fertilizer spreader was operated on SA (application
   only in plant areas) and uniform (application in plants and bare
   spots/weed patches) modes alternately and the collectors were collected
   and re-weighed. Results of this study suggested that the MVRG spreader
   was capable of detecting plants/bare spots/weeds for SA of fertilizer.
   Spot application of fertilizer can help to reduce excessive fertilizer
   usage in bare spots/weeds, which will increase farm profitability.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Two series of lanthanum containing zinc-silicate glasses were developed
   (A: 0.51SiO(2)-0.29Na(2)O-(0.20-X)ZnO-XLa2O3, 0 <= 0.09; B:
   0.51SiO(2)-0.35ZnO-(0.14-Y)Na2O-YLa2O3, 0 <= Y <= 0.14). Glasses were
   characterized in order to examine
   composition-structure-property-function relationships with a view to
   their potential use as therapeutic inorganic ion delivery systems.
   Glasses were melt synthesized and the role of lanthanum was investigated
   with respect to (i) glass structure based on density, glass transition
   temperature (T-g) and Si-29 MAS-NMR, (ii) the effect on radiopacity
   (computed tomography) as a function of composition and (iii) the ion
   release characteristics under simulated physiological conditions. A
   linear increase in density and T-g was observed with the addition of
   La2O3 to each glass series. Generally, glasses demonstrated a constant
   molar volume, while density was observed to increase linearly with the
   addition of La2O3. The peak maxima of the Si-29 MAS NMR spectra remained
   relatively unchanged by the addition of La2O3 in both glass series, but
   the line shapes and widths reveal modifications in the local silica
   structure. Radiopacity increased with La2O3: series A ranged between
   1770 +/- 33 and 6590 +/- 89 HU and B Series B ranged between 2340 +/- 54
   and 9120 +/- 290 HU. Series A glasses were observed to release only Na,
   it was also noted that increased La2O3 caused a reduction in Na+
   release. Series B glasses released all constituent glass elements.
   Interestingly, in series B, La3+ concentration decreased over time
   indicating possible reprecipitation. Based on the structural data,
   lanthanum does not behave as a traditional network modifier and may in
   fact act to stabilize the network against degradation by the formation
   of mixed cation clusters. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Residential air exchange rates (AERs) are vital in understanding the
   temporal and spatial drivers of indoor air quality (IAQ). Several
   methods to quantify AERs have been used in IAQ research, often with the
   assumption that the home is a single, well-mixed air zone. Since 2005,
   Health Canada has conducted IAQ studies across Canada in which AERs were
   measured using the perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) gas method. Emitters and
   detectors of a single PFT gas were placed on the main floor to estimate
   a single-zone AER (AER(1z)). In three of these studies, a second set of
   emitters and detectors were deployed in the basement or second floor in
   approximately 10\% of homes for a two-zone AER estimate (AER(2z)). In
   total, 287 daily pairs of AER(2z) and AER(1z) estimates were made from
   35 homes across three cities. In 87\% of the cases, AER(2z) was higher
   than AER(1z). Overall, the AER(1z) estimates underestimated AER(2z) by
   approximately 16\% (IQR: 5-32\%). This underestimate occurred in all
   cities and seasons and varied in magnitude seasonally, between homes,
   and daily, indicating that when measuring residential air exchange using
   a single PFT gas, the assumption of a single well-mixed air zone very
   likely results in an under prediction of the AER.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the selectivity and yield of multiphase reactions, an attempt
   to intensify gasliquid mass-transfer operations was undertaken in which
   screen/grid static mixers were used to promote interphase mass transfer.
   A modified technique was used to enhance the reproducibility of the
   results and to account for the depletion effect which becomes critical
   at high mass-transfer rates. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient,
   k(L)a, was found to increase with increasing liquid superficial velocity
   and gas volume fraction and reached values as high as 4.08 s(1) at low
   specific energy consumption rates, particularly for slowly coalescent
   systems, a situation that is encountered in most industrially relevant
   systems. The gasliquid reactor/contactor presently investigated takes
   advantage of the coalescence retardation characteristics of most
   industrially relevant streams to achieve k(L)a values that surpassed
   those of most conventional reactor/contactors by more than an order of
   magnitude while maintaining a high energy utilization efficiency (up to
   0.63 kg O-2/kWh). The ability to reach 98\% equilibrium within residence
   times of less than 800 ms, achieved without significantly increasing the
   power consumption rates, allows for the use of static mixing reactor
   volumes that are several orders of magnitude smaller than conventional
   units such as mechanically agitated tanks and bubble columns.}},

Title = {{A novel adaptive robust control architecture for bilateral teleoperation

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL}},

Abstract = {{Bilateral teleoperation technology has caused wide attentions due to its
   applications in various remote operation systems. The communication
   delay becomes one of the main challenging issues in the teleoperation
   control design. Meanwhile, various nonlinearities, parameter variations,
   and modeling uncertainties existing in manipulator and environment
   dynamics need to be considered carefully in order to achieve good
   control performance. In this paper, a globally stable nonlinear adaptive
   robust control algorithm is developed for bilateral teleoperation
   systems to deal with these control issues. Namely, the unknown dynamical
   parameters of the environmental force are estimated online by the
   improved least square adaptation law. A novel communication structure is
   proposed where only the master position signal is transmitted to the
   slave side for the tracking design, and the online estimators of the
   environmental parameters are transmitted from the slave to the master to
   replace the traditional environmental force measurement. Because the
   estimated environmental parameters are not power signals, the passivity
   problem of the communication channel and the trade-off limitation
   between the transparency performance and robust stability in traditional
   teleoperation control are essentially avoided. The nonlinear adaptive
   robust control is subsequently developed to deal with nonlinearities,
   unknown parameters, and modeling uncertainties of the master, slave, and
   environmental dynamics, so that the guaranteed transient and
   steady-state transparency performance can be achieved. The experiments
   on two voice-coil motor-driven manipulators are carried out, and the
   comparative results verify that the proposed control algorithm achieves
   the excellent control performance and the guaranteed robust stability
   simultaneously under time delays. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical and experimental works have shown that disordered
   positive electrode materials can function well in lithium cells. This
   work explores the solid solution series Li(1+x)Ti2xFe(1-3x)O2 (0 <= x <=
   0.333) and compares the measured specific capacity variation with x to a
   recent theoretical model. The samples have varying degrees of cation
   disordering between lithium and transition metal layers that is
   dependent on x. The materials were characterized using induced coupled
   plasma optical emission spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to quantify
   the degree of disorder and predict electrochemical performance. The
   specific capacities of lithium-limited samples (0 <= x <= 0.13) were
   found to agree very well with the recently proposed percolation theory
   model, whereas redox-limited samples (0.13 <= x <= 0.29) yielded
   slightly higher than expected capacities due to oxygen redox
   compensation characterized by oxygen K-edge XAS studies. Capacity
   retention was found to increase with lithium content. The voltage vs
   specific capacity relations for this set of materials do not suggest
   practicality, so this work is primarily of academic interest, but it
   suggests that more disordered materials should be explored.}},

Abstract = {{Core-shell structure positive electrode materials, based on layered
   Li-Ni-Mn-Co oxides, could be the next generation of positive electrode
   materials for high energy density lithium-ion batteries. Diffusion of
   the transition metal cations between the core and shell phases occurs
   during sintering, which can significantly affect the final core-shell
   (CS) properties. However, the interdiffusion constants have never been
   measured. Laminar pellets of the pure core phase and pure shell phase
   were pressed in contact and then heated to measure the interdiffusivity
   of the transition metals at various temperatures. The diffusion couples
   Ni3+/Co3+, Co3+/Mn4+, and Ni3+/Mn4+ were measured by analyzing
   composition versus position, with respect to the initial interface
   between the core and shell phase pellets. The transition metal
   composition profiles were measured with energy dispersive spectroscopy
   (EDS) line scans. This is the first time interdiffusion constants have
   been reported in the layered cathode materials to our knowledge. At 900
   degrees C, Ni3+/Co3+ has the highest interdiffusivity, D, of similar to
   4.7 x 10(-12) cm(2)/s, while Ni3+/Mn4+ has the lowest of similar to 0.1
   x 10(-12) cm(2)/s. The activation energy barriers for Ni3+/Co3+,
   Co3+/Mn4+, and Ni3+/Mn4+ interdiffusion were determined from Arrhenius
   plots of D vs 1/T. Simulations of diffusion in spherical core-shell
   materials were performed to show how knowledge of the interdiffusion
   constants can guide rational design of practical core-shell materials.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane fouling is a critical problem for many nanofiltration (NF)
   membrane plants. This study demonstrated that the poor spaces of the NF
   membrane were decreased for the deposition of natural organic matter
   (NOM) on the membrane surface. In-line coagulation was added prior to
   the low-pressure filtration step to remove more organic material by
   microfiltration (MF), thereby improving the quality of the feed-water
   entering the NF membranes. Three different types of coagulants, i.e.
   aluminum sulfate, ferric chloride, and polyaluminum chloride, with their
   different levels at different pH values were used for this study. The
   optimal dose of each coagulant was determined, and the impact on the NF
   membrane was assessed by batching and running 20L of post-coagulation MF
   permeate through a bench-scale NF membrane for 200h. Ferric chloride was
   found to perform the best of these three tested coagulants to reduce NF
   pressure fouling by reduction of NOM in the NF feed-water. High
   performance size exclusion chromatography study revealed that higher
   molecular weight fractions of NOM removed preferentially due to in-line
   coagulation processes. The scanning electron microscopy analysis of the
   fouled NF membrane trial revealed that the foulant layer consisted of a
   very large quantity of inorganic and organic matter, bacteria, which
   resulted in a very rough surface topography.}},

Title = {{Investigation into the use of cement kiln dust in high density sludge
   (HDS) treatment of acid mine water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{443-450}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential to replace
   lime with cement kiln dust (CKD) in high density sludge (HDS) treatment
   of acid mine drainage (AMD). The bench-scale study used two water
   samples: AMD sampled from a lead-zinc mine with high concentrations of
   iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and arsenic (As) (Fe/Zn-AMD) and a synthetic AMD
   solution (Syn-AMD) spiked with ferric sulfate (Fe-2(SO4)(3)). Arsenic
   was found to be significantly reduced with CKD-HDS treatment of
   Fe/Zn-AMD compared to lime-HDS treatment, to concentrations below the
   stringent mine effluent discharge regulation of 0.10 mg As/L (i.e., 0.04
   +/- 0.02 mg/L). Both CKD- and lime-HDS treatment of the two AMD samples
   resulted in settled water Fe concentrations above the stringent
   discharge guideline of 0.3 mg Fe/L. CKD addition in the HDS process also
   resulted in high settled water turbidity, above typical discharge
   guidelines of 15 mg TSS/L CKD-HDS treatment was found to result in
   significantly improved settled solids (i.e., sludge) quality compared to
   that generated in the lime-HDS process. HDS treatment with CKD resulted
   in 25-88\% lower sludge volume indices, 2 to 9 times higher \% wet
   solids, and 10 to 20 times higher \% dry solids compared to lime
   addition. XRD and XPS testing indicated that CKD-HDS sludge consisted of
   mainly CaCO3 and SiO2 with Fe3+ precipitates attached at particle
   surfaces. XRD and XPS testing of the lime-HDS generated sludge showed
   that it consisted of non-crystalline Fe oxides typical of sludge formed
   from precipitates with a high water concentration. Increased
   sedimentation rates were also found for CKD (1.3 cm/s) compared to lime
   (0.3 cm/s). The increased solids loading with CKD addition compared to
   lime addition in the HDS process was suggested to both promote surface
   complexation of metal precipitates with insoluble CKD particles and
   increase compression effects during Type IV sedimentation. These
   mechanisms collectively contributed to the reduced water content of
   CKD-HDS sludge. The results of this study suggest that solids loading is
   a significant factor in increased sludge density found with the HDS
   process compared to conventional lime precipitation-sedimentation. (C)

Abstract = {{Aluminum-based metal matrix composite (MMC) materials containing SiC,
   AIN, Si3N4 or BN were processed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Ceramic
   powder type, size and content were investigated to determine their
   effect on sinter quality. SiC, AIN and Si3N4 proved to be amenable to
   this style of processing whereas all systems containing BN were not.
   Full densification of MMCs that incorporated finer ceramic particles was
   problematic due to the presence of ceramic clusters and the extent to
   which aluminum could be forced into these regions. MMCs that
   incorporated coarser ceramic particles were more easily densified, but
   their hardness benefits were inferior. Three point bend tests proved to
   be an effective tool in determining the relative sinter quality of MMC
   systems. SiC outperformed AIN MMC samples in bend tests. Excellent
   ductility and bend strength was developed at low temperatures, while
   equivalent AlN-bearing materials required significantly higher
   temperatures to achieve comparable properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics is a fundamental foundation of all engineering
   disciplines. A vast majority of engineering undergraduate programmes
   contain one or more courses on thermodynamics, and many engineers use
   thermodynamics every day to analyse or design energy systems. However,
   there is extensive anecdotal evidence as well as a wide range of
   published literature indicating that students often struggle to
   understand thermodynamic principles. In an effort to understand
   students' attitudes and perception of thermodynamics, including their
   expectations, experience and frustrations, an investigation was
   conducted. Following a review of the literature on the teaching and
   learning of thermodynamics in engineering, a survey questionnaire was
   developed and administered to close to a 1000 students in 17
   thermodynamics classes at 13 universities in 7 countries. Survey results
   were analysed using statistical methods. This paper presents the
   findings of this investigation.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Binhai New Area of Tianjin has been suffering severe
   water shortage due to climate change and industrial activities.
   Integrated and effective water resources management approaches are
   urgent for the sustainable development of industrial parks in Binhai New
   Area. However, uncertainties exist in many aspects of the water
   resources system and are inevitably problematic for water resources
   planning and policy-making. To address these uncertainties, an interval
   multiple-objective programming model was developed here to support the
   long-term planning of industrial water resources management in Binhai
   New Area, Tianjin, China. The model incorporated both multiple-objective
   programming and interval linear programming into a general programming
   framework. The developed model could handle the uncertainties and
   complexities of the water management system, and also allowed decision
   makers to adjust fuzzy objective control decision variables to satisfy
   multiple holistic and interactive objectives. The solutions are useful
   for planning adjustments of the existing water allocation patterns in
   Binhai New Area.}},

Abstract = {{As part of its infrastructure renewal, Canadian Blood Services (CBS)
   will consolidate production and support functions for hospitals in the
   provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Existing production and
   distribution facilities in Calgary, Edmonton, and Regina will be
   combined into a single production facility to be located in Calgary.
   Stakeholders, however, have questioned whether there is a need for a
   stock holding unit (SHU) to be located in Saskatoon. In this paper we
   provide the details of a simulation study to evaluate the network
   performance expected under the consolidated plan. A simulation model was
   developed from a generic framework. Once validated, the model was used
   to conduct a series of experiments in which RBC availability and
   outdates were measured with and without a SHU in Saskatoon. Results
   suggest that product wastage will increase with a SHU, along with a
   small increase in product availability. However, any increase in product
   availability is unlikely to be practically significant if 1.4 or fewer
   road closures are experienced per year.}},

Journal = {{NATURE GEOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{875+}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory simulations of earthquakes show that at high slip rates,
   faults can weaken significantly, aiding rupture(1-3). Various
   mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, have been
   proposed to cause this weakening during laboratory experiments(1,4-6,)
   yet the processes that aid fault slip in nature remain unknown.
   Measurements of seismic radiation during an earthquake can be used to
   estimate the frictional work associated with fault weakening, known as
   an event's fracture energy(7-9). Here we compile new and existing(8,9)
   measurements of fracture energy for earthquakes globally that vary in
   size from borehole microseismicity to great earthquakes. We observe a
   distinct transition in howfracture energy scales with event size, which
   implies that faults weaken differently during small and large
   earthquakes, and earthquakes are not self-similar. We use an
   elastodynamic numerical model of earthquake rupture to explore possible
   mechanisms. We find that thermal pressurization of pore fluid by the
   rapid shear heating of fault gouge can account for the observed scaling
   of fracture energy in small and large earthquakes, over seven orders of
   fault slip magnitude. We conclude that thermal pressurization is a
   widespread and prominent process for fault weakening.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality rates of eggs and nauplii are essential for understanding and
   modelling dynamics of copepod populations. Abundances of Calanus
   finmarchicus females, eggs and nauplii were determined at 88 stations in
   the Labrador Sea. Egg production rates (EPRs) and egg and naupliar stage
   durations were calculated using published relationships with in situ
   chlorophyll concentration and temperature. The data were used to
   estimate mortality rates for eggs (M-E), eggs and early naupliar stages
   (ME-NIII) and naupliar stages (MNI-NVI). Estimated mortality rates in
   the central basin were higher than those on the shelves and within
   regions generally M-E > ME-NIII > MNI-NVI. The ``Basic Method{''} for
   eggs, arguably the most reliable method, gave a high proportion of
   seemingly erroneous (negative) values. These became positive when a
   modified estimation formula was used, which assumes that some eggs being
   laid could not hatch. Egg hatching success is often <100\%, but this is
   rarely considered when calculating mortality rates, although it affects
   all estimates that include egg abundances and/or EPRs as variables,
   mostly at low mortality rates. Egg and early life stage mortality rates
   were correlated with female abundance, but cannibalism may not be the
   appropriate interpretation. The issues of egg viability and cannibalism
   require more careful consideration.}},

   ignition sources for dust explosions, the types of enterprises with high
   risk, and the critical equipment in such enterprises are also analyzed.
   The results could help identify hazards of dust explosions in various

Title = {{Risk assessment of rare events}},
Journal = {{PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{102-108}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rare events often result in large impacts and are hard to predict. Risk
   analysis of such events is a challenging task because there are few
   directly relevant data to form a basis for probabilistic risk
   assessment. Due to the scarcity of data, the probability estimation of a
   rare event often uses precursor data. Precursor-based methods have been
   widely used in probability estimation of rare events. However, few
   attempts have been made to estimate consequences of rare events using
   their precursors. This paper proposes a holistic precursor-based risk
   assessment framework for rare events. The Hierarchical Bayesian Approach
   (HBA) using hyper-priors to represent prior parameters is applied to
   probability estimation in the proposed framework. Accident precursor
   data are utilized from an information theory perspective to seek the
   most informative precursor upon which the consequence of a rare event is
   estimated. Combining the estimated probability and consequence gives a
   reasonable assessment of risk. The assessed risk is updated as new
   information becomes available to produce a dynamic risk profile. The
   applicability of the methodology is tested through a case study of an
   offshore blowout accident. The proposed framework provides a rational
   way to develop the dynamic risk profile of a rare event for its
   prevention and control. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{Popular interest in barefoot running has emerged as a result of its
   alleged performance and injury prevention benefits. Oxygen cost of
   transport (COT) improvements from barefoot running, however, remains
   equivocal. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of an
   8-week progressive barefoot training program on COT and associated
   spatiotemporal variables. 15 male runners participated in this study.
   Variables such as oxygen uptake, biomechanical and spatiotemporal
   characteristics of gait, including ground contact (GC) and swing time;
   stride length and frequency and ankle plantar-dorsiflexion were measured
   pre- and post-intervention. The COT did not differ between barefoot and
   shod running either pre-or post-training. Improved barefoot COT (p <
   0.05) but not shod was found between pre- and post-training.
   Biomechanical differences between barefoot and shod conditions persisted
   over the training period. A decrease in barefoot COT was associated with
   a decrease in GC time (p = 0.003, r = 0.688) and a small increase in
   stride frequency (p = 0.030; r = 0.569). Ground contact time and stride
   frequency, previously associated with COT, only partly contribute (32 \%
   - Stride frequency and 47 \% - GC time) to a decrease in COT after
   barefoot training. Thus other physiological and biomechanical variables
   must influence the improvement in COT after a barefoot training
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated remodeling of aortic and mitral valves
   leaflets under the volume loading and cardiac expansion of pregnancy.
   Those valves' leaflets enlarge with altered collagen fiber architecture,
   content, and cross-linking and biphasic changes (decreases, then
   increases) in extensibility during gestation. This study extends our
   analyses to right-sided valves, with additional compositional
   measurements for all valves. Valve leaflets were harvested from
   nonpregnant heifers and pregnant cows. Leaflet structure was
   characterized by leaflet dimensions, and ECM composition was determined
   using standard biochemical assays. Histological studies assessed changes
   in cellular and ECM components. Leaflet mechanical properties were
   assessed using equibiaxial mechanical testing. Collagen thermal
   stability and cross-linking were assessed using denaturation and
   hydrothermal isometric tension tests. Pulmonary and tricuspid leaflet
   areas increased during pregnancy by 35 and 55\%, respectively. Leaflet
   thickness increased by 20\% only in the pulmonary valve and largely in
   the fibrosa (30\% thickening). Collagen crimp length was reduced in both
   the tricuspid (61\%) and pulmonary (42\%) valves, with loss of crimped
   area in the pulmonary valve. Thermomechanics showed decreased collagen
   thermal stability with surprisingly maintained cross-link maturity. The
   pulmonary leaflet exhibited the biphasic change in extensibility seen in
   left side valves, whereas the tricuspid leaflet mechanics remained
   largely unchanged throughout pregnancy. The tricuspid valve exhibits a
   remodeling response during pregnancy that is significantly diminished
   from the other three valves. All valves of the heart remodel in
   pregnancy in a manner distinct from cardiac pathology, with much
   similarity valve to valve, but with interesting valve-specific responses
   in the aortic and tricuspid valves.}},

   total anthocyanin, chlorogenic acid, cyanidin, total phenolic compounds
   and total anthocyanins of cloudberry fruit were significantly (P<0.05)
   affected by the combination of the growing season and the location. The

Title = {{Offload zones to mitigate emergency medical services (EMS) offload delay
   in the emergency department: a process map and hazard analysis}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{670-678}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Offload delay is a prolonged interval between ambulance
   arrival in the emergency department (ED) and transfer of patient care,
   typically occurring when EDs are crowded. The offload zone (OZ), which
   manages ambulance patients waiting for an ED bed, has been implemented
   to mitigate the impact of ED crowding on ambulance availability. Little
   is known about the safety or efficiency. The study objectives were to
   process map the OZ and conduct a hazard analysis to identify steps that
   could compromise patient safety or process efficiency.
   Methods: A Health Care Failure Mode and Effect Analysis was conducted.
   Failure modes (FM) were identified. For each FM, a probability to occur
   and severity of impact on patient safety and process efficiency was
   determined, and a hazard score (probability X severity) was calculated.
   For any hazard score considered high risk, root causes were identified,
   and mitigations were sought.
   Results: The OZ consists of six major processes: 1) patient transported
   by ambulance, 2) arrival to the ED, 3) transfer of patient care, 4)
   patient assessment in OZ, 5) patient care in OZ, and 6) patient transfer
   out of OZ; 78 FM were identified, of which 28 (35.9\%) were deemed high
   risk and classified as impact on patient safety (n = 7/28, 25.0\%),
   process efficiency (n = 10/28, 35.7\%), or both (n = 11/28, 39.3\%).
   Seventeen mitigations were suggested.
   Conclusion: This process map and hazard analysis is a first step in
   understanding the safety and efficiency of the OZ. The results from this
   study will inform current policy and practice, and future work to reduce
   offload delay.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines medical waste management, including the common
   sources, governing legislation and handling and disposal methods. Many
   developed nations have medical waste legislation, however there is
   generally little guidance as to which objects can be defined as
   infectious. This lack of clarity has made sorting medical waste
   inefficient, thereby increasing the volume of waste treated for
   pathogens, which is commonly done by incineration. This review
   highlights that the unnecessary classification of waste as infectious
   results in higher disposal costs and an increase in undesirable
   environmental impacts. The review concludes that better education of
   healthcare workers and standardized sorting of medical waste streams are
   key avenues for efficient waste management at healthcare facilities, and
   that further research is required given the trend in increased medical
   waste production with increasing global GDP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Surgical navigation systems for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery
   are capable of capturing passive three-dimensional (3D) angular joint
   movement patterns intraoperatively. Improved understanding of
   patient-specific knee kinematic changes between pre and post-implant
   states and their relationship with post-operative function may be
   important in optimizing TKA outcomes. However, a comprehensive
   characterization of the variability among patients has yet to be
   investigated. The objective of this study was to characterize the
   variability within frontal plane joint movement patterns
   intraoperatively during a passive knee flexion exercise. Three hundred
   and forty patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) received a
   primary TKA using a navigation system. Passive kinematics were captured
   prior to (pre-implant), and after prosthesis insertion (post-implant).
   Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to capture characteristic
   patterns of knee angle kinematics among patients, to identify potential
   patient subgroups based on these patterns, and to examine the
   subgroup-specific changes in these patterns between pre- and
   post-implant states. The first four extracted patterns explained 99.9\%
   of the diversity within the frontal plane angle patterns among the
   patients. Post-implant, the magnitude of the frontal plane angle shifted
   toward a neutral mechanical axis in all phenotypes, yet subtle pattern
   (shape of curvature) features of the pre-implant state persisted. (c)

Title = {{Ecological risk assessment of bisphenol A in surface waters of China
   based on both traditional and reproductive endpoints}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{133-137}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) occurs widely in natural waters with both traditional
   and reproductive toxicity to various aquatic species. The water quality
   criteria (WQC), however, have not been established in China, which
   hinders the ecological risk assessment for the pollutant. This study
   therefore aims to derive the water quality criteria for EPA based on
   both acute and chronic toxicity endpoints and to assess the ecological
   risk in surface waters of China. A total of 15 acute toxicity values
   tested with aquatic species resident in China were found in published
   literature, which were simulated with the species sensitivity
   distribution (SSD) model for the derivation of criterion maximum
   concentration (CMC). 18 chronic toxicity values with traditional
   endpoints were simulated for the derivation of traditional criterion
   continuous concentration (CCC) and 12 chronic toxicity values with
   reproductive endpoints were for reproductive CCC. Based on the derived
   WQC, the ecological risk of BPA in surface waters of China was assessed
   with risk quotient (RQ) method. The results showed that the CMC,
   traditional CCC and reproductive CCC were 1518 mu g L-1, 2.19 mu g L-1
   and 0.86 mu g L-1, respectively. The acute risk of BPA was negligible
   with RQ values much lower than 0.1. The chronic risk was however much
   higher with RQ values of between 0.01-3.76 and 0.03-9.57 based on
   traditional and reproductive CCC, respectively. The chronic RQ values on
   reproductive endpoints were about threefold as high as those on
   traditional endpoints, indicating that ecological risk assessment based
   on traditional effects may not guarantee the safety of aquatic biota.

Title = {{Application of low-mixing energy input for the coagulation process}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{333-341}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Rapid-mixing tanks with mechanical mixers are a common design used in
   treatment plants. Yet, the role of such rapid-mixing systems on the
   effectiveness of the coagulation performance is unclear. This study
   looked at optimizing the direct energy used in the coagulation process
   for removal of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM). The role of
   coagulation mixing intensity (G-value) on total organic carbon (TOC) and
   turbidity removal was examined for the water types with high organic
   content, with a specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of at least 2-2.5
   units of m(-1) of absorbance per mg/L A standard jar test using ferric
   sulfate coagulant was performed to optimize the chemical condition in
   coagulation for removal of dissolved organics as well as particles. The
   jar test analysis at an acidic pH (4.5 +/- 0.3) required an iron dose
   <0.3 mM to arrive at an optimal coagulant concentration and resulted in
   above 75\% of TOC removal. The influence of coagulation mixing on TOC
   and turbidity removal was evaluated at G varying from 0 to 1500 s(-1) at
   the optimized coagulant dose and pH conditions for enhanced coagulation.
   In this study, a combined effective removal of TOC and turbidity was
   achieved at a low-mixing intensity range of 110 s(-1) < G < 450 s(-1).
   Coagulation operated at G greater than 450 s(-1) showed negligible
   improvement in TOC removal. Minimizing energy consumption in enhanced
   coagulation is feasible at the proposed mixing intensity range (i.e.,
   110 s(-1) < G < 450 s(-1)), without sacrificing the effectiveness of DOM
   removal by coagulation. These findings represent an opportunity for
   energy savings for the water industry without sacrificing quality. (C)

Abstract = {{Haskap berries (Lonicera caerulea L.) are a rich source of bioactive
   molecules. As such, the extraction of anthocyanins is important for the
   development of many value-added products and functional food
   ingredients. In this paper, the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of
   anthocyanins from haskap berries was investigated. Significant
   independent variables were screened and optimized using Plackett-Burman
   (PB) and Box-Behnken (BB) designs, respectively. The mathematical model
   showed a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.9396) and the
   optimum conditions for the extraction were as follows: liquid/solid
   ratio 25:1 (mL/g), solvent composition of 80\% ethanol, addition of
   0.5\% formic acid, ultrasound bath temperature of 35 degrees C for 20
   min. Under these conditions, the total anthocyanin content of 22.73 mg
   cyaniding 3-glucoside equivalents (C3G)/g dry weight (DW) was consistent
   with the predicted response of 22.45 mg C3G/g DW from the model (mean
   error of 1.28\%). Five anthocyanins were identified in the optimized
   extract, namely cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin
   3-rutinoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, and peonidin 3-glucoside. Thus,
   UAE is a suitable technique for the extraction of anthocyanins from
   haskap berries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation and characterization of all-thiol-protected noble-metal
   nanoclusters represent significant advancements in the field of
   nanomaterials. One of the emerging trends in the study of silver
   nanoclusters in particular, is the generation of sulfide-type silver at
   their surfaces as a result of surface protection by thiols. Here, X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to identify the structure and
   composition of 2 nm tiopronin-protected silver nanoclusters arranged in
   one-dimensional chains. Silver K-edge XAS multipath refinements and
   wavelet-transformed XAS analysis found that the nanoclusters comprised
   small metal cores surrounded by thick sulfide-type shells. This further
   demonstrates that the sulfide-type shell is a prevalent surface
   structure throughout silver nanoclusters protected by thiols. In
   addition, the antibacterial activities of the nanoclusters were also
   examined; they were found to be active against both Gram-positive and
   Gram-negative bacteria, thereby shedding light on the effects of both
   the surface structure and the special arrangement of the nanoclusters.}},

Abstract = {{The application of detailed in-situ neutron diffraction studies on
   lithium ion batteries has been limited in part due to the requirement of
   expensive deuterated carbonate-based electrolyte. This work presents an
   in-situ neutron diffraction study of the structural evolution of the
   Li-x (Ni0.4Mn0.4Co0.2)O-2 (NMC442) positive electrode material using a
   recently-developed low-cost deuterated ethyl acetate-based electrolyte.
   Rietveld analysis show that the NMC442 c lattice parameter gradually
   increases until x = 0.47 (4.03 V) and then decreases during the first
   charge. The decreasing trend of the c lattice parameter with time during
   the hold at 4.7 V and 4.9 V agrees very well with the change of current.
   Overall the structural changes appear highly reversible When 4.7 V is
   used as an upper cutoff voltage, even following a 10 h hold at 4.7 V.
   However, the electrode/electrolyte changes dramatically when charged and
   held at 4.9 V. There is a significant drop in background attributed to
   electrolyte decomposition and an unexpected increase in the a lattice
   parameter is noted after the 4.9 V hold. Therefore, the electrolyte
   system used is both beneficial for in-situ neutron diffraction studies
   and battery performance until 4.7 V, but appears to degrade in
   combination with the electrode at 4.9 V. By comparison to
   Li(Ni0.8Mn0.1Co0.1)O-2 (NMC811), the contraction of the c lattice with
   increasing voltage and decreasing lithium content of the NMC442 is less
   rapid. The transition metal composition significantly affects the c
   lattice contraction above 4.0 V. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The rate and efficiency of iron generation in a bench-scale
   electrocoagulation (EC) system was investigated when variations were
   made to operating voltage, cathode material and electrolyte composition.
   Two electrolytes were tested, one with organic compounds (naphthalene,
   acenaphthene and 4-nonylphenol) and one without. While aromatic
   structures often make good corrosion inhibitors, in this case they had
   no discernible effect. This is a positive indicator that EC systems will
   not have adverse effects when treating wastewaters associated with oil
   and gas production. Using a stainless steel cathode rather than an
   aluminium one resulted in 35\% more production of iron at the anode per
   volt per minute; it also resulted in greater iron production given
   equivalent quantities of power. This occurred because the rate-limiting
   hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode occurs more quickly on iron
   than on aluminium. It was also observed that the EC system (using either
   cathode) produced more iron per unit power when operated at lower
   voltages. At lower voltages, the corrosion that occurred spontaneously
   in the absence of an applied current contributed more significantly to
   the total amount of iron released. This research suggests that it is
   more efficient to design EC systems using iron-based cathodes rather
   than aluminium ones. It also indicates that it is more energy efficient
   to use more electrodes at low power, rather than fewer electrodes at
   high power.}},

Abstract = {{Background Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone with numerous
   beneficial cardiovascular effects. Recently, a mutation in the ANP gene,
   which results in the generation of a mutant form of ANP (mANP), was
   identified and shown to cause atrial fibrillation in people. The
   mechanism(s) through which mANP causes atrial fibrillation is unknown.
   Our objective was to compare the effects of wild-type ANP and mANP on
   atrial electrophysiology in mice and humans.
   Methods and Results Action potentials (APs), L-type Ca2+ currents
   (I-Ca,I-L), and Na+ current were recorded in atrial myocytes from
   wild-type or natriuretic peptide receptor C knockout (NPR-C-/-) mice. In
   mice, ANP and mANP (10-100 nmol/L) had opposing effects on atrial
   myocyte AP morphology and I-Ca,I-L. ANP increased AP upstroke velocity
   (V-max), AP duration, and I-Ca,I-L similarly in wild-type and NPR-C-/-
   myocytes. In contrast, mANP decreased V-max, AP duration, and I-Ca,I-L,
   and these effects were completely absent in NPR-C-/- myocytes. ANP and
   mANP also had opposing effects on I-Ca,I-L in human atrial myocytes. In
   contrast, neither ANP nor mANP had any effect on Na+ current in mouse
   atrial myocytes. Optical mapping studies in mice demonstrate that ANP
   sped electric conduction in the atria, whereas mANP did the opposite and
   slowed atrial conduction. Atrial pacing in the presence of mANP induced
   arrhythmias in 62.5\% of hearts, whereas treatment with ANP completely
   prevented the occurrence of arrhythmias.
   Conclusions These findings provide mechanistic insight into how mANP
   causes atrial fibrillation and demonstrate that wild-type ANP is
   antiarrhythmic.}},

   ``solidification/stabilization{''} (S/S) construction cells do not
   currently specify the sample size considering the accuracy of the
   estimated effective hydraulic conductivity of the cells from the
   samples, nor considering the risk associated with drawing the wrong
   conclusions about the acceptability of the cells. In this paper,
   probabilistic simulations are performed to examine the influence of a
   soil-cement material's mean, variance, and correlation length on
   sampling requirements for a QC program of cement-based S/S construction
   cells. The sampling requirements are determined by considering a
   hypothesis test, having nulled that the constructed material is
   unacceptable, and targeting acceptable probabilities of making an
   erroneous decision. Two types of errors can be made: (i) concluding that
   the material is acceptable when it actually is not, or (ii) failing to
   conclude that the material is acceptable when it actually is. The paper
   investigates how many samples are required to keep the probabilities of
   making these errors acceptably small. Plots are provided, which can be
   used to estimate the required number of samples. The paper concludes by
   discussing how the simulation-based results compare with current
   sampling requirements for the QC of an actual set of cement-based S/S
   construction cells.}},

Abstract = {{We present results of a four year field study examining the changes in
   seasonal soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) and soil pH from the application of
   an alkaline treated biosolid (ATB) in an acidic sandy loam soil. Results
   of two management practices, annual ATB applications and a single
   application, and different rates of ATB (0, 7, 14, 28 and 42 Mg ha(-1))
   were also compared over the four year study period. Corn (Zea mays L)
   was used as the test crop throughout the study. Soil pH was effectively
   modified in all treatments receiving ATB rates, compared to the control,
   under both management practices but best results were achieved under
   annual ATB application. Soil cation exchange capacity was increased
   under annual ATB applications, by 3x at the highest ATB. Compared to the
   control, soil nitrogen and pH displayed significant changes under
   frequent additions with increasing rates of ATB. Our results indicate
   that a single application at the highest ATB rate had a residual effect
   on soil pH but little impact on subsequent SMN dynamics. Average soil
   mineral nitrogen (SMN) concentrations in the single application
   management ranged from 8.3 to 9.3 mg kg(-1) in the final three years of
   the study but ranged from 8.5 to 12.1 mg kg(-1) under the annual
   application management. In contrast, annual applications of ATB at rates
   >14 Mg ha(-1) increased seasonal SMN by 15-42\% and soil pH by 1-1.5 pH
   units. Seasonal SMN dynamics under different ATB rates and management
   practices were also examined using a soil nitrogen ratio (SNR) and as an
   area under the seasonal SMN curve. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The cell adhesion molecule Cadherin 2 (Cdh2) plays important roles in
   somatic cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. Cdh2 is also highly
   expressed in mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs), but its function in
   these cells is unknown. To understand the function of Cdh2 in mEpiSCs,
   we compared the expression of pluripotency-related genes in mEpiSCs and
   mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) after either Cdh2 knockdown or Cdh2
   over-expression. Introduction of specific siRNA against Cdh2 led to
   attenuation of pluripotency-related genes. Pluripotent gene expression
   was not recovered by overexpression of Cdh1 following Cdh2 knockdown.
   Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that
   Cdh2 stabilizes FGFR1 in mEpiSCs. Furthermore, stable transfection of
   mESCs with Cdh2 cDNA followed by FGF2 supplementation accelerated cell
   differentiation. Thus, Cdh2 contributes to the establishment and
   maintenance of FGF signaling-dependent self-renewal in mEpiSCs through
   stabilization of FGFR1.}},

Abstract = {{The simple press-and-sinter powder metallurgical technique has provided
   an economical route for the manufacture of components from lightweight
   alloys, including titanium. However, the issue of residual porosity is
   limiting Ti alloy use in demanding applications. The presence of a
   liquid phase during sintering can potentially facilitate diffusion,
   leading to improved densification. In the present work a comparison of
   liquid phase sintering mechanisms is undertaken, with either persistent
   or transient liquid formation, for Ti-Ni and Ti-Sn alloys, respectively.
   Samples are produced using blended elemental powders, with up to 10 wt\%
   alloying addition. Compacts were uniaxially pressed, and sintered at
   1200-1400 degrees C. The benefit of Ni addition is significant in terms
   of sintering, with close to full density (similar to 99.5\% of
   theoretical) achieved for optimised conditions. Sn additions also
   exhibit a beneficial sintering response, particularly at lower
   temperatures ( < 1250 degrees C) and for lower concentrations (i.e. 2.5
   wt\%), with densities exceeding 98.5\% of theoretical achieved under
   optimal conditions. The hardening effect is clear for both alloy groups
   compared to commercially pure-Ti, whereas there was generally an adverse
   effect on the tensile properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A method for measuring the sub-micrometer in-plane dynamics of MEMS
   devices with nano-scale precision using a CCD camera and synchronized
   pulsating illumination is presented. Typical MEMS actuators have fast
   responses (generally in the 1-200 kHz range), much faster than typical
   cameras which record a time averaged motion. Under constant illumination
   the average displacement is steady state and independent of dynamic
   amplitude or phase. Methods such as strobe illumination use short light
   pulses to freeze the motion. This paper develops the use of longer
   pulses of illumination that do not freeze the image, but make the
   average displacement depend on dynamic amplitude and phase; thus
   allowing both properties to be extracted. The expected signal is derived
   as a function of light pulse width and delay, and short versus longer
   pulses are compared. Measurements using a conventional microscope with
   replacement of the lamp with LEDs confirmed the derived equations. The
   system was used to measure sub-micrometer motion of MEMS actuators with
   similar to 5 nm precision. The time constant of a thermal actuator was
   measured and found to be 48 mu s. A resonant peak of a MEMS device was
   measured at 123.30 kHz with an amplitude of 238 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Biopiles can be used to dispose of slaughterhouse residuals (SLRs);
   however, the fate of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., pathogenic strains of
   Eschericia coli, Streptococcus fecalis) in these systems is not well
   understood. The transport of these bacteria in water leaching from the
   biopile could represent a significant contamination source. This
   research examined the transport of Enterobacteriaceae and
   Enterococcaceae indicator bacteria from SLR biopiles. Three biopiles
   (2.6 m wide by 4.6 m long by 1.8 m high) were formed on soil layers in
   concrete cells that allowed for real-time monitoring of environmental
   parameters, hydrologic flux, and indicator bacteria levels in effluent
   leaching from the piles. In biopile effluent, indicator bacteria
   populations decreased exponentially following biopile formation.
   Indicator bacteria loads in effluent constituted <0.01\% of the initial
   indicator bacteria levels in the biopiles, which was attributed to
   retention, inactivation, and death. Nearly 90\% of the total indicator
   bacteria loads coincided with large precipitation events (>15 mm d(-1)).
   Movement of the indicator bacteria through the biopiles and underlying
   soil appeared to be consistent with preferential flow phenomena. The
   populations of the Enterobacteriaceae indicators remained low in
   conditions of higher soil water content and lower biopile temperatures,
   whereas the Enterococcaceae indicator appeared to regrow in these
   conditions. This indicated that bacterial pathogen transport from a
   biopile could be a concern after the disappearance of conventional
   bacterial indicators, such as E. coli. Management considerations should
   attempt to divert excess water from entering a biopile, such as locating
   a biopile under a roof. Unsaturated biopile and soil conditions should
   be maintained to impede water flow through preferential pathways in the
   soil underneath a biopile.}},

Abstract = {{Surface waters are commonly used as source water for drinking water and
   irrigation. Knowledge of sources of fecal pollution in source watersheds
   benefits the design of effective source water protection plans. This
   study analyzed the relationships between enteric pathogens (Escherichia
   coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. {[}C. jejuni, C.
   lari and C. coli]), water quality (turbidity, temperature, and E. coli),
   and human and ruminant-cow Bacteroidales and mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA)-based fecal source tracking (FST) markers in two source
   watersheds. Water samples (n = 329) were collected at 10 sites (five in
   each watershed) over 18 mo. The human Bacteroidales marker (HF183)
   occurred in 9 to 10\% of the water samples at nine sampling sites; while
   a forested site in the urban watershed tested negative. Ruminant-cow
   Bacteroidales markers (BacR and CowM2) only appeared in the rural
   watershed (6\%). The mtDNA markers (HcytB and AcytB) showed the same
   pattern but were less sensitive due to lower fecal concentrations.
   Higher prevalences (P < 0.05) of Campylobacter spp. (41 vs. 16\% for the
   rural and urban watershed, respectively) and E. coli O157: H7 (12 vs.
   3\%) were observed in the rural watershed, while Salmonella spp. levels
   were comparable (23-28\%). Densities of E. coli 3 100 colony-forming
   units (CFU) 100 mL(-1) increased the odds (P < 0.05) of detecting the
   enteric bacterial pathogens. The water turbidity levels (nephelometric
   turbidity units {[}NTU] >= 1.0) similarly predicted (P < 0.05) pathogen
   presence. Storm events increased (P < 0.01) pathogen and fecal marker
   concentrations in the waterways. The employment of multiple FST methods
   suggested failing onsite wastewater systems contribute to human fecal
   pollution in both watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides an economic and energy analysis of the
   implementation of geothermal systems to meet the needs of a typical 130
   m(2) dwelling of a Canadian individual. The objective is to determine
   the monetary balance after 22 years, the net present value, the internal
   return rate, and annual savings for the same system operating under
   different climatic conditions and in different provinces (legislations,
   costs of fuel) to determine whether or not an individual should
   implement such a system in 2014. The geothermal system is used for both
   space heating and cooling, and to provide for 25\% of the total amount
   of domestic hot water. The simulations are performed with RETScreen (R)
   for four Canadian cities: Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. For
   the investigated configurations, it appeared that the cost of energy and
   its sources, which varied greatly according to the location, are the
   factors that most strongly influenced the economic viability of the
   proposed geothermal system, while climate was only a secondary impact.
   The impact of carbon taxes and equivalent monetary subsidies does not
   significantly modify the economic outcomes for Halifax and Montreal.
   However, for Toronto and Vancouver, these would need to reach between
   280 and 300 Can\$/tCO(2)eq to attain economic balance. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Geophysical observations suggest that mature faults weaken significantly
   at seismic slip rates. Thermal pressurization and thermal decomposition
   are two mechanisms commonly used to explain this dynamic weakening. Both
   rely on pore fluid pressurization with thermal pressurization achieving
   this through thermal expansion of native solids and pore fluid and
   thermal decomposition by releasing additional pore fluid during a
   reaction. Several recent papers have looked at the role thermal
   pressurization plays during a dynamically propagating earthquake, but no
   previous models have studied the role of thermal decomposition. In this
   paper we present the first solutions accounting for thermal
   decomposition during dynamic rupture, solving for steady state
   self-healing slip pulses propagating at a constant rupture velocity.
   First, we show that thermal decomposition leads to longer slip
   durations, larger total slips, and a distinctive along-fault slip rate
   profile. Next, we show that accounting for more than one weakening
   mechanism allows multiple steady slip pulses to exist at a given
   background stress, with some solutions corresponding to different
   balances between thermal pressurization and thermal decomposition, and
   others corresponding to activating a single reaction multiple times.
   Finally, we study how the rupture properties depend on the fault
   properties and show that the impact of thermal decomposition is largely
   controlled by the ratio of the hydraulic and thermal diffusivities =
   (hy)/(th) and the ratio of pore pressure generated to temperature rise
   buffered by the reaction P-r/E-r.}},

Title = {{Operational risk assessment: A case of the Bhopal disaster}},
Journal = {{PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{70-79}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Accidental releases of hazardous chemicals from process facilities can
   cause catastrophic consequences. The Bhopal disaster resulting from a
   combination of inherently unsafe designs and poorly managed operations
   is a well-known case. Effective risk modeling approaches that provide
   early warnings are helpful to prevent and control such rare but
   catastrophic events. Probability estimation of these events is a
   constant challenge due to the scarcity of directly relevant data.
   Therefore, precursor-based methods that adopt the Bayesian theorem to
   update prior judgments on event probabilities using empirical data have
   been proposed. The updated probabilities are then integrated with
   consequences of varying severity to produce the risk profile.
   This paper proposes an operational risk assessment framework, in which a
   precursor-based Bayesian network approach is used for probability
   estimation, and loss functions are applied for consequence assessment.
   The estimated risk profile can be updated continuously given real-time
   operational data. As process facilities operate, this method integrates
   a failure-updating mechanism with potential consequences to generate a
   real-time operational risk profile. The real time risk profile is
   valuable in activating accident prevention and control strategies. The
   approach is applied to the Bhopal accident to demonstrate its
   applicability and effectiveness. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Cement-based solidification/stabilization (s/s) is a remediation
   technology that has been widely used for treatment of a range of
   contaminants. Currently, there is limited published data on changes in
   hydraulic performance of cement-treated materials subjected to cycles of
   freezing/thawing (f/t). Fourteen sets of tests were performed to examine
   the influence of factors such as number of f/t cycles, freezing
   temperature, curing time, and mix design on changes in hydraulic
   conductivity and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of cement-treated
   silty sand. Results showed an increase of up to three orders of
   magnitude in hydraulic conductivity as well as decreases in UCS values
   after exposure to 4 and 12 f/t cycles. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   performed on the results of a factorial experiment considering the
   effect of freezing temperature, curing time, and number of f/t cycles
   showed that all of these factors are significant in affecting the
   measured changes in the hydraulic conductivity and UCS values.
   Monitoring of damage using the impact resonance method showed that
   changes in the resonant frequency of specimens were consistent with
   changes in hydraulic conductivity and UCS after f/t exposure and also
   allowed monitoring of damage for intermediate cycles with minimal

Abstract = {{Forestry has contributed many problems to the Operations Research (OR)
   community. At the same time, OR has developed many models and solution
   methods for use in forestry. In this article, we describe the current
   status of research on the application of OR methods to forestry and a
   number of research challenges or open questions that we believe will be
   of interest to both researchers and practitioners. The areas covered
   include strategic, tactical and operational planning, fire management,
   conservation and the use of OR to address environmental concerns. The
   paper also considers more general methodological areas that are
   important to forestry including uncertainty, multiple objectives and
   hierarchical planning.}},

Abstract = {{Tidal turbine developers and researchers use small scale testing (i. e.
   tow tank and flume testing) as a cost effective and low risk way to
   conduct proof-of-concept studies and evaluate early stage device
   performance. This paper presents experimental performance data for a
   three-bladed 1/20th scale NREL S814 tidal turbine rotor, produced at the
   4.6 x 2.5 m and 76 m long Kelvin Hydrodynamics Laboratory tow tank at
   Strathclyde University. The rotor performance was characterised from
   very low tip speed ratios to runaway for four carriage speeds. A maximum
   CP of 0.285 and a maximum C-T of 0.452 were recorded at tip speed ratios
   of 3.53 and 4.45 for a carriage speed of 1 m/s. The uncertainty in the
   instrument calibration and experimental measurements was quantified,
   allowing accurate representation of the experiments in numerical models.
   The methodology behind the uncertainty calculations is described in this
   paper. The uncertainty in the experimental measurements was found to be
   less than 5\% for over 87\% of the tests. Reynolds number scaling
   effects were found to be influential on the rotor performance in the
   range of velocities tested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Lead-acid battery response to various formation levels - Part A:
   Recommended formation levels for off-grid solar and conventional
   applications}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{A significant amount of people in the world are without electricity
   service, the majority of which are located in rural areas where
   extending the electricity grid is not economically feasible. Off-grid
   solar photovoltaic technology has been identified as the most prominent
   option to electrify these rural areas, of which lead-acid storage
   batteries are a major component.
   The formation process of lead-acid batteries is poorly defined in the
   public literature as it is considered confidential by battery
   manufacturers. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the
   lead-acid battery characteristics of amp-hour capacity, voltage, and
   temperature as a function of formation level using a constant-current
   algorithm, with the goal of identifying the optimal formation level for
   both conventional and off-grid solar applications.
   Eight cells are formed using the container formation method to a
   different level in order to capture a wide range of variations. For a
   positive plate thickness of 4.32 mm, it is suggested that the formation
   levels for conventional and off-grid solar applications are 2.3 and 2.8
   times the theoretical capacity of the cell, respectively. This range
   overlaps, but extends beyond the range recommended in literature of
   1.24-2.50 times the theoretical capacity of the cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   Internal resistance}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{126-133}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In Part A of this study, eight lead-acid battery cells were formed to
   different levels to investigate their performance in conventional and
   off-grid solar photovoltaic applications. In Part B of the study (this
   article) the objective is to investigate the internal resistance of the
   cells as a function of finished formation level. Cells were formed to
   levels corresponding to 0.7, 1.4, 1.9, 2.3, 2.8, 4.2, 5.6, and 7.0 times
   their theoretical capacity, and cycled 10 times using a deep-cycle
   algorithm. A correlation between formation level and internal resistance
   is shown. Higher formation levels resulted in lower internal resistance
   values for both discharging and charging processes, although they
   differed in magnitude. It is also shown that internal resistance values
   of the under-formed cells start converging with the remaining cells
   after 4 cycles as they complete their formation process. It is
   recommended that manufacturers of under-formed cells suggest higher
   voltage setpoints during the constant-voltage phase of the charge. This
   would overcome the high internal resistance limitations of these
   aforementioned cells, thus allowing for faster formation completion,
   while increasing their energy efficiency in deep-cycling operation. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examined whether a measured increase in average body size of
   adult sea scallops inside three fishery closed areas on Georges Bank
   (GB), United States (US), was sufficient to increase larval supply to
   closed areas and open fishing areas in both US and Canadian areas of the
   Bank. The effects of adult scallop density-at-size and fecundity-at-size
   on egg production were compared among open and closed fishery areas,
   countries, and time periods before and after the closed areas were
   established. Estimated egg production was then used to define spawning
   conditions in a coupled biological-physical larval tracking model that
   simulated larval development, mortality, and dispersal. Results showed
   that order of magnitude increases in larval settlement after closure
   were facilitated by increases in size-dependant egg production inside
   and dispersal from Closed Areas I and II, but not Nantucket Lightship
   Closed Area. The distributions of both egg production and larval
   settlement became more uniform across the Bank, causing the relative
   contribution of Canadian larvae to US scallop aggregations to decrease
   after establishment of Closed Areas I and II. Decreases in small and
   medium-sized scallop density in Canada and decreases in large scallops
   over the US-Southern Flank after closure caused local declines in egg
   production but were not sufficient to negatively affect larval
   settlement at the regional scale. Our model suggests that the
   establishment of fishery closed areas on GB considerably strengthened
   larval supply and settlement within and among several adult scallop
   aggregations.}},

Abstract = {{The incorporation of functional ingredients in food products is often
   limited by their taste and instability during processing and storage.
   Encapsulation techniques are commonly used to overcome these limitations
   and for the development of value-added products. Although different
   methods and materials are available, their selection will depend on the
   bioactive properties and the desired characteristics of the encapsulate
   and the final product. Physicochemical characteristics of encapsulates
   should be assessed and considered during all stages of food processing.
   Although a considerable body of literature has reported the
   encapsulation of bioactives, there is still a large gap between research
   and their application and commercialization into food products. The
   purposes of this review are to provide an overview of the current
   research on the encapsulation of bioactive components and methods used
   for their preparation, discuss relevant physicochemical characteristics
   that should be considered for the application of encapsulates into food

Abstract = {{Solvent extraction of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUPA) ethyl
   esters (Et) from 18/I2EE fish oil was performed with an aqueous silver
   nitrate solution in a mini-fluidic reactor framework. The resulting
   extraction was compared within conventional stirred-tank reactors, with
   practical extraction yields of EPA-Et and DHA-Et approaching 60 to 70 wt
   \%. Equilibrium was reached in less than 36 s at 10 degrees C, despite
   stratified flow being observed rather than previously reported slug-flow
   profiles in idealized fluid pairs at these scales. The deviation in flow
   pattern was attributed to a measured order of magnitude reduction in the
   interfacial tension between fish oils and AgNO3 solution relative to
   idealized solvent mixtures using hexane/heptane as a carrier for
   purified EPA/DHA. The impact of solvent addition to fish oils on
   interfacial tension with silver nitrate solutions was subsequently
   explored through spinning drop tensiometry, suggesting that the
   heterogeneous nature of raw fish oils will yield significantly different
   flow patterns than previously considered in extraction studies utilizing
   AgNO3 solutions. These results are applicable both to mini-fluidic
   systems and for the approximation of interfacial tension in fish
   oil/organic/aqueous extraction systems.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost deuterated electrolyte suitable for in situ neutron
   diffraction measurements of normal and high voltage Li-ion battery
   electrodes is reported here. Li{[}Ni0.4Mn0.4Co0.2]O-2/graphite
   (NMC(442)/graphite) pouch cells filled with 1:0.1:2 (molar ratio) of
   lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSi):LiPF6: ethyl acetate (EA) and
   LiFSi:LiPF6:deuterated EA (d8-EA) electrolytes were successfully cycled
   between 2.8V and 4.7 Vat 40 degrees C for 250 h without significant
   capacity loss, polarization growth, or gas production. The
   signal-to-noise ratio of neutron powder diffraction patterns taken on
   NMC(442) powder with a conventional deuterated organic carbonate-based
   electrolyte and filled with LiFSi:LiPF6:d8-EA electrolyte were virtually
   identical. Out of all the solvents widely available in deuterated form
   tested in highly-concentrated systems, EA was the only one providing a
   good balance between cost and charge-discharge capacity retention to 4.7
   V. The use of such an electrolyte blend would half the cost of
   deuterated solvents needed for in situ neutron diffraction measurements
   of Li-ion batteries compared to conventional deuterated carbonate-based
   electrolytes. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a techno-economic evaluation of retrofitting
   internal combustion engine (ICE) based cogeneration systems in the
   Canadian housing stock (CHS). The study was conducted using the Canadian
   Hybrid Residential End-Use Energy and GHG Emissions Model (CHREM). CHREM
   includes close to 17,000 unique house files that are statistically
   representative of the Canadian housing stock. The cogeneration system
   performance was evaluated using a high resolution integrated building
   performance simulation software. It is assumed that the ICE cogeneration
   system is retrofitted into all houses that currently use a central space
   heating system and have a suitable basement or crawl space. The GHG
   emission intensity factor associated with marginal electricity
   generation in each province is used to estimate the annual GHG emissions
   reduction due to the cogeneration system retrofit. The results show that
   cogeneration retrofit yields 13\% energy savings in the CHS. While the
   annual GHG emissions would increase in some provinces due to
   cogeneration retrofits, the total GHG emissions of the CHS would be
   reduced by 35\%. The economic analysis indicates that ICE cogeneration
   system retrofits may provide an economically feasible opportunity to
   approach net/nearly zero energy status for existing Canadian houses. (C)

Abstract = {{Nonylphenol (NP) is an endocrine disruptor and causes feminization in
   various organisms. This study aims to determine the water quality
   criteria for NP in China based on species sensitivity distribution (SSD)
   models considering both reproductive and traditional toxicity effects. A
   total of 17 chronic values with reproductive endpoints and 14 chronic
   values with traditional endpoints tested with aquatic species resident
   in China were found in published literature, among which six values were
   from marine species. As chronic toxicity data for marine species were
   limited, the acute-to-chronic toxicity ratio methodology was employed to
   extrapolate from acute-to-chronic toxicity values. The SSD models were
   then built with a whole set of chronic toxicity values for NP. Based on
   model simulation, the chronic water quality criterion in fresh water was
   calculated as 1.37 mu g/L and 4.29 mu g/L for reproductive endpoints and
   traditional endpoints, respectively. The criterion in seawater was
   derived as 1.68 mu g/L for traditional endpoints. Although these
   criteria were derived by a third-party organization not affiliated with
   the Chinese authority for criteria development, they were obtained from
   a scientific point of view and can be used to evaluate water quality and
   ecological risks of nonylphenol in various water bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage (AMD) is characterized as having low pH and high
   concentrations of sulfate and dissolved metals. This study compared
   treated water quality and sludge properties of three process
   technologies for AMD: conventional sedimentation, high density sludge
   (HDS), and ballasted flocculation. All three processes were found to be
   capable of removing regulated metals to concentrations below current
   Canadian discharge guidelines. However, ballasted flocculation was the
   only technology found to be able to meet the more stringent federal
   guidelines proposed for future implementation under the Fisheries' Act's
   Metal Mining Effluent Regulations. Specifically, arsenic and zinc
   concentrations in AMD treated by the conventional and HDS processes were
   above proposed future guidelines of 0.10 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively,
   while lead, copper, and nickel all met respective guidelines.
   Concentrations of all regulated contaminants were below proposed
   guidelines when treated by ballasted flocculation. The HDS process was
   found to produce a significantly more concentrated sludge than
   conventional sedimentation (i.e., higher solids content (19 +/- 1\%
   versus 7 +/- 4\% wet solids) and lower sludge volume index (SVI; 8.4 +/-
   0.8 versus 230 +/- 20 mL/g)).}},

Abstract = {{The reliability, energy efficiency and real-time display of patient's
   data are important factors for body area network (BAN) communication in
   indoor hospital environments. In this paper, we propose a novel routing
   protocol by considering the quality of service (QoS) requirements of BAN
   data with strict reliability requirements. Our proposed algorithm
   increases the reliable delivery of critical BAN data at the destination.
   We have performed extensive simulations in the OMNeT++-based simulator
   Castalia 3.2 to demonstrate the better performance of the proposed
   QoS-based routing protocol for reliability sensitive data in terms of
   lower network routing traffic (Hello packets) overhead, less reliability
   packets dropped, lower end-to-end delay (latency), less packets dropped
   due to media access control (MAC) buffer overflow and higher throughput
   in both stationary and movable patient scenarios. The scalability of the
   protocol is demonstrated by using two cases that simulate a 24 beds and
   a 46 beds real hospital environment with a 49 and 93 nodes,
   respectively. It is shown that, even in the larger real hospital
   scenarios, simulating a hospital with 24 and 46 beds requiring the
   transmission of critical data packets with stringent reliability
   requirements, QPRR outperforms comparable protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Soft Error Rates (SER) of hardened and unhardened SRAM cells need to be
   experimentally characterized to determine their appropriate applications
   in radiation environments. This characterization is especially important
   when low supply voltage is preferred. In this paper, we developed an
   SRAM test chip with four cell arrays including two types of unhardened
   cells (standard 6T and subthreshold 10T) and two types of hardened cells
   (Quatro and DICE). This test chip was fabricated in a 65 nm bulk
   technology and irradiated by heavy ions at different supply voltages.
   Experimental results show that the SERs of 6T and 10T cells present
   significant sensitivities to supply voltages when the particle linear
   energy transfers (LETs) are relatively low. For Quatro and DICE cells,
   one does not consistently show superior hardening performance over the
   other. It is also noted that Quatro cells show significant advantage in
   single event resilience over 10T cells although they consume similar
   areas. TCAD simulations were carried out to validate the experimental
   data. In addition, the error amount distributions follow a Poisson
   distribution very well for each type of cell array.}},

Title = {{Urban water resources allocation under the uncertainties of water supply

Abstract = {{In recent years, Urumqi has been suffering from growing water resources
   shortage due to climate change and socioeconomic activities. Integrated
   water resources management approach is urgent for regional sustainable
   development. However, uncertainties around the supply and demand side
   are problematic for regional water resources planning and policy-making.
   To address these uncertainties, an inexact multi-stage dual-stochastic
   programming (IMDSP) was proposed for supporting urban water resources
   management in Urumqi, China. The developed model can manage the
   uncertainties of parameters and stochastic variables through the
   incorporation of interval-parameter programming (IPP), dual-stochastic
   programming (DSP) and multi-stage optimization programming (MSP).
   Strategic water-allocation plans that combine surface water,
   groundwater, diverse water users, and water sources were obtained
   through the solutions of this model. Varied benefits and recourse costs,
   water supply risk analysis were conducted in detailed computational
   results. The obtained results can help decision makers identify
   optimized water-allocation schemes under water scarcity and environment
   deterioration.}},

Abstract = {{A blind source separation (BSS) is proposed to reject the crosstalk
   between inductive-coupling channels in 3-D systems. The phase and
   permutation ambiguities inherent to BSS are compensated for in the
   proposed technique. A continuous-time natural gradient BSS with
   integrator output swing bounding, which is amenable for high-speed
   implementation, is also proposed. Techniques to reduce the
   implementation complexity for a large channel array are presented. The
   proposed technique shows substantial improvement results for crosstalk
   rejection in a high-crosstalk-coupling environment. In addition, for a 3
   x 3 array channel with 1 Gb/s/channel, with a crosstalk-to-signal ratio
   of -3 dB, a bit-error rate of 10(-11) is obtained compared to 10(-4)
   without BSS.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy produces rapid, dramatic volume-overload changes to the
   maternal circulation. This paper examines pregnancy-induced
   structural-mechanical changes in bovine aortic and mitral heart valve
   leaflets. Valve leaflets were harvested from non-pregnant heifers and
   pregnant cows. Dimensions, biaxial extensibility and creep resistance
   were assessed and related to changes in the collagen network:
   histological leaflet and anatomic layer thicknesses plus collagen crimp,
   and biochemical collagen content. Collagen stability and crosslinking
   were assessed thermomechanically. Pregnancy altered both aortic and
   mitral valve leaflets. Both valves demonstrated biphasic changes in
   leaflet stretch, decreasing in early pregnancy and recovering by late
   pregnancy. Creep in leaflets from both valves was minimal and decreased
   even further with pregnancy in the mitral valve. There were
   valve-specific changes in preconditioning areal extension with
   pregnancy: increasing in the aortic valve and decreasing in the mitral
   valve. Leaflet area increased dramatically (84\% aortic, 56\% mitral),
   with thickening mainly in the fibrosa, accompanied by increases in
   collagen content (8\% aortic, 16\% mitral): together suggesting
   synthesis of new collagen. Collagen crimp was almost completely lost in
   pregnancy, with the denaturation temperature decreased by approximately
   2 A degrees C. Mature and total crosslinking increased, curiously
   without a significant increase in immature crosslinking. Mature aortic
   and mitral heart valve leaflets in the maternal cardiovascular system
   remodel substantially and similarly-despite their different
   embryological origins.}},

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen whose survival in food
   processing environments may be associated with its tolerance to
   desiccation. To probe the molecular mechanisms used by this bacterium to
   adapt to desiccation stress, a transposon library of 11,700 L.
   monocytogenes mutants was screened, using a microplate assay, for
   strains displaying increased or decreased desiccation survival (43\%
   relative humidity, 15 degrees C) in tryptic soy broth (TSB). The
   desiccation phenotypes of selected mutants were subsequently assessed on
   food-grade stainless steel (SS) coupons in TSB plus 1\% glucose
   (TSB-glu). Single transposon insertions in mutants exhibiting a change
   in desiccation survival of >0.5 log CFU/cm(2) relative to that of the
   wild type were determined by sequencing arbitrary PCR products. Strain
   morphology, motility, and osmotic stress survival (in TSB-glu plus 20\%
   NaCl) were also analyzed. The initial screen selected 129
   desiccation-sensitive (DS) and 61 desiccation-tolerant (DT) mutants, out
   of which secondary screening on SS confirmed 15 DT and 15 DS mutants.
   Among the DT mutants, seven immotile and flagellum-less strains
   contained transposons in genes involved in flagellum biosynthesis (fliP,
   flhB, flgD, flgL) and motor control (motB, fliM, fliY), while others
   harbored transposons in genes involved in membrane lipid biosynthesis,
   energy production, potassium uptake, and virulence. The genes that were
   interrupted in the 15 DS mutants included those involved in energy
   production, membrane transport, protein metabolism, lipid biosynthesis,
   oxidative damage control, and putative virulence. Five DT and 14 DS
   mutants also demonstrated similar significantly (P<0.05) different
   survival relative to that of the wild type when exposed to osmotic
   stress, demonstrating that some genes likely have similar roles in
   allowing the organism to survive the two water stresses.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 corrosion, or `sweet corrosion,' is the most prevalent form of
   attack encountered in oil and gas pipelines. Corrosion of carbon steel
   in CO2-containing environment is very complex and requires extensive
   attention. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
   phenomenon. However, these mechanisms either apply to very specific
   conditions or have not received widespread recognition or acceptance. To
   establish a fundamental understanding of CO2 attacks on steel, it is
   essential to conduct further studies to investigate the formation,
   composition, microstructure, and characteristics of the surface film
   induced by carbon dioxide corrosion. In this study, corrosion behavior
   of API pipeline steel has been assessed in 2 g/l NaCl solution purged
   with CO2 as the corrosive media. Specimens were immersed in the
   corrosive solution (open system) for 15, 45, 100, and 185 h. In this
   study, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy were employed systematically to characterize
   the composition, microstructure, and formation of the surface film on
   API X42 steel.}},

Title = {{Real-time imaging of in-vitro human middle ear using high frequency
   ultrasound}},
Journal = {{HEARING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{326}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Imaging techniques currently used in the clinic to inspect ears in
   patients are generally limited to views terminating at the tympanic
   membrane (TM) surface. For imaging past the TM, methods such as computed
   tomography are typically used, but in addition to disadvantages such as
   being costly, time consuming, and causing radiation exposure, these
   often do not provide sufficient resolution of the middle ear structures
   of interest. This study presents an investigation into the capability of
   high frequency ultrasound to image the middle ear with high resolution
   in real-time, as well as measure vibrations of TM and middle ear
   structures in response to sound stimuli. In unfixed cadaver ears, the
   TM, ossicles, and ossicular support tissues were all readily
   identifiable, with capabilities demonstrated for real-time imaging and
   video capture, and vibrometry of middle ear structures. Based on these
   results, we conclude that high frequency ultrasonography is a relatively
   simple and minimally invasive technology with great potential to provide
   clinicians with new tools for diagnosing and monitoring middle ear
   pathologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   consideration geographic location (Greenwood, Sydney, Caribou Point),
   and wind turbine capacity (including 20, 35, and 50 kW). The biogas
   energy production component reflected a representative Nova Scotia,
   Canada dairy farm with 100 cows. Wind biogas hybrid energy systems were
   generally not economically feasible without COMFIT scheme financial
   incentives. Locating the hybrid energy system one km away from a utility
   grid increased cost of energy produced by about \$0.06 per kWh. Under
   current government COMFIT scheme with guaranteed energy prices, economic
   feasibility improved relative to a base scenario, with NPV per kWh
   increasing from -\$0.51 to \$0.83 for a system with the 50 kW turbine at
   Caribou Point, compared with -\$0.51 to -\$0.14 for a similar 50 kW
   turbine at Sydney. Wind biogas power production was economically viable
   under COMFIT scheme prices only for Caribou Point. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A highly linear current-controlled delay unit (CCDU) is presented. The
   proposed design linearly delays an input clock edge against an applied
   input current. The topology features a directly proportional
   input/output relation compared with an inversely proportional one in the
   traditional current-starved inverter (CSI). The proposed CCDU features a
   THD of only 0.15\% compared with 22.6\% in a conventional CSI over the
   same input dynamic current range of 180 nA. The proposed CCDU is
   implemented in 65 nm CMOS and consumes only 0.74 mu W. An
   analogue-time-digital ADC is simulated using the proposed CCDU as a
   front-end block, achieving a resolution (ENOB) of 9.07 bits. Monte Carlo
   analysis confirms the linearity of the proposed CCDU under mismatch and
   process variation.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) design aims to incorporate
   environmental considerations into the traditional supply chain design by
   including recycling, disassembly and reuse activities. A CLSCN
   incorporates the use and reuse of environmentally friendly products and
   materials supported by the design of an appropriate recovery,
   disassembly, and refurbishing network. In the design process, a
   trade-off must often be made between the need to maximize profit and
   maximize greenness. The latter is considered for several reasons
   including regulatory requirements, corporate responsibility and
   corporate image. In this paper, a bi-objective mixed integer programming
   model is developed and solved for a forward/reverse logistic network
   including three echelons in the forward direction (suppliers, assembly
   centers and customer zones) and two echelons in the reverse direction
   (disassembly and recycling center). A set of Pareto optimal solutions is
   obtained to show the trade-off between the profit and the greenness
   objectives. Some useful managerial insights are developed through
   various computational experiments. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing

Title = {{The surface structure of silver-coated gold nanocrystals and its
   influence on shape control}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the surface structure of metal nanocrystals with specific
   facet indices is important due to its impact on controlling nanocrystal
   shape and functionality. However, this is particularly challenging for
   halide-adsorbed nanocrystals due to the difficulty in analysing
   interactions between metals and light halides (for example, chloride).
   Here we uncover the surface structures of chloride-adsorbed,
   silver-coated gold nanocrystals with \{111\}, \{110\}, \{310\} and
   \{720\} indexed facets by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density
   functional theory modelling. The silver-chloride, silver-silver and
   silver-gold bonding structures are markedly different between the
   nanocrystal surfaces, and are sensitive to their formation mechanism and
   facet type. A unique approach of combining the density functional theory
   and experimental/simulated X-ray spectroscopy further verifies the
   surface structure models and identifies the previously indistinguishable
   valence state of silver atoms on the nanocrystal surfaces. Overall, this
   work elucidates the thus-far unknown chloride-metal nanocrystal surface
   structures and sheds light onto the halide-induced growth mechanism of
   anisotropic nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to the remarkable progress in risk analysis of normal
   accidents, the risk analysis of major accidents has not been so
   well-established, partly due to the complexity of such accidents and
   partly due to low probabilities involved. The issue of low probabilities
   normally arises from the scarcity of major accidents' relevant data
   since such accidents are few and far between. In this work, knowing that
   major accidents are frequently preceded by accident precursors, a novel
   precursor-based methodology has been developed for likelihood modeling
   of major accidents in critical infrastructures based on a unique
   combination of accident precursor data, information theory, and
   approximate reasoning. For this purpose, we have introduced an
   innovative application of information analysis to identify the most
   informative near accident of a major accident. The observed data of the
   near accident were then used to establish predictive scenarios to
   foresee the occurrence of the major accident. We verified the
   methodology using offshore blowouts in the Gulf of Mexico, and then
   demonstrated its application to dam breaches in the United Sates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and testing results of a complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor double-bulk harmonic-rejection (HR) mixer for
   wideband applications. An optimal gate-source bias voltage in the
   sub-threshold regime of the input transistor is found theoretically to
   achieve maxim HR by analysing the mixing mechanism of double-bulk mixer;
   and a double-bulk mixer has been designed and fabricated to verify the
   theoretical analysis. Test results substantiate the existence of the
   optimal bias point for HR of double-bulk-driven mixer when the
   sinusoidal local oscillator (LO) is applied. This simple but effective
   topology can achieve higher than 36, 44, 60 and 62 dB HR ratio for the
   third-, fifth-, seventh- and ninth-order of LOs, respectively, over
   broadband. The double-bulk mixer which input bandwidth is from 250 MHz
   to 3 GHz, including the buffer, consumes 5 mA current from 1 V power

Abstract = {{Background: We previously reported that fish proteins can alleviate
   metabolic syndrome (MetS) in obese animals and human subjects.
   Objectives: We tested whether a salmon peptide fraction (SPF) could
   improve MetS in mice and explored potential mechanisms of action.
   Methods: ApoB(100) only, LDL receptor knockout male mice
   (LDLR-/-/ApoB(100/100) were fed a high-fat and -sucrose (HFS) diet (25
   g/kg sucrose). Two groups were fed 10 g/kg casein hydrolysate (HFS), and
   1 group was additionally fed 4.35 g/kg fish oil (FO; HFS+FO). Two other
   groups were fed 10 g SPF/kg (HFS+SPF), and 1 group was additionally fed
   4.35 g FO/kg (HFS+SPF+FO). A fifth (reference) group was fed a standard
   feed pellet diet. We assessed the impact of dietary treatments on
   glucose tolerance, adipose tissue inflammation, lipid homeostasis, and
   hepatic insulin signaling. The effects of SPF on glucose uptake, hepatic
   glucose production, and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity were
   further studied in vitro with the use of L6 myocytes, FAO hepatocytes,
   and J774 macrophages.
   Results: Mice fed HFS+SPF or HFS+SPF+FO diets had lower body weight
   (protein effect, P = 0.024), feed efficiency (protein effect, P =
   0.018), and liver weight (protein effect, P = 0.003) as well as lower
   concentrations of adipose tissue cytokines and chemokines (protein
   effect, P <= 0.003) compared with HFS and HFS+FO groups. They also had
   greater glucose tolerance (protein effect, P < 0.001), lower activation
   of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/S6 kinase 1/insulin
   receptor substrate 1 (mTORC1/S6K1/IRS1) pathway, and increased insulin
   signaling in liver compared with the HFS and HFS+FO groups. The HFS+FO,
   HFS+SPF, and HFS+SPF+FO groups had lower plasma triglycerides (protein
   effect, P = 0.003; lipid effect, P = 0.002) than did the HFS group. SPF
   increased glucose uptake and decreased HGP and iNOS activation in vitro.
   Conclusions: SPF reduces obesity-linked MetS features in
   LDLR-/-/Apo(100/100) mice. The anti-inflammatory and glucoregulatory
   properties of SPF were confirmed in L6 myocytes, FAO hepatocytes, and
   J774 macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{The potential capability of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), with diverse
   surface functional groups for the purpose of enhancing the interlaminar
   fracture toughness of E-glass/epoxy composites was assessed. The GNPs
   included unmodified GNPs, and two chemically functionalized GNPs.
   Comparisons were made based on modes I, II and III interlaminar fracture
   toughness values. The results indicated that the interlaminar fracture
   toughness was increased significantly under mode I fracture, but not as
   much for the other modes. Based on the microscopic evaluation of the
   fracture surfaces, the inclusion of the functionalized GNPs generated
   the most resilient fiber/resin interface, thus, effectively inhibiting
   the crack propagation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many branches of lipid science, researchers are interested in
   non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) content and composition. For many
   years, diazomethane was the reagent of choice to selectively derivatize
   and then detect NEFA due to its highly specific methylation of the
   carboxylic acid functional group. While the activity of this
   derivatizing reagent is very defined, it is dangerous and can be
   difficult to obtain. In this brief review, we have compiled a collection
   of methods which allow for the detection of NEFA and hydroxy NEFA
   without the use of diazomethane. We have concentrated on methods that
   employ three distinct approaches of selective quantification/extraction,
   purification from total lipids and derivatization techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Knee replacements are common after hip replacement for end
   stage osteoarthritis. Whether abnormal knee mechanics exist in moderate
   hip osteoarthritis remains undetermined and has implications for
   understanding early osteoarthritis joint mechanics. The purpose of this
   study was to determine whether three-dimensional (3D) knee motion and
   muscle activation patterns in individuals with moderate hip
   osteoarthritis differ from an asymptomatic cohort and whether these
   features differ between contra- and ipsilateral knees.
   Methods: 3D motions and medial and lateral quadriceps and hamstring
   surface electromyography were recorded on 20 asymptomatic individuals
   and 20 individuals with moderate hip osteoarthritis during treadmill
   walking, using standardized collection and processing procedures.
   Principal component analysis was used to derive electromyographic
   amplitude and temporal waveform features. 3D stance-phase range of
   motion was calculated. A 2-factor repeated analysis of variance
   determined significant within-group leg and muscle differences.
   Student's t-tests identified between group differences, with Bonferroni
   corrections where applicable (alpha= 0.05).
   Findings: Lower sagittal plane motion between early and mid/late stance
   (5 degrees, P = 0.004, effect size: 0.96) and greater mid-stance
   quadriceps activity was found in the osteoarthritis group (P = 0.01).
   Compared to the ipsilateral knee, a borderline significant increase in
   mid-stance hamstring activity was found in the contralateral knee of the
   hip osteoarthritis group (P = 0.018).
   Interpretation: Bilateral knee mechanics were altered, suggesting
   potentially increased loads and knee muscle fatigue. There was no
   indication that one knee is more susceptible to osteoarthritis than the
   other, thus clinicians should include bilateral knee analysis when
   treating patients with hip osteoarthritis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to synthesize and optimize intrinsically
   radiopaque composite embolic microspheres for sustained release of
   doxorubicin in drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization. Using
   a design of experiments approach, 12 radiopaque composites composed of
   polylactic-co-glycolic acid and a radiopaque glass (ORP5) were screened
   over a range of compositions and examined for radiopacity (computed
   tomography) and density. In vitro cell viability was determined using an
   extract assay derived from each composition against the human
   hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2. Mathematical models based on
   a D-Optimal response surface methodology were used to determine the
   preferred radiopaque composite. The resulting radiopaque composite was
   validated and subsequently loaded with doxorubicin between 0 and 1.4\%
   (wt\% of polylactic-co-glycolic acid) to yield radiopaque composite
   drug-eluting beads. Thereafter, the radiopaque composite drug-eluting
   beads were subjected to an elution study (up to 168h) to determine
   doxorubicin release profiles (UV-Vis spectroscopy) and in vitro cell
   viability. Radiopaque composites evaluated for screening purposes had
   densities between 1.28 and 1.67g.cm(-3), radiopacity ranged between 211
   and 1450HU and cell viabilities between 91 and 106\% were observed. The
   optimized radiopaque composite comprised 23 wt\% polylactic-co-glycolic
   acid and 60 wt\% ORP5 with a corresponding density of 1.63 +/-
   0.001g.cm(-3), radiopacity at 1930 +/- 44HU and cell viability of 89 +/-
   7.6\%. Radiopaque composite drug-eluting beads provided sustained
   doxorubicin release over 168h. In conclusion, the mathematical models
   allowed for the identification and synthesis of a unique radiopaque
   composite. The optimized radiopaque composite had similar density and
   cell viability to commercially available embolic microspheres. It was
   possible to preload doxorubicin into radiopaque composite drug-eluting
   beads, such that sustained release was possible under simulated
   physiological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We have synthesized TiO2 doped strontium borate glasses,
   70B(2)O(3)-(30-x)SrO-xTiO(2) and 70B(2)O(3)-20SrO(10-x)Na2O-xTiO(2). The
   composition dependence of glass structure, density, thermal properties,
   durability, and cytotoxicity of degradation products was studied.
   Digesting the glass in mineral acid and detecting the concentrations of
   various ions using an ICP provided the actual compositions that were
   5-8\% deviated from the theoretical values. The structure was
   investigated by means of B-11 magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR
   spectroscopy. DSC analyses provided the thermal properties and the
   degradation rates were measured by measuring the weight loss of glass
   disc-samples in phosphate buffered saline at 37 degrees C in vitro.
   Finally, the MTT assay was used to analyze the cytotoxicity of the
   degradation products. The structural analysis revealed that replacing
   TiO2 for SrO or Na2O increased the BO3/BO4 ratio suggesting the
   network-forming role of TiO2. Thermal properties, density, and
   degradation rates also followed the structural changes. Varying SrO
   content predominantly controlled the degradation rates, which in turn
   controlled the ion release kinetics. A reasonable control (2-25\% mass
   loss in 21 days) over mass loss was achieved in current study. Even
   though, very high concentrations (up to 5500 ppm B, and 1200 ppm Sr) of
   ions were released from the ternary glass compositions that saturated
   the degradation media in 7 days, the degradation products from ternary
   glass system was found noncytotoxic. However, quaternary glasses
   demonstrated negative affect on cell viability due to very high (7000
   ppm) Na ion concentration. All the glasses investigated in current study
   are deemed fast degrading with further control over degradation rates,
   release kinetics desirable. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

   seven commonly identified phthalates found in soil and biosolids
   including: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP),
   benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), bis(2-diethylhexyl phthalate) (DEHP),
   di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), dipentyl phthalate (DPP) and di-n-butyl
   phthalate (DnBP). The developed method is capable of measuring
   phthalates in 15 min with sensitivity in the tenth of ng kg(-1) range.
   Parameters for ASE were investigated to render maximum efficiency of
   phthalate recovery using a tri-solvent extraction (ethyl acetate,
   hexane, dichloromethane) in a 2:3:2 ratio along with different
   temperatures and static periods. A detailed oven program was developed
   for the GC-MS analysis in which seven major phthalates were separated.
   The results obtained for recovery of phthalates ranged from 85 to 111\%
   in tests on field soils and an alkaline treated biosolid. The method was
   successfully validated for the SPE extraction efficiency and the loss of
   content. The optimized method resulted in high sensitivity of
   measurement with the LOD ranging from 0.03 ng kg(-1) to 0.27 mu g kg(-1)
   and the LOQ ranging from 0.1 ng kg(-1) to 0.87 mu g kg(-1) with the RSD
   ranging from 4.4 to 9.8\%. Concentrations of phthalates recovered in an
   agricultural field soil ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 to 0.15 +/- 0.04 ng
   g(-1) but were measured at 0.63 +/- 0.1 to 43 +/- 0.48 ng g(-1) in the
   same soil receiving an alkaline treated biosolid (ATB) amendment. The
   concentrations of phthalates found in the ATB used in the field soil
   ranged from 2.8 +/- 0.81 to 8.3 +/- 0.73 to g(-1) and the concentrations
   of phthalates in the raw untreated sewage solids (w/w) ranged from 3.4
   +/- 0.79 to 14.9 +/- 1.3 ng g(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanical/physical
   properties of an industrially processed Al-Zn-Mg-Cu powder metallurgy
   (PM) alloy and assess the subsequent effects of shot peening. The
   research involved a number of experimental techniques, including density
   measurements, tensile testing, Rockwell hardness measurements,
   nano-indentation, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Residual
   stress measurements were completed using a combination of X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and neutron diffraction (ND). Industrially produced
   specimens attained near full theoretical density and exhibited a nominal
   yield strength on the order of 460 MPa in the T6 condition. It was
   discovered that zinc had preferentially evaporated from the surface of
   the components during sintering. The depleted region persisted to a
   depth of approximate to 13 mm and resulted in reduced nano-hardness of
   1.65 GPa at the surface versus 2.50 GPa in the bulk. Shot peening
   increased the surface hardness of the alloy and resulted in a peak
   compressive residual stress of 232 MPa at the treated surface. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new method to determine epoxide:concentrations in oxidized oils Was
   developed and validated using H-1 NMR. Epoxides derived from lipid
   oxidation gave signals between 2.90 and 3.24 ppm, well separated from
   the signals of other lipid oxidation products. To calibrate, soybean,
   oils with a range of epoxide concentrations were synthesized and
   analyzed using NMR by taking the sn-1,3 glycerol protons (4.18, 4.33
   ppm) as internal references. The NMR signals were compared to the
   epoxide content determined by titration with hydrogen bromide
   (HBr)-acetic acid solution. As expected, the signal response increased
   with concentration linearly (R-2 = 99.96\%), and validation of the
   method gave results comparable to those of the HBr method. A study of
   the oxidative stability of soybean off was performed by applying this
   method to monitor epoxides during thermal lipid oxidation. The epoxide
   content increased over time and showed a different trend compared to
   peroxide value (PV). A phenomenological model was suggested to model
   epoxides derived from lipid oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{The demand-side management (DSM) is one of the most important aspects in
   future smart grids: towards electricity generation cost by minimizing
   the expensive thermal peak power plants. The DSM greatly affects the
   individual users' cost and per unit cost. The main objective of this
   research article is to develop a generic demand-side management (G-DSM)
   model for residential users to reduce peak-to-average ratio (PAR), total
   energy cost, and waiting time of appliances (WTA) along with fast
   execution of the proposed algorithm. We propose a system architecture
   and mathematical formulation for total energy cost minimization, PAR
   reduction, and WTA. The G-DSM model is based on genetic algorithm (GA)
   for appliances scheduling and considers 20 users having a combination of
   appliances with different operational characteristics. Simulation
   results show the effectiveness of G-DSM model for both single and
   multiple user scenarios. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Soil-Structure Interaction of Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete Slab
   Strips on a Geogrid Reinforced Subgrade}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Performance of slabs on grade is governed mainly by the mutual coupled
   performance of the slab stiffness and the subgrade support. The use of
   reinforcement geogrids to increase the stiffness and structural capacity
   of the subgrade support can be potentially advantageous, but is
   currently poorly understood, especially under frequent transient loading
   conditions. The objective of this experimental study is to investigate
   the beneficial use of geogrids as a reinforcing material in a loose
   subgrade. This paper presents the results of large scale laboratory
   tests on slab strips (300 mm wide 9 150 mm thick 9 2,500 mm long)
   supported on a reinforced subgrade. The slab strips contained either
   steel fibers or were reinforced with welded wire fabric (WWF), and are
   compared with earlier tests on an unreinforced subgrade. All slab strips
   were tested under a central point load and were restrained from uplift
   at the ends. Both monotonic and cyclic loads are considered. The geogrid
   increases the bottom surface cracking load of the slab strip, does not
   affect the top surface cracking load, and increases the ultimate load
   carrying capacity. The use of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) was
   successful in providing post-cracking strength to maintain slab
   integrity when compared to the WWF reinforced slab strip used in this
   investigation. A simplified analysis of beams on grade is carried out
   for the elastic and post-cracking regions, and predicted values for the
   SFRC slab strip under monotonic load are compared to the measured
   load-deformation response. The comparison indicates that the theoretical
   response underestimates the capacity of the SFRC slab strip.}},

   anistropic materials. Analytical modeling of magneto-piezoelastic
   materials is essential for the design and applications in the smart

   time harmonic magneto-elastic-piezoelectricity problems using the
   boundary integral technique, and the exact analytical solutions are
   obtained. As an application, a two-dimensional static plane-strain
   problem is considered to investigate the effect of magnetic field on
   piezoelectric materials. The closed-form analytical solutions are
   obtained for a number of boundary conditions for all components of the
   magneto-piezoelectric field. As a special case, numerical results are
   presented for two-dimensional static magneto-electroelastic field of a
   piezoelectric solid subjected to a concentrated line load and an
   electric charge. The numerical solutions are obtained for three
   different piezoelectric materials and they demonstrate a substantial

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Safe drinking water and wastewater sanitation are universally recognized
   as critical components of public health. It is well documented that a
   lack of access to these basic services results in millions of
   preventable deaths each year among vulnerable populations. Water and
   wastewater technologies and management practices are frequently tailored
   to local environmental conditions. Also important, but often overlooked
   in water management planning, are the social, cultural and economic
   contexts in which services are provided. The purpose of this qualitative
   case study was to identify and understand residents' perceptions of the
   functionality of current water and wastewater sanitation systems in one
   vulnerable context, that of a remote Arctic Aboriginal community (Coral
   Harbour, Nunavut), and to identify potential future water related health
   risks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 Inuit residents
   and 9 key informants in 2011 and 2012. Findings indicate that the
   population's rapid transition from a semi-nomadic hunting and gathering
   lifestyle to permanent settlements with municipally provided utilities
   is influencing present-day water usage patterns, public health
   perceptions, and the level of priority decision-makers place on water
   and wastewater management issues. Simultaneously environmental, social
   and cultural conditions conducive to increased human exposure to
   waterborne health risks were also found to exist and may be increasing
   in the settlements. While water and wastewater system design decisions
   are often based on best practices proven suitable in similar
   environmental conditions, this study reinforces the argument for
   inclusion of social, cultural, and economic variables in such decisions,
   particularly in remote and economically challenged contexts in Canada or
   elsewhere around the world. The results also indicate that the addition
   of qualitative data about water and wastewater systems users' behaviours
   to technical knowledge of systems and operations can enhance the
   understanding of human water interactions and be valuable in risk
   assessments and intervention development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Using a multi-variable design approach this study sought to determine
   whether calcium polyphosphate (CPP) could be precipitated with a
   significantly higher chain length than achieved with conventional
   melt-derived glass and subsequently enhance the performance of the
   CPP-based drug delivery matrix. Manipulating aqueous sodium
   polyphosphate concentration, order of reactant addition, and Ca/P molar
   ratio at mix of reactants across a minimum of two levels was found to
   significantly influence the chain length, Ca/P ratio, and residual
   sodium of the resulting CPP precipitates. The various interactions of
   these three variables were also found to have a significant impact on
   the aforementioned properties of the precipitates and we successfully
   fabricated a precipitate with a 6-fold increase in chain length over
   that achieved by conventional melting. Despite not seeing a significant
   improvement in drug release properties, our systematic preparation of
   calcium polyphosphate from aqueous sodium polyphosphate solutions
   yielded valuable mechanistic data on this interesting fabrication
   strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Existing control approaches for the precision motion control of linear
   motor driven systems are mostly based on rigid-body dynamics of the
   system. Since all drive systems are subjected to the effect of
   structural flexible modes of their mechanical parts, the neglected
   high-frequency dynamics resulting from these structural modes have
   become the main limiting factor when pushing for better tracking
   performance and higher closed-loop control bandwidth. In this paper,
   physical modeling and dynamic analysis that take into account the
   flexibility of the ball bearings between the stage and the linear
   guideways are presented with experimental verification. With the gained
   knowledge of these high-frequency dynamics, a novel mu-synthesis-based
   adaptive robust control strategy is subsequently developed. The proposed
   control algorithm uses adaptive model compensation having accurate
   online parameter estimation to effectively deal with various
   nonlinearity effects and to transform the difficult trajectory tracking
   control problem into a robust stabilization problem. The well-developed
   mu-synthesis-based linear robust control technique is then employed in
   the fast feedback control loop design to explicitly deal with the robust
   control issue associated with the high-frequency dynamics to achieve
   higher closed-loop bandwidth for better disturbance rejection.
   Comparative experiments have been performed and the results show the
   better tracking performance of the proposed algorithm over existing
   ones.}},

Title = {{Breakdown of a Pressurized Fingerlike Crack in a Permeable Solid}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the analysis of a low-viscosity fluid
   injection into a preexisting, fingerlike crack within a linear elastic,
   permeable rock, and of the conditions leading to the onset of the
   fracture propagation (i.e., the breakdown). The problem is of interest
   in reservoir waterflooding, supercritical CO2 injection for geological
   storage, and other subsurface fluid injection applications. Fluid
   injection into a stationary crack leads to its elastic dilation and
   pressurization, buffered by the fluid leak-off into the surrounding
   rock. The solution of the problem, therefore, requires coupling of the
   crack deformation and the full-space pore-fluid pressure diffusion in
   the permeable rock. Contrary to the case of propagating hydraulic
   fractures, when significant part of the energy input is dissipated in
   the viscous fluid flow in the fracture, we find that the viscous fluid
   pressure drop inside a stationary fracture can be often neglected (we
   establish the conditions when one can do so). This, in turn, allows for
   a semi-analytical solution of the problem using the Green's function
   method, and, furthermore, for the full analytical treatment of the
   small/large injection time asymptotics. We apply the transient
   pressurization solution to predict the onset of the propagation based on
   the criteria derived from the energy considerations for a fingerlike
   crack.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Retrospective review.
   Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how several
   preoperative variables affect the outcome using the rib-to-pelvis S-hook
   constructs of a rib-based distraction implant (Vertical Expandable
   Prosthetic Titanium Rib).
   Summary of Background Data. Rib-to-pelvis fixation with S-hooks is one
   of the options for distal anchoring of rib-based distraction growing rod
   construct to control early-onset spinal deformity. Since the initial
   report, the indications of pelvic fixation with S-hooks have been
   extended and modified.
   Methods. This is an institutional review board-approved retrospective
   study of patients who underwent rib-based growing rod system
   surgery-rib-to-pelvis construct with Dunn-McCarthy S-hook. Data
   evaluation included history, physical examination, preoperative and
   postoperative radiographs, surgical variables, and complications.
   Results. Sixty-five patients were evaluated; 38 were male and 27 were
   female. Mean age at initial procedure was 71 months. The mean follow-up
   was 46 months. There was a statistically significant improvement of the
   immediate postoperative Cobb angle and the last follow-up Cobb angle (P
   < 0.0001). Fifty percent of the patients (32/65) had S-hook-related
   complications. The most common complication was sliding of the S-hook
   out of the iliac crest, followed by infection, neuropathic pain, distal
   migration of more than 2 cm, fracture of the hook, and bursitis. The
   complications were related to the preoperative ambulatory status, the
   use of end-to-end rod connectors, surgical time, and not positioning the
   hook over the central one-third of the iliac crest at the initial
   implantation.
   Conclusion. The use of the S-hook as a pelvic attachment of the
   rib-based system is indicated in nonambulatory patients with
   progressive, early-onset scoliosis curve with a lack of adequate anchor
   at the lumbar spine. Several technical factors should be considered to
   reduce the complication rate.}},

Abstract = {{Construction of new highway embankments in urban areas often requires
   building over existing underground utilities and lifelines. Embankments
   constructed over such utilities often induce substantial additional
   earth pressures causing overstressing and/or unacceptable deformations
   of the buried pipes, resulting in interruption of service for both the
   utility and highway. There are several techniques that can be used to
   mitigate this problem. Geogrid-reinforced bridge platforms are one of
   the newer techniques to deal with this problem. In order to gain a
   better understanding of the earth pressure reduction that may be
   achieved by geogrid bridging, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation
   (MTO) constructed an instrumented full-scale test embankment over a
   geogrid-reinforced bridged trench. In this paper, the results of this
   full-scale test along with a numerical study to evaluate the stress
   reductions achieved by the use of geogrid bridging platform installation
   are reported. In addition, results of a parametric study to investigate
   the soil structure interaction of the proposed stress reduction system
   and its effectiveness on the reduction of the deformations, moments, and
   normal forces of a buried culvert are presented. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{In practice, inherent soil variability is not commonly considered in
   routine slope stability analysis. This is due mainly to the fact that
   the effect of soil variability is complex and difficult to quantify.
   Furthermore, the majority of available slope stability analysis computer
   programs used in practice, which adopt conventional limit equilibrium
   methods, are unable to consider this aspect explicitly. To predict the
   stability of a slope more accurately, especially the marginally stable
   ones, the effect of soil variability needs to be accounted for. In this
   paper, an advanced probabilistic analysis method called the random
   finite element method (RFEM), developed by Griffiths and Fenton in the
   1990s, is used to investigate the effect of soil variability on the
   reliability of a c'-phi' soil slope. The results from the probabilistic
   study demonstrate that soil variability has a significant effect on the
   reliability of a slope. It is concluded that the deterministic factor of
   safety (FOS) is not a reliable measure of the true safety of a slope
   with spatially variable soils.}},

   the pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes. To investigate potential
   environmental reservoirs of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes, surface
   water and point source pollution samples from an urban and a rural
   municipal water supply watershed in Nova Scotia, Canada, were examined
   over 18 months. Presumptive Listeria spp. were cultured from 72 and 35\%
   of rural and urban water samples, respectively, with 24\% of the
   positive samples containing two or three different Listeria spp. The L.
   innocua (56\%) and L. welshimeri (43\%) groups were predominant in the
   rural and urban watersheds, respectively. Analysis by the TaqMan assay
   showed a significantly (P < 0.05) higher prevalence of L. monocytogenes
   of 62\% versus 17\% by the culture-based method. Both methods revealed
   higher prevalences in the rural watershed and during the fall and winter
   seasons. Elevated Escherichia coli (>= 100 CFU/100 ml) levels were not
   associated with the pathogen regardless of the detection method.
   Isolation of Listeria spp. were associated with 70 times higher odds of
   isolating L. monocytogenes (odds ratio = 70; P < 0.001). Serogroup IIa
   was predominant (67.7\%) among the 285 L. monocytogenes isolates,
   followed by IVb (16.1\%), IIb (15.8\%), and IIc (0.4\%). L.
   monocytogenes was detected in cow feces and raw sewage but not in septic
   tank samples. Pulsotyping of representative water (n = 54) and local
   human (n = 19) isolates suggested genetic similarities among some
   environmental and human L. monocytogenes isolates. In conclusion,
   temperate surface waters contain a diverse Listeria species population
   and could be a potential reservoir for L. monocytogenes, especially in
   rural agricultural watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Adjusting powder-liquid ratio (P/L) and polyacrylic acid concentration
   (AC) has been documented as a means of tailoring the handling and
   mechanical properties of glass ionomer cements (GICs). This work
   implemented a novel approach in which the interactive effects of these
   two factors on three key GIC properties (working time, setting time, and
   compressive strength) were investigated using a central composite design
   of experiments. Using nonlinear regression analysis,
   formulation-property relationships were derived for each property, which
   enabled prediction of an optimal formulation (P/L and AC) through
   application of the desirability approach. A novel aluminum free GIC was
   investigated, as this material may present the first clinically viable
   GIC for use in injectable spinal applications, such as vertebroplasty.
   Ultimately, this study presents the first series of predictive
   regression models that explain the formulation-dependence of a GIC, and
   the first statistical method for optimizing both P/L and AC depending on
   user-defined inputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-rich layered Ni-Mn-Co oxide materials have been intensely
   studied in the past decade. Mn-rich materials have serious voltage fade
   issues, and the Ni-rich materials have poor thermal stability and
   readily oxidize the organic carbonate electrolyte. Core-shell (CS)
   strategies that use Ni-rich material as the core and Mn-rich materials
   as the shell can balance the pros and cons of these materials in a
   hybrid system. The lithium-rich CS materials introduced here show much
   improved overall electrochemical performance compared to the core-only
   and shell-only samples. Energy dispersive spectroscopy results show that
   there was diffusion of transition metals between the core and shell
   phases after sintering at 900 degrees C compared to the prepared
   hydroxide precursors. A Mn-rich shell was still maintained whereas the
   Co which was only in the shell in the precursor was approximately
   homogeneous throughout the particles. The CS samples with optimal
   lithium content showed low irreversible capacity (IRC), as well as high
   capacity and excellent capacity retention. Sample CS2-3 (the third
   sample in the 0.67Li(1+x)(Ni0.67Mn0.33)(1-x)O-2 center dot
   0.33Li(1+y)(Ni0.4Mn0.5Co0.1)(1-y)O-2 CS2 series) had a reversible
   capacity of similar to 218 mAh/g with 12.3\% (similar to 30 mAh/g)
   irreversible capacity (IRC) and 98\% capacity retention after 40 cycles
   to 4.6 V at 30 degrees C at a rate of similar to C/20. Differential
   capacity versus potential (dQ/dV versus V) analysis confirmed that cells
   of the CS samples had stable impedance as well as a very stable average
   voltage. Apparently, the Mn-rich shell can effectively protect the
   Ni-rich core from reactions with the electrolyte while the Ni-rich core
   renders a high and stable average voltage.}},

Abstract = {{Solid particle erosion of steel is a function of abrasive particle
   properties, target material, erodent velocity, abrasive feed rate,
   impact angle and the environment. Steel microstructure, which directly
   influences its hardness and ductility, plays an important role in
   determining the erosion rate. In this study, the effect of
   microstructure on the erosion of AISI 1018 (pearlite + ferrite) and AISI
   1080 (pearlite) steel is investigated. Particle velocities and impact
   angles employed were as follows: 36, 47, 56 and 81 m s(-1) at 30
   degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively.
   Nano-indentation was performed and it was found that hardness of the
   various microstructures has an inverse relationship to erosion rate. It
   was also found that, contrary to expectation, at low impact angle, AISI
   1018 steel exhibits higher erosion resistance than AISI 1080 steel.
   Surface and sub-surface examinations were conducted using scanning
   electron microscopy. Ploughing, metal cutting and delamination are
   identified as dominant mechanisms during erosion of AISI 1018 and AISI
   1080 steel. It was observed that pearlitic and ferritic microstructures
   respond differently to erosion and that the orientation of pearlite
   plates with respect to the impinging particle affects the extent of
   metal removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The shock response of a submerged system consisting of two co-axial
   cylindrical shells coupled with the fluid filling the inter-shell space
   is considered. The shock-structure interaction is modeled using a
   semi-analytical methodology based on the use of the classical apparatus
   of mathematical physics. Both the fluid and structural dynamics of the
   interaction is addressed, with special attention paid to the interplay
   between the two. It is demonstrated that the wave effects due to
   multiple reflections of the pressure waves travelling in the inter-shell
   fluid to a large degree determine the structural dynamics of the system,
   but have a more pronounced effect on the outer shell than on the inner
   one. It is also established that the effect of changing the thickness of
   the outer shell on the stress-strain state of the inner shell is
   incomparably more pronounced than vice versa. The investigation
   culminates with the results of a parametric study of the overall peak
   stress in the system, an example of utilizing the approach developed
   based on the introduced model and aiming at facilitating structural
   optimization of industrial systems at the pre-design stage in the
   context of shock resistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   (HIE-FDTD) method is proposed for simulating graphene-based patch
   couplers at terahertz (THz) for different physical and geometrical
   parameters, where the Drude model of monolayer graphene and the
   associated auxiliary differential equation (ADE) technique are
   implemented. In order to accurately model the curved graphene
   boundaries, the conformal FDTD method is further hybridized with the
   HIE-FDTD method, which results in a conformal HIE-FDTD method. Numerical

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a serious complication of
   diabetes mellitus that impairs autonomic regulation of heart rate (HR).
   This has been attributed to damage to the nerves that modulate
   spontaneous pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node (SAN). Our
   objective was to test the hypothesis that impaired parasympathetic
   regulation of HR in diabetes is due to reduced responsiveness of the SAN
   to parasympathetic agonists. We used the Akita mouse model of type 1
   diabetes to study the effects of the parasympathetic agonist carbachol
   (CCh) on SAN function using intracardiac programmed stimulation, high
   resolution optical mapping and patchclamping of SAN myocytes. CCh
   decreased HR by 30\% and increased corrected SAN recovery time (cSNRT)
   by 123\% in wildtype mice. In contrast, CCh only decreased HR by 12\%,
   and only increased cSNRT by 37\% in Akita mice. These alterations were
   due to smaller effects of CCh on SAN electrical conduction and
   spontaneous action potential firing in isolated SAN myocytes. Voltage
   clamp experiments demonstrate that the acetylcholine-activated K+
   current (I-KACh) is reduced in Akita SAN myocytes due to enhanced
   desensitization and faster deactivation kinetics. These I-KACh
   alterations were normalized by treating Akita SAN myocytes with
   PI(3,4,5)P-3 or an inhibitor of regulator of G-protein signaling 4
   (RGS4). There was no difference in the effects of CCh on the
   hyperpolarization-activated current (If) between wildtype and Akita
   mice. Our study demonstrates that Akita diabetic mice demonstrate
   impaired parasympathetic regulation of HR and SAN function due to
   reduced responses of the SAN to parasympathetic agonists. Our
   experiments demonstrate a key role for insulin-dependent
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the parasympathetic
   dysfunction seen in the SAN in diabetes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS \& HARD MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{227-239}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Combining hard but brittle Ti(C,N) ceramic particles with the ductile
   Ni3Al intermetallic produces a ceramicmetal composite, or cermet, with
   high wear resistance. However, for high N content Ti(C,N) cermets, the
   wettability of molten Ni3Al is relatively poor, which leads to materials
   with residual porosity when a low binder volume fraction is used.
   Through a reaction sintering process, various amounts of Mo2C (from 1.25
   to 10 vol.\%) were incorporated into TiC0.3N0.7-Ni3Al cermets, with the
   aim of improving the densification behaviour. Materials were prepared
   with Ni3Al binder contents from 20 to 40 vol.\%, and were densified by
   vacuum sintering. Mo2C was found to improve upon the wettability during
   sintering, thus enhancing the densification, especially for the lowest
   binder contents. The sliding wear and Vickers indentation behaviour of
   these cermets were assessed. It was found that Mo2C additions had a
   positive effect on both the hardness and indentation fracture resistance
   of the samples, but had a detrimental effect on the sliding wear
   response of the cermets. This behaviour was attributed to increased
   microstructural inhomogeneity with Mo2C additions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   pixel-adaptive width and contrast estimations, the probability of
   detecting blur at edge pixels can be determined. Also, unlike previous
   work, we advocate using only the salient edge pixels to simulate the

   is obtained by cumulating the probability of blur detection. Various

Pages = {{828-836}},

Abstract = {{Abstract-This article describes a multi-objective optimization method to
   solve the optimal distributed generation sizing and placement. The
   optimization problem considers two objectives: minimizing the total real
   power losses of the network and minimizing the overall distributed
   generation installation cost. The objectives are combined into a scalar
   objective optimization problem by using weighted sum method. Both
   objective functions and equality and inequality constraints are
   formulated as a non-linear program and solved by a sequential quadratic
   programming deterministic technique. The multi-objective optimization
   method gives several answers instead of a single (unique) one. These
   answers are optimal, and the designer (decision maker) can select the
   proper solution according to subjective preferences. These optimum
   results are known as the Pareto front. A fuzzy decision-making procedure
   for order preference is used for finding the best compromise solution
   from the set of Pareto solutions. The proposed method is tested using a
   15-bus radial distribution system to show its applicability. A
   comparative study is performed to evaluate two cases-a single
   distributed generation unit installation and a multiple distributed
   generation installation-ending by a comparative study of the two cases.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have gained much attention in biomedical
   research because of their antibacterial properties. However, they have
   also exhibited cytotoxicity toward certain mammalian cells. In order to
   improve therapeutic efficacy, the incorporation of gold (Au) and Ag into
   bimetallic Ag-Au NPs is a promising strategy, as it has the potential to
   increase biocompatibility and maintain antibacterial activity. Toward
   this end, we prepared a series of bimetallic Ag-Au NPs and studied them
   with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in order to elucidate the
   correlation of atomic structure to their bioactivities. The addition of
   Au was found to drastically change the atomic structure of the Ag NPs;
   namely, the Ag core of the NPs was gradually replaced with Au, while Ag
   was found mostly on the surface. Next, NP antibacterial activity toward
   S. aureus and cytotoxicity toward NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells were
   assessed. It was found that the antibacterial activity of the bimetallic
   NPs was lower than pure Ag NPs and dependent on the Ag location within
   the NPs. On the other hand, the cytotoxicity of bimetallic NPs was much
   lower than the pure Ag NPs and dependent on the overall Au
   concentration. Using the structural information garnered from XAS, we
   were able to rationalize the bioactivity results of the NPs based on
   their atomic structure and provide guiding principles to design Au-Ag

Abstract = {{Subnanometer, atomically precise thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters
   represent an important advancement in our understanding of
   thiolate-protected gold nanoparticles and thiolate-gold chemistry. Aside
   from being a link between larger gold nanoparticles and small gold
   complexes, gold nanoclusters exhibit extraordinary molecule-like
   optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties that are promising
   for next-generation imaging agents, sensing devices, or catalysts. The
   success in elucidating a number of unique thiolate-gold surface and gold
   core structures has greatly improved our understanding of thiolate-gold
   nanoclusters. Nevertheless, monitoring the structural and electronic
   behavior of thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters in a variety of media
   or environments is crucial for the next step in advancing this class of
   nanomaterials. Not to mention, there are a number of thiolate-protected
   gold nanoclusters with unknown structures or compositions that could
   reveal important insights on application-based properties such as
   luminescence or catalytic activity. This review summarizes some of the
   recent contributions from X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies on
   the intriguing bonding properties of thiolate-protected gold
   nanoclusters and some structural analogs. Advantages from XAS include a
   local structural, site-and element-specific analysis, suitable for
   ultra-small particle sizes (1-2 nm), along with versatile experimental
   conditions.}},

   unforced stochastic singular systems to be regular and impulse-free. The
   mean-square exponential stability of the whole system is guaranteed
   under the proposed lemma. As a result, a suitable feedback controller is
   designed via strict linear matrix inequality such that the system's
   stabilisation problem is guaranteed. Finally, numerical examples are

Abstract = {{Non-classical ionomer glasses like those based on zinc-boron-germanium
   glasses are of special interest in a variety of medical applications
   owning to their unique combination of properties and potential
   therapeutic efficacy. These features may be of particular benefit with
   respect to the utilization of glass ionomer cements for minimally
   invasive dental applications such as the atruamatic restorative
   treatment, but also for expanded clinical applications in orthopedics
   and oral-maxillofacial surgery. A unique system of
   zinc-boron-germanium-based glasses (10 compositions in total) has been
   designed using a Design of Mixtures methodology. In the first instance,
   ionomer glasses were examined via differential thermal analysis, X-ray
   diffraction, and B-11 MAS NMR spectroscopy to establish fundamental
   composition - structure-property relationships for the unique system.
   Secondly, cements were synthesized based on each glass and handling
   characteristics (working time, W-t, and setting time, S-t) and
   compression strength were quantified to facilitate the development of
   both experimental and mathematical composition-structure-property
   relationships for the new ionomer cements. The novel glass ionomer
   cements were found to provide W-t, S-t, and compression strength in the
   range of 48-132s, 206-602s, and 16-36MPa, respectively, depending on the
   ZnO/GeO2 mol fraction of the glass phase. A lower ZnO mol fraction in
   the glass phase provides higher glass transition temperature, higher N-4
   rate, and in combination with careful modulation of GeO2 mol fraction in
   the glass phase provides a unique approach to extending the W-t and S-t
   of glass ionomer cement without compromising (in fact enhancing)
   compression strength. The data presented in this work provide valuable
   information for the formulation of alternative glass ionomer cements for
   applications within and beyond the dental clinic, especially where
   conventional approaches to modulating working time and strength exhibit
   co-dependencies (i.e. the enhancement of one property comes at the
   expense of the other) and therefore limit development strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a numerical study on the behavior and
   strength of unstiffened extended shear tab connections using finite
   element modeling. The model was verified with the experimental results
   reported in the literature. The parameters studied included the web
   slenderness ratio of supporting member, distance between the center bolt
   line and weld line, plate thickness, number of bolts, double-row of
   bolts, and beam lateral restraint. Results were analyzed to determine
   the effects of these parameters on the behavior and bolt shear strength
   and also used to assess the effectiveness of the AISC manual 2011 design
   procedure. It shows that the AISC design procedure for bolt shear
   fracture was overly conservative for extended shear tab connections with
   number of bolts less than 6 in a single row configuration. For
   connections with 6 bolts or higher or double-row bolts, the AISC design
   procedure provided reasonably good estimate. When the AISC design
   procedure was used but in combination with the finite element determined
   effective eccentricity, the estimate on bolt shear strength was markedly
   improved, especially for connections with less than 6 bolts in a single
   row configuration. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Responsible for 17\% of all energy consumption and 16\% of greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions in Canada, the residential sector presents
   substantial opportunities for reducing both energy consumption and GHG
   emissions. Being one of the highest per capita energy consumers in the
   world, there is increasing pressure on Canada to reduce both. Amongst
   the numerous options to reduce energy consumption in the residential
   sector is the large-scale adoption of active and passive solar
   technologies in the Canadian housing stock (CHS). In earlier
   publications, the authors have investigated the techno-economic
   feasibility of large-scale adoption of window and glazing modifications,
   window shading devices and solar domestic hot water systems in the CHS
   as retrofit measures. In this paper, the focus is on the adoption of
   thermal storage using phase change material (PCM) in the CHS as a
   retrofit measure. The results indicate that applying PCMs with melting
   temperature of 23 degrees C to the eligible houses reduce energy
   consumption GHG emissions of the Canadian housing stock by about 2.5\%.
   The economic feasibility results demonstrate the impact of fuel costs,
   as well as interest and energy price escalation rates on payback period.

Abstract = {{Torrefaction makes biomass brittle, and as such it is likely to produce
   more dusts during handling and transportation. So, it could increase the
   risk of explosion in plant using torrefied biomass. As the torrefaction
   technology enters commercial market the safety aspect of torrefied wood
   becomes important. The present paper is one of the first examinations of
   the question if torrefaction makes the biomass dust more explosive.
   Effects of torrefaction conditions on two important parameters that
   define the explosivity of a dust, i.e., minimum ignition temperature
   (MIT) and minimum explosible concentration (MEC) were studied. Above
   parameters were measured for Poplar wood before and after torrefaction.
   Three different particle size distributions of the wood, torrefied at
   200, 250 and 300 degrees C, were tested. Exploratory experiments
   reported here found negligible effect of torrefaction on measured values
   of;Deg;ME;Deg;C and MIT of biomass. However, torrefied particles larger
   than 100 micron showed higher values of MIT than that for raw biomass.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a computational simulation framework developed to
   capture the ratcheting response of dented straight pipes. The results
   are compared against the results obtained from our previously conducted
   experiments. Ratcheting occurs when a structure is subjected to a
   primary axial load along with a secondary cyclic load, provided that the
   applied loads are sufficiently large in magnitude to cause the material
   to yield. The dented pipes investigated in this study were initially
   subjected to a monotonic axial compression load, which caused the
   initiation of small amplitude wrinkles, and were subsequently subjected
   to an axial cyclic loading regime. A nonlinear finite element analysis,
   using a combined hardening model, was adopted to model the response of
   the material during the entire loading regime. The parameters required
   by the material model were obtained from cyclic tests conducted on
   representative coupon specimens. The results of the numerical
   simulations were compared to experimentally obtained data. The results
   demonstrated that the ratcheting response of dented pipes could be
   numerically simulated with a reasonable accuracy. The results also
   revealed that the surface imperfections exerted a very pronounced effect
   on the ratcheting response of the dented pipes. The computational model
   was also used to investigate the influence of some key parameters, such
   as the initial strain level, stress amplitude, mean stress, loading
   regime, and material hardening properties, on the resulting ratcheting.}},

Abstract = {{Fish oil is available primarily as triacylglycerols (TAG) or ethyl

   peroxide value (PV) and p-anisidine value (AV) were used to monitor

   temperatures from 5 to 60 A degrees C. Pseudo first-order kinetics were
   assumed and rate constants were calculated for each temperature. At all
   temperatures, the rates of oxidation were higher for EE oils than TAG
   oils. For PV and AV measured in both oils, non-linear Arrhenius models
   were plotted, generating activation energies that ranged from 7 to 103
   and 2 to 159 kJ/mol for PV and AV, respectively. Although TAG were more
   resistant to oxidation than EE, they had lower activation energies (E
   (a)) at a parts per thousand currency sign15 A degrees C for reactions

Abstract = {{The dynamic nature of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) requires
   efficient routing protocols for better performance. It is challenging to
   provide a universal routing protocol that performs well in all scenarios

   paper presents a novel direction and relative speed (DARS)-based routing
   protocol for highways using a single-hop packet forwarding approach. It
   selects the next hop using DARS of the vehicle. The experiments show
   significant improvement in packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay,
   packet drop ratio, and Jain's fairness index for proposed protocol

Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{79-92}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Optimal allocation of safety strategies in order to reduce threats of
   dust explosions is very challenging, particularly when all potential
   accident contributors and various safety measures are to be taken into
   account. In this paper, we have proposed a risk-based optimal allocation
   of safety measures while considering both available budget and
   acceptable residual risk. The methodology is based on a Bayesian network
   (BN) to model the risk of dust explosions, which in turn helps identify
   key contributing factors, assess performances of relative safety
   measures, and decide on those safety measures to most efficiently
   control the risks of dust explosions within a limited budget. The
   Bayesian network also facilitates the implementation of diagnostic
   analysis to determine vulnerable parts in the system to which special
   attention should be paid in safety measure allocation. The Net Risk
   Reduction Gain (NRRG) for each relevant safety measure is also used to
   simultaneously account for both the cost of a safety measure and the
   respective risk reduction. Accordingly, the risk-based optimal
   allocation of safety measures will be achieved by maximizing the sum of
   the NRRG of all relevant safety measures under limited budgets, which is
   regarded as a knapsack problem. We applied the methodology to the
   aluminum dust explosion that occurred at Hayes Lemmerz International,
   Huntington, Indiana, US in October 2003. The result shows the efficacy
   and applicability of the proposed methodology for optimal risk reduction
   within a limited budget. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of a virus transport process in a groundwater aquifer is
   necessary for predicting the movement of viruses in an aquifer. It is
   also necessary in implementing remedial measures to inactivate viruses
   present in groundwater. For simulating the virus transport process in a
   groundwater aquifer, the parameters responsible for movement of viruses
   in an aquifer have to be estimated. In the case of saturated porous
   media, the transport parameters are linear distribution coefficient,
   hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient, and inactivation coefficient for
   aqueous and sorbed viruses. These parameters can be estimated using an
   inverse optimization procedure that minimizes an error function
   represented by the difference between the experimentally observed and
   simulated virus concentration. Gradient-based classical optimization
   methods can be applied to minimize the error function for estimating the
   parameters of the transport process. It is reported that the error
   function is nonlinear and nonconvex in nature when all four parameters
   are considered in the model. As such, classical optimization methods are
   not effective when all four parameters are considered. Global
   optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, may be efficient to
   solve the inverse problem. However, in many cases, these algorithms
   yield a near global optimal solution. As such, a hybrid optimization
   model using genetic algorithms and the simplex method is proposed for
   estimating the parameters. Example problems have been solved to evaluate
   the efficiency of the proposed method. The evaluation shows that the
   proposed procedure is efficient and can be applied in the field for
   estimating parameters of the virus transport process in a groundwater
   aquifer. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study is to introduce a new fiber
   metal laminate (FML), formed by sandwiching a 3D fiberglass fabric in
   between thin sheets of magnesium alloy. In particular, the low-velocity
   impact (LVI) response and failure modes of this new FML composite are
   investigated experimentally and computationally. In addition, to gain a
   more comprehensive understanding of the response of the FML, its
   performance is compared against those of conventional FMLs, made with
   various layers of biaxial woven fabrics in place of the 3D fabric. The
   failure modes of the specimens are characterized based on the
   quantitative measurements of shape, type, and extent of damage on the
   FMLs' constituents. The impact characteristics of all panels are further
   examined by characterizing and comparing their energy absorption
   capacity, residual deformation and maximum deformation due to LVI. The
   characteristics of the new 3D glass fabric are specifically discussed,
   and its positive attributes and limitations, in comparison to woven
   fabrics, are highlighted. The results would reveal that FML made by the
   3D fabric exhibits outstanding impact absorption capacity; however,
   their impact energy resistance is lower than FMLs formed by woven
   fabrics. Moreover, as a major part of this study, a finite element
   analysis (FEA) framework is constructed, using the commercial finite
   element code ABAQUS, in order to simulate the response of such complex
   structures. Good agreement between the experimental and computational
   results demonstrate that the simulation framework can be further used to
   optimize the configuration of FMLs for different loading situations. (C)

Abstract = {{A longitudinally polarized optical chain is generated in a proposed 4 pi
   focusing system. The radially polarized Bessel-Gaussian incident beam is
   modulated by a complex amplitude filter. Their focusing performance is
   investigated using the Debye integral. Longitudinally polarized focusing
   spots with uniform intensity, high axial resolution and small spot
   volume are achieved in the proposed scheme. The number of the focusing
   spots in the optical chain is controllable by adjusting the complex
   amplitude filter. As an example, a longitudinally polarized optical
   chain with seven uniform intensity focusing spots is obtained. The
   volume of each focusing spot is reduced by about seven times and the
   axial resolution is only one-fourth of that in a single lens system with
   the same parameters. The influence of optical axes mismatching and foci
   shifting on the focusing performance is also investigated. The focusing
   system with the complex amplitude filter permits a large foci shifting
   because of the elongated depth of focus. It is expected that the
   research results can be used in the field of confocal microscopy,
   optical trapping and manipulating. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Role of sigB and osmolytes in desiccation survival of Listeria
   monocytogenes in simulated food soils on the surface of food grade
   stainless steel}},
Journal = {{FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{443-451}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This research aimed to determine whether the SigB (sigma(B)) regulon and
   osmolytes impact the survival of the foodborne pathogen, Listeria
   monocytogenes, during desiccation in simulated food soils with varying
   salt and nutrient contents on food grade stainless steel (SS) surfaces.
   L. monocytogenes 568 (Lm568, serotype 1/2a), its isogenic sigB mutant
   (Delta sigB) and the back-complemented Delta sigB were desiccated in
   BHI, TSB with 1\% glucose (TSB-glu), peptone physiological saline (PPS)
   and minimal media (MM) for 21 days at 43\% relative humidity (RH) and 15
   degrees C on SS. The effect of food related osmolytes (proline, betaine
   and carnitine) on desiccation survival was studied by (a) pre-culturing
   strains in MM with an osmolyte followed by desiccation in MM and (b) by
   desiccating strains in MM with an osmolyte.
   Desiccation survival of L. monocytogenes was positively correlated to
   the nutrient and osmolyte concentrations in the desiccation substrates.
   Initial Lm568 levels of 8 Log(CFU/cm(2)) decreased by 0.9 Log(CFU/cm(2))
   in BHI and 1.1-2.9 Log(CFU/cm(2)) in TSB-glu, PPS and MM after 21 days.
   Comparatively, the initial survival of Delta sigB was reduced in PS and
   MM, while no differences were observed among the three strains in BHI
   and TSB-glu. Pre-culture in osmolyte containing MM enhanced (p < 0.05)
   desiccation survival of all strains. Desiccation in osmolyte-containing
   MM improved desiccation survival of all strains, albeit the protection
   was less than that observed after pre-culture with the osmolytes.
   Complementation of the Delta sigB mutant restored the wildtype
   phenotype.
   In conclusion, this work shows the protective effect of osmolytes in
   desiccation survival of L. monocytogenes, while the sigma(B) regulon
   only improved the initial survival in nutrient and osmolyte poor
   environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of Protecting Ligands on Surface Structure and Antibacterial
   Activity of Silver Nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3745-3752}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Silver nanopartides (Ag NPs) have attracted much attention in the past
   decade because of their unique physicochemical properties and notable
   antibacterial activities. In particular, thiol-protected Ag NPS have
   come to the forefront of metal nanoparticle studies, as they have been
   shown to possess high stability and interesting structure property
   relationships. However, a clear correlation between thiol-protecting
   ligands, the resulting Ag NP surface structure, and their antibacterial
   properties has yet to be determined. Here, a multielement (Ag and 5),
   multi-edge (Ag K-edge, Ag L-3-edge, S K-edge) X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy (XAS) methodology was ried to identify the structure and
   composition of Ag NPs protected with cysteine. XAS characterization was
   carried out on similar-sized Ag NPs protected with
   poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), in order to provide a valid comparison of
   the ligand effect on surface structure. The PVP-Ag NPs showed a metallic
   Ag surface and composition, consistent with metal NPs protected by weak
   protecting ligands. On the other hand, the Cys-Ag NPs exhibited a
   distinct surface shell of silver sulfide, which is remarkably different
   than previously studied Cys-Ag NPs. The minimum inhibitory concentration
   (MIC) of both types of Ag NPs against Gram-positive (+) and
   Gram-negative (-) bacteria were tested, including Staphylococcus aureus
   (+), Escherichia coli (-), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (-). It was found
   that the MICs of the Cys-Ag NPs were significantly lower than the PVP-Ag
   NPs for each bacteria, implicating the influence of the sulfidized
   surface structure. Overall, this work shows the effect of ligand on the
   surface structure of Ag NPs, as well as the importance of surface
   structure in controlling antibacterial activity.}},

Abstract = {{Bench-scale experiments investigated the role of iron and aluminum
   residuals in lead release in a low alkalinity and high (> 0.5)

   examined for two lead-bearing plumbing materials, including harvested
   lead pipe and new lead: tin solder, after exposure to water with
   simulated aluminum sulfate, polyaluminum chloride and ferric sulfate
   coagulation treatments with 1-25-mu M levels of iron or aluminum
   residuals in the water. The release of lead from systems with harvested
   lead pipe was highly correlated with levels of residual aluminum or iron
   present in samples (R-2 = 0.66-0.88), consistent with sorption of lead
   onto the aluminum and iron hydroxides during stagnation. The results
   indicate that aluminum and iron coagulant residuals, at levels complying
   with recommended guidelines, can sometimes play a significant role in
   lead mobilization from premise plumbing.}},

Abstract = {{Successful bidding and operational strategies of electric power
   generators (GENCO) depend highly on the availability of accurate and

   and applied over the past few years to predict the marginal price of

   techniques apply time-consuming, complex, and hybrid methods requiring
   multiple inputs and large databases. This article introduces the first
   application of the method of ``innovations{''} and a single artificial
   neural network to provide accurate forecasting results with mean
   absolute percentage error comparable to more complex and hybrid
   artificial neural network forecasting methods. The proposed model is
   applied to data of two seasons of Spain's power market operator (OMEL)
   marginal price data. The technique provided average accuracy improvement
   of 26\% with overall mean absolute percentage error of 6.5\%, which is
   reasonable considering the number of inputs and the simplicity of this
   model compared to other proposed models.}},
