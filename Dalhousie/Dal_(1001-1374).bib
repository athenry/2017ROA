Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Fish oil supplements have grown in popularity in recent years
   owing to their multiple health benefits, leading to rapid growth in the
   number of fish oil supplements available for consumers. When choosing a
   product, it is important that label claims for eicosapentaenoic acid
   (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are met, especially when a specific
   dosage is required. In this study the amounts of EPA and DHA in 16 of
   the top-selling liquid fish oil products from the American marketplace
   were analysed and compared with their label claims. Peroxide value, a
   measure of oxidation, was also determined, along with lipid class.
   RESULTS This study found that over half of the supplements did not meet
   their label claims for EPA and DHA, and a quarter exceeded recommended
   limits for peroxide value. CONCLUSION These results suggest that more
   stringent regulation is required for fish oil products. (c) 2012 Society

Abstract = {{A novel method of producing die-compacted powder metallurgy (PM)
   components with a fully enclosed, stearic acid-filled internal structure
   (IS) was developed. The physical characteristics and strength of the
   compacts were evaluated by measuring bulk density, internal density
   gradients, and compressive green strength. Additionally, a finite
   element (FE) simulation was developed to evaluate the compaction process
   of the IS. The IS compacts displayed the anticipated reduction in bulk
   density compared with a conventional PM compact due to the lower density
   of the IS. Higher local densities were found within the IS compacts at
   all compaction pressures. Compressive green strength increased with
   compaction pressures up to 300 MPa but at a compaction pressure of 400
   MPa there was a plateau in green strength. This phenomenon is attributed
   to an increase in the differential shear stress around the IS with
   minimal increase in density for compaction pressures from 300 MPa to 400
   MPa.}},

Abstract = {{This study shows the potential of chitosan (CH) nanoparticles as both an
   oral and IV drug delivery system using the anticancer drug cladribine as
   a model drug. Smooth, spherical nanoparticles were prepared by the
   ionotropic gelation of CH with sodium tripolyphosphate. Nanoparticle
   size depended on degree of hydration, drug loading, and crosslinking
   conditions, with the smallest nanoparticles in the size range of 212 +/-
   51 nm. Cladribine was entrapped in the CH matrix with an entrapment
   efficiency of up to 62\%, depending on the initial loading. The release
   of cladribine followed a near-Fickian diffusion rate over the first
   several hours and then reached a plateau. A second release phase began
   after 3040 h of incubation in the release medium, and proceeded until
   approximate to 100 h. Loaded CH nanoparticles that were crosslinked with
   genipin showed a delayed release profile, with only 40\% of loaded drug

Abstract = {{Early detection of bolt loosening is a major concern in the oil and gas
   industry. In this study, a vibration-based health monitoring strategy
   has been developed for detecting the loosening of bolts in a pipeline's
   bolted flange joint. Both numerical and experimental studies are
   conducted to verify the integrity of our implementation as well as of an
   enhancement developed along with it. Several damage scenarios are
   simulated by the loosening of the bolts through varying the applied
   torque on each bolt. An electric impact hammer is used to vibrate
   (excite) the system in a consistent manner. The induced vibration
   signals are collected via piezoceramic sensors bonded onto the pipe and
   flange. These signals are transferred remotely by a wireless data
   acquisition module and then processed with a code developed in-house in
   the MATLAB environment. After normalization and filtering of the
   signals, the empirical mode decomposition is applied to establish an
   effective energy-based damage index. The assessment of the damage
   indices thus obtained for the various scenarios verifies the integrity
   of the proposed methodology for identifying the damage and its
   progression in bolted joints as well as the major enhancements applied
   onto the methodology.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important objectives of supply chain S\&OP (Sales and
   Operations Planning) is the profitable alignment of customer demand with
   supply chain capabilities through the coordinated planning of sales,
   production, distribution, and procurement. In the make-to-order
   manufacturing context considered in this paper, sales plans cover both
   contract and spot sales, and procurement plans require the selection of
   supplier contracts. S\&OP decisions also involve the allocation of
   capacity to support sales plans. This article studies the coordinated
   contract selection and capacity allocation problem, in a three-tier
   manufacturing supply chain, with the objective to maximize the
   manufacturer's profitability. Using a modeling approach based on
   stochastic programming with recourse, we show how these S\&OP decisions
   can be made taking into account economic, market, supply, and system
   uncertainties. The research is based on a real business case in the
   Oriented Strand Board (OSB) industry. The computational results show
   that the proposed approach provides realistic and robust solutions. For
   the case considered, the planning method elaborated yields significant
   performance improvements over the solutions obtained from the mixed
   integer programming model previously suggested for S\&OP.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental decision-making in offshore oil and gas (OOG) operations
   can be extremely complex due to conflicting objectives or criteria,
   availability of vague and uncertain information, and interdependency
   among multiple decision-makers. Most existing studies ignore conflicting
   preferences and strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper
   presents a game theoretical approach to solve multi-criteria conflict
   resolution problem under constrained and uncertain environments.
   Uncertainties in the quantification of imprecise data are expressed
   using rough numbers. A multi-criteria game is developed to model a
   decision problem in which three groups of decision-makers (i.e.,
   operators, regulators and service engineers) are involved. This game is
   solved using the generalized maximin solution concept. With the solution
   (i.e., optimal weights of the criteria), the rough numbers can be
   aggregated to an expected payoff for each alternative. Finally, the
   weights of upper and lower limits of a rough number are employed to
   transform the expected payoff into a crisp score, based on which all
   alternatives are ranked to identify the best one. A numerical example is
   outlined to demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the
   selection of management scenarios of drilling wastes. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Respiratory impedance measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT)
   can be contaminated by artifacts such as coughing, vocalization,

   was performed with artifacts introduced during separate 60 s recordings
   at known times in 10 healthy subjects. Brief glottal closures were
   generated phonetically and confirmed by nasopharyngoscopic imaging of
   the glottis. Artifacts were detected using Daubechies wavelets by
   applying a threshold to squared detail coefficients from the wavelet
   transforms of both pressure and flow signals. Sensitivity and
   specificity were compared over a range of thresholds for different level
   squared detail coefficients. Coughs could be identified using 1st level
   detail (cd1) coefficients of pressure achieving 96\% sensitivity and
   100\% specificity while swallowing could be identified using cd2
   thresholds of pressure with 95\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity. Male
   vocalizations could be identified using cd1 coefficients with 88\%
   sensitivity and 100\% specificity. For leaks at the mouthpiece, cd3
   thresholds of flow could identify these events with 98\% sensitivity and
   99\% specificity. Thus, this method provided an accurate, easy, and
   automated technique for detecting and removing artifacts from
   measurements of respiratory impedance using FOT.}},

Abstract = {{Alloying elements including aluminium, chromium, cobalt, indium,
   molybdenum, titanium and vanadium were added to a synthetic 90/10 Cu-Ni
   alloy and its behaviours in natural sea water and in artificial saline
   solutions (containing 2.86 wt-\%NaCl and 0 or 2260 ppm sulphate) were
   investigated. Alloying elements included the addition of 2 wt-\% of one
   of the elements such as aluminium, chromium, cobalt, indium, molybdenum,
   titanium and vanadium. The passive film formed on most of the synthetic
   alloys is uniform in thickness (similar to 100 mu m when the sample was
   exposed to the solution for 20 h) and consists of more than one layer
   when the alloy was exposed to artificial saline solutions or N.S. sea
   water for a relatively long time. The corrosion film formed on 90/10
   Cu-Ni synthetic alloy surfaces after 20 h exposure in three different
   electrolytes (0 ppm sulphate artificial saline solution, 2260 ppm
   sulphate artificial saline solution and N.S. sea water) was
   characterised by visual observation, field emission scanning electron
   microscope, electron probe microanalysis, energy dispersive
   spectroscopy, wavelength dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
   The stability and protection provided by the corrosion film depend on
   the alloying element added to the alloy. Cobalt was detected to be the
   most effective alloying element and aluminium may be used as an alloying
   element only in the absence of sulphate. Chromium could be used to some
   extent while the use of molybdenum, indium, vanadium or titanium as
   alloying elements did not improve the corrosion properties of 90/10
   Cu-Ni alloy.}},

Abstract = {{A single-point diamond dressing tool was used to cut shallow

   grinding efficiency by reducing the consumed power by up to 61\%.
   Although the use of grooved grinding wheels caused the workpiece surface
   roughness to increase slightly when compared to a non-grooved wheel, the
   grooved wheel enabled up to 37\% more material to be removed while still

Abstract = {{A critical feature of tendons and ligaments is their ability to resist
   rupture when overloaded, resulting in strains or sprains instead of
   ruptures. To treat these injuries more effectively, it is necessary to
   understand how overload affects the primary load-bearing elements of
   these tissues: collagen fibrils. We have investigated how repeated
   subrupture overload alters the collagen of tendons at the nanoscale.
   Using scanning electron microscopy to examine fibril morphology and
   hydrothermal isometric tension testing to look at molecular stability,
   we demonstrated that tendon collagen undergoes a progressive cascade of
   discrete plasticity damage when repeatedly overloaded. With successive
   overload cycles, fibrils develop an increasing number of kinks along
   their length. These kinksdiscrete zones of plastic deformation known to
   contain denatured collagen moleculesare accompanied by a progressive and
   eventual total loss of D-banding along the surface of fibrils,
   indicating a loss of native molecular packing and further molecular
   denaturation. Thermal analysis of molecular stability showed that the
   destabilization of collagen molecules within fibrils is strongly related
   to the amount of strain energy dissipated by the tendon after yielding
   during tensile overload. These novel findings raise new questions about
   load transmission within tendons and their fibrils and about the
   interplay between crosslinking, strain-energy dissipation ability, and
   molecular denaturation within these structures. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic

Abstract = {{Two comprehensive micromechanical models for the analysis of
   piezo-magneto-thermo-elastic smart composite structures with orthotropic
   constituents are developed and applied to examples of practical
   importance. Details on the derivations of the aforementioned models are
   given in Part I of this work. The present paper solves the derived unit
   cell problems and obtains expressions for such effective coefficients as
   piezomagnetic, piezoelectric, elastic and many others. Of particular
   importance are the effective product properties, such as
   magnetoelectric, pyroelectric and pyromagnetic coefficients which, in
   general, manifest themselves in the macroscopic composite as a
   consequence of the interactions of the different constituents but are
   not exhibited by the constituents themselves as individual entities. The
   effective coefficients are universal in nature and once determined, can
   be used to examine a number of boundary value problems associated with a
   given composite geometry. The present work illustrates the use of the
   developed models and compares the results obtained with corresponding
   results stemming from other analytical and/or numerical models.
   Furthermore, results from the two micromechanical models presented here
   are also compared with each other. The mathematical model developed in
   this work can be used in analysis and design to tailor the effective
   elastic, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, magnetoelectric etc. coefficients
   of smart composite structures to meet the design criteria of different
   engineering applications by a judicious selection of different geometric

Abstract = {{The melting transition of dodecanoic acid (CH3(CH2)(10)COOH, also known
   as lauric acid) has been examined with a view to use for latent heat
   energy storage in solar thermal applications. The influence of purity
   (reagent grade {[}98\% pure] compared with practical grade {[}<80\%
   pure]) on the melting transition was found to be insignificant. The
   long-term stability of the melting transition of practical-grade
   dodecanoic acid was investigated by thermal cycling of samples from
   completely solid through complete melting and back to the solid phase,
   nearly 500 times. It was found that the transition enthalpy and the
   melting onset temperature remain within experimental uncertainty of
   their values, 184 J g(-1) and 43.3 degrees C, respectively. Neither data
   set showed significant trends with number of thermal cycles. The
   freezing temperature of 41 degrees C for practical-grade dodecanoic acid
   also was stable with respect to thermal cycling, showing almost
   negligible hysteresis, without addition of nucleating agents. The
   specific heat in the region of the phase transition was determined,
   along with the thermal conductivity in the solid state (0.150 +/- 0.004
   W m(-1) K-1 at 30 degrees C) and the volume change associated with
   melting (6\%). Although the thermal conductivity of dodecanoic acid is
   low in both the solid phase and liquid phase, and thermal energy storage
   devices would need to be designed accordingly, dodecanoic acid is
   inexpensive, readily available (used as a foodstuff), has a low volume
   change on melting, and is stable over hundreds of thermal cycles even in
   practical grade, making it a promising phase-change material for thermal
   energy storage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue life assessment of pipelines and risers is a complex process,
   involving various uncertainties. The selection of an appropriate fatigue
   model is important for establishing the inspection intervals and
   maintenance criteria. In offshore structures, the vortex-induced
   vibration (VIV) could cause severe fatigue damage in risers and
   pipelines, resulting in leakage or even catastrophic failure. The
   industry has customarily used simple fatigue models for fatigue life
   assessment of pipelines and risers (such as the Paris or Walker models);
   however, these models were developed based on constant amplitude loading
   scenarios. In contrast, VIV-induced stress-time history has a variable
   amplitude nature. The use of the simplified approach (which is
   inherently non conservative), has necessitated the implementation of
   large safety factors for fatigue design of pipelines and risers.
   Moreover, most of the experimental investigations conducted to date with
   the aim of characterizing the fatigue response of pipelines and risers
   have been done based on incorporation of constant amplitude loading
   (CAL) scenarios (which is unrealistic), or converting the variable
   amplitude loading (VAL) scenarios to an equivalent CAL. This study
   demonstrates that the use of such approaches would not be lead to
   accurate assessment of the fatigue response of risers subject to
   VIV-induced VAL. The experimental investigation performed in this study
   will also clarify the underlying reasons for the use of large safety
   factors by the industry when assessing the fatigue life of pipelines and
   risers. In addition, an experimental investigation was also conducted to
   highlight the influence of the compressive portion of VIV stress-time
   history on the fatigue life of such components. It is shown that the
   compressive stress cycles significantly influence the fatigue crack
   growth response of risers, and their presence should not be ignored.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion-corrosion is common in oil and gas processing plants and
   pipelines where there is interaction between solid particles, corrosive
   fluid and target material. In this study, the synergism between erosion
   and corrosion of API pipeline steel has been assessed under liquid-solid
   impingement conditions in 2 g/l NaCl solution purged with CO2 as the
   corrosive media and aluminum oxide as the erodent. The total material
   loss rate and the components of erosion, corrosion and their synergistic
   interactions have been determined. A test setup was designed to mitigate
   the limitations of the in situ method (to avoid the fluctuation in
   electrochemical data due to bubble formation and turbulence). The flow
   velocity was varied from 36 to 81 m s(-1), while angle of incidence was
   kept constant at 90 degrees. The experimental results show that there is
   an immense correlation exists between erosion and corrosion. It was
   observed that erosion enhances corrosion and corrosion enhances erosion
   with each contributing to significant synergism. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{TiNi shape memory alloys are well known for their shape memory and
   superelastic effects, which are the result of reversible martensitic
   transformation. Materials exhibiting superelastic effect are
   characterized by high recoverable strain during deformation due to

   that TiNi alloy has superior wear resistance compared to other
   conventional materials. Understanding the superelastic behavior of this
   material helps to increase its utilization in applications where high
   wear and denting are common as in gears and bearings. Unfortunately,
   limited work has been done to investigate the superelastic effect of
   TiNi under wear and indentation conditions. In this study the
   superelastic behavior of TiNi under sliding wear and indentation loading
   is investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development and Evaluation of Object-Based Visual Attention for

Abstract = {{Bottom-up visual attention is an automatic behavior to guide visual
   perception to a conspicuous object in a scene. This paper develops a new
   object-based bottom-up attention (OBA) model for robots. This model
   includes four modules: Extraction of preattentive features, preattentive
   segmentation, estimation of space-based saliency, and estimation of
   proto-object-based saliency. In terms of computation, preattentive
   segmentation serves as a bridge to connect the space-based saliency and
   object-based saliency. This paper therefore proposes a preattentive
   segmentation algorithm, which is able to self-determine the number of
   proto-objects, has low computational cost, and is robust in a variety of
   conditions such as noise and spatial transformations. Experimental
   results have shown that the propsoed OBA model outperforms space-based
   attention model and other object-based attention methods in terms of
   accuracy of attentional selection, consistency under a series of noise
   settings and object completion.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper proposes a computational model of
   object-based bottom-up visual attention for robots. This model can be
   used for several robotic applications, such as detecting unusual
   objects, tracking unusual objects, object recognition, selection of
   landmarks, exploration of unknown environment, localization and mapping
   in the unknown environment, and human-computer interface. Compared with
   space-based bottom-up visual attention model, this proposed object-based
   model can achieve the complete object region and is robust to noise and
   spatial transformations. The complete object region can provide more
   information such as shape and size. The robustness can further guarantee
   the computational performance under a variety of conditions. Thus, this
   model has great advantages in a variety of engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{AERMOD was used to model the air dispersion of point and major line
   emissions of PM2.5 in Halifax and Pictou, NOX in Halifax and SO2 in
   Halifax, Sydney and Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, Canada. Emission
   inventory data for 2004 were used in simulations within four, 50 km x 50
   km, domains over annual, monthly and 1-hour averaging periods. Annual
   averaged surface concentration maps are reported. Modeled versus
   observed comparisons were made within each domain at the Government,
   National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) monitoring sites (discrete
   receptors). Evaluation of the model was conducted on the annual, monthly
   and hourly results using a number of statistical methods that included
   R-2, fractional bias, normalized mean square error and the fraction of
   predictions within a factor of two of the observations. The AERMOD model
   evaluation showed that there was good agreement between the modeled and
   observed SO2 concentration for the annual and monthly comparison but
   less skill at estimating the hourly comparisons for SO2 in Halifax and
   Sydney. AERMOD showed poor model skill at predicting SO2 in Port
   Hawkesbury over the same averaging periods. The model evaluation for
   PM2.5 in Halifax, PM2.5 in Pictou and NOX in Halifax showed poor
   agreements and model skill. The surface concentrations from the point
   and major lines sources in all domains from all metrics were found to be
   well below the National Air Quality Standards. AERMOD has shown its
   utility as a suitable model for conducting dispersion modeling from
   point and line sources in Nova Scotia with good model skill for
   estimating annual and monthly SO2 concentrations in Halifax and Sydney.
   The study highlights the validity of using emission inventory data to
   estimate the surface impact of major point and line sources within
   domains containing complex terrain, differing land use types and with
   large variability within the annual meteorology.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the potential for beneficial
   reuse of fly ash as a sorbent for benzene, trichloroethylene, and
   ethylbenzene in soils treated with cement (i.e., cement-based
   solidification/stabilization (S/S)). Batch testing was performed with
   soil-cement mixtures containing fly ash and compared with similar
   samples with humic acid as a source of organic carbon. The experimental
   batch test results were fit to the Freundlich sorption model assuming
   both linear and nonlinear behavior. It was found that the level of
   sorption is low for benzene and trichloroethylene, but relatively higher
   for ethylbenzene. Cement addition appeared to not only decrease sorption
   values obtained for fly ash, but also eliminate the nonlinear sorptive
   behavior, likely due to the blocking-coating of sorption sites. To
   demonstrate the practical application of the sorption observed, a
   hypothetical contaminated site is modeled with a one-dimensional
   contaminant transport program. It iss shown that the addition of fly ash
   can potentially reduce off-site migration of trichloroethylene (TCE),
   but is more effective at reducing ethylbenzene migration, for the time
   frames considered in the modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Demodulation in a random multiple access channel is considered where the
   signals are chosen uniformly randomly with unit energy. It is shown that
   by lifting (replicating) the graph of this system and randomizing the
   graph connections, a simple iterative cancellation demodulator achieves
   the same performance as an optimal symbol-by-symbol detector of the
   original system. The iterative detector has a complexity that is linear
   in the number of users, while the direct optimal approach is known to be
   NP-hard. However, the maximal system load of this lifted graph is
   limited to alpha < 2.07, even for large signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNRs)-the system is interference limited. Spatial coupling between

Abstract = {{To determine test-retest reliability of a surface electromyographic
   protocol designed to measure knee joint muscle activation during walking
   in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty-one individuals
   with moderate medial compartment knee OA completed two gait data
   collections separated by approximately 1 month. Using a standardized
   protocol, surface electromyograms from rectus femoris plus lateral and
   medial sites for the gastrocnemii, vastii and hamstring muscles were
   recorded during walking. After full-wave rectification and low pass
   filtering, time and amplitude normalized (percent of maximum) waveforms
   were calculated. Principal component analysis (PP-scores) and
   co-contraction indices (CCI) were calculated from the waveforms.
   Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,k) were calculated for
   PP-scores and CCI's. No differences in walking speed, knee muscle
   strength and symptoms were found between visits (p > 0.05). The majority
   of PP-scores (17 of 21) and two of four CCIs demonstrated ICC2,k values
   greater than 0.81. Remaining PP-scores and CCIs had ICC2,k values
   between 0.61 and 0.80. The results support that reliable EMG
   characteristics can be captured from a moderate knee OA patient
   population using a standardized protocol. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Evidence indicates that previous low back injury (LBI) is a strong
   predictor for re-injury. The purpose of this study was to examine
   whether neuromuscular patterns remain altered in a LBI group who were
   deemed recovered. Surface electromyograms from 12-abdominal and 12-back
   extensors sites and motion variables were recorded from 33 LBI
   individuals (sub-acute phase) and 54 asymptomatic controls. Pain-related
   variables were recorded and a clinical assessment performed for LBI
   participants. Subjects performed a symmetrical lift and replace task in
   two reaches. Pattern recognition techniques were applied to normalized
   activation amplitude patterns to extract key recruitment strategies.
   Mixed model ANOVAs tested for effects (p < 0.05). Despite similar task
   performance, significantly (p < 0.05) different recruitment strategies
   were observed for the LBI group. There were higher activation amplitudes
   for LBI subjects in all muscles (except posterior external oblique) and
   greater co-activation between abdominal and back extensor sites compared
   to controls. Local abdominal and back extensor sites showed altered
   responses to increased physical demands in the LBI group. Despite
   outcomes indicating recovery, the LBI group had altered neuromuscular
   patterns compared to asymptomatic controls supporting that residual
   alterations remain following recovery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Many otologic disorders have been attributed to
   dysfunction of the tensor tympani muscle, including tinnitus, otalgia,
   Meniere's disease and sensorineural hearing loss. The objective of this
   study was to determine adequate stimuli for tensor tympani contraction
   in humans and determine markers of the hypercontracted state that could
   be used to detect this process in otologic disease. Study Design:
   Multiple types of studies. Methods: Studies included 1) measuring middle
   ear impedance changes in response to orbital puffs of air, facial
   stroking, and self-vocalization; 2) measuring changes in stapes and
   eardrum vibrations and middle ear acoustic impedance in response to
   force loading of the tensor tympani in fresh human cadaveric temporal
   bones; 3) measuring changes in acoustic impedance in two subjects who
   could voluntarily contract their tensor tympani, and performing an
   audiogram with the muscle contracted in one of these subjects; and 4)
   developing a lumped parameter computer model of the middle ear while
   simulating various levels of tensor tympani contraction. Results:
   Orbital jets of air are the most effective stimuli for eliciting tensor
   tympani contraction. As markers for tensor tympani contraction, all
   investigations indicate that tensor tympani hypercontraction should
   result in a low-frequency hearing loss, predominantly conductive, with a
   decrease in middle ear compliance. Conclusions: These markers should be
   searched for in otologic pathology states where the tensor tympani is
   suspected of being hypercontracted.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of vibration localization plays an important role in the
   dynamics of inhomogeneous and nonlinear materials and structures. The
   vibration localization can occur in the case of inhomogeneity under the
   following conditions: (i) the frequency spectrum of the periodic
   structure includes stopbands, (ii) a perturbation of periodicity is
   present, and (iii) the eigenfrequency of the perturbed element falls
   into a stopband. Under these conditions, the energy can be spatially
   localized in the vicinity of the defect with an exponential decay in the
   infinity. The influence of nonlinearity can shift frequency into the
   stopband zone. In the present paper, the localization of vibrations in
   one-dimensional linear and nonlinear lattices is investigated. The
   localization frequencies are determined and the attenuation factors are
   calculated. Discrete and continuum models are developed and compared.
   The limits of the applicability of the continuum models are established.
   Analysis of the linear problem has allowed a better understanding of
   specifics of the nonlinear problem and has led to developing a new
   approach for the analysis of nonlinear lattices alternative to the
   method of continualization.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation in white matter
   is controversial. Given that many of the studies that report fMRI
   activation in white matter used high field MRI systems, we investigated
   the field strength dependence of sensitivity to white matter fMRI
   activation. In addition, we evaluated the temporal signal to noise ratio
   (tSNR) of the different tissue types as a function of field strength.
   Data were acquired during a motor task (finger tapping) at 1.5 T and 4
   T. Group and individual level activation results were considered in both
   the sensorimotor cortex and the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
   We found that sensitivity increases associated with field strength were
   greater for white matter than gray matter. The analysis of tSNR
   suggested that white matter might be less susceptible to increases in
   physiological noise related to increased field strength. We therefore
   conclude that high field MRI may be particularly advantageous for fMRI
   studies aimed at investigating activation in both gray and white matter.}},

Title = {{Are Soil Mineralizable Nitrogen Pools Replenished during the Growing

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in both environmental conditions and substrate quality
   and quantity determine the soil N supply to plants. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate seasonal changes in the quantity and quality
   of soil mineral N (SMN) and mineralizable N pools under a growing potato
   (Solanum tuberosum L.) crop that was preceded by three crop species
   (barley {[}Hordeum vulgare L.], Italian ryegrass {[}Lolium multiflorum
   Lam.], and red clover {[}Trifolium pratense L.]) that might be expected
   to affect soil N supply. Seasonal changes were small and expressed
   mainly through changes in SMN and Pool I, a labile mineralizable N pool,
   which decreased significantly from May to August and then subsequently
   increased in October. In comparison, potentially mineralizable N (N-0)
   did not change during the growing season. The depth distribution of
   mineralizable N pools was also studied, and these were similar in size
   for the 0- to 15- and 15- to 30-cm layers but decreased for 30 to 45 cm.
   The estimated depletion of SMN and Pool I for the 0- to 30-cm layer from
   May to August was less than the supply of N to the potato crop,
   estimated as plant N uptake (N accumulation in tubers plus vines in late

Abstract = {{Dust and hybrid-mixture explosions continue to occur in industrial
   processes that handle fine powders and flammable gases. Considerable
   research is therefore conducted throughout the world with the objective
   of both preventing the occurrence and mitigating the consequences of
   such events. In the current work, research has been undertaken to help
   move the field of dust explosion prevention and mitigation from its
   current emphasis on hazards (with an accompanying reliance on primarily
   engineered safety features) to a focus on risk (with an accompanying
   reliance on hierarchical, risk-based, decision-making tools). Employing
   the principles of quantitative risk assessment (QRA) of dust and
   hybrid-mixture explosions, a methodological framework for the management
   of these risks has been developed.
   The QRA framework is based on hazard identification via credible
   accident scenarios for dust explosions, followed by probabilistic
   fault-tree analysis (using Relex - Reliability Excellence - software)
   and consequence severity analysis (using DESC - Dust Explosion
   Simulation Code - software). Identification of risk reduction measures
   in the framework is accomplished in a hierarchical manner by considering
   inherent safety measures, passive and active engineered devices, and
   procedural measures (in that order). An industrial case study is
   presented to show how inherent safety measures such as dust minimization
   and dust/process moderation can be helpful in reducing dust and
   hybrid-mixture explosion consequences in a 400-m(3) polyethylene storage

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Accurate domestic-hot water (DHW) consumption information is useful for
   solar-thermal-hot-water-system designers and policy makers supporting
   solar-thermal-incentive programs. Conducting field studies of
   DHW-consumption patterns is difficult and costly, and as a result, there
   are few studies available in the body of literature. Several DHW models
   exist, however these aggregate models are often dated and most fail to
   identify the influence of the number of occupants in the dwelling,
   instead relying on a standard-per-capita consumption. The standard of 60
   liters/capita/day (lcd) is found to be accurate for households of 4 or
   more occupants, but significantly under estimates per-capita-hot-water
   consumption for households with 3 or fewer occupants, consequently,
   under estimating the energy and GHG-emissions savings of solar-DHW
   programs {[}1]. The new estimate presented here addresses these issues.
   This study was conducted using utility-billing data, and occupant
   responses from a survey of 1594 residences. The data includes annual
   total-water use, energy consumption, costs, and basic information about
   the residence and occupants. The method isolates average-oil used in
   water heaters and then estimates system performance to calculate the
   volume of hot water heated. The findings include total-water use, oil
   consumption for water heating, and DHW use based on occupancy for
   households of 1 through 6 occupants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In Nova Scotia, Canada, contour trench disposal fields are the most
   common type of onsite wastewater system. In this study, two identical
   contour trench disposal fields were monitored for 3 yr to compare
   performance under gravity-fed versus periodically dosed loading
   conditions. Influent and effluent from both systems were analyzed for a
   suite of water quality parameters, and the hydraulics of the systems
   were assessed using tracer studies and measurements of ponded water
   depth in the distribution trenches. Ponded water depths in the
   distribution trench of the gravity-fed disposal field were observed to
   increase steadily during the monitoring period, indicating progressive
   clogging. This was not observed in the periodically dosed field.
   Regarding treatment, both systems performed well, consistently producing
   effluent with 5-d biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids
   (TSS) concentrations <10 mg L-1 and achieving >5 log reductions in
   Escherichia coli. However, the gravity-fed system produced statistically
   lower average effluent concentrations for total P and TSS. It is
   speculated that the slightly better treatment performance achieved by
   the gravity-fed system is due to enhanced biomat formation. This study
   demonstrated adequate treatment of residential wastewater by contour
   trench disposal fields regardless of loading method. However, because
   the hydraulic performance of these systems is heavily dependent on
   pretreatment and loading methods, it is recommended that a dosing system
   be used to distribute wastewater to contour trench disposal fields to
   help prevent hydraulic failure.}},

Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{123-149}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy actuators' strokes can be increased at the expense of
   recovery force via heat treatment to form compressed springs in their
   heat-activated, austenitic state. Although there are models to explain
   their behaviour, few investigations present experimental results for
   support or validation. The aim of the present paper is to determine via
   experimentation how certain parameters affect a helical shape memory
   alloy actuator's outputs: its transformation times and stroke. These
   parameters include wire diameter, spring diameter, transition
   temperature, number of active turns, bias force and direct current
   magnitude. Six investigations were performed: one for each parameter
   manipulation. For repeatability and to observe thermo-mechanical
   training effects, the springs were cyclically activated. The resultant
   patterns were compared with results predicted from one-dimensional
   models to elucidate the findings. Generally, it was observed that the
   transformation times and strokes converged at changing stress levels;
   the convergence is likely the peak where the summation of elastic stroke
   and transformation stroke has reached its maximum. During cyclic
   loading, the actuators' strokes decreased to a converged value,
   particularly at larger internal stresses; training should therefore be
   performed prior to the actuator's implementation for continual use
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the opening fluctuation of glottis is meaningful in
   diagnosing vocal cord dysfunction. Nasopharyngoscopy can offer a direct
   method for visualizing the opening and closing of the glottis. However,
   the large amount of image data presents a significant challenge for
   quantitative analysis of the video recordings. Thus, automatic image
   processing method allowing for batch analysis of glottic images becomes
   clinically important. Here, we present an image processing method using
   Gaussian smoothing filter and threshold segmentation, followed by
   differentiation and Canny image edge detection for tracking changes in
   glottis dimensions (the opening area). A quantitative assessment of true
   glottic size was also developed for calibration in our study. This
   method was used to analyze different video data acquired from clinical
   nasopharyngoscopy of 8 healthy subjects during either normal breathing,
   breathing with cough or with `Hee' sound. The results indicated that the
   computed glottic area change waveform was consistent with the observed
   glottic fluctuation in the video from nasopharyngoscopy. Thus, our
   proposed method may provide an accurate and efficient detection of
   glottic aperture and quick assessment of glottic fluctuations to assist
   clinical diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction and other airway

   forested watersheds}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{205-213}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in both
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In-stream DOC concentration is an
   important indicator of water quality, because high in-stream DOC
   concentrations naturally lead to reductions in dissolved oxygen. Recent
   studies indicate that DOC is responsible in transferring toxic metals
   (e.g., mercury, Hg) from terrestrial sources to aquatic ecosystems.
   However, assessing DOC or Hg dynamics is fairly challenging as a result
   of extreme spatiotemporal variation. Typically, process-based models
   with short-to-medium term temporal resolutions are required to model DOC
   and Hg dynamics. The objective of this research is to develop a
   watershed-based monthly DOC production and export model that integrates
   the treatment of (i) forest-litter decomposition (DOC production), (ii)
   wetland-to-watershed area ratio (DOC storage), and (iii) relevant
   hydrological processes (DOC export) in the simulation of in-stream
   concentrations. Model results are compared against DOC concentrations
   collected at the stream outlets of two separate forested watersheds in
   Kejimkujik National Park, Atlantic Canada. Comparisons for the two
   watersheds show that predicted monthly DOC concentrations are generally
   in good agreement with field-based concentrations, giving R-2-values of
   0.61 and 0.63 for Pine Marten Brook watershed and 0.72 and 0.75 for
   Moose Pit Brook watershed for model calibration and validation,
   respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A TiO2-coated rotating corrugated reactor is experimentally
   characterized and simulated for ultraviolet (UV)-based photo degradation
   of methylene blue (MB). Using degradation kinetics derived from
   flat-plate experiments and finite-element discrete-ordinate models
   simulating spatially and temporally varying radiation patterns from a
   UV-lamp array, the simulated reactor performance is experimentally
   validated and extended to explore the impact of geometry variations.
   Mass-transfer limitations between the corrugated surface and the
   reservoir bulk are identified as a determining factor in the degradation
   rate of MB. Optimization studies suggest minimizing the corrugation
   half-angle to improve reactor performance for a given area, increasing
   the number of corrugations rather than the corrugation depth subject to
   practical limitations arising from undesirable bubble formation at small
   aperture widths. Given the relevance of mass transfer to this system,
   future work is needed to elucidate the experimental impact of reservoir
   volume and geometry while validating the use of flat-plate correlations

Abstract = {{Rising global energy demand is encouraging oil companies to invest in
   deepwater drilling. However, there are numerous engineering and safety
   challenges involved in this activity. The BP Deepwater Horizon accident
   (Macondo well blowout) has raised serious concerns about the safety of
   deepwater drilling. The major reasons for such a catastrophic blowout
   event are the lack of continuous assessment of risk and the lack of
   risk-based decision making to take timely and adequate preventive
   actions. The present work proposes an accident modeling and risk
   assessment framework based on accident precursors (early warnings). This
   framework uses the system hazard identification, prediction and
   prevention methodology to model the unwanted situation. The proposed
   risk assessment framework generates results that can be used to: (1)
   analyze the dynamic performance of safety barriers, (2) analyze the
   probability of occurrence of different severity levels, (3) analyze the
   dynamic risk profile of different severity levels and the aggregated
   risk profile, and (4) help to make safety-critical decisions based on
   aggregated risk profile. The present work provides an assessment of
   offshore deepwater drilling risk assessment and a basis to make timely
   and precise safety critical decisions. The risk assessment methodology
   is demonstrated on the Macondo well blowout accident. This case study
   highlighted the applicability and advantages of using the proposed
   method in drilling operations.}},

Abstract = {{Women living on rural Kenyan dairy farms spend significant amounts of
   time collecting wood for cooking. Biogas digesters, which generate
   biogas for cooking from the anaerobic decomposition of livestock manure,
   are an alternative fuel source. The objective of this study was to
   quantify the quality of life and health benefits of installing biogas
   digesters on rural Kenyan dairy farms with respect to wood utilisation.
   Women from 62 farms (31 biogas farms and 31 referent farms) participated
   in interviews to determine reliance on wood and the impact of biogas
   digesters on this reliance. Self-reported back pain, time spent
   collecting wood and money spent on wood were significantly lower
   (p<0.01) for the biogas group, compared to referent farms. Multivariable
   linear regression showed that wood consumption increased by 2 lbs/day
   for each additional family member living on a farm. For an average
   family of three people, the addition of one cow was associated with
   increased wood consumption by 1.0 lb/day on biogas farms but by 4.4
   lbs/day on referent farms (significant interaction variable likely due
   to additional hot water for cleaning milk collection equipment). Biogas
   digesters represent a potentially important technology that can reduce
   reliance on wood fuel and improve health for Kenyan dairy farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory symptoms are largely caused by obstruction of the airways.
   In asthma, airway narrowing mediated by airway smooth muscle (ASM)
   contraction contributes significantly to obstruction. The spasmogens
   produced following exposure to environmental triggers, such as viruses
   or allergens, are initially responsible for ASM activation. However, the
   extent of narrowing of the airway lumen due to ASM shortening can be
   influenced by many factors and it remains a real challenge to decipher
   the exact role of ASM in causing asthmatic symptoms. Innovative tools,
   such as the forced oscillation technique, continue to develop and have
   been proven useful to assess some features of ASM function in vivo.
   Despite these technologic advances, it is still not clear whether
   excessive narrowing in asthma is driven by ASM abnormalities, by other
   alterations in non-muscle factors or simply because of the
   overexpression of spasmogens. This is because a multitude of forces are
   acting on the airway wall, and because not only are these forces
   constantly changing but they are also intricately interconnected. To
   counteract these limitations, investigators have utilized in vitro and
   ex vivo systems to assess and compare asthmatic and non-asthmatic ASM
   contractility. This review describes: 1- some muscle and non-muscle
   factors that are altered in asthma that may lead to airway narrowing and
   asthma symptoms; 2- some technologies such as the forced oscillation
   technique that have the potential to unveil the role of ASM in airway
   narrowing in vivo; and 3- some data from ex vivo and in vitro methods
   that probe the possibility that airway hyperresponsiveness is due to the
   altered environment surrounding the ASM or, alternatively, to a
   hypercontractile ASM phenotype that can be either innate or acquired.

Abstract = {{Asthma is a chronic obstructive airway disease characterised by airway
   hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airway wall remodelling. The effector of
   airway narrowing is the contraction of airway smooth muscle (ASM), yet
   the question of whether an inherent or acquired dysfunction in ASM
   contractile function plays a significant role in the disease
   pathophysiology remains contentious.
   The difficulty in determining the role of ASM lies in limitations with
   the models used to assess contraction. In vivo models provide a fully
   integrated physiological response but ASM contraction cannot be directly
   measured. Ex vivo and in vitro models can provide more direct assessment
   of ASM contraction but the loss of factors that may modulate ASM
   responsiveness and AHR, including interaction between multiple cell
   types and disruption of the mechanical environment, precludes a complete
   understanding of the disease process.
   In this review we detail key advantages of common in vivo, ex vivo and
   in vitro models of ASM contraction, as well as emerging tissue
   engineered models of ASM and whole airways. We also highlight important
   findings from each model with respect to the pathophysiology of asthma.

Abstract = {{Site-specific crop management can increase profitability and reduce
   environmental risks of wild blueberry crop having large spatial
   variation in soil/plant characteristics and topographic features which
   may affect fruit yield. An integrated automated system comprising of an
   ultrasonic sensor, a digital color camera, a slope sensor, a real-time
   kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), custom software and ruggedized computer was
   developed. The system was incorporated onto a commercial wild blueberry
   harvester, to measure plant height, fruit yield, slope and elevation
   simultaneously while harvesting. Two wild blueberry fields were selected
   in central Nova Scotia, Canada to evaluate the performance of the
   system. Field boundaries, bare spots, weeds and grass patches were
   mapped with a RTK-GPS prior to start the experiment.
   Linear regression was used to calibrate the actual fruit yield with the
   percentage of blue pixels (R-2 = 0.91-0.92; P < 0.001; n = 40) using a
   0.91 x 0.70 m quadrat at selected points from both fields. The output
   voltage of the ultrasonic sensor was significantly correlated with
   manually measured plant height (R-2 = 0.94; P < 0.001; n = 13).
   Comprehensive surveys were conducted in both fields to measure plant
   height, fruit yield, slope and elevation rapidly in real-time at the
   same time of harvest. The maps for the measured parameters were
   developed in ArcGIS 10. Maps showed substantial variability in measured
   parameters across the fields, suggesting more fruit yield and lower
   plant height in low lying areas (mild slope) and vice versa. A negative
   relationship among fruit yield and plant height and the results of zonal
   statistics in ArcGIS 10 also supported the results identified by the
   maps. Overall, the results of calibration and mapping indicated that the
   developed system was an accurate, reliable and efficient to map plant
   height, fruit yield, slope and elevation in real-time. This information
   can be used to develop site-specific fertilization, based on easily
   measured field parameters, to optimize productivity while minimizing the
   environmental impacts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   simple method for quantifying dissolved nitrous oxide in tile drainage
   water. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 59-64. It is often assumed that the N2O
   produced from nitrification and denitrification in soil systems is lost
   primarily as a gas from the soil surface. However, the dissolution and
   eventual degassing of N2O in water leaching through, and draining from,
   agricultural fields is also a significant loss pathway. The
   quantification of this pathway of N2O loss has been limited by available
   methodologies for measuring dissolved gases in drainage water. Here a
   simple method is presented, which allows for the collection of tile
   drainage water samples using standard automated water sampling equipment
   that maintains the dissolved gases. Tile drainage water was collected in
   1 L ISCO (TM) water sampling bottles outfitted with modified 10 mL
   volumetric pipettes. The pipettes provide a means of reducing the
   water:atmosphere interface for water held within the pipette thus
   reducing the N2O exchange with the atmosphere. The water samples are
   removed from the pipette using long slender needles attached to a 20-mL
   syringe, drawing 5 mL of water from within the bulb of the pipette. The
   dissolved N2O in the water samples was measured by headspace analysis
   using a gas chromatograph. A laboratory trial determined that retaining
   the water in the pipette bulbs resulted reduced N2O degassing such that
   N2O concentration did not decrease significantly in the first 24 h after
   filling of the bottle.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A new methodology is introduced based on Bayesian network both to model
   domino effect propagation patterns and to estimate the domino effect
   probability at different levels. The flexible structure and the unique
   modeling techniques offered by Bayesian network make it possible to
   analyze domino effects through a probabilistic framework, considering
   synergistic effects, noisy probabilities, and common cause failures.
   Further, the uncertainties and the complex interactions among the domino
   effect components are captured using Bayesian network. The probabilities
   of events are updated in the light of new information, and the most
   probable path of the domino effect is determined on the basis of the new
   data gathered. This study shows how probability updating helps to update
   the domino effect model either qualitatively or quantitatively. The
   methodology is applied to a hypothetical example and also to an
   earlier-studied case study. These examples accentuate the effectiveness
   of Bayesian network in modeling domino effects in processing facility.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of alloying elements including aluminium, chromium, cobalt,

   a synthetic 90/10 Cu-Ni alloy in natural sea water and in artificial
   saline solutions (containing 2.86 wt-\% NaCl and 0 or 2260 ppm sulphate)
   was investigated. Synthetic alloys were prepared in an induction
   furnace, under an Ar/7 vol.-\%H-2 atmosphere in cylindrical boron
   nitride crucibles and were heat treated in a tube furnace. The
   electrochemical measurements were conducted using aerated electrolytes
   at room temperature using a potential range between -1.5 and +2.5
   V(SCE). Tafel extrapolation, cyclic polarisation, cyclic voltammetry and
   linear polarisation electrochemical techniques were applied in this
   investigation. It was concluded that the corrosion behaviour of the
   synthetic alloys depends on the alloying element added to the alloy.
   Cobalt was detected to be the most effective alloying element and
   aluminium may be used as an alloying element only in the absence of
   sulphate. Chromium could be used to some extent while the use of
   molybdenum, indium, vanadium or titanium as alloying elements did not
   improve the corrosion properties of 90/10 Cu-Ni alloy.}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{180-188}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The classical problem of a beam on an elastic foundation has long been
   of practical interest to geotechnical engineers, because it provides a
   framework for computing deflections not only of foundations, but also of
   vertically oriented laterally loaded piles. The supporting soil can be
   modelled as an elastic medium, which can be calibrated to represent the
   stiffness of the soils adjacent to the beam (or pile). The objective of
   this paper is to study the influence of spatially random soil stiffness
   on deformations of transversely loaded homogeneous piles and beams,
   using a combination of finite-element analysis, random field theory and
   Monte Carlo simulations. Following code validation against alternative
   solutions, the method investigates how the statistically defined soil
   stiffness (mean, standard deviation and spatial correlation length)
   influences the mean and standard deviation of pile or beam deflection.
   The goal of such an approach is to estimate the probability of
   deflections exceeding some design threshold.}},

Title = {{Refractory effects of the N1 event-related potential in experienced

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if cochlear implant (CI) patients exhibit a
   temporal processing deficit for auditory stimuli, by examining
   refractory effects of the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component.
   Design: CI patients and normally-hearing controls were tested in an
   auditory refractory period paradigm while ERP recordings were collected
   across the scalp. Participants were presented with brief 500-Hz tones
   that were separated by inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 500, 1000, or
   3000 ms. The amplitude of the N1 was examined as a function of ISI
   within each group. Study sample: Ten adult CI patients and 13
   age-matched normally-hearing controls were tested. Patients had
   long-lasting severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss prior to
   implantation, and a minimum of two years experience with CI activation.
   Results: Unlike normally-hearing controls, CI users showed no refractory
   effect for tones at 500 ms ISIs compared to 1000 ms. However, similar to
   controls, recovery from refractoriness was observed in anterior
   locations at 3000 ms. Conclusion: The refractory period threshold,
   defined as the minimum ISI where different N1 amplitudes are elicited,
   is greater than 1000 ms in CI patients; at least double that of
   normally-hearing controls.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{317}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{A model is proposed in which the relationship between individual neurons
   within a neural network is dynamically changing to the effect of
   providing a measure of ``plasticity{''} in the control of heart rate.
   The neural network on which the model is based consists of three
   populations of neurons residing in the central nervous system, the
   intrathoracic extracardiac nervous system, and the intrinsic cardiac
   nervous system. This hierarchy of neural centers is used to challenge
   the classical view that the control of heart rate, a key clinical index,
   resides entirely in central neuronal command (spinal cord, medulla
   oblongata, and higher centers). Our results indicate that dynamic
   networking allows for the possibility of an interplay among the three
   populations of neurons to the effect of altering the order of control of
   heart rate among them. This interplay among the three levels of control
   allows for different neural pathways for the control of heart rate to
   emerge under different blood flow demands or disease conditions and, as
   such, it has significant clinical implications because current
   understanding and treatment of heart rate anomalies are based largely on
   a single level of control and on neurons acting in unison as a single
   entity rather than individually within a (plastically) interconnected
   network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Power transfer between areas is a major function of a running electric
   power system. However, transmission networks have limited capability to
   transfer power. The objective of this paper is to present how to
   determine power transfer capability of transmission lines by a practical
   method. The proposed method is based on computer simulations of various
   scenarios of operation under incremental power changes at a chosen load
   bus and a corresponding generator bus. These simulations are performed
   by power-flow solutions using the Newton-Raphson method. The simulation
   results provide us indispensable information for successful operations
   of power systems under various amounts of power transfer. To assess the
   transfer capability, we first obtain the power-flow solution for the
   given data by running the power-flow program. For the given data of
   network, generation, and load, the program obtains the base-case
   solution. After obtaining power-flow solutions for the base case, we run
   the program for the scenarios in order to determine power transfer
   capability of the transmission lines that are of interest. Thus, the
   power transfer capability is determined. The method we have proposed is
   computationally efficient and easy to implement. Also, we have developed
   the power-flow program in a modular way so that it can be expandable
   with new applications when needed. Consequently, this research work
   helps system operators and power marketers use the existing transmission
   lines efficiently.}},

Title = {{Interface Failure Detection in Adhesively Bonded Composite Joints Using
   a Novel Vibration-Based Approach}},
Booktitle = {{ADVANCES IN MODELING AND DESIGN OF ADHESIVELY BONDED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{237-260}},
Abstract = {{Fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRP) structures are widely used in
   several applications in aerospace, automotive and infrastructures.
   Furthermore, adhesively bonded joints (ABJs) are increasingly used to
   mate FRP to FRP or FRP to other materials. FRP and ABJs are, however,
   susceptible to delamination and disbond, respectively. The effect of
   these defects (i.e. delamination and disbond) can be worsened under
   applied mechanical and environmentally-induced loads. Therefore, if
   delaminations remained undetected, they could cause significant loss in
   the load carrying capacity and performance of the structural element,
   especially under dynamic load conditions.
   In this paper, the integrity of a novel vibration-based damage detection
   methodology for detecting disbond and delamination damages in single lap
   ABJ is verified. The adopted approach is based on the evaluation of an
   Energy Damage Index (EDI) based on processing the vibration signals
   obtained through piezoelectric sensors mounted on the structure, using
   the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Furthermore, the details of a
   comprehensive experimental program designed and carried out to verify
   the capability of the proposed methodology are presented. Moreover,
   using the implicit dynamic solver of the commercial software ABAQUS (R),
   a comprehensive finite element framework is established, which is shown
   to be capable of simulating the entire damage detection process.
   Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   methodology is a powerful and cost-effective means for detecting disbond
   and delamination damages in FRP and ABJ.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen is widely produced and used in the process industries with
   growing use in the public domain. While the former area of focus would
   obviously necessitate process safety considerations, the latter involves
   activities such as transportation in which occupational safety issues
   for individuals are paramount. The current research addresses this issue
   by identifying several areas of application in the hydrogen economy for
   three key process safety concepts: (i) inherently safer design, (ii)
   safety management systems, and (iii) the use of case studies. This paper
   thus illustrates, by means of referenced examples, the transferable
   nature of key process safety concepts to various features of the
   emerging hydrogen economy. The primary thesis of this work is the notion
   that inherently safety design principles, safety management systems, and
   lessons learned from case histories have broader implications for safety
   than would be apparent by restricting their use solely to the process
   industries.}},

   and control the likelihood and consequences of explosions of
   nontraditional dusts. Using concepts drawn from previous studies, the
   framework consists of three main components: (i) a new combined safety
   management protocol, (ii) use of the CFD (computational fluid dynamics)
   software DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code) and FTA (Fault Tree
   Analysis) to determine explosion consequences and likelihood,
   respectively, and (iii) application of the hierarchy of controls
   (inherent, engineered and procedural safety) to achieve residual risk
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The anticipated entrance to the hydrogen economy has raised many
   concerns as regards its safe production, transport, storage and use, not
   excluding environmental concerns. Although it is true that hydrogen has
   been safely used for many decades, this has occurred until now in
   activities mainly in the chemical industry, where skilful and highly
   trained personnel are engaged. Yet, no one is certain what would happen
   when a layman handles a potentially hazardous material such as liquid
   hydrogen to refuel our cars. Such thoughts are sustained by the fact
   that there is still a significant shortage of knowledge on hazardous
   properties of hydrogen. Scepticism is also emerging on the environmental
   effects of large hydrogen leaks when hydrogen will be extensively used
   worldwide. This paper is a contribution to knowledge of hazardous
   properties of hydrogen and aims at offering a comprehensive overview on
   safety issues of this new energy carrier. It is shown that hydrogen
   safety concerns are not normally more severe, but they are simply
   different than those we are accustomed to with gasoline or natural gas.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless technologies has been attracting much attention due to its wide
   application. Thus it is important to predict the electromagnetic
   propagation characterization precisely. Full-wave time-domain
   electromagnetic methods are usually effective in rigorously modelling
   and evaluating wireless channels. However, their computational
   expenditures are expensive, when dealing with electrically large size
   problems consisting of fine structures. Thus, in this paper, a rigorous
   full-wave numerical solution, via the locally one-direction finite
   difference time domain (LOD-FDTD) method for lossy media, which reduces
   computational time by removing the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL)
   stability condition, is applied to characterize the wireless channel. By
   comparing the simulation results with the conventional FDTD, the
   proposed method demonstrates both good simulation efficiency and high
   accuracy. Post-processing of the simulation results lead to effective
   channel characterization with path loss exponent and probability
   distribution of path loss.}},

Abstract = {{Irregular repetition slotted ALOHA is a random access scheme where users
   transmit multiple copies of a packet to the receiver to provide
   time-domain diversity; then, the receiver attempts to iteratively decode
   packets and cancel their interference contribution in other time slots,
   increasing the chance of resolving collisions and decoding more packets.
   This scheme was shown to support larger system loads compared to
   conventional slotted ALOHA. In the original scheme, collision resolution
   between l colliding packets is possible only when l-1 of those packets
   are decoded in prior iterations, which is probable because of the other
   copies of each packet transmitted in other slots. However, although
   asymptotic analysis promises high efficiency of this scheme, the
   analysis relies on the large number of slots participating in the
   iterative collision resolution, which requires large receiver complexity
   and introduces delay. In this paper, we study this scheme for receivers
   capable of decoding multiple colliding packets jointly, which increases
   the chance of decoding more packets under large system loads. Asymptotic
   analysis for this generalized model is provided and it is shown by
   simulations that a multiuser detector supports larger loads for low
   number of slots jointly processed.}},

Abstract = {{In this research work, we advise gateway based energy-efficient routing
   protocol (M-GEAR) for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We divide the
   sensor nodes into four logical regions on the basis of their location in
   the sensing field. We install Base Station (BS) out of the sensing area
   and a gateway node at the centre of the sensing area. If the distance of
   a sensor node from BS or gateway is less than predefined distance
   threshold, the node uses direct communication. We divide the rest of
   nodes into two equal regions whose distance is beyond the threshold
   distance. We select cluster heads (CHs) in each region which are
   independent of the other region. These CHs are selected on the basis of
   a probability. We compare performance of our protocol with LEACH (Low
   Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy). Performance analysis and compared
   statistic results show that our proposed protocol perform well in terms
   of energy consumption and network lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of silicon and nanotechnology offers the possibility to
   design ultrafast silicon electro-optic switches with speeds of the order
   of 100 GHz. The design procedure for an ultrafast silicon electro-optic
   switch with the addition of photonic crystals is presented. The material
   medium selected for propagation of the optical signal through the switch
   is silicon nanocrystals in silica. A patterned slot waveguide with
   one-dimensional photonic crystals is proposed as the preferred slow
   light waveguide to be used in the design of the electro-optic switch.
   The ultrafast quadratic electro-optic effect or Kerr effect is the
   physical effect utilized, and its analysis for slot waveguides is
   discussed. The optical structure analysis of the electro-optic switch
   using a ring resonator is presented and it is shown theoretically that
   the use of a slow light waveguide in the ring resonator can reduce the
   required externally applied electric field or the radius of the ring
   resonator.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers energy efficient information dissemination in
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) deploying co-operating nodes which by
   adjusting their transmission ranges minimize the total transmitted power
   in the network. Specifically, the design of routing protocols with a
   single relay node along a data path is proposed for multiple unicast
   sessions in a network with randomly distributed nodes. The protocols
   take advantage of topological diversity created by adapting the
   transmission power and exploit the benefits of network coding in a
   system where nodes are periodically generating data packets. Energy
   efficiency of the conventional, store-and-forward, and network coding
   based relaying schemes is analyzed in different propagation conditions
   and for various node densities. The best-case improvement in the energy
   efficiency achievable with network coding over store-and-forward is 25\%
   for two node exchange of data. In WSNs, it is demonstrated through
   simulations that network coding offers realistically between 11\% to
   19\% energy savings over the store-and-forward strategy. The deployment
   of the relaying node contributes to the improvement in energy efficiency
   over direct transmissions in a range of 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper invetigates the stabilization issue for a bilateral
   teleoperation system with time-varying delays. The master and slave
   manipulators were modeled as linear single degree of freedom systems.
   The human user force was modeled based on the band limited availability
   of human motion, and the environmental force was modeled as a spring and
   damper combination based on the slave position. An impedance matching
   approach was applied to the master side dynamics, while a static error
   feedback gain is used to stabilize the slave side dynamics. A Lyapunov
   functional based on the error dynamics of the system is proposed with
   consideration for the minimum and maximum level of delays existing in
   the system. LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) techniques are used with
   Jensen's inequality to determine the static feedback control gain. The
   cone complementarity algorithm is used to deal with non-linear terms
   within the LMI. The algorithms, hardware applications to haptic devices
   are described thoroughly and experimental results with comparisons to
   simulation results are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Grasp planning based on geometrical information of objects can be
   approached as an optimization problem where a hand configuration that
   indicates a stable grasp needs to be located in a large search space. In
   this paper, we study the applicability of genetic algorithm (GA) on
   grasp planning optimization of 3D objects. The details are given on the
   selection of operators and parameters. Different sampling methods in the
   implementation of crossover and mutation operators are tested. A
   quantitative analysis including the comparison with random planner and
   simulated annealing (SA) method is performed to evaluate the performance
   of the GA based planner. GraspIt! simulator {[}1] is used for
   implementing the proposed algorithm and as the test environment. Two
   different quality metrics are considered. The result shows that GA is a
   robust method in the field of grasp planning. And the GA planner
   outperforms the SA planner in both pre-grasp quality and stability of
   the final grasp.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films of Si1-xOx were produced using combinatorial sputtering
   methods. X-ray diffraction studies of these films show that they are
   amorphous or nanostructured. The effect of oxygen content on the
   electrochemical performance of these materials was studied. The
   reversible specific capacity (between 0.005 and 0.9 V) agrees with the
   assumption that Si1-xOx is made up of amorphous silicon, which can react
   to form Li3.75Si, and amorphous SiO2, which reacts to form Li4SiO4. The
   irreversible capacity increases with oxygen content when measured to a
   potential limit of 0.9 V vs Li/Li+ but further Li can be extracted from
   sites presumably near oxygen up to a potential of 2.0 V vs Li/Li+.
   However, such potentials for the negative electrode would not be reached
   in a full Li-ion cell. This work shows that the oxygen content in
   Si1-xOx should be optimized to produce materials with a reasonable
   active/inactive ratio in order to have electrodes with the desired
   specific capacity, an appropriate irreversible capacity and an
   appropriate amount of inactive phase to buffer volume expansion. (C)

Abstract = {{Limited studies have been conducted to evaluate synergistic benefits
   between disinfectants, although promise has been shown between
   ultraviolet (UV) light and chlorine-based disinfectants. This research
   aimed to determine drinking water quality factors that affect potential
   for enhanced removal of heterotrophic bacteria due to synergy between UV
   light and free chlorine. An additional goal was to determine the impact
   of pipe material on the formation of biofilm and the effectiveness of
   combined disinfection in controlling it. Annular reactors (ARs)
   containing polycarbonate or cast iron coupons were used to simulate
   typical drinking water distribution systems. Two experiments were
   conducted with untreated hard groundwater and groundwater treated with
   ion exchange to remove hardness, each comparing chorine alone to
   chlorine with UV pre-treatment. Results show that enhanced removal of
   heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria existed with hard water when UV
   preceded chlorine, but synergistic benefits were not consistently
   observed. Under softened water conditions, no enhanced reduction or
   synergy was observed. Cast iron ARs supported biofilm HPC bacteria that
   were unaffected by any disinfection scheme regardless of source water,
   while bulk HPC bacteria were more resistant to disinfection in
   polycarbonate than cast iron ARs. Results indicate that disinfection
   synergy between UV and chlorine is limited in groundwater sources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is to develop a novel consensus algorithm or protocol for
   multi-agent systems in the event of communication link failure over the

   is applied to represent the data dropout during operation. The
   sufficient conditions for the stabilization controller design is
   developed by Lyapunov-based methodologies and Linear matrix inequality
   (LMIs) techniques. The feasibility of the given LMIs is analyzed to
   ensure the stabilization controller design, which ensures the MAS to
   achieve the consensus. Leader-following numerical simulations with a
   group of agents are successfully conducted to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the novel consensus algorithm in this paper. The
   results are studied to show that the consensus achievement is
   incorporating with the data loss probability up to 95\%, however the

Abstract = {{A random walk particle tracking model was used to simulate the motions
   of oil-mineral-aggregates (OMAs) under hydrodynamic conditions involving
   wave-induced velocities, random velocities due to turbulence, and the
   settling velocity due to gravity. Wave-induced and settling velocities
   for OMAs determined from the application of Stokes's theory and
   empirical equations derived from experimental data were used in a series
   of simulations to evaluate the effects of wave characteristics, particle
   size distribution, and settling/floating velocity on the transport of
   OMAs formed from two different types of minerals. The study found that
   the wave effect on advection/diffusion is of secondary importance when
   compared to tidal currents and turbulence induced velocity. To assess
   the risk of OMAs to benthic organisms, predicted environmental
   concentrations (PEC) was compared to the benchmark concentration (BC)
   derived for eight different hydrocarbon groups. The simulation results
   indicate that no risk from both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons can
   be found for the two cases described in this paper with a 1,000 tonnes
   spill. The study also showed that aromatic hydrocarbons posed more risk
   than aliphatic hydrocarbons. For both aliphatic and aromatic
   hydrocarbons, the C-9-C-12 group posed greater risk than other groups.}},

Abstract = {{Hydride/dehydride titanium powder has been processed using a
   conventional die compaction powder metallurgical approach. The effects
   of various processing parameters have been assessed in terms of the
   microstructure and mechanical behaviour, including lubricant type and
   amount, compaction pressure, delubrication atmosphere, and sintering
   conditions. While low lubricant contents can result in high sintered
   densities, a minimum lubricant content is required to maintain die life.
   It was also demonstrated that a compaction pressure of 300 MPa is
   sufficient to provide high sintered densities, while again minimising
   potential for die damage. Densities close to 99\% of theoretical could
   be achieved when sintering at 1450 degrees C for 4 h. Tensile strengths
   in excess of 750 MPa were obtained when sintering at 1300 or 1400
   degrees C. The mechanical behaviour was strongly influenced by a
   combination of intrinsic powder impurities (i.e. oxygen), residual
   carbon contamination from the lubricant, grain growth and retained
   porosity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Fe and Ni additions to an Al-Cu-Mg powder metallurgy

   prealloyed materials also exhibited a refined distribution of the
   aluminide phases formed. These included Al7Cu2Fe, Al7Cu4Ni and Al9FeNi
   as identified through a combination of SEM/EDS and XRD. The most
   promising alloy was identified as Al-4.4Cu-1.5Mg-1Fe-1Ni as it exhibited
   tensile properties that exceeded those of the baseline material. This

Journal = {{CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-80}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ti(C, N) based cermets have received significant attention due to their
   enhanced mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, low mass and
   increased chemical stability, when compared to WC-Co hardmetals. These
   properties have been found to be superior in many cases to traditional
   hardmetal replacements, such as TiC-Ni. The current study focuses on
   Ti(C, N)-Ni3Al cermets formed through melt infiltration (with binder
   contents ranging from 20 to 40 vol.-\%Ni3Al). Comparison is made with
   TiC-Ni3Al cermets using an identical binder alloy. The reciprocating
   ball on flat wear properties of the cermets were evaluated as a function
   of applied load (using a WC-Co counterface), together with the composite
   hardness and indentation fracture resistance. It is shown that nitrogen
   content negatively affects infiltration, resulting in non-infiltrated
   areas within low binder content cermets, which decreases the indentation
   fracture resistance and hardness. This problem can be largely mitigated
   by increasing binder content. When comparing fully infiltrated cermets,
   increasing nitrogen content decreases hardness and increases toughness,
   while all Ti(C, N) cermets outperform TiC (at 40 vol.-\% binder).
   Reciprocating wear increased with increasing load, and typically was the
   most severe for the lowest binder contents. A combination of wear
   mechanisms were apparent, including both abrasive and adhesive wear,
   with the formation of an oxide tribolayer containing components from
   both the tested cermets and the WC-Co counterface material.}},

Abstract = {{The source attribution of observed variability of total PM2.5
   concentrations over Halifax, Nova Scotia, was investigated between 11
   July and 26 August 2011 using measurements of PM2.5 mass and PM2.5
   chemical composition (black carbon, organic matter, anions, cations and
   33 elements). This was part of the BORTAS-B (quantifying the impact of
   BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants using Aircraft and
   Satellites) experiment, which investigated the atmospheric chemistry and
   transport of seasonal boreal wildfire emissions over eastern Canada in
   2011. The US EPA Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model was
   used to determine the average mass (percentage) source contribution over
   the 45 days, which was estimated to be as follows: long-range transport
   (LRT) pollution: 1.75 mu g m(-3) (47\%); LRT pollution marine mixture:
   1.0 mu g m(-3) (27.9\%); vehicles: 0.49 mu g m(-3) (13.2\%); fugitive
   dust: 0.23 mu g m(-3) (6.3\%); ship emissions: 0.13 mu g m(-3) (3.4\%);
   and refinery: 0.081 mu g m(-3) (2.2\%). The PMF model describes 87\% of
   the observed variability in total PM2.5 mass (bias=0.17 and RSME = 1.5
   mu g m(-3)). The factor identifications are based on chemical markers,
   and they are supported by air mass back trajectory analysis and local
   wind direction. Biomass burning plumes, found by other surface and
   aircraft measurements, were not significant enough to be identified in
   this analysis. This paper presents the results of the PMF receptor
   modelling, providing valuable insight into the local and upwind sources
   impacting surface PM2.5 in Halifax and a vital comparative data set for
   the other collocated ground-based observations of atmospheric
   composition made during BORTAS-B.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the design and execution of the BORTAS (Quantifying the
   impact of BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic
   using Aircraft and Satellites) experiment, which has the overarching
   objective of understanding the chemical aging of air masses that contain
   the emission products from seasonal boreal wildfires and how these air
   masses subsequently impact downwind atmospheric composition. The central
   focus of the experiment was a two-week deployment of the UK BAe-146-301
   Atmospheric Research Aircraft (ARA) over eastern Canada, based out of
   Halifax, Nova Scotia. Atmospheric ground-based and sonde measurements
   over Canada and the Azores associated with the planned July 2010
   deployment of the ARA, which was postponed by 12 months due to UK-based
   flights related to the dispersal of material emitted by the
   Eyjafjallajokull volcano, went ahead and constituted phase A of the
   experiment. Phase B of BORTAS in July 2011 involved the same atmospheric
   measurements, but included the ARA, special satellite observations and a
   more comprehensive ground-based measurement suite. The high-frequency
   aircraft data provided a comprehensive chemical snapshot of pyrogenic
   plumes from wildfires, corresponding to photochemical ( and physical)
   ages ranging from < 1 day to greater than or similar to 10 days, largely
   by virtue of widespread fires over Northwestern Ontario. Airborne
   measurements reported a large number of emitted gases including
   semi-volatile species, some of which have not been been previously
   reported in pyrogenic plumes, with the corresponding emission ratios
   agreeing with previous work for common gases. Analysis of the NOy data
   shows evidence of net ozone production in pyrogenic plumes, controlled
   by aerosol abundance, which increases as a function of photochemical
   age. The coordinated ground-based and sonde data provided detailed but
   spatially limited information that put the aircraft data into context of
   the longer burning season in the boundary layer. Ground-based
   measurements of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m ( PM2.5) over
   Halifax show that forest fires can on an episodic basis represent a
   substantial contribution to total surface PM2.5.}},

Abstract = {{Although information pertaining to the viscous characterization of HES
   130/0.4 Voluven (R) and HES 260/0.45 Pentaspan (R) is available,
   quantification is limited to 100\% concentrations. We focus here on the
   quantification of their viscous behavior along with HES 130/0.4 Volulyte
   (R) in a shear thinning non-Newtonian blood analog of aqueous xanthan
   gum and glycerol. Dynamic viscosities of multiple batches of HES fluids
   were measured through capillary viscometry. The viscous behavior of
   100\%, 25\% and 12.5\% concentrations were then measured through a
   closed flow loop across physiologically relevant flow rates. Measured
   viscosities were 2.57 millipascal second (mPa.s) 6.52 mPa.s and 2.48
   mPa.s for HES 130/0.4 Voluven (R), HES 260/0.45 and HES 130/0.4 Volulyte
   (R), respectively. Pipe flow analysis found that all HES fluids
   displayed Newtonian behavior at 100\% concentrations. 25\%
   concentrations of both HES 130/0.4 fluids decreased analog viscosity
   23\%-29\% at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/s and 16\%-21\% at a flow rate of
   22.5 ml/s. At a flow rate of 22.5 ml/s, 25\% and 12.5\% concentrations
   of HES 260/0.45 resulted in analog viscosity changes of 3.9\%-4.5\%.
   Capillary viscosity reductions of approximately 7\% and 14.5\% in HES
   130/0.4 Voluven (R) and HES 260/0.45 suggest changes in molecular
   composition to batches previously measured. Maintenance of analog
   viscosity suggests that HES 260/0.45 would be suitable as a high
   viscosity plasma expander in extreme hemodilution through preservation
   of microcirculatory function and wall shear stress (WSS).}},

Abstract = {{Efficient exploitation of the wide bandwidth available in the EHF
   (extremely high frequency) domain will be a main pillar for the
   development of future-generation terabit satellite networks.
   State-of-the-art systems use spectrally-efficient coded modulations,
   which are based on coherent demodulation that requires the use of
   complex and expensive analog PLL circuitry, which are vulnerable to high
   Doppler shifts and phase noise, the latter, being a significant
   impairment in the W-band. The latest trends in digital communications
   are to use fully digital receivers. Therefore, we consider a novel
   modulation method based on differential turbo-coded modulation and
   A-Posteriori-Probability (APP) channel estimation for application in
   multi-gigabit W-band satellite links. The proposed scheme utilizes the
   combination of an outer 2/3 binary parity channel code and differential
   8-PSK modulation, similar to a binary repeat-accumulate serial turbo
   coding. The turbo-demodulator uses a double-spread interleaver and
   Log-MAP decoding performed on the 8-PSK trellis. Counteracting channel
   impairments and frequency drifts is primarily accomplished by APP
   channel estimation which is integrated into the differential
   demodulator, and consists of a simple smoothing filter. Preliminary
   results have shown a robust behavior of the system, achieving high link
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative wideband omnidirectional horizontally polarized (HP)
   antenna is presented for 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless
   communication and networking systems. The proposed planar antenna
   consists of four pairs of flag-shaped radiators, a balun for

   bandwidth enhancement. Such a design enables in-phase and axially
   symmetric current flowing along the radiators. The measurements show
   that the proposed HP antenna exhibits a relative bandwidth of 41\% with
   the return loss greater than or equal to 10 dB; it covers the frequency
   band of 1.76-2.68 GHz, including PCS, UMTS/LTE, Bluetooth, ISM, and WLAN
   bands. With an omnidirectional radiation pattern in E-plane, the
   proposed antenna has a peak gain of 3.6-4.2 dBi across the operational
   band and a radiation efficiency of 83\%. The low profile and compact
   design, along with the omnidirectional radiation pattern, makes it ideal

Title = {{On Adaptive Energy-Efficient Transmission in WSNs}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
   is to reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes to prolong lifetime of
   finite capacity batteries. In this paper, we propose energy-efficient
   adaptive scheme for transmission (EAST) in WSNs. EAST is an IEEE
   802.15.4 standard compliant. In this scheme, open-looping feedback
   process is used for temperature-aware link quality estimation and
   compensation, wherea closed-loop feedback process helps to divide
   network into three logical regions to minimize overhead of control
   packets. Threshold on transmitter power loss (RSSIloss) and current
   number of nodes (n(c)(t)) in each region help to adapt transmit power
   level (P-level) according to link quality changes due to temperature
   variation. Evaluation of the proposed scheme is done by considering
   mobile sensor nodes and reference node both static and mobile.
   Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively adapts
   transmission P-level to changing link quality with less control packets
   overhead and energy consumption as compared to classical approach with
   single region in which maximum transmitter P-level assigned to
   compensate temperature variation.}},

Abstract = {{Glacial debris flows along International Karakorum Highway (KKH)

   Corporation in 2008. However it is necessary to collect the detailed
   data about the damages to bridges and obtain the most dangerous key
   position. The series of field investigations from 2008 to 2011
   demonstrate that the damages are classified into four categories:
   deposition under bridge, abrasive erosion, impact on piers or abutment
   and collapse due to buoyancy. Statistics indicate deposition under
   bridge is the most dominant damage whereas the most serious damage is
   the impact on piers or abutments. Therefore a case study on key point is
   made for the typical bridge subjected to impact from Ghulkin glacial
   debris flow. Finally prevention measures are given.}},

Abstract = {{Cast iron pipes were installed broadly in North American water
   utilities, particularly in older cities such as Halifax, NS, and other
   cities in the northeastern portions of Canada and the USA. Many of these
   cast iron pipes are corroded and are continuous sources of Fe(II) ions
   in drinking water distribution systems. In this paper, the results of an
   experimental investigation into the factors influencing haloacetic acids
   (HAAs) formation in the presence of Fe(II) ions are presented. The
   experiments were conducted using NaHCO3 buffered synthetic water samples
   with different characteristics (i.e. pH, phosphate, stagnation time)
   simulating with water distribution systems. The results showed that
   Fe(II) ions significantly reduced HAAs formation in different reaction
   systems at a 95\% confidence level. In control water systems, pH had no
   significant impact, however, in the presence of Fe(II) ions in water, pH
   had an obvious impact to increase HAAs formation (alpha = 0.05). In
   contrast, phosphate-based corrosion inhibitor significantly (alpha =
   0.05) reduced HAAs formation in the presence of different dosages of
   Fe(II) ions in water samples for the reaction period of 24, 48, 84 and
   130 h, respectively. Significant factors and their rank influencing HAAs
   formation and distribution were identified using a 24 full factorial
   design approach.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, reconfigurable antennas, with the ability to radiate
   wave in more than one pattern and polarization, play a great role in
   modern telecommunication systems. Compared with conventional antennas,
   multipattern and multipolarization antennas have more advantages and
   better prospects. They can be used to improve system gain and security,
   satisfy system requirements, avoid noisy environment, and adapt to the
   environment flexibly. This paper discusses different patterns and
   polarizations of reconfigurable antennas according to current research
   work in this area. In the opinion of this paper, the radiation pattern
   states of antennas include beam direction, shape, and gain. The
   polarization states of antennas include horizontal/vertical linear, +/-
   slant 45 degrees linear, left-hand or right-hand circular polarized.
   Different multipattern and multipolarization antennas with various
   structures and working mechanisms are compared and discussed.
   Multipattern and multipolarization antennas have been well applied for
   aerospace and terrestrial applications, such as dynamic scenarios,
   adaptive beam scanning, and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
   systems.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has proposed that hybridization of residential-scale
   cogeneration with roof-mounted solar PV (photovoltaic) arrays can
   increase the PV penetration level in ideal situations by a factor of
   five. In regions where there is a significant cooling load PV-cogen
   hybrid systems could be coupled to an absorption chiller to utilize
   waste heat from the cogen unit. In order to investigate realistic
   (non-ideal) loads that such a hybrid system would need to service, a new
   numerical simulation called PVTOM (PV-trigeneration optimization model)
   was created and coupled to the results of the established CHREM
   (Canadian Hybrid Residential End-Use Energy and Emissions Model). In
   this paper, PVTOM is applied to representative houses in select Canadian
   regions, which experience cooling loads, to assess the fuel utilization
   efficiency and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from hybrid
   PV-cogen and trigen systems in comparison with conventional systems.
   Results of the optimization runs are provided and the efficacy of
   PV-cogen and PV-trigen systems is discussed. Both PV-trigen and PV-cogen
   systems have demonstrated to be more effective at reducing emissions
   when compared to the current combination of centralized power plants and
   household heating technologies in some regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Objective: To perform a contemporary review of experimental studies to
   describe the effects of various novel adjuvant therapies in enhancing
   tympanic membrane (TM) perforation healing.
   Methods: A PubMed search for articles from January 2000 to June 2012
   related to TM perforation, along with the references of those articles,
   was performed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to all
   experimental studies assessing adjuvant therapies to TM healing.
   Results: Many studies have assessed the efficacy of biomolecules or
   growth factors, such as epidermal growth factors and basic fibroblast
   growth factors, in TM regeneration with significant success. More recent
   strategies in TM tissue engineering have involved utilizing
   bioengineered scaffold materials, such as silk fibroin, chitosan,
   calcium alginate, and decellularized extracellular matrices. Most
   scaffold materials demonstrated biocompatibility and faster TM
   perforation healing rates.
   Conclusion: Although several studies have demonstrated promising
   results, many questions still remain, such as the adequacy of animal
   models and long-term biocompatibility of adjuvant materials. As well,
   further studies comparing various adjuvant substances and bioscaffolds
   are required prior to clinical application. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental investigation of triangular and circular
   jets of air issuing into still-air surroundings are presented. Two
   isosceles triangular jets, issuing from sharp-edged orifices with apex
   angles of 30 and 160 deg, a sharp-edged orifice circular jet, and a
   contoured nozzle circular jet, were used for the study. The orifices and
   nozzle had the same exit area. The Reynolds number, based on the
   equivalent diameter of the triangular orifices (or diameter of the
   circular orifice or nozzle), was (1.68 +/- 0.08) x 10(5) in the jets. An
   x array hot-wire probe and a pitot-static tube were used to acquire the
   data. The results show that the 160 deg triangular jet has a higher mean
   streamwise centerline velocity decay rate but a lower mass entrainment
   rate than the 30 deg triangular jet. Also, the preferred mode Strouhal
   numbers for the 160 and 30 deg triangular jets were found to be 0.96 and
   0.53, respectively. The autocorrelation coefficient distribution
   exhibits long tails in the 160 deg triangular jet, but it is periodic in
   the 30 deg triangular jet. Contour maps of the mean streamwise velocity,
   from which a faster development of the 160 deg triangular jet can be
   deduced, show changes in the shape of the triangular jets.}},

   into the concentrations and potential local and long-range sources of
   air pollution, but its association with lichen species diversity was
   also examined. Ogawa passive diffusion samplers were used to measure

   concentrations in the park of winter and summer NO2 (0.81 and 0.16 ppb)
   and SO2 (0.24 and 0.21 ppb) are not at levels known to be phytotoxic to
   lichen. The NO2 concentrations in winter were significantly (p = 0.001)
   higher than those in summer whilst the SO2 concentrations did not differ
   significantly between winter and sunnmer (p = 0.429). Highest NO2
   concentrations in both seasons were observed in the Grand Anse Valley,
   presumably due to the steep road, emissions from the Pleasant Bay
   community at the foot of the valley and the enclosed topography of this
   area reducing dispersion of primary emissions. The SO2 concentrations in
   the park tended to be greater at elevated sites than valley sites,
   consistent with dispersion from long-range, rather than local, sources
   for this pollutant. Significant predictors in a multilinear regression
   for an index of air purity (lichen based measure of air quality) were
   lichen species number (p = 0.009), forest old growth index (p = 0.001)
   and distance from roads (p < 0.001) (model R-2 = 0.8, model p = 0.004).
   The study suggests that local sources of pollution (roads emissions) are
   adversely associated with lichen species diversity in this National
   Park, compared with long-range transport, and that monitoring programs
   such as a lichen-based `index of air purity' can reveal locations where
   ambient air pollution, although low, is nevertheless at a level that may
   cause ecological detriment. The implications from this work could be
   applicable to national parks elsewhere. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: The primary objective of this research was to explore the
   use of an interactive whiteboard as an Emergency Response Focus Board
   (ERFB) for offshore emergency response teams (ERT) during a training and
   assessment process.
   Methods: Thirty-seven participants completed simulation testing in a
   randomized study design with two visual display conditions (static and
   dynamic display). Outcome measures included speed and accuracy of
   response to situation awareness questions presented orally during three
   separate simulation freezes, and self-rating of performance.
   Results: Results indicate that the type of ERFB display significantly
   influenced the speed and accuracy of responses. Qualitative results
   indicate that situation awareness was increased when using the dynamic
   ERFB.
   Conclusions: It can be concluded that the dynamic ERFB offers an
   objective measure of performance and as a consequence, it is recommended
   that dynamic ERFBs be implemented into future offshore emergency
   response assessment training.
   Relevance to industry: Given the enormous amount of information
   available during an emergency, the dynamic ERFB offers an improved
   system for data logging, consolidation of information, and greater
   comprehension of relevant resource allocation factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We consider a submerged evacuated circular cylindrical shell subjected
   to an external impulse loading and focus on the numerical simulation of
   the radiation by such a shell into the surrounding fluid. The structure
   of the radiated field in question is complex, and the only fully
   successful attempts at its numerical simulation were those where the
   shell was treated as an elastic body, i.e. where all the assumptions
   accommodating the distinctive geometry of a shell were abandoned. Our
   objective is to attempt introducing a mathematical model of the system
   that would be based on a shell theory more advanced than the ones used
   so far in the present context but that, at the same time, would produce
   the results of the same level of accuracy as the more complex,
   non-shell-theory-based models. We demonstrate that this is indeed
   possible, and that employing the Reissner-Mindlin shell theory within
   the framework of the semi-analytical methodology developed in our
   earlier work allows for an accurate reproduction of the structure of the
   radiated field without resorting to treating the shell as an elastic
   body. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A bow-tie diagram combines a fault tree and an event tree to represent
   the risk control parameters on a common platform for mitigating an
   accident. Quantitative analysis of a bow-tie is still a major challenge
   since it follows the traditional assumptions of fault and event tree
   analyses. The assumptions consider the crisp probabilities and
   ``independent{''} relationships for the input events. The crisp
   probabilities for the input events are often missing or hard to come by,
   which introduces data uncertainty. The assumption of ``independence{''}
   introduces model uncertainty. Elicitation of expert's knowledge for the
   missing data may provide an alternative; however, such knowledge
   incorporates uncertainties and may undermine the credibility of risk
   analysis.
   This paper attempts to accommodate the expert's knowledge to overcome
   missing data and incorporate fuzzy set and evidence theory to assess the
   uncertainties. Further, dependency coefficient-based fuzzy and evidence
   theory approaches have been developed to address the model uncertainty
   for bow-tie analysis. In addition, a method of sensitivity analysis is
   proposed to predict the most contributing input events in the bow-tie
   analysis. To demonstrate the utility of the approaches in industrial
   application, a bow-tie diagram of the BP Texas City accident is
   developed and analyzed. (c) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Journal = {{PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{46-53}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Among the various techniques used for safety analysis of process
   systems, bow-tie (BT) analysis is becoming a popular technique as it
   represents an accident scenario from causes to effects. However, the BT
   application in the dynamic safety analysis is limited due to the static
   nature of its components, i.e. fault tree and event tree. It is
   therefore difficult in BT to take accident precursors into account to
   update the probability of events and the consequent risk. Also, BT is
   unable to represent conditional dependency. Event dependency is common
   among primary events and safety barriers. The current paper illustrates
   how Bayesian network (BN) helps to overcome these limitations. It has
   also been shown that BN can be used in dynamic safety analysis of a wide
   range of accident scenarios due to its flexible structure. This paper
   also introduces the application of probability adapting in dynamic
   safety analysis rather than probability updating. A case study from the
   U.S. Chemical Safety Board has been used to illustrate the application
   of both BT and BN techniques, with a comparison of the results from each
   technique. (c) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

   relevant to asthma, a disease characterized by structural remodeling of
   the airway wall, and highlights a need for more physiologically relevant
   models of ASM function. We utilized a tissue engineering platform known
   as microfabricated tissue gauges to develop a 3D culture model of ASM
   featuring arrays of similar to 0.4 mm long, similar to 350 cell
   ``microtissues{''} capable of simultaneous contractile force measurement
   and cell-level microscopy. ASM-only microtissues generated baseline
   tension, exhibited strong cellular organization, and developed actin
   stress fibers, but lost structural integrity and dissociated from the
   cantilevers within 3 days. Addition of 3T3-fibroblasts dramatically
   improved survival times without affecting tension development or
   morphology. ASM-3T3 microtissues contracted similarly to ex vivo ASM,
   exhibiting reproducible responses to a range of contractile and relaxant
   agents. Compared with 2D cultures, microtissues demonstrated identical
   responses to acetylcholine and KCl, but not histamine, forskolin, or
   cytochalasin D, suggesting that contractility is regulated by substrate
   geometry. Microtissues represent a novel model for studying ASM,
   incorporating a physiological 3D structure, realistic mechanical
   environment, coculture of multiple cells types, and comparable
   contractile properties to existing models. This new model allows for
   rapid screening of biochemical and mechanical factors to provide insight
   into ASM dysfunction in asthma.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a study of the three-dimensional vibration of two dry
   human skulls in response to harmonic excitation are presented. The
   vibratory response exhibits three distinct types of motion across the
   range of audible frequencies. At low frequencies below 1000 Hz,
   whole-head quasi-rigid motion is seen. At the middle frequencies between
   1000 and 6000 Hz, the motion exhibits a series of increasingly complex
   modal patterns. Above 6000 Hz, the response is wavelike and clear
   wave-fronts can be distinguished in the vibration data. In this regime
   the relationship between wavelength and frequency is calculated and
   compared to a number of theories of skull vibration that have been
   proposed. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to develop an aluminum powder metallurgy
   (P/M) alloy appropriate for industrial press-sinter technology. An entry
   in the 2xxx series of aluminum-copper-magnesium alloys was explored for
   this purpose. Designated as P/M 2324 (Al-4.4Cu-1.5Mg), the sintering
   response and mechanical properties of the alloy were investigated in
   laboratory and industrial settings. It was determined that compaction at
   400 MPa and sintering at 600 degrees C for 20 min produced the best
   properties in the sintered product. Doping with a minor amount of tin
   (0.2w/o) was found to improve the properties whereas modifications to Cu
   and Mg concentration produced minimal gains. All tensile properties of
   P/M 2324 were significantly superior to those of the principal 2xxx
   series aluminum P/M alloy (AC2014) in current use. These benefits were
   attributed to a high sintered density (> 98\% theoretical) that was
   reproducible in an industrial setting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The fiber-reinforced composite materials with cylindrical inclusions of

   employs the dynamic threshold and weighting values formulated on the
   speed of the input voltage. The validation of the rate-dependent
   Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is demonstrated by comparing its out responses
   with the measured responses obtained for a piezoelectric actuator under
   different input frequencies. Finally, a feedforward controller with an
   inverse rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is designed to account
   for the dynamic hysteresis. The results show that the hysteresis
   nonlinearities are significantly reduced at both the lower and higher

Abstract = {{There are 3 primary roles in a service learning (SL) project: student,
   teacher, and community organization representative (COR). It has been
   established that students enjoy and benefit from SL experiences. 1-5
   Teachers benefit as well, in their ability to meet educational
   objectives. 1 For the community organizations, the advantage appears to
   be obvious; their problem is resolved. However, the benefits for the COR
   must be more fully explored. This paper will examine the advantages as
   well as the inconveniences experienced by one of the authors while
   participating in a SL project.
   In the 2011 -2012 academic year, 45 first-year engineering students at
   the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada were introduced to a
   need from a remote village in Kenya. Though it would have been
   preferable to work directly with the villagers, poor internet quality
   and the extreme distance made this impossible. As a result, people from
   the local community, who regularly travelled to the village, identified
   the need and acted as the COR during the 15-week long project. In groups
   of 3, the students designed charcoal presses to convert agricultural
   waste into charcoal briquettes more efficiently than the current
   process.
   The COR was involved in the design process during the problem
   introduction, a hands-on demonstration of the process, question and
   answer sessions, reviews, and the design exposition. Also, while in the
   Kenyan village, the COR facilitated an exchange of information and
   performed an experiment designed by the students. The time demand,
   though great, gave the students a better understanding of the needs of
   the villagers.
   This paper will consider a qualitative assessment of the COR's
   involvements. This will be achieved through an examination of activities
   between the students and the COR, including a firsthand account of the
   events that took place in the remote village. Finally, the
   accomplishments and deficiencies that the COR experienced will be
   analyzed, and recommendations will be made to ensure that all
   participants' expectations are achievable.}},

   parity-check matrix of a low-density parity-check convolutional code

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel algorithm to solve multi-robot formation path
   planning problem is proposed. A combination of the leader-follower and
   improved poly-clonal artificial immune algorithm is used to derive the
   formation architecture. The formation of multi-robot is maintained
   through controlling the distance and angle between leader and followers.
   Robots reach the desired positions and avoid obstacles with improved
   poly-clonal artificial immune algorithm. Artificial immune network has
   been widely used in obstacles avoidance with the strong searching
   ability and learning ability. Improved poly-clonal artificial immune
   algorithm increases the diversity of antibodies. Concentration of every
   antibody is computed based on the algorithm. Only the antibody with the
   highest concentration is selected to act on robot. Meanwhile, formation
   control system changes the leader temporarily when the original
   followers encounter with obstacles. Extensive experiments show that the
   proposed algorithm effectively maintains the formation and successfully
   avoids obstacles. Simulations validate the effectiveness and stability
   of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for Single-hidden Layer Feedforward
   Neural Network (SLFN) has been attracting attentions because of its

   been proven that generalization performance of ELM classifier depends
   critically on the number of hidden neurons and the random determination
   of the input weights and hidden biases. In this paper, we propose
   Variable-length Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (VPSO) for ELM to
   automatically select the number of hidden neurons as well as
   corresponding input weights and hidden biases for maximizing ELM
   classifier's generalization performance. Experimental results have
   verified that the proposed VPSO-ELM scheme significantly improves the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a pre-attentive visual segmentation method by using
   Jeffrey divergence based irregular pyramid, termed as ``JIP{''}
   algorithm. The proposed JIP algorithm obtains a suboptimal labeling
   solution under the condition that the number of segments is not manually
   given. This algorithm models each node at higher pyramidal levels as a
   probabilistic distribution, based on which Jeffrey divergence is
   employed to measure the inter-node distance while entropy is used to
   measure the intra-node distance. As a result, the neighborhood system
   for the graph of each higher pyramidal level can be automatically set up
   according to the similarity and graphic constraints. During the
   hierarchical accumulation of the irregular pyramid, the segments can
   emerge once they are represented by single nodes at certain levels.
   Experimental results have shown that this proposed JIP algorithm
   outperforms other benchmark segmentation algorithms in terms of
   segmentation accuracy and labeling cost.}},

Abstract = {{As the acoustic images are low-quality, it is difficult to use these
   images for scientific research and practical applications directly.
   Although the PSNR of sonar images were improved through existing
   methods, denoised images were lack of clarity so that the outline of
   objects and details had not been better preserved. Subsequently, this
   impacted accuracy of target detection. In this paper, we propose a
   collaborative tracking algorithm based on Mean-Shift and
   reference-template-based matching (RTM). We construct a set of
   underwater security monitoring sonar system and carry out our experiment
   in Huangpu River. The algorithm represented in this paper can
   effectively improve the signal noise ratio of the sonar image, an
   increase strength of about 3 similar to 4db. Target tracking satisfies
   the real-time requirements, which shows our method is effective.}},

Abstract = {{Our bionic eye PTZ requires the tracking target at the central field of
   view of the camera, which means it is so important to realize the target
   tracking well in the first step. The particle filter method is famous
   for its robust tracking performance in cluttered environments. However,
   most methods are in the mode of moving object and stationary camera and
   they are not utilizing so well on the bionic eye PTZ since the camera in
   our project needs real-time motion. In this paper, we proposed an
   improved particle filter based on the SKL (Symmetric Kullback-Leibler
   divergence) similarity measure to realize object tracking and a
   closed-loop control model based on speed regulation to keep the target
   at the centre of the camera. The experiment results show that our system
   can track the moving object well and can always keep the object in the
   middle of the field of the view.}},

Abstract = {{For performing the best obstacle-surmounting capability, including
   Stairs-Climbing and channel-crossing, SHU-I's, a six-track robot with
   four independent swing arms, obstacle-surmounting capability are
   analyzed according to the robot kinematics based on the
   obstacle-surmounting mechanism of the six-track robot with four swing
   arms. Its maximal obstacle-surmounting capability of Stairs-Climbing is
   mainly analyzed. Taking SHU-I crawler robot prototype as an example,
   three dimensional relationship diagrams of the step height, the
   elevation angle and arms' swing angle are drawn. Also, the relationship
   between channel-crossing capability and structural parameters of the
   six-track robot are analyzed. We establish obstacle-surmounting
   mathematical model, also deduce the optimum obstacle-surmounting
   capability and corresponding obstacle gesture. Then, we use recurdyn
   dynamics software to carry out simulation experiments to examine
   validity of obstacle-surmounting mathematical model. This paper would
   provide theoretical basis for six-track robots' centroid position
   control in obstacle-surmounting process.}},

   method. Base on this, a dynamic model of spherical robot is developed

Abstract = {{Bilateral teleoperation technology has caused wide attentions due to its
   applications in various remote operation systems. However, to really
   realize teleoperation requirements, there still exist some challenging
   control issues: a) the communication delay between master and slave
   manipulators may lead to system instability or performance decreasing;
   b) in some applications, the sensors are not easily set up to measure
   the environmental external force; c) various manipulator modeling
   uncertainties need to be considered carefully in order to achieve good
   control performance. In this paper, the disturbance observer is designed
   based on the slave manipulator dynamics to observe the unmeasurable
   environmental force. When the environmental force is modeled as a
   general linear regression form, its unknown parameters can be estimated
   online by the least square adaptation law. A novel communication
   structure is proposed where only the master trajectory is transmitted to
   the slave side, and the transmission signal from the slave to the master
   is replaced by those estimated environmental parameters. This design can
   avoid solving the complicated passivity problem under communication
   delays and having the trade-off between the system stability and control
   performance, and thus has the potential of achieving the excellent
   control performance and the guaranteed robust stability simultaneously
   under arbitrary time delays. The sliding mode control and the force
   compensation of disturbance observer are integrated subsequently to deal
   with various manipulator modeling uncertainties, so that the excellent
   synchronization performance can be achieved. The simulation on single
   DOF manipulators is carried out and the results show the effectiveness
   of the proposed control algorithm.}},

   an eyeball, three driving stators, three preloaded apparatuses and some
   supports, and has three degrees of freedom (3-DOF). The eyeball is
   driven by frictional forces from three same annular stators attached
   with several piezoelectric elements. A velocity closed-loop control by
   piezoelectric element is utilized to improve the eyeball's rotational
   velocity driven by each stator. An attitude sensor is mounted in the

Abstract = {{A vision-based method is proposed in this paper for mobile robot
   localization. The proposed method mainly consists of two parts: mapping
   and localization. First, to build the map, robot moves randomly in the
   target enviroment and captures images using its camera. The SURF
   descriptor is used to extract the features of each image. Then map can
   be built with the SURF features and their positions. For the
   localization phase, a new image is obtained at each unknown position
   when the robot walks in the enviroment. SURF and FLANN are utilized to
   match the features of the new image with those in the map to infer the
   position of the robot. Besides, an improved RANSAC method is employed to
   reduce the outlier matches. Experimental results show that the proposed
   localization method performed well in both static and dynamic
   localization tasks.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, three advanced oxidation processes (AOP) were
   investigated for their capabilities to reduce petroleum hydrocarbons
   (PHC) in oily sludge. These include ultrasonic treatment alone, Fenton's
   reaction process alone, and the combination of ultrasound and Fenton's
   reaction (US/Fenton). Under the experimental conditions, the ultrasonic
   treatment and Fenton's reaction process achieved a reduction of 22.6\%
   and 13.8\% in the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), respectively.
   However, a TPH reduction of 43.1\% was observed for the combined process
   of ultrasound and Fenton's reaction, indicating that the individual AOP
   is complementary to one another. As a result, the combined process could
   be acted as a more effective method to treat oily sludge as compared to

   Inter/Intra-domain knowledge over different planes (service, control and

   captures uncertainty over the planes. A simple use-case is presented

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol heterogeneous Wireless
   Body Area Sensor Networks WBASNs); Mobility-supporting Adaptive
   Threshold-based Thermal-aware Energy-efficient Multi-hop ProTocol
   (M-ATTEMPT). A prototype is defined for employing heterogeneous sensors
   on human body. Direct communication is used for real-time traffic
   (critical data) or on-demand data while Multi-hop communication is used
   for normal data delivery. One of the prime challenges in WBASNs is
   sensing of the heat generated by the implanted sensor nodes. The
   proposed routing algorithm is thermal-aware which senses the link
   Hot-spot and routes the data away from these links. Continuous mobility
   of human body causes disconnection between previous established links.
   So, mobility support and energy-management is introduced to overcome the
   problem. Linear Programming (LP) model for maximum information
   extraction and energy consumption is presented in this study. MATLAB
   simulations of proposed routing algorithm are performed for lifetime and
   successful packet delivery in comparison with Multi-hop communication.
   The results show that the proposed routing algorithm has less energy
   consumption and more reliable as compared to Multi-hop communication.

Abstract = {{Remote healthcare system is widely used in developed and developing
   countries. Rapid development in network technologies and Sensor Web
   Enablement (SWE) provide anytime anywhere access of healthcare data. But
   Sensor Web Enablement faces challenges such as privacy, securi.ty,
   scalability etc. This paper proposes a framework that addresses above
   issues. The proposed framework comprises of Wireless Body Sensor Network
   (WBSN), Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and web services to provide
   health services to the doctors, caregivers and patients. In order to
   address the privacy issues of sensitive health data, the proposed
   framework uses role based authorization technique to formulate the rules
   and decide whether to allow or deny the user access request. The
   proposed framework has been implemented using Java. Experimental results
   show that the proposed SOA framework guarantees high quality service
   with average response time of 0.237 ms and average throughput of 87\%.

Abstract = {{Personalized security in E-banking is an important issue for many
   individuals and companies that are looking for achieving the proper
   level of security. The cloud environment is a suitable infrastructure to
   implement personalized security mechanisms for many big companies such
   as hanks. Employing mandatory access controls boosts the security of
   E-banking to a high level. Flask architecture is the security
   architecture which enforces mandatory access control that provides a
   clean separation of security policies and enforcements. In this paper,
   it a model for implementing personalized security in E-banking over a
   cloud environment is introduced. Using role-based access control models,
   the security system can be configured to provide expected level of
   security in e-payment systems employing user-defined policies for
   individuals, companies and governmental organizations. The paper focuses
   on defining such policies and how they improve the level of security.

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is to
   prolong the lifetime of network. Traditional research work focuses on
   minimizing transmit power; however, in the case of short range
   communication the consumption power in decoding is significantly larger
   than transmit power. This paper investigates the minimization of total
   power consumption by reducing the decoding power consumption. For
   achieving a desired Bit Error Rate (BER), we introduce sonic fundamental
   results on the basis of iterative message-passing algorithms for Low
   Density Parity Check Code (LDPC). To reduce energy dissipation in
   decoder, LDPC based coded communications between sensors are considered.
   Moreover, we evaluate the performance of LDPC at different code rates
   and introduce Adaptive Iterative Decoding (AID) by exploiting threshold
   on the number of iterations for a certain BER (10(-4)). In iterative
   LDPC decoding, the total energy consumption of network is reduced by 20
   - 25\%. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Geotechnical design is plagued by the uncertainty associated with site
   characterization. Common questions are ``How many samples should be
   taken?{''} and ``How do these samples reduce my uncertainty?{''} Of
   considerable interest is the question ``What site sampling plan will
   give the best cost to effectiveness ratio?{''} This papers looks
   specifically at the effect of the number of samples on residual
   uncertainty. The results can be used to quantitatively select the
   required number of samples needed to achieve a target maximum residual
   uncertainty level. To study this problem, a square domain is selected
   (the site) and a stationary Gaussian random field is simulated within
   the domain (the random soil properties). The random field is sampled at
   a series of locations and a trend is estimated from the samples. The
   trend is then removed from the random field and the residual random
   field is statistically analyzed to determine various measures of the
   effectiveness of the sampling scheme. These measures include: I) the
   variance of the residual field average (i.e. does the estimate represent
   the average?), 2) the residual standard deviation (i.e. how much
   residual uncertainty remains?), and 3) the residual correlation length
   (i.e. how does trend removal affect the perceived correlation lengths?).}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the frequency and the duration of participation
   in physical activity by children who go to school in the city of Dhaka,
   Bangladesh. The study uses data from a 2012 activity-based travel diary
   survey of 245 students in Grades 6 to 10 in the Dhaka metropolitan area.
   To explore the trade-offs between factors that affect the frequency of
   out-of-home physical activity, including the use of active
   transportation, this study used a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression
   model. Additionally, parametric hazard models were estimated to examine
   the duration of physical activities. The results of the ZIP count model
   suggest that personal and household characteristics, attributes of the
   built environment, and time commitments for other mandatory and
   discretionary activities influence the frequency of participation in
   physical activity. For example, an increase in the number of children in
   the household and the presence of sidewalks increased the frequency of
   out-of home, out-of-school physical activity if everything else was held
   equal. In contrast, travel time to school, the presence of traffic
   intersections, and the time commitment for tutoring sessions negatively
   affected participation in physical activity. lathe modeling of the
   duration of out-of-home physical activity, this study found that a
   Weibull parametric hazard model outperformed a log logistic model. The
   duration was influenced by sociodemographic characteristics, spatial
   context, and escort arrangements. For instance, car ownership and a
   parental escort increased the duration of physical activity. The paper
   offers an in-depth behavioral understanding of children's physical
   activities in a developing country.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal Bayesian networks have gained popularity as a robust technique
   to model dynamic systems in which the components' sequential dependency,
   as well as their functional dependency, cannot be ignored. In this
   regard, discrete-time Bayesian networks have been proposed as a viable
   alternative to solve dynamic fault trees without resort to Markov
   chains. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of Markov chains such as
   the state-space explosion and the error-prone conversion procedure from
   dynamic fault tree. It also benefits from the inherent advantages of
   Bayesian networks such as probability updating. However, effective
   mapping of the dynamic gates of dynamic fault trees into Bayesian
   networks while avoiding the consequent huge multi-dimensional
   probability tables has always been a matter of concern. In this paper, a
   new general formalism has been developed to model two important elements
   of dynamic fault tree, i.e., cold spare gate and sequential enforcing
   gate, with any arbitrary probability distribution functions. Also, an
   innovative Neutral Dependency algorithm has been introduced to model
   dynamic gates such as priority-AND gate, thus reducing the dimension of
   conditional probability tables by an order of magnitude. The second part
   of the paper is devoted to the application of discrete-time Bayesian
   networks in the risk assessment and safety analysis of complex process
   systems. It has been shown how dynamic techniques can effectively be
   applied for optimal allocation of safety systems to obtain maximum risk
   reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Structured mini-/microscale reactors continue to receive attention from
   both industry and academia due to their low pressure drop, high heat and
   mass transfer rates, and ease of scale-up relative to conventional
   reactor technology. Commonly considered for reactions such as
   hydrogenations, hydrodesulfurization, oxidations, and Fischer-Tropsch
   synthesis, the performance of these systems is highly dependent on
   mixing and the interfacial area between phases. While existing
   literature describes the initial flow patterns generated by a broad
   range of two-phase contactors, few studies explore the dynamic impacts
   of downstream passive mixing elements. Experimental and computational
   methodologies for characterizing two-phase flow pattern transitions,
   pressure drop, and heat and mass transfer are discussed, with relevant
   examples for serpentine and Venturi-based passive mixing designs. The
   efficacies of these two configurations are explored in the context of
   pressure drop, conditions leading to significant interface renewal, and
   design considerations for optimizing mass transfer. Challenges associate
   with the characterization of multiphase flow through these systems are
   highlighted, and strategies suggested for both experimental and
   computational analysis of dynamic flow patterns and fluid-fluid

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The strain concentration at the field joint (FJ) of the commonly used
   concrete coated offshore pipelines is considered and discussed in this
   paper. The details of a 3D finite element (FE) modeling framework,
   developed using the commercial software ABAQUS, are presented. The
   numerical results are verified against the experimental results
   available in the literature. The FE model considered in this study
   captures several nonlinear phenomena associated with the problem,
   including the plastic deformation of the steel and anticorrosion layer
   (ACL) material, the cracking and crushing of the concrete, and also the
   large deformation effects. The developed FE framework is subsequently
   used to perform a parametric study to assess the effect of each
   influencing parameter on the strain concentration factor (SCF) developed
   within the FJ region. The influence of the geometric features of the
   coated pipe and the relevant mechanical properties of the materials as
   well as various combined loading scenarios are investigated. Results
   indicate that pipeline diameter, thickness, and coating thickness affect
   the SCF more than the strength of either concrete coating or ACL. Also,
   the postyield properties of the steel, especially the strain hardening
   capacity, may significantly influence the SCF. The combination of the
   internal pressure loading (causing a biaxial stress state) or tensile
   loading with the primary bending load is found to also increase the SCF
   significantly after steel yielding is initiated. Moreover, these
   combined loading scenarios cause different and more severe plastic
   deformation patterns in the FJ. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006556]}},

Title = {{A SINGLE-OBJECT TRACKING METHOD FOR ROBOTS USING OBJECT-BASED VISUAL
   ATTENTION}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANOID ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is a quite challenging problem for robots to track the target in
   complex environment due to appearance changes of the target and
   background, large variation of motion, partial and full occlusion,
   motion of the camera and so on. However, humans are capable to cope with
   these difficulties by using their cognitive capability, mainly including
   the visual attention and learning mechanisms. This paper therefore
   presents a single-object tracking method for robots based on the
   object-based attention mechanism. This tracking method consists of four
   modules: pre-attentive segmentation, top-down attentional selection,
   post-attentive processing and online learning of the target model. The
   pre-attentive segmentation module first divides the scene into uniform
   proto-objects. Then the top-down attention module selects one
   proto-object over the predicted region by using a discriminative feature
   of the target. The post-attentive processing module then validates the
   attended proto-object. If it is confirmed to be the target, it is used
   to obtain the complete target region. Otherwise, the recovery mechanism
   is automatically triggered to globally search for the target. Given the
   complete target region, the online learning algorithm autonomously
   updates the target model, which consists of appearance and saliency
   components. The saliency component is used to automatically select a
   discriminative feature for top-down attention, while the appearance
   component is used for bias estimation in the top-down attention module
   and validation in the post-attentive processing module. Experiments have
   shown that this proposed method outperforms other algorithms without
   using attention for tracking a single target in cluttered and
   dynamically changing environment.}},

Title = {{Effects of Reactor Design on the Torrefaction of Biomass}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Torrefied biomass is a green alternative to coal, and thus the interest
   in the torrefaction process is rising fast. Different manufacturers are
   offering different patented designs of torrefier with data on varying
   operating and process conditions each claiming their superiority over
   others. The choice of torrefaction technology has become exceptionally
   difficult because of a near absence of a comparative assessment of
   different types of reactors on a common base. This work attempts to fill
   this important knowledge gap in torrefaction technology by reviewing
   available types of reactors, and comparing their torrefaction
   performance common basis and examining the commercial implication of
   reactor choice. After reviewing available patent and technologies
   offered, torrefiers are classified broadly under two generic groups:
   indirectly heated and directly heated. Four generic types of reactors,
   convective heating, fluidized bed, rotating drum and microwave reactor
   were studied in this research. Convective and fluidized beds have direct
   heating, rotating reactors has indirect heating while microwave involves
   a volumetric heating (a subgroup of direct heating) mechanism. A
   standard sample of biomass (25 mm diameter x 64 mm long poplar wood) was
   torrefied in each of these types of reactors under identical conditions.
   The mass yield, energy density and energy yield of the wood after
   torrefaction were measured and compared. Rotating drum achieved lowest
   mass yield but highest energy density. The difference between two direct
   heating, convective heating and fluidized beds was small. Microwave
   provided only localized torrefaction in this series of tests. Indirectly
   heated reactors might be suitable for a plant near the biomass source
   while directly heated plant would give better value at the user end.

Abstract = {{Regression surface modeling has been applied to examine and predict the
   network connectivity (NC), thermal properties and radiopacity of a
   series of La2O3-TiO2 doped zinc-silicate (Zn-Si) bioglasses. The
   objective of this work is to provide new regression models based on a
   design of mixture (DOM) approach for predicting the NC, thermal
   responses and radiopacity for phosphate free, Zn-Si bioglasses that
   include variable ratios of SiO2, ZnO, La2O3 and TiO2. To ensure a
   comprehensive examination of the composition-property relationships, the
   experimental design varied the ratios of SiO2, ZnO, La2O3 and TiO2
   within the glass network. Regression models were deployed to analyze
   data derived from NC calculations, differential scanning calorimetry and
   axial CT scans. It was observed that, for the glasses examined, the NC
   ranged from 2.41 to 2.83. The observed values of glass transition
   temperature (T-g) ranged from 597 to 690 degrees C and for the first
   point of crystallization temperature (T-p(1)) it was observed that the
   values ranged from 620 to 700 degrees C. Both T-g and T-p(1) regression
   models predominantly showed that an increase in La2O3 (at the expense of
   ZnO) results in an increase of both thermal properties. In addition,
   increasing the La2O3/ZnO ratio is also observed to result in a shift
   towards achieving higher levels of radiopacity. In general, regression
   modeling of the radiopacity data indicated that increased loadings of
   La2O3, TiO2 and ZnO are required at the expense of SiO2 in order to
   increase the radiopaque nature of the glasses. The application of this
   methodology provides a more statistically robust approach over existing
   models that exist in the literature for predicting the properties of
   multi-component zinc-silicates doped with La2O3 and TiO2. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{We have developed a high-frequency pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound probe
   as a promising minimally-invasive technique for measuring intracochlear
   mechanics without damaging the cochlea. Using a custom high-frequency
   ultrasound system, we have measured dynamic motion of intracochlear
   structures by recording the pulsed-wave Doppler signal resulting from
   the vibration of the basilar and round window membranes. A 45 MHz
   needle-mounted Doppler probe was fabricated and placed against the round
   window membranes of eight different fresh human temporal bones.
   Pulsed-wave ultrasonic Doppler measurements were performed on the
   basilar membrane and round window membrane during the application of
   pure tones to the external ear canal. Doppler vibrational information
   for acoustic input frequencies ranging from 100-2000 Hz was collected
   and normalized to the sound pressure in the ear canal. The middle ear
   resonance, located at approximately 1000 Hz, could be characterized from
   the membrane velocities, which agreed well with literature values. The
   maximum normalized mean velocity of the round window and the basilar
   membrane were 180 mu m/s/Pa and 27 mu m/s/Pa at 800 Hz. The mean phase
   difference between the membrane displacements and the applied ear canal
   sound pressure showed a flat response almost up to 500 Hz where it began
   to accumulate. This is the first study that reports the application of
   high frequency pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound for measuring the
   vibration of basilar membrane through the round window. Since it is not
   required to open or damage the cochlea, this technique might be
   applicable for investigating cochlear dynamics, in vivo. (E-mail:

Volume = {{107}},

Abstract = {{Carnivora includes three independent evolutionary transitions to the
   marine environment: pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), sea
   otters, and polar bears. Among these, only the pinnipeds have retained
   two forms of insulation, an external fur layer and an internal blubber
   layer for keeping warm in water. In this study we investigated key
   factors associated with the transition to the use of blubber, by
   comparing blubber characteristics among the pinnipeds. Characteristics
   included gross morphology (blubber thickness), fat composition (fatty
   acid profiles, percentage lipid, and water), and thermal conductivity.
   Sea lions, phocids, and walrus, which have lower fur densities than fur
   seals, have thicker blubber layers than fur seals (P?<?0.001).
   Comparisons of lipid content, water content, and fatty acid composition
   indicated significant differences in the composition of the inner and
   outer regions of the blubber between groups (P?<?0.001), consistent with
   the hypothesis that phocids and sea lions utilize the outer layer of
   their blubber primarily for thermal insulation, and the inner layer for
   energy storage. Fur seals, by contrast, rely more on their fur for
   thermal insulation, and utilize their blubber layer primarily for energy
   storage. Comparing across carnivore species, differences in total
   insulation (fur and/or blubber) are influenced substantially by body
   size and habitat, and to a lesser extent by latitudinal climate.
   Overall, these results indicate consistent evolutionary trends in the
   transition to blubber and evidence for convergent evolution of thermal
   traits across lineages. (C) 2012 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {{Despite its many health benefits, many consumers avoid fish oil
   supplements due to fishy tastes and odors. Common chemical measures of
   oxidation have little correlation with sensory properties, making it
   difficult to determine the sensory quality of fish oil without the use
   of an expensive sensory panel. Here we investigate an alternative method
   to assess oxidation using solid phase microextraction and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fish oils containing different amounts
   of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were oxidized, and
   headspace volatiles were monitored over time and compared to sensory
   evaluations by a taste panel. Peroxide value and anisidine value were
   also measured. Sensory panel scores and headspace volatile data were
   analyzed using principal component analysis and linear regression to
   identify key volatiles responsible for changes in sensory degradation of
   oils over time. A total of eight compounds were identified, primarily
   aldehydes and ketones. By monitoring these volatiles, it may be possible
   to create a simple method to assess oxidation in fish oils that
   correlates well with sensory properties of the oil without the use of a
   sensory panel.}},

   in vertical methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Accurate estimates of stage-dependent mortality rates are critical for
   understanding zooplankton dynamics. Existing methods for estimating
   mortality from survey data include assumptions that are not always
   evident, meaning practitioners may be unaware of errors or whether a
   particular method is appropriate for their data. Here, a quantitative
   analysis of three vertical (single time point) methods is conducted to
   help improve confidence in mortality estimates. The underlying theory is
   reviewed to clarify assumptions and sources of error. The Basic method
   propagates errors. the Ratio method smoothes stage-to-stage variation,
   and the Alternative method is unrealistic when rates are constant.
   Contrary to perception, all three methods neglect the influence of
   advection. Application to field data for Calanus finmarchicus in the
   Northwest Atlantic illustrates dependence of estimates on input
   variables and choice of method. Variation among methods was generally
   smaller than that caused by uncertainty in physiological rates, and
   frequent violations of assumptions common to all methods seriously
   limited their utility. Simulations with an individual-based model reveal
   unacceptable sensitivity for the Basic method, whereas Ratio and
   Alternative methods are relatively robust except for dynamic or
   advective environments. Recommendations are given regarding ways to
   detect whether these methods can be applied to survey data, as well as
   to assess uncertainty. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{411-440}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper summarizes and reviews the findings of our research on AM60B
   magnesium alloy conducted in past 8 years. It essentially covers three
   categories: microstructural study, environmental effect, and fatigue
   crack growth rate of AM60B. The experimental and numerical studies on
   the influence of casting defects on this particular material's
   properties are reviewed in the first part. It has been shown that the
   non-uniform solidification of the casting results in variations of the
   microstructure in different layers (skin and core) of the alloy which
   affects the mechanical properties in those regions. Moreover, the
   influence of microstructure on fatigue crack initiation and propagation
   response of the alloy is presented. The influence of several casting
   defects on the failure mechanism of the material are also numerically
   analyzed and discussed. The influence of elevated and cold temperatures
   on the fatigue response of the alloy is reviewed in the second part. Our
   findings show that the temperature does not have a significant effect on
   the number of cycles to failure. However, but at some stress level, this
   effect cannot be dismissed. The fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR)
   response of the alloy at a wide range of stress ratios is also
   investigated in the last part. The FCGR of the alloy showed a noticeable
   dependency on the stress ratio. A model is proposed for estimating the
   FCGR of the alloy, which could provide a good prediction of alloy's FCGR
   over a wide range of negative and positive stress ratios. The integrity
   of the new model is also compared against other models. Finally, the
   influence of compressive loading on fatigue life of the specimens under
   constant and random amplitude cyclic loading is investigated
   experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of powder composition on in situ TiC formation
   within an Fe-based matrix coating during laser cladding was studied.
   Different atomic ratios of C:Ti (45\% and 55\%) were selected in order
   to adjust the matrix from an Fe-Ti-based composition to an Fe-C-based
   one. Fe percentages of 70, 60, 50 and 10 wt\% were explored to increase
   the volume fraction of TiC in the clad. Results showed that chemical
   composition affects the TiC morphology as well as the TiC distribution
   and hardness profile in the clad. By increasing the C: Ti ratio from 45
   at\% to 55 at\%, the volume fraction of the formed TiC increases. A
   higher volume fraction of TiC in the clad resulted in increases clad
   hardness. SEM and EDS analyses were used to characterize the phases in
   the clad, while increasing the C ratio promoted the formation of excess
   graphite in the Fe matrix. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Quantification of Hemodynamic Parameters Downstream of a Gianturco
   Zenith Stent Wire Using Newtonian and Non-Newtonian Analog Fluids in a
   Pulsatile Flow Environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Although deployed in the vasculature to expand vessel diameter and
   improve blood flow, protruding stent struts can create complex flow
   environments associated with flow separation and oscillating shear
   gradients. Given the association between magnitude and direction of wall
   shear stress (WSS) and endothelial phenotype expression, accurate
   representation of stent-induced flow patterns is critical if we are to
   predict sites susceptible to intimal hyperplasia. Despite the number of
   stents approved for clinical use, quantification on the alteration of
   hemodynamic flow parameters associated with the Gianturco Z-stent is
   limited in the literature. In using experimental and computational
   models to quantify strut-induced flow, the majority of past work has
   assumed blood or representative analogs to behave as Newtonian fluids.
   However, recent studies have challenged the validity of this assumption.
   We present here the experimental quantification of flow through a
   Gianturco Z-stent wire in representative Newtonian and non-Newtonian
   blood analog environments using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Fluid
   analogs were circulated through a closed flow loop at physiologically
   appropriate flow rates whereupon PIV snapshots were acquired downstream
   of the wire housed in an acrylic tube with a diameter characteristic of
   the carotid artery. Hemodynamic parameters including WSS, oscillatory
   shear index (OSI), and Reynolds shear stresses (RSS) were measured. Our
   findings show that the introduction of the stent wire altered downstream
   hemodynamic parameters through a reduction in WSS and increases in OSI
   and RSS from nonstented flow. The Newtonian analog solution of glycerol
   and water underestimated WSS while increasing the spatial coverage of
   flow reversal and oscillatory shear compared to a non-Newtonian fluid of
   glycerol, water, and xanthan gum. Peak RSS were increased with the
   Newtonian fluid, although peak values were similar upon a doubling of
   flow rate. The introduction of the stent wire promoted the development
   of flow patterns that are susceptible to intimal hyperplasia using both
   Newtonian and non-Newtonian analogs, although the magnitude of sites
   affected downstream was appreciably related to the rheological behavior
   of the analog. While the assumption of linear viscous behavior is often
   appropriate in quantifying flow in the largest arteries of the
   vasculature, the results presented here suggest this assumption
   overestimates sites susceptible to hyperplasia and restenosis in flow
   characterized by low and oscillatory shear. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007746]}},

   management tool in wild blueberry. The potential of visible (VIS), near
   infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy was evaluated
   during 2006 (sprout/vegetative phase of production) to estimate foliar
   nitrogen (N). Canopy reflectance measurements were taken from two
   nutrient management experimental sites located in Nova Scotia (NS) and
   New Brunswick (NB). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) estimated
   foliar N, giving the coefficients of determination (R-2) values ranging
   from 0.69 to 0.85, and root mean square errors of cross validation
   (RMSECV) from 0.16\% (+/- 8.29\% of mean) to 0.24\% (+/- 12.43\% of
   mean) for different spectral ranges used in this study. The green peak
   region located in the VIS region best estimated foliar N. The tested
   spectral ranges differed in their predictive ability, but generally
   followed the biochemical basis. Variable importance in projection scores
   (VIP), regression vector coefficients and PLSR loading weights (LWs)
   plots highlight the importance of wavebands (similar to 550 nm, similar
   to 610 nm, 1510 nm, similar to 1690 nm, similar to 1730 nm, similar to
   1980 nm and similar to 2030 nm) for in situ foliar N estimations. Thus,
   it was concluded that reflectance spectra may be used to estimate and
   ultimately map foliar N in wild blueberry production. The results
   illustrated the ability of multivariate techniques, such as PLSR to
   explore hyperspectral data and estimate leaf tissue nutrient content.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of non-scattering domains (voids) is an area of active
   research in biomedical optics. To avoid complexities of image
   reconstruction algorithms and requirements of a priori knowledge of void
   locations inherent to diffuse optical tomography (DOT), it would be
   useful to establish specific experimental signatures of voids that would
   help identify and detect them by other means. To address this, we
   present a radiance-based spectro-angular mapping approach that
   identifies void locations in the angular domain and establishes their
   spectral features. Using water-filled capillaries in scattering
   Intralipid as a test platform, we demonstrate perturbations in the
   directional photon density distribution produced by individual voids.

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{936-942}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gait biomechanical variables have been associated with total
   knee arthroplasty tibial implant migration measured with
   Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA), but no studies have examined the role
   of the periarticular musculature, which is responsible for a high
   proportion of the forces on the joint. The purpose of this study was to
   measure the pre-operative electromyography (EMG) patterns of the
   periarticular knee muscles during gait and determine the association of
   these patterns with the post-operative tibial implant migration measured
   with RSA. We hypothesized that pre-operative muscle activation patterns
   (specifically the activation patterns of the vastus and gastrocnemius
   muscle groups) measured with EMG are associated with migration at 6
   months.
   Methods: Electromyographic data were collected from 6 periarticular knee
   joint muscles on 37 patients pre-operatively during gait.
   Radiostereometric exams were performed immediately and at 6 months
   post-operatively. Relationships between the pre-operative patterns of
   muscle activation and micromotion of the implant were examined using
   Pearson correlation and regression models.
   Findings: Statistically significant correlations were found between the
   pattern of the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle activations during
   gait and implant translation in the posterior direction. Regression
   analysis illustrated that a substantial proportion of the variance in
   the post-operative tibial component posterior translation (R2 = 0.49)
   was explained by a prolonged activation of the vastus medialis muscle
   and higher activation of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle during early
   stance.
   Interpretation: The variability in migration explained by the muscle
   activation patterns supports the hypothesis that pre-operative
   functional characteristics can contribute to predicting implant
   migration following total knee arthroplasty surgery. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Spirometry is insensitive to small airway
   abnormalities in asthma. Our objective was to evaluate regional lung
   structure and function using hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) before, during and after a methacholine challenge (MCh).
   Methods: Twenty-five asthmatics (mean age = 34 +/- 11 years) and eight
   healthy volunteers (HV) (mean age = 33 +/- 11 years) underwent
   spirometry, plethysmography and hyperpolarized He-3 MRI prior to a MCh.
   MRI was repeated following the MCh and again 25 min after salbutamol
   administration. He-3 MRI gas distribution was quantified using
   semiautomated segmentation of the ventilation defect percent (VDP).
   Tissue microstructure was measured using the He-3 apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC). Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used
   to evaluate changes at each time point as well as to determine
   interactions between regions of interest (ROI) and subject group.
   Pearson's correlations were performed to evaluate associations between
   He-3 MRI measurements and established clinical measures.
   Results: In asthmatics, but not HV, whole-lung ADC was increased
   post-MCh (P < 0.01). In asthmatics only, ADC was increased post-MCh in
   posterior ROI (P < 0.01) and all ROI in the superior-inferior direction
   (P < 0.01). VDP was increased in posterior and inferior ROI (P < 0.001).
   There was a correlation between VDP and specific airway resistance (r =
   0.74, P < 0.0001), dyspnoea score (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and fractional
   exhaled nitric oxide (r = 0.45, P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: We evaluated the regional pulmonary response to
   methacholine and salbutamol using 3He MRI and showed heterogeneous VDP
   and ADC consistent with bronchoconstriction and gas trapping,
   respectively, post-MCh. These regional alterations resolved
   post-salbutamol.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Obesity is a highly cited risk factor for knee osteoarthritis
   (OA), but its role in knee OA pathogenesis and progression is not as
   clear. Excess weight may contribute to an increased mechanical burden
   and altered dynamic movement and loading patterns at the knee. The
   objective of this study was to examine the interacting role of moderate
   knee OA disease presence and obesity on knee joint mechanics during
   gait.
   Methods: Gait analysis was performed on 104 asymptomatic and 140
   individuals with moderate knee OA. Each subject group was divided into
   three body mass categories based on body mass index (BMI): healthy
   weight (BMI <25), overweight (25 <= BMI <= 30), and obese (BMI > 30).
   Three-dimensional knee joint angles and net external knee joint moments
   were calculated and waveform principal component analysis (PCA) was
   applied to extract major patterns of variability from each. PC scores
   for major patterns were compared between groups using a two-factor
   ANOVA.
   Results: Significant BMI main effects were found in the pattern of the
   knee adduction moment, the knee flexion moment, and the knee rotation
   moment during gait. Two interaction effects between moderate OA disease
   presence and BMI were also found that described different changes in the
   knee flexion moment and the knee flexion angle with increased BMI with
   and without knee OA.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that increased BMI is associated with
   different changes in biomechanical patterns of the knee joint during
   gait depending on the presence of moderate knee OA. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Novel composite microspheres were synthesized by thermally induced phase

   quasi-statically (paced by the pore fluid diffusion) or dynamically. In
   this work, we consider a prestressed fault with a locally peaked,
   diffusively spreading pore pressure field to study (1) conditions
   leading to the escalation of slip and nucleation of dynamic rupture and
   (2) rupture run-out distance before it is arrested. Nucleation appears
   in this model when the fault friction decreases from its peak value with
   slip, while arrest of dynamic propagation is imminent on aseismic faults
   (i.e., such that prestress tau(b) is less than the residual fault
   strength tau(r) at ambient conditions). When fluid overpressure is a
   small-to-moderate fraction of the ambient value of normal effective
   stress (and prestress is large enough for fault slip to be activated by
   overpressure), dynamic rupture always nucleates, and the nucleation
   length increases with decreasing prestress practically independently of
   the overpressure value. Transition from the ultimately unstable (tau(b)
   > tau(r)) to the ultimately stable (tau(b) < tau(r)) fault loading is
   marked by a strong increase of the nucleation length (proportional to
   1/(tau(b) - tau(r))(2)) as tau(b) approaches tau(r) from above. For
   aseismic faults (tau(b) < tau(r)), no dynamic rupture is nucleated at
   large fluid overpressures for all but the smallest values of prestress.
   The largest run-out distances of dynamic slip on aseismic faults
   correspond to overpressure/prestress just sufficient for slip
   activation. In such cases, the dynamically accumulated slip can lead to
   enhanced, dynamic fault weakening, resulting in a sustained dynamic
   rupture and generating a large earthquake. This is consistent with field
   observations when the largest injection-induced seismicity occurred
   after fluid injection ended.}},

   materials in Li-ion batteries. The sputtered samples were found to be
   amorphous/nanostructured and had a greater degree of atomic intermixing
   in comparison to the milled sample, which was more crystalline. Samples
   were incorporated as electrodes in Li-half cells and had a capacity of
   about 400 mAh g(-1). Significant capacity loss was observed beginning
   near the 50th cycle for the mechanically milled sample, while little
   capacity loss was observed for the sputtered samples after 100 cycles.
   Despite its good cycling performance, amorphous Cu6Sn5 + C was found to
   crystallize as Li is cycled, resulting in the aggregation of Cu6Sn5
   grains. Structural changes during lithiation and delithiation as well as
   the evolution of the electrochemistry are compared and contrasted for

Abstract = {{Concentrations of eight heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, and
   As) in the muscles of ten species of fish collected from Bangshi River
   at Savar in Bangladesh were measured in two different seasons. The
   concentrations of the studied heavy metals, except Pb in Corica soborna,
   were found to be below the safe limits suggested by various authorities
   and thus gave no indication of pollution. The present study also showed
   that, Zn was the most and Cd was the least accumulated metal in the
   studied fish muscles. ANOVA analysis clearly revealed that there was a
   significant variation (Cl = 95\%) of the heavy metal concentrations in
   different fish species in the Bangshi River. Significant positive
   correlations between the heavy metal concentrations in fish muscles were
   also observed in both seasons. From the human health point of view, this
   study showed that there was no possible health risk to consumers due to
   intake of studied fishes under the current consumption rate. Crown

Abstract = {{A purely numerical parametric study of 24 flow-through rockfill dam
   geometries was conducted. The nonlinear nature of the p-LaPlacian-like
   partial differential equation was dealt with using a finite-difference
   scheme that directly incorporated the exponent of a power law that
   replaced Darcy's law. Convergence, use of specialty nodes, nodal
   density, and boundary condition effects were quantitatively
   investigated. The flow-field angle of the toe was found to be a useful
   starting point in studying the potential for unraveling failure. Factors
   of safety (FS) against this type of failure are then presented for a
   range of downstream slopes, thus showing which combinations of slope and
   particle diameter are unsafe. It is shown that the FS tends to drop
   below unity under the seepage face primarily because of the strength of
   the exit gradient near the toe of the structure and secondarily because
   of the overflow velocity. It is hoped that the techniques and results
   presented will facilitate the design and assessment of flow-through
   rockfill structures. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   achieve much better bit error rate. Furthermore, the proposed SL
   technique has the same NBI mitigation performance as the Teager-Kaiser

Abstract = {{Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are frequently used for deep-water
   ocean applications such as surveying and cable laying, where accurate
   control of vehicle depth and attitude is needed. The water level in the
   onboard ballast tanks is typically manually set for neutral buoyancy
   before each mission, while the vehicle is on the surface. The ballast
   tank contents are not normally adjusted to control vehicle depth and
   orientation while the AUV is in operation. As a result, vehicle
   trajectory and orientation is exclusively controlled using the vehicle's
   control surfaces during a mission. The challenges with controlling the
   depth and trim of an underwater vehicle include nonlinear hydrodynamic
   forces, as well as inherent time delays (latencies) associated with
   water tank level changes and valve adjustments. Furthermore, small
   changes in the location of the vehicle's center of gravity (i.e., due to
   the deployment of the AUV's payload equipment) can reduce the control
   authority of the AUV's control surfaces. To meet these challenges, this
   paper proposes two unique variable ballast system (VBS) control
   approaches. The first proposed VBS controller changes the weight of the
   AUV to help control vehicle depth and vertical (inertial) velocity. The
   second proposed VBS controller attempts to shift the center of gravity
   along the body-fixed -(longitudinal)-axis to reduce depth and pitch
   angle error while restoring control authority to the bowplane and
   sternplane deflection fins. The ballasting system consists of two water
   tanks positioned aft and forward of amidships. The ballast tanks are
   then automatically filled or emptied of ocean water as desired.
   Numerical simulations have been carried out on a 2-D underwater vehicle
   simulator to test and compare the performance of the proposed ballast
   and fin deflection control systems. The simulation results show that,
   for the assumptions and conditions tested, the proposed controllers are
   capable of achieving a setpoint depth and pitch angle with minimal error
   by effectively utilizing the ballast tanks and deflection fins. As a
   result, the work presented in this paper helps increase the autonomy of

Abstract = {{A new convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) is proposed and
   implemented in one-step leapfrog alternately direction-implicit
   finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method. Different from the
   previous developed perfectly matched layers (PMLs) used in the ADI-FDTD
   methods, the proposed PML has the same form as that used for the
   conventional FDTD method, requiring only one-step computations of the
   CPML auxiliary quantities. Stability of the proposed CPML is verified
   semianalytically and its high absorption efficiency is proven
   numerically. The proposed CPML is then applied to a number of
   applications; they include radiation generated by a current source in
   free space, propagating and evanescent modes in a rectangular waveguide,
   and transient current prediction on an aircraft that is modeled with a
   numerical grid of 402 x 48 x 262. Accurate results have been obtained in
   comparison with the results obtained with the other methods.}},

   2012. First published August 10, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00845.2011.-There is growing evidence that heart
   valves are not passive structures but can remodel with left ventricular
   dysfunction. To determine if these tissues remodel under nonpathological
   conditions, we examined the mirtal valve anterior leaflet during the
   volume loading and cardiac expansion of pregnancy using a bovine model.
   We measured leaflet dimensions, chordal attachments, and biaxial
   mechanical properties of leaflets collected from never-pregnant heifers
   and pregnant cows (pregnancy duration estimated from fetal length).
   Hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) tests were performed to assess the
   denaturation temperature (T-d) associated with collagen molecular
   stability and the load decay half-time (t(1//2)) associated with
   intermolecular cross-linking. Histological changes were examined using
   Verhoeff-van Gieson and picrosirius red staining with polarized light.
   We observed striking changes to the structure and material properties of
   the mitral anterior leaflet during pregnancy. Leaflet area was increased
   33\%, with a surprising increase (nearly 25\%) in chordae tendinae
   attachments. There was a biphasic change in leaflet extensibility: it
   rapidly decreased by 30\% and then reversed to prepregnant values by
   late pregnancy. The 2 degrees C decrease in T-d in pregnancy was
   indicative of collagen remodeling, whereas the 70\% increase in HIT
   t(1/2) indicated an increase in collagen cross-linking. Finally,
   histological results suggested transient increases in leaflet thickness
   and transient decreases in collagen crimp. This remodeling may
   compensate for the increased loading conditions associated with
   pregnancy by normalizing leaflet stress and maintaining coaptation.
   Understanding the mechanisms of mitral valve physiological remodeling in
   pregnancy could contribute to alternative treatments of pathological
   remodeling associated with left ventricular dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Degradable, bioceramic bone implants made of calcium polyphosphate (CPP)
   hold potential for controlled release of therapeutic agents in the
   treatment of localized bone disease. Magnetic resonance imaging
   techniques for non-invasively mapping fluid distribution, T-1 and T-2
   relaxation times and the apparent diffusion coefficient were performed
   in conjunction with a drug elution protocol to resolve free and bound
   water components within the material microstructure in two CPP
   formulations (G1 and G2). The T-2 maps provided the most accurate
   estimates of free and bound water, and showed that G1 disks contained a
   detectable free water component at all times, with drug release
   dominated by a Fickian diffusion mechanism. Drug release from G2 disks
   was characterized by a combined diffusional/structural relaxation
   mechanism, which may be related to the gradual infiltration of a free
   water component associated with swelling and/or chemical degradation.

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) fractionation of French River water (Nova
   Scotia, Canada) was performed at an integrated membrane system employing
   ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) for water treatment. An
   attempt was made to evaluate this surface water and the effect of UF
   treatment on disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor removal. Each NOM
   fraction was assessed in terms of trihalomethane and haloacetic acid
   formation potential. The NOM fractionation was performed by separation
   into six fractions: hydrophobic acid (HOA), base (HOB) and neutral (HON)
   and hydrophilic acid (HIA), base (HIS) and neutral CHIN). The raw water
   was found to be mostly comprised of HIN (approximately 50\%) and HOA
   (approximately 35\%). Upon treatment with UF, 66\% of the DOC was
   removed. The key finding of this work was that the HOA fraction was the
   main contributor to DBP formation potential. Removal of 93\% of the HOA
   components through UF treatment resulted in a reduction of
   trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation potential of 54 and 30\%,
   respectively, despite the fact that HOA comprised 35\% of the NOM in the
   raw water. The results also showed that the UF component of the system
   contributes to the overall DBP precursor removal at this full-scale
   plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   (2.4-3.4\%), and para-cymene (0.8-3.1\%) were highest at the shortest DT
   (1.5 to 5 min) and decreased with increasing DT. Cis-sabinene hydrate
   (0.5-0.97\%) and linalool plus trans-sabinene (0.56-1.6\%) reached
   maximum levels at 40 min DT. Maximum concentrations of limonene
   (2.3-2.8\%) and pregeijerene-B (0.06-1.4\%) were obtained at 360-480 min

   (0.06-1.65\%), elemol (0-6.0\%), and 8-alpha-acetoxyelemol (0-4.4\%)
   reached maximum at 840 min DT. The yield of the essential oil
   constituents increased with increasing DT. Only linalool/transsabinene
   hydrate reached a maximum yield at 360 min DT. Maximum yields of the
   following constituents were obtained at 720 min DT: alpha-thujene,
   alpha-pinene, camphene, sabinene, myrcene, alpha-terpinene, para-cimene,
   limonene, gamma-terpinene, terpinolene, and 4-terpinenol. At 840 min DT,
   cis-sabinene hydrate, prejeijerene-B, gamma muurolene, delta-cadinene,
   reached maximum. At 960 min DT, maximum yields of beta-pinene, elemol,
   alphaeudesmol/betaeudesmol, 8-alpha-acetoxyelemol were reached. These
   changes were adequately modeled by either the Michaelis-Menten or the
   Power (Convex) nonlinear regression models. Oils from the 480 min DT
   showed higher antioxidant activity compared to samples collected at 40,
   160, or 960 min DT. These results show the potential for obtaining
   essential oils with various compositions and antioxidant capacity from
   male J. scopulorum by varying DT. This study can be used as a reference

   method was applied in order to account for the large amount of latent
   energy stored during melting of the PCM and the moving interface between
   the solid and liquid phases. The effects of increasing the number and
   distribution of fins on the melting rate of the PCM were studied for
   configurations having between 0 and 27 fins for heat transfer fluid
   (HTF) velocities of 0.05 and 0.5 m/s. Results show that the overall heat
   transfer rate to the PCM increases with an increase in the number of
   fins irrespective of the HTF velocity. It was also observed that the
   total amount of energy stored after 12 h increases nearly linearly with
   the addition of fins up to 12 fins; further addition of fins increasing
   the total energy stored by ever smaller amounts.}},

Abstract = {{A regional energy system consists of diverse forms of energy.
   Energy-related issues such as utilization of renewable energy and
   reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are confronting decision
   makers. Meanwhile, various uncertainties and dynamics of the energy
   system are posing difficulties for the energy system planning,
   especially for those under multiple stages. In this study, an interval
   multi-stage stochastic programming regional energy systems planning
   model (IMSP-REM) was developed to support regional energy systems
   management and GHG control under uncertainty. The IMSP-REM is a hybrid
   methodology of inexact optimization and multi-stage stochastic
   programming. Not only can it handle uncertainties presented as intervals
   and probability density functions but also reflect dynamics of system
   conditions over multiple planning stages. The developed IMSP-REM was
   applied to a hypothetical regional energy system. The results indicate
   that the IMSP-REM can effectively reflect issues of GHG reduction and
   renewable energy utilization within an energy system planning framework.
   In addition, the model has advantages in incorporating multiple
   uncertainties and dynamics within energy management systems. Copyright

Abstract = {{Phenolic compounds are widely distributed in the natural environment,
   typically existing as a mixture at the nanogram or microgram per liter
   level. Among the phenolic compounds, 4-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol,
   bisphenol A and 2,4-dichlorophenol attract the most concern due to their
   abundance and risks within the natural environment. The former three
   chemicals are known as endocrine disruptors causing feminization in
   various organisms, whereas the latter one requires further clarification
   concerning its feminization effect. This study aims to evaluate the
   combined effects of these chemicals using vitellogenin protein induction
   in male juvenile goldfish Carassius auratus as an endpoint after 15 days
   of exposure. The results showed that all these chemicals can induce
   vitellogenin with a relative potency of 4-t-octylphenol > bisphenol A >
   4-nonylphenol a parts per thousand << 2,4-dichlorophenol.
   2,4-dichlorophenol showed a very weak estrogenic effect with an
   induction of vitellogenin concentration of < 1 \% of positive control,
   and it is therefore omitted in further tests to evaluate their combined
   effect. The other three chemicals were mixed in two ways, at an
   equipotent ratio and at an equal environmental level ratio, and their
   combined effects were evaluated with both the toxicity units method and
   concentration addition model. The resulting effect of exposure to both
   mixtures showed that these chemicals generally exhibited an additive
   effect. The ecological risk of phenolic chemicals may therefore be
   underestimated if based on the presence of single chemicals whereas
   their combined effects warrant further consideration.}},

   growth rate of aluminum alloy under the influence of compressive stress
   cycles}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To date, most of the studies conducted on fatigue life estimation of
   structural components have focused on the Constant Amplitude Loading
   (CAL) scenarios. However, very few structures in the real world
   experience such a loading condition, and most structural components
   undergo a Variable Amplitude Loading (VAL) during their service life. It
   is also observed that most of the available fatigue crack growth (FCC)
   models ignore the influence of the compressive stresses, despite the
   fact that recent studies have highlighted the detrimental effect of
   compressive stress cycles (CSCs) on the FCC of materials.
   In this paper, a VAL stress-time history is used to study the fatigue
   response of 6061-T651 aluminum alloy, with a focus on the compressive
   portion of the stress time history. An experimental investigation is
   conducted to assess the influence VAL, in particular, the influence of
   the CSC on FCC of the material. In the tests, the tensile portion of the
   stress-time history was kept unchanged, while the compressive portion of
   the stress-time history were varied by various scaling factors. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the compressive stress portion of
   the applied load has a significant influence on the overall fatigue life
   of the material. It is observed that even introducing a few number of
   small CSC into the stress-time history can significantly decrease the
   fatigue life of the material.
   In addition, the influence of the CSC is also examined by means of a
   microscopic evaluation of crack surfaces' roughness. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fugitive emissions are among the major concerns of industrial process
   releases. The emissions cause problem to various aspects including the
   environment, health, and economic. Early evaluation of process hazards
   is beneficial because process can be made inherently benign at lower
   cost. This paper discusses two important aspects of fugitive emissions
   assessment during process design - the quantification and the prevention
   strategies.
   For the quantification part, three methods are presented for fugitive
   emissions estimation during the process design. They are tailored to
   data available in simple process flow diagram (PFD), detailed PFD, and
   piping \& instrumentation diagram (PID). Such methods are needed as
   early emissions estimation allows production routes and process designs
   with lower emissions to be selected. The fugitive emissions estimation
   and methods to abatement are demonstrated on a benzene process case
   study. Valves are found to be the major emission source with 50\% of
   fugitive emissions of process area in a base case of petrochemical
   process, in which no fugitive emission reductions are yet made. Pumps
   without mechanical seals come second with 30\% and flanges with 8\% of
   emissions. Inherently safer design keywords can be applied to prevent
   fugitive emissions in the process plants. Substitution is the most
   applicable keyword in fugitive emission reduction of existing plants.
   The emission rate calculations together with estimation of health risk
   give a sound background for the decision making on elimination of
   emissions at source through equipment and piping changes. The case study
   presented reveals that by substituting emission prone components by
   inherently low-leaking ones, the plant emissions can be reduced over
   90\% in practice. This is created mainly by replacing rising stem valves
   with ball valves, installing double mechanical pump seals or hermetic
   pumps and making changes in sampling and relief systems. Ideally by also
   changing flanges to welded connections, which is not viable for various
   reasons, the emissions could be reduced nearly to zero. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this work, a biomass processing facility is designed and simulated
   for the annual conversion of 77 ktons of sunflower residue into
   electricity and activated carbon. The residue is initially pyrolized to
   produce low hydrocarbon gases (35 wt\%), bio-oils (30 wt\%), and char
   (35 wt\%). The gases and bio-oils are separated and combusted to
   generate high pressure steam, electricity, and steam for conversion of
   char into activated carbon. Assuming 35\% of the char's mass is lost
   during activation, the proposed process produces 15.6 ktons activated
   carbon and 5.5 ktons ash annually, while generating 10.2 MW of
   electricity. Economic analysis of the proposed facility yielded capital
   costs of \$31.64 million, annual operating costs of \$31.58 million, and
   a yearly gross revenue of \$38.9 million. A discounted payback period of
   6.1 years was determined for the current design, extending to 10 years
   if the facility were operated at 75\% capacity. While the proposed
   process appears to be economically viable, profitability is highly
   sensitive to the selling price of electricity and activated carbon,
   highlighting the need for additional research into the pyrolysis reactor
   design, char/ash separation techniques, and the quality of activated
   carbon obtained using char from sunflower residue pyrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a prognostics model to estimate the Mean Residual
   Life of Rail Wagon Bearings within certain confidence intervals. The
   prognostics model is constructed using a Proportional Hazards approach,
   informed by imperfect data from a bearing acoustic monitoring system,
   and a failure database. The model supports prediction within a defined
   maintenance planning window from the time of receipt of the latest
   acoustic condition monitoring information. We use the model to decide
   whether to replace a bearing, or leave it until collection of the next
   condition monitoring indicators. The model is tested on a limited number
   of cases, and demonstrates good predictive capability. Opportunities to
   improve the performance of the model are identified, and the processes
   necessary and time required to build the model are described. Lessons
   learned from dealing with real field data will assist those interested
   in using prognostics to support maintenance planning activities.}},

Abstract = {{Meshless methods are a promising new field in computational
   electromagnetics. Instead of relying on an explicit mesh topology, a
   numerical solution is computed on an unstructured set of collocation
   nodes. This allows to model fine geometrical details with high accuracy
   and facilitates the adaptation of node distributions for optimization or
   refinement purposes. The radial point interpolation method (RPIM) is a
   meshless method based on radial basis functions. In this paper, the
   current state of the RPIM in electromagnetics is reviewed. The localized
   RPIM scheme is summarized, and the interpolation accuracy is discussed
   in dependence of important parameters. A time-domain implementation is
   presented, and important time iteration aspects are reviewed. New
   formulations for perfectly matched layers and waveguide ports are
   introduced. An unconditionally stable RPIM scheme is summarized, and its
   advantages for hybridization with the classical RPIM scheme are
   discussed in a practical example. The capabilities of an adaptive
   time-domain refinement strategy based on the experiences on a
   frequency-domain solver are discussed. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that knee effusion presence in those
   with knee osteoarthritis (OA) alters knee joint muscle activation
   patterns and sagittal plane mechanics during gait.
   Methods: Thirty-five patients with medial compartment knee OA were
   assessed for the presence of effusion using a brush test. Based on the
   results, they were assigned to the knee effusion (n = 17) and no knee
   effusion (n = 18) groups. Electromyograms from seven lower extremity
   muscles (lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and
   medialis, rectus femoris and the lateral and medial hamstrings), leg
   motion and ground reaction forces were recorded during self-selected
   walking. Isometric knee extensor, plantar flexor and knee flexor
   strength were measured. Discrete measures from angular knee motion and
   net external moment of force waveforms were identified. Principal
   component analysis extracted electromyographic waveform features.
   Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group, muscle) and
   interactions (alpha = 0.05). Bonferroni post-hoc testing was employed.
   Results: No differences in age, body mass index, knee pain, Western
   Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, gait velocity and muscle
   strength were found between groups (P > 0.05). Individuals with effusion
   had a greater overall quadriceps activation and prolonged hamstring
   activation into mid-stance (P < 0.05). Knee joint flexion angles were
   higher (P < 0.05) and net external knee extension (KE) moments in mid to
   late stance lower in the effusion group.
   Conclusion: Quadriceps and hamstrings activation during walking were
   altered when effusions were present. Increased knee flexion (KF) angles
   and decreased KE moment in mid-late stance provide a mechanical
   explanation for the effect of joint effusion on muscle activation in
   those with knee OA. (c) 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1946-1953}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present work was to compare the cutting action of two
   different abrasive-grain geometries using experimental observations and
   a validated finite element model. A spherical tool was used to
   approximate a dull abrasive grain while a truncated cone tool was used
   to approximate an abrasive grain with a well defined cutting edge. The
   selected geometries were chosen to represent extreme cases in order to
   bracket the cutting action of a range of cutting geometries. The results
   showed that both tools produced similar normal and tangential forces per
   unit width up to a depth of cut of approximately 3 mu m. The improved
   cutting geometry of the truncated cone tool caused the normal force per
   unit width to decrease and the tangential force per unit width to
   increase in relation to the spherical tool. The truncated cone tool was
   shown to experimentally and numerically be more efficient based on the
   reduced pile-up heights and improved stress distributions. It was also
   shown that both geometries converged towards the same specific energy to
   displace material at suitably large depths of cut, which suggests that
   there is a minimum specific energy obtainable for a given workpiece
   material that is independent of the grain geometry. However, specific
   energies to remove material were higher for the spherical tool as
   compared to the truncated cone tool. Analysis of the energy components
   of the finite element model showed that frictional energy contributions
   were high with the spherical tool and low with the truncated cone tool.
   Finally, it was found that both tools required approximately the same
   energy to shear a chip from a workpiece when friction was subtracted
   from the specific energy for material removal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A capacitance type densitometer was used to measure the densities of
   canola, jatropha and soapnut biodiesel and their blends at elevated
   temperatures and pressures. This densitometer is based on the principle
   that the capacitance of the liquid is proportional to the dielectric
   constant, which, in turn, is proportional to the density. Densities were
   measured from room temperature up to 523 K and from atmospheric pressure
   up to 7 MPa. The frequency output from the densitometer was found to
   have a linear relationship with temperature. It was found that density
   showed a linear relationship with temperature and pressure over the
   measured range. The measured data were regressed and the regression
   models were developed to represent densities as a function of
   temperature as well as pressure. The errors between measured and
   regressed densities of diesel and canola, jatropha, soapnut biodiesel

Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Membrane fouling is a key constraint for the widespread application of
   membrane-based technologies in water and wastewater treatment because it
   reduces the production volume of water, thereby increasing operating and
   maintenance costs. Characterization of membrane materials and foulant
   layers is crucial for an accurate understanding of fouling processes.
   This study used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and normal
   Raman spectroscopy as a novel technique to examine fouling caused by
   naturally occurring organics on a polymeric nanofiltration (NF)
   membrane, which is used for the treatment of drinking water. The results
   from this study suggest that normal Raman spectroscopy is useful for
   characterization of polyamide NF membranes used in drinking water
   treatment, but is not sensitive enough to resolve the foulant materials
   present on the membrane surface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   analysis of virgin and used membrane suggests significant membrane
   fouling. The observed SERS peak of fouled membrane at wavenumber 1543
   cm(-1) suggests the presence of protein and those at 1444, 1305, and
   1239 cm(-1) indicate the possible presence of carbohydrate on the
   membrane surface. These results demonstrate that SERS has the potential
   for identification of functional groups of organics involved in NF
   membrane fouling in water treatment that could lead to improved
   strategies for membrane fouling reduction. The use of SERS for possible
   foulant identification offers a rapid, cost effective and portable tool
   for on-site analysis of membrane surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The use of composite materials for repair and rehabilitation of corroded
   steel pipes has been increasingly growing in the oil and gas industry.
   However, there exists a noticeable gap in the literature on the long

   to large internal pressure magnitudes. This work is an attempt toward
   filing the gap by gaining a better understanding of the effects of
   environmental conditions on the long term performance of composite
   repaired pipes subjected to large internal pressures. Finite element
   method (FEM) is used to simulate typical composite warp-repaired gouged
   steel pipes, conditioned in various environments and subsequently
   subjected to internal pressure. The influence of the resulting
   degradation in composite's mechanical properties on the performance of
   the system was evaluated. To validate the results, an experimental
   program was designed and carried out. Repaired specimens were
   conditioned in an environmental chamber under certain thermal and
   moisture conditions; then, the specimens were tested to failure subject
   to internal pressure. Good correlation was obtained after fine tuning of
   FEM model's material data through the use of the experimentally obtained

Abstract = {{Muscle synergies are important for spinal stability, but few studies
   examine temporal responses of spinal muscles to dynamic perturbations.
   This study examined activation amplitudes and temporal synergies among
   compartments of the back extensor and among abdominal wall muscles in
   response to dynamic bidirectional moments of force. We further examined
   whether responses were different between men and women. 19 women and 18
   men performed a controlled transfer task. Surface electromyograms from
   bilateral sites over 6 back extensor compartments and 6 abdominal wall
   muscle sites were analyzed using principal component analysis. Key
   features were extracted from the measured electromyographic waveforms
   capturing amplitude and temporal variations among muscle sites. Three
   features explained 97\% of the variance. Scores for each feature were
   computed for each measured waveform and analysis of variance found
   significant (p < .05) muscle main effects and a sex by muscle
   interaction. For the back extensors, post hoc analysis revealed that
   upper and more medial sites were recruited to higher amplitudes, medial
   sites responded to flexion moments, and the more lateral sites responded
   to lateral flexion moments. Women had more differences among muscle
   sites than men for the lateral flexion moment feature. For the abdominal
   wall muscles the oblique muscles responded with synergies related to
   fiber orientation, with women having higher amplitudes and more
   responsiveness to the lateral flexion moment than men. Synergies between
   the abdominal and back extensor sites as the moment demands change are
   discussed. These findings illustrate differential activation among
   erector spinae compartments and abdominal wall muscle sites supporting a
   highly organized pattern of response to bidirectional external moments
   with asynchronies more apparent in women. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{White versus gray matter: fMRI hemodynamic responses show similar
   characteristics, but differ in peak amplitude}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is growing evidence for the idea of fMRI activation in
   white matter. In the current study, we compared hemodynamic response
   functions (HRF) in white matter and gray matter using 4 T fMRI. White
   matter fMRI activation was elicited in the isthmus of the corpus
   callosum at both the group and individual levels (using an established
   interhemispheric transfer task). Callosal HRFs were compared to HRFs
   from cingulate and parietal activation.
   Results: Examination of the raw HRF revealed similar overall response
   characteristics. Finite impulse response modeling confirmed that the WM
   HRF characteristics were comparable to those of the GM HRF, but had
   significantly decreased peak response amplitudes.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results matched a priori expectations of
   smaller HRF responses in white matter due to the relative drop in
   cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). Importantly,
   the findings demonstrate that despite lower CBF and CBV, white matter
   fMRI activation remained within detectable ranges at 4 T.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the potential for unraveling failure of flow-through rockfill
   dams, a systematic study of three aspects of the hydraulic design of
   these structures was conducted. First, the gradient that is most useful
   in independently computing the height of the point of first flow
   emergence was established. The proposed method is based on the idea of
   the angle of the emergent flow field within the toe of the structure.
   Secondly, as a result, this study presents a method for independently
   computing the variation in hydraulic head within the vertical that
   allows the toe of the structure (i.e., downstream from the vertical
   associated with first flow emergence) to be isolated. This is based in
   part on a separate parametric study of 24 numerically simulated
   flow-through rockfill dams. Thirdly, the gradient that allows for the
   independent estimation of the default tailwater depth is presented and
   verified, with the help of laboratory results. The hope is that these
   three computational tools will facilitate the design and assessment of
   flow-through rockfill structures, as a particular class of
   pseudohydraulic structure. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000572. (C)

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{878-890}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Human societies may be modelled as very large complex systems involving
   multiple flows of energy and materials between different sectors.
   Traditional exergy analysis methods are inadequate for the analysis of
   such systems because they do not take non-energetic flows into account.
   Extended exergy analysis (EEA) allows for the inclusion of exergetic
   equivalents of non-energetic quantities labour, capital and the costs of
   environmental remediation. In this work, EEA is conducted to
   characterize the extraction, conversion, and end use of energy and
   materials in the economy of Nova Scotia, Canada, in 2006.
   The economy of Nova Scotia is divided into seven sectors (agriculture,
   industry, tertiary, domestic, natural resource extraction, energy
   conversion, and transportation) and each sector is modelled according to
   its characteristic material and energy fluxes. A model of the structural
   connectivity of the economy in terms of exchanges between sectors is
   constructed. Equivalent values of exergy are computed for each flow of
   energy and material, and energy, exergy and extended exergy efficiencies
   are calculated for each sector of the economy of Nova Scotia and
   compared with those of Norway, China, Italy, Netherlands and the UK. (C)

Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose RSA can be used for early detection of unstable
   implants. We assessed the micromotion of the Mobility Total Ankle System
   over 2 years, to evaluate the stability of the bone-implant interface
   using radiostereometric analysis measurements of longitudinal migration
   and inducible displacement.
   Patients and methods 23 patients were implanted with the Mobility
   system. Median age was 62 (28-75) years and median BMI was 28.8
   (26.0-34.5). Supine radiostereometric analysis examinations were done
   from postoperatively to the 2-year follow-up. Standing examinations were
   taken from the 3-month to the 2-year follow-up. Migrations and
   displacements were assessed using model-based RSA software (v. 3.2).
   Results The median maximum total point motion (MTPM) for the implants at
   2 years was 1.19 (0.39-1.95) mm for the talar component and 0.90
   (0.17-2.28) mm for the spherical tip of the tibial component. The
   general pattern for all patients was that the slope of the migration
   curves decreased over time. The main direction of motion for both
   components was that of subsidence. The median 2-year MTPM inducible
   displacement for the talar component was 0.49 (0.27-1.15) mm, and it was
   0.07 (0.03-0.68) mm for the tibial component tip.
   Interpretation The implants subside into the bone over time and under
   load. This corresponds to the direction of primary loading during
   standing or walking. This statistically significant motion may become a
   clinically significant finding that would correspond with premature
   implant failure.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{455-461}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In a healthy human, deep inspirations produce bronchodilation of
   contracted airways, which probably occurs due to the transient
   distension of the airway smooth muscle (ASM). We hypothesised that deep
   expiratory manoeuvres also produce bronchodilation due to transient
   airway wall and ASM compression.
   We used porcine bronchial segments to assess the effects of deep
   inspirations, and maximal and partial expiration (submaximal) on airway
   calibre. Respiratory manoeuvres were simulated by varying transmural
   pressure using a hydrostatic pressure column: deep inspiration 5 to 30
   cmH(2)O, maximal expiration 30 to -15 cmH(2)O, partial expiration 10 to
   -15 cmH(2)O; amidst a background of tidal oscillations, 5 to 10 cmH(2)O
   at 0.25 Hz. Changes in luminal cross-sectional area in
   carbachol-contracted airways were measured using video endoscopy.
   Deep inspirations produce an immediate bronchodilation (similar to
   40-60\%, p=0.0076) that lasts for up to 1 min (p=0.0479). In comparison,
   after maximal expiration there was no immediate change in airway
   calibre; however, a delayed bronchodilatory response was observed from 4
   s after the manoeuvre (p=0.0059) and persisted for up to 3 min
   (p=0.0182). Partial expiration had little or no effect or airway
   calibre.
   The results observed demonstrate that the airway wall dilates to deep
   inspiration manoeuvres but is unresponsive to deep expiratory
   manoeuvres.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative method for measuring the surface porosity of pressed and
   sintered PM alloys was investigated. Materials used for this research
   consisted of a commercially available alloy. Alumix 231, and a
   proprietary alloy. DAL 6-Si PM alloys. The densities of the samples of
   the two alloys were analyzed using helium-pycnometry and
   oil-impregnation. In both cases, the measured density by
   helium-pycnometry was found to be 1-2\% higher than that determined by
   the oil impregnation method and closer to the theoretical density. This
   is believed to be due to the superior ability of helium to penetrate the
   microstructure of these alloys. In addition, the volume of open
   (surface) porosity was calculated for both alloys. The results showed
   significant differences in the volume of open and closed porosity
   measured by the two techniques. Helium-pycnometry gives higher open
   porosity values and lower closed porosity compared to oil impregnation

Abstract = {{Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) - Pluronic F127 - glass composites
   have demonstrated excellent potential, from the perspective of
   controlled mechanical properties and cytocompatibility, for peripheral
   nerve regeneration. In addition to controlling the mechanical properties
   and cytotoxicity for such composite devices, the glass component may
   mediate specific responses upon implantation via degradation in the

   research focused on quantifying the release levels of such therapeutic
   ions from these experimental medical devices has been limited. To
   redress the balance, this paper explores the ion release profiles for
   Si4+, Ca2+, Na+, Zn2+, and Ce4+ from experimental composite nerve
   guidance conduits (CNGC) comprising PLGA (at 12.5, and 20 wt.\%), F127
   (at 0, 2.5 and 5 wt.\%) and various loadings of Si-Ca-Na-Zn-Ce glass (at
   20 and 40 wt.\%) for incubation periods of up to 28 days. The
   concentration of each ion, at various time points, was determined using
   Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer
   Optima 3000). It was observed that the Si4+, Na-+,Na- Ca2+, Zn2+ release
   from CNGCs in this study ranged from 0.22 to 6.477 ppm, 2.307 to 3.277
   ppm, 40 to 119 ppm, and 45 to 51 ppm, respectively. The Ce4+
   concentrations were under the minimum detection limits for the ICP
   instrument utilized. The results indicate that the ion release levels
   may be appropriate to mediate therapeutic effects with respect to
   peripheral nerve regeneration. The data generated in this paper provides
   requisite evidence to optimize composition for pre-clinical evaluation
   of the experimental composite. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Accident probability estimation is a common and central step to all
   quantitative risk assessment methods. Among many techniques available,
   bow-tie model (BT) is very popular because it represent the accident
   scenario altogether including causes and consequences. However, it
   suffers a static structure limiting its application in real-time
   monitoring and probability updating which are key factors in dynamic
   risk analysis. The present work is focused on using BT approach in a
   dynamic environment in which the occurrence probability of accident
   consequences changes. In this method, on one hand, failure probability
   of primary events of BT, leading to the top event, are developed using
   physical reliability models, and constantly revised as physical
   parameters (e.g., pressure, velocity, dimension, etc) change. And, on
   the other hand, the failure probability of safety barriers of the BT are
   periodically updated using Bayes' theorem as new information becomes
   available over time. Finally, the resulting, updated BT is used to
   estimate the posterior probability of the consequences which in turn
   results in an updated risk profile. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to devise a means by which dispersoid
   forming transition metals could be incorporated into press and sinter
   aluminium powder metallurgy (P/M) alloys. Additions of iron and nickel
   were explored in this context added as either admixed elemental powders
   or prealloyed additions into the base aluminium powder. Utilising an
   Al-2.3Cu-1.6Mg-0.2Sn composition as the base system, elemental additions
   imparted coarse aluminide phases within the sintered microstructure and
   diminished the general sintering response of the alloy. The resultant
   tensile properties of these materials were inferior to those of the
   unmodified base alloy. Prealloying was much more effective. Using this
   approach, highly refined distributions of aluminides were achieved
   without any adverse effects on the compaction or sintering response of
   the base alloy. A prealloyed addition of 1 wt-\% iron was the most
   effective of those considered as it imparted tangible gains in yield
   strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) to the base alloy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of a single reservoir diffusion test
   to determine both the effective porosity of a soil-cement matrix and the
   diffusivity of tritium through saturated, monolithic, cement
   solidified/stabilized wasteforms. Testing was performed on a laboratory
   mixture of cement paste, sand, and kaolinite. The influence of porosity
   on the proper interpretation of the diffusion tests was examined.
   Results of tests on three replicate specimens were consistent and
   indicate effective porosities of 0.26 to 0.28 and effective diffusive
   coefficients of 2.5 x 10(-10) to 3.0 x 10(-10) m(2)/s. The effect of
   curing time is discussed. Products of the effective diffusion
   coefficients and porosity (n(e)D(e)),) decreased by 22 \% from specimens
   cured for 14 days to specimens cured for 28 days prior to testing while
   from 70 to 126 days of curing n(e)D(e) only changed by 8 \%. This
   suggests that curing should be carried out for greater than 70 days

   is well modeled by a linear series of thermal resistors, and along the
   lamellae it is well represented by parallel thermal resistors of
   continuous slabs of PMMA and; similar to 200-mu m long slabs of Al2O3,

Abstract = {{Enzymatic hydrolysis of pre-treated lignocellulosic biomass is an ideal
   alternative to acid hydrolysis for bio-ethanol production, limited
   primarily by pre-treatment requirements and economic considerations
   arising from enzyme production costs and specific activities. The quest
   for cheaper and better enzymes has prompted years of bio-prospecting,
   strain optimization through genetic engineering, enzyme characterization
   for simple and complex lignocellulosic feedstock, and the development of
   pre-treatment strategies to mitigate inhibitory effects. The recent
   shift to systematic characterizations of de novo mixtures of purified
   proteins is a promising indicator of maturation within this field of
   study, facilitating progression towards feedstock assay-based rapid
   enzyme mixture optimization. It is imperative that international
   standards be developed to enable meaningful comparisons between these
   studies and the construction of a database of enzymatic activities and
   kinetics, aspects of which are explored here-in. Complementary efforts
   to improve the economic viability of enzymatic hydrolysis through
   process integration and reactor design are also considered, where
   membrane-confinement shows significant promise despite the associated
   technological challenges. Significant advancements in enzyme technology
   towards the economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass should be
   expected within the next few years as systematic research in enzyme
   activities conforms to that of traditional reaction engineering. (C)

Abstract = {{Mass transfer and hydrodynamic characteristics of an oscillatory-plate
   column (OPC) and their relation to energy dissipation were investigated
   using a 0.1-m diameter pilot-scale unit. The column is characterized by
   having plates with a small hole diameter (1.63.2?mm) oscillating at 180
   degrees out of phase at higher frequencies (030?Hz) and small amplitudes
   (03.2?mm). Using this design, it was possible to achieve gas holdup and
   specific interfacial areas as high as similar to 0.8 and 400?m1,
   respectively. The maximum gas superficial velocity achieved reaches as
   high as 1.7?m/s, while the axial dispersion coefficient ranged from
   similar to 104 to over similar to 3 x 10(3)?m2s1, which is almost one
   order of magnitude lower than that in bubble columns under similar flow
   rates. The value of gas velocity of similar to 0.1?m?s1 seems to mark a
   transition beyond which interfacial area, holdup, and axial mixing
   become practically unchanged. Keeping in view its performance
   characteristics, the column can satisfactorily meet many of the demands
   posed by intensified wastewater treatment processes, namely high rates
   of oxygen transfer, multistage operational mode, uniform distribution of
   small-scale turbulence structure, and the ability to handle sludge with
   relatively high concentrations of suspended solids.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the use of random fields and finite elements to
   assess the influence of porosity and void size on the effective elastic
   stiffness of geomaterials. A finite element model is developed involving
   ``tied freedoms{''} that allows analysis of an ideal block of materials
   leading to direct evaluation of the effective Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio. The influence of block size and representative volume
   elements (RVE) are discussed. The use of random fields and Monte-Carlo
   simulations deliver a mean and standard deviation of the elastic
   parameters that lead naturally to a probabilistic interpretation. The
   methodology is extended to a foundation problem involving a footing on
   an elastic foundation containing voids. The approach enables estimates
   to be made of the probability of excessive settlement. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Susceptibility field gradients (SFGs) cause problems for functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in regions like the orbital frontal
   lobes, leading to signal loss and image artifacts (signal displacement
   and ``pile-up{''}). Pulse sequences with spiral-in k-space trajectories
   are often used when acquiring fMRI in SFG regions such as
   inferior/medial temporal cortex because it is believed that they have
   improved signal recovery and decreased signal displacement properties.
   Previously postulated theories explain differing reasons why spiral-in
   appears to perform better than spiral-out; however it is clear that
   multiple mechanisms are occurring in parallel. This study explores
   differences in spiral-in and spiral-out images using human and phantom
   empirical data, as well as simulations consistent with the phantom
   model.
   Using image simulations, the displacement of signal was characterized
   using point spread functions (PSFs) and target maps, the latter of which
   are conceptually inverse PSFs describing which spatial locations
   contribute signal to a particular voxel. The magnitude of both PSFs and
   target maps was found to be identical for spiral-out and spiral-in
   acquisitions, with signal in target maps being displaced from distant
   regions in both cases. However, differences in the phase of the signal
   displacement patterns that consequently lead to changes in the
   intervoxel phase coherence were found to be a significant mechanism
   explaining differences between the spiral sequences.
   The results demonstrate that spiral-in trajectories do preserve more
   total signal in SFG regions than spiral-out; however, spiral-in does not
   in fact exhibit decreased signal displacement. Given that this signal
   can be displaced by significant distances, its recovery may not be
   preferable for all fMRI applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Bending capacity of sandwich pipes}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{17-31}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A sandwich pipe (SP) is an effective design alternative, providing
   effective load carrying capacity and thermal insulation to pipelines,
   especially when the pipe is going to be utilized in deep and ultra-deep
   water applications. However, the design and development of a reliable SP
   requires an in-depth understanding of the behavior of such a system
   under various loading conditions. In this paper, the behavior of SPs
   subject to pure bending, which is one of the governing loading
   conditions for offshore pipelines, is investigated.
   In order to perform this investigation, a series of numerical parametric
   models, using the finite element (FE) method, was developed. The linear
   eigenvalue buckling analysis and the nonlinear post-buckling analysis
   were conducted to explore the systems' response. The influence of
   several significant structural parameters on the pre-buckling, buckling
   and post-buckling responses of SPs was investigated. The parameters
   investigated included various combinations of several geometrical and
   material properties, as well as the consideration of various possible
   intro-layer adhesion mechanisms. Moreover, the recent high strength
   steels used in formation of oil and pipes exhibit certain degree of
   yield anisotropy; it is therefore crucial to understand the effect of
   material's yield anisotropy on such system's response. This issue has
   also been considered in this research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A new comprehensive micromechanical model for the analysis of the
   dynamic problem of a smart composite piezo-magneto-thermo-elastic thin
   plate with rapidly-varying thickness is developed in the present paper.
   A rigorous three-dimensional formulation is used as the basis of
   multiscale asymptotic homogenization. A complete dynamic approach is
   adhered to beginning with the equations of dynamic equilibrium, the
   time-varying form of Maxwell's equations and dynamic thermal balance.
   The asymptotic homogenization model is derived, the governing equations
   are determined and subsequently general expressions called unit cell
   problems that can be used to determine the effective elastic,
   piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, electrical conductivity etc. properties
   are presented. Of particular interest in this work is the development of
   general expressions pertaining to the so-called product properties which
   are manifested in the macroscopic composite plate via the interaction of
   the different phases but may be absent from some individual constituents
   of the composite. Examples of product properties are the
   magnetoelectric, pyroelectric and pyromagnetic coefficients. The derived
   expressions pertaining to the unit-cell problems and the resultant
   effective coefficients are very general and are valid for any geometry
   of the unit cell. In addition to the effective properties, the developed
   model also computes the local mechanical displacement and stress,
   electric displacement, magnetic field, heat flux and free current
   density. The work is illustrated by means of a 3-layer anisotropic plate
   consisting of an elastic middle layer sandwiched between thin
   piezoelectric and piezomagnetic carrier layers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The interest in hydrogen energy is rising. Biomass could be its
   potential resource. Steam gasification of biomass in the presence of the
   sorbent calcium oxide (CaO) can produce a gas rich in hydrogen along
   with in situ capture of the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced.
   Calcium-looping gasification (CLG) produces a gas rich in hydrogen and
   at the same time captures CO2 during the process while also regenerating
   sorbent producing pure CO2. However, deposition of char and tar,
   sintering because of high-temperature operation, and cyclic heating and
   cooling in the looping system can drastically reduce the ability of
   sorbent to capture CO2 and at the same time for its regeneration.
   Therefore, this paper presents the study conducted to examine the
   performance of the sorbent as it goes through a number of alternating
   calcination-carbonation cycles. This research is carried out using two
   rigs. With the first one, kinetic rates are developed for calcination in
   the presence of three media: nitrogen (N-2), CO2, and steam (H2O). With
   the second one, the effects of the particle size, medium, and
   temperature on the calcination and carbonation reactions are studied. An
   empirical relationship, in order to predict the loss during carbonation
   as the sorbent goes through successive calcination-carbonation cycles,
   is developed and presented here. With the calcium-looping system at the
   laboratory scale, (a) assessment of the fluid dynamics of the process,
   distribution of the pressure, and particles lost by attrition and (b) a
   study of the calcination-carbonation cycle are made and presented in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of TIC morphology and TiC volume fraction on

   with two atomic percent ratios, 45:55 and 55: 45, were selected for
   C:Ti, and Fe percentages were explored with 70, 60,50 and 10 wt.\%.
   Results showed that TIC morphology was affected by laser process
   parameters and powder composition. Optimum wear resistance was found
   among the samples by conducting wear tests with the ASTM G65-04, dry
   sand/rubber wheel, low-stress, coarse and abrasive (three-body) test
   methods. The abrasive characteristics of TiC were compared to WC-12wt.\%
   Ni deposited on a similar substrate measured under identical test
   conditions. Results showed excellent wear resistance of in-situ TiC. The

Abstract = {{Collagen fibrils are nanostructured biological cables essential to the
   structural integrity of many of our tissues. Consequently, understanding
   the structural basis of their robust mechanical properties is of great
   interest. Here we present what to our knowledge is a novel mode of
   collagen fibril disruption that provides new insights into both the
   structure and mechanics of native collagen fibrils. Using enzyme probes
   for denatured collagen and scanning electron microscopy, we show that
   mechanically overloading collagen fibrils from bovine tail tendons
   causes them to undergo a sequential, two-stage, selective molecular
   failure process. Denatured collagen molecules-meaning molecules with a
   reduced degree of time-averaged helicity compared to those packed in
   undamaged fibrils-were first created within kinks that developed at
   discrete, repeating locations along the length of fibrils. There,
   collagen denaturation within the kinks was concentrated within certain
   sub-fibrils. Additional denatured molecules were then created along the
   surface of some disrupted fibrils. The heterogeneity of the disruption
   within fibrils suggests that either mechanical load is not carried
   equally by a fibril's subcomponents or that the subcomponents do not
   possess homogenous mechanical properties. Meanwhile, the creation of
   denatured collagen molecules, which necessarily involves the energy
   intensive breaking of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, provides a physical
   basis for the toughness of collagen fibrils.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the explosion characteristics of three
   nontraditional dusts: nanomaterials, flocculent materials, and hybrid
   mixtures. Nanomaterials have a high likelihood of explosion with minimum
   ignition energies potentially less than 1 mJ. These low ignition
   energies may therefore allow nanomaterials to ignite due to
   electrostatic sparks, collision, or mechanical friction. The severity of
   nanomaterial explosions is affected by agglomeration and coagulation of
   the particles. Flocculent materials with a high length-to-diameter ratio
   exhibit explosion behavior patterns similar to those for spherical
   dusts. The length of flocculent particles plays a role in explosion
   likelihood which is not yet fully understood. High voltage discharge
   during the electrostatic flocking process is a common flocculent
   ignition hazard. Hybrid mixtures of a combustible dust and a flammable
   gas/vapor display a higher explosion severity and a lower minimum
   explosible concentration than that of the dust alone. Violent hybrid
   explosions may occur even if the dust and the gas/vapor are below their
   respective lean limit concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient multi-scale approach to meshless modeling of

   applied to regions with coarse nodal distributions while the original
   RPIM is applied to the rest of the dense nodal solution domain. With
   application of the leapfrog ADI scheme, a uniform time-step can now be
   applied to the entire solution domain without temporal and spatial
   interpolation between different computational regions. Furthermore, in
   the proposed scheme, implicit updating of field variables is confined
   only within the regions of densely-distributed nodes, yielding a
   significant saving in memory overhead and a further reduction in CPU
   time in comparison with leapfrog ADI-RPIM and original RPIM,

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coupled MM5-CMAQ modeling system was employed to
   investigate the PM10 pollution issue in Beijing, China, with a focus on
   assessing the effects of different restriction policies implemented
   during and after the 2008 Olympic Games. The simulations under designed
   scenarios were implemented over a 2-level nested grid domain for
   comparing the difference of PM10 concentrations under restriction and
   no-restrictions situations. The restriction measures include
   alternate-day vehicle driving, construction activities, trans-boundary
   emissions from neighboring provinces, and vehicle restrictions during
   the post-Olympic period. Meteorological contributions to the air quality
   improvement were also examined. The results show that significant
   improvement of air quality in Beijing during the 2008 Games was
   attributed largely to these restriction measures, although favorable
   weather conditions play an important role. Also, during the post-Olympic
   period, daily vehicle restrictions implemented temporarily under extreme
   weather conditions played a crucial role in alleviating Beijing's air
   pollution. Beijing not only needs to take continuing efforts to
   addresses its own PM10 problem, but also has a clear self-interest in
   demanding better environmental performance from neighboring provinces.
   It is suggested that Beijing would work collectively with neighboring
   provinces to develop a long-term multi-region initiative and strategy
   aimed at emission reduction for providing the citizens in this region a
   healthy and clean air in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-assisted surgery can be used to measure 3-dimensional knee
   function during arthroplasty surgery; however, it is unknown if the

   this study was to determine if the preoperative adduction moment is
   correlated with the knee abduction/adduction angle measured
   intraoperatively. A statistically significant correlation was found
   between the mean (r(2) = 0.59; P = .001) and peak (r(2) = 0.53; P =
   .003) preoperative knee adduction moment and the mean

Title = {{Effect of feeding fresh forage and marine algae on the fatty acid

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of feeding fresh forage either as
   pasture plus a concentrate (PAS) or as a silage-based total mixed ration
   (TMR), combined with either a ruminally inert lipid supplement high in
   saturated fatty acids ((-)) or a ruminally protected microalgae
   containing 22 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/100 g of fatty acids ((+))
   on the fatty acid (FA) composition and oxidation of milk and butter. For
   the 8 mid-lactation Holstein cows in this study, milk yield was not
   significantly affected by treatment, averaging 32.3 +/- 1.28 kg/d. Milk
   fat content was higher for PAS(-), averaging 5.05 compared with 4.10 +/-
   0.17\% for the mean of other treatments, and was significantly depressed
   with microalgae supplementation (3.97 vs. 4.69 +/- 0.17\%). The
   saturated fatty acid level in the milk of cows fed TMR- was
   significantly higher than that of the other treatments (66.9 vs. 61.2
   g/100 g of FA). The level of monounsaturated FA was lowered by feeding
   TMR- (27.4 vs. 32.0 g/100 g of FA), whereas levels of polyunsaturated FA
   were elevated by feeding PAS(+) compared with the mean of the other
   treatments (6.54 vs. 5.07 g/100 g of FA). Feeding the rumen-protected
   microalgae increased the DHA content of milk more than 4-fold (0.06 to
   0.26 g/100 g of FA) with the PAS treatment. The conjugated linoleic acid
   content of milk was highest for PAS(+) compared with the other
   treatments (4.18 vs. 3.41 g/100 g of FA). In general, the fatty acid
   composition of butter followed that of milk. Overall, feeding the TMR
   supplemented with the rumen-protected microalgae increased the levels of
   volatile products of oxidation in milk and butter. No effect of forage
   type or microalgae supplementation was observed on the oxidative
   stability or antioxidant capacity of milk, although the oxidative
   stability of butter exposed to UV was reduced with microalgae
   supplementation, particularly with TMR, as assessed by using the ferric
   reducing ability of plasma assay.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic stability of fibers in fiber-reinforced composite materials
   subject to compressive loading is studied. The transversal buckling mode
   is considered, and two limiting cases, the dilute and non-dilute

   cylindrical model and the lubrication approximation are applied. The
   original problem is reduced to a problem of stability of a rod on
   elastic foundation. Through the solution of this problem a simple
   formula for the buckling load is obtained. In the case of a dilute
   composite, the solution of a problem of stability of a compressed rod in
   elastic plane is used. On the basis of the obtained solutions in two
   limiting cases the interpolation formulae are derived. These formulae
   describe buckling of fiber in the fiber-reinforced composite for any
   value of the fiber volume fraction. Comparison with known numerical and
   experimental results is carried out, and the sufficient accuracy of the
   derived formulae is demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Development of an experimentally validated abrasive-grain cutting model

Abstract = {{This work describes the creation of an experimentally validated
   abrasive-grain cutting model using a hybrid Euler-Lagrange finite
   element formulation. This model was developed to better understand the
   micro-mechanical cutting that occurs during the grinding manufacturing
   operation. The model was developed in stages using the commercially
   available package LS-DYNA (R) with each stage undergoing experimental
   validation. Two cutting tool geometries were utilized to represent
   idealized abrasive grains that form a grinding wheel. A round-nosed tool
   was used to approximate the general size of abrasive grains and a
   flat-nosed tool was used to approximate the size and active cutting edge
   shape of abrasive grains. The development began with a simple spherical
   indentation model to test the feasibility of the numerical formulation,
   to determine essential contact parameters, and to verify an
   elastoplastic material model. The indentation model was then expanded to
   include relative motion between a round-nosed cutting tool and the
   workpiece using the same parameters that were identified with the
   indentation model. The round-nosed cutting model was used to determine
   the coefficient of friction between the tool and the workpiece. Analysis
   of the results from the round-nosed cutting model revealed that a plowed
   lip of plastically deformed material forms in front of the tool while a
   ridge of material forms on the sides of the residual groove as a result
   of flow around the tool. Subsurface stresses were shown to be more
   affected by depth of cut as compared to cutting speed. A case study
   showed that smaller abrasive grains produced lower overall forces and
   reduced the size of the subsurface stress fields; however, peak stresses
   were shown to increase slightly with decreasing grain size. Finally, a
   flat-nosed cutting tool was introduced in-place of the round-nosed tool
   to create a three-dimensional model of abrasive-grain cutting with chip
   formation. This finalized model incorporated all of the identified
   numerical parameters from the previous two development stages. The
   results revealed markedly different deformation and subsurface stresses.
   The workpiece material was shown to flow up the sides and around the
   cutting tool producing a continuous chip. Material thinning of the chip
   as it flowed around the tool demonstrated likely areas of crack
   formation, which may lead to discontinuous chip formation. The
   subsurface stresses were shown to be concentrated along a thin shear
   band at the root of the chip in accordance with metal cutting theory.
   Stresses below the flat-nosed cutting tool were shown to be below the
   yield stress of the workpiece material. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of stress ratio on fatigue crack growth rate
   (FCGR) of AM60B magnesium alloy plates at room temperature is studied.
   The plates are loaded under a wide range of stress ratios (-1, 0.8, 0.6,
   0.3, 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) and the behavior of the center crack is
   investigated. Most FCGR data available in the literature have been
   presented using various FCGR models that are mainly based on a positive
   stress intensity range as well as the entire stress intensity range. In
   this paper, a modified model, developed based on the Walker model, is
   proposed. The model condenses and presents the data obtained under the
   wide stress ratio range into a single line on a logarithmic scale.
   Finally, the variances in the FCGR data that were presented with
   different models from the best-fitted line to the zero stress ratio were
   calculated and compared to each other to clarify the efficiency of the
   model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Co-occurrence matrix-based textural features were analyzed and three
   algorithms were developed to identify bare spots, wild blueberry plants,
   and weeds with the aim of applying agrochemicals to wild blueberry
   cropping fields in a spot-specific manner Images were acquired using
   four cameras and a ruggedized laptop with custom-written programs coded
   in Microsoft Visual (R) C++. Textural features were extracted from the
   images using MATLAB (R) and analyzed with SAS (R). Forty-four textural
   features were extracted from co-occurrence matrices of NTSC luminance
   (L), hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI) images. Multiple discriminant
   analysis using all 44 features (DF\_ALL model) showed 98.1\% of overall
   classification accuracy and 83 ms of processing time of an image with
   C++ calculation. Based on the results of multiple discriminant analysis
   and two-step linear discrimination plotting, the DF\_HSISD, DF\_SISD,
   and HSILD algorithms are preferred algorithms with overall accuracy of
   94.9\%, 92.7\%, and 91.4\%, and processing time of 55, 27, and 29 ms,
   respectively. Any of three reduced textural feature algorithms can be
   employed for spot-specific application of agrochemicals in wild

   depend on whether processing speed or accuracy is more important for the
   end-user's application.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing importance of security in computers and communication
   systems introduces the need for several public-key cryptosystems. The
   modular division and multiplication arithmetic operations in GF (p) and
   GF (2(n)) are extensively used in many public key cryptosystems, such as
   El-Gamal cryptosystem, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and the
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Processing these
   cryptosystems involves complicated computations, therefore, it is
   recommended to develop specialized hardware to speed up these
   computations. In this work, we propose efficient hardware design to
   compute both operations (division and multiplication) in the binary
   extension finite filed (GF (2(n)). The common points in both operations
   are utilized in our design to reduce the design area and delay. making
   the proposed architecture faster than other previously proposed designs.

Abstract = {{The high level of PUFA in fish oil, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid
   (EPA) and DHA result in rapid oxidation of the oil. Current methods used
   to assess oxidation have little correlation with sensory properties of
   fish oils. Here we describe an alternative method using solid phase
   microextraction (SPME) combined with GC-MS to monitor volatile oxidation
   products. Stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to
   classify oils characterized as acceptable or unacceptable based on
   sensory analysis; a cross-validated success rate of 100\% was achieved
   with the function. The classification function was also successfully
   validated with tasted samples that were not used to create the method. A
   total of 14 variables, primarily aldehydes and ketones, were identified
   as significant discriminators in the classification function. This
   method will be useful as a quality control method for fish oil
   manufacturers. Practical applications: This paper describes an
   analytical method that can be used by fish oil manufacturers for quality
   control purposes. Solid phase microextraction and GC-MS were used to
   monitor volatile oxidation products in fish oil. These data, combined
   with results of analyses by a sensory panel, were used to create a
   function that classified fish oil samples as acceptable or unacceptable.
   The volatile oxidation products used to in the function were primarily
   aldehydes and ketones. This method can be used by fish oil manufacturers
   as an alternative to expensive sensory panels.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are attractive for use in automotive and
   aerospace applications because of their low density and good mechanical
   properties. However, difficulty in forming magnesium and the limited
   number of available commercial alloys limit their use. Powder metallurgy
   may be a suitable solution for forming near-net-shape parts. However,
   sintering pure magnesium presents difficulties due to surface film that
   forms on the magnesium powder particles. The present work investigates
   the composition of the surface film that forms on the surface of pure
   magnesium powders exposed to atmospheric conditions and on pure
   magnesium powders after compaction under uniaxial pressing at a pressure
   of 500 MPa and sintering under argon at 600 degrees C for 40 minutes.
   Initially, focused ion beam microscopy was utilized to determine the
   thickness of the surface layer of the magnesium powder and found it to
   be similar to 10 nm. The X-ray photoelectron analysis of the green
   magnesium sample prior to sintering confirmed the presence of MgO, MgCO3
   center dot 3H(2)O, and Mg(OH)(2) in the surface layer of the powder with
   a core of pure magnesium. The outer portion of the surface layer was
   found to contain MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O and Mg(OH)(2), while the inner
   portion of the layer is primarily MgO. After sintering, the MgCO3 center
   dot 3H(2)O was found to be almost completely absent, and the amount of
   Mg(OH)(2) was also decreased significantly. This is postulated to occur
   by decomposition of the compounds to MgO and gases during the high
   temperature of sintering. An increase in the MgO content after sintering
   supports this theory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation on
   mixing in turbulent free air jets issuing from isosceles triangular
   orifices with apex angles of 10 degrees, 20 degrees and 30 degrees. The
   results obtainecl in a contoured nozzle round jet are also presented for
   comparison. The measurements were made with an x-array hot-wire probe
   and a pitot-static tube in isothermal, incompressible jets issuing into
   still surrounding air. The Reynolds number, based on the equivalent
   diameter of the triangular orifices (the same as the diameter of the
   contoured round nozzle), was on average 1.69 x 10(5) for all jets. The
   results of the mean streamwise centreline velocity decay, mass
   entrainment and jet spreading suggest that the 10 degrees jet has the
   highest mixing rate among all the test jets and that the contoured
   nozzle round jet has the lowest mixing rate. The high mixing rate of the
   10 degrees jet is supported by the jet centreline profile of the
   streamwise turbulence intensity and the one-dimensional energy spectra,
   which develop much more rapidly in this jet than in any of the other
   jets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an integrated community-scale energy model (ICEM) was
   developed for supporting renewable energy management (REM) systems
   planning with the consideration of changing climatic conditions. Through
   quantitatively reflecting interactive relationships among various
   renewable energy resources under climate change, not only the impacts of
   climate change on each individual renewable energy but also the combined
   effects on power-generation sector from renewable energy resources could
   be incorporated within a general modeling framework. Also, discrete
   probability levels associated with various climate change impacts on the
   REM system could be generated. Moreover, the ICEM could facilitate
   capacityexpansion planning for energy-production facilities within a
   multi-period and multi-option context in order to reduce energy-shortage
   risks under a number of climate change scenarios. The generated
   solutions can be used for examining various decision options that are
   associated with different probability levels when availabilities of
   renewable energy resources are affected by the changing climatic
   conditions. A series of probability levels of hydropower-, wind- and
   solar-energy availabilities can be integrated into the optimization
   process. The developed method has been applied to a case of long-term
   REM planning for three communities. The generated solutions can provide
   desired energy resource/service allocation and capacityexpansion plans
   with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a
   maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs, renewable
   energy availabilities and energy-shortage risks can also be tackled with
   the consideration of climate change, which would have both positive and
   negative impacts on the system cost, energy supply and greenhouse-gas
   emission. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to determine the antimicrobial effect of allyl
   isothiocyanate (AIT) entrapped in alpha and beta cyclodextrin inclusion
   complexes (ICs). In model experiments. AIT formulations were applied to
   filter paper discs fixed inside the lid of Petri dishes, where the agar
   surface was inoculated with the target organism (Penicillium expansum,
   Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes). Solid phase microextraction
   coupled with gas chromatography was used to determine static headspace
   concentrations of All formulations. The antimicrobial effect of beta IC
   was determined during aerobic storage of packaged fresh-cut onions at 5
   degrees C for 20 days. AIT entrapped in beta IC exhibited a
   significantly (p < 0.05) better antimicrobial effect compared to
   unentrapped AIT. AIT vapour concentrations in the static system were
   highest for unentrapped AIT followed by beta IC and alpha IC.
   Application of beta IC (200 mu l/l) to packaged fresh-cut onions
   effectively decreased numbers oft. monocytogenes, which were also
   decreased at slower rates to undetectable levels on untreated cut onion.
   After 10 days, total aerobic counts were ca. 4 log CFU/g lower on onions
   treated with beta IC (100 and 200 mu l/l) compared to untreated
   controls. This work demonstrates the utility of beta IC as an
   antimicrobial treatment with potential applications in packaged
   fresh-cut vegetable products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Seismic and aseismic slip pulses driven by thermal pressurization of
   pore fluid}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{There are several lines of evidence that suggest that thermal
   pressurization (TP) of pore fluid within a low-permeability fault core
   may play the key role in the development of earthquake slip. To
   elucidate effects of TP on spontaneous fault slip, we consider solutions
   for a steadily propagating slip pulse on a fault with a constant sliding
   friction, the level of which may reflect other thermally-activated
   processes at the rupture front (such as the flash heating on
   asperities). Upon arrival of the pulse front, essentially
   undrained-adiabatic TP takes place during the initial slip acceleration
   from the locked state with a corresponding reduction of the fault
   strength. With passage of time, the diminishing rate of heating (due to
   the reduced fault strength) and increasing rate of hydrothermal
   diffusion from the shear zone offset TP and result in partial recovery
   of the strength, slip deceleration and eventual locking and healing of
   the slip. We show that the rupture speed nu(r) decreases with thickness
   h of the principal shear zone. For lab-constrained values of fault-gouge
   parameters, the TP-pulse solution predicts seismic (nu(r) similar to
   km/s) slip on a millimeter-to-cm thin principal shear zone; and aseismic
   slip with nu(r) similar to 10 km/day and slip rates 1-2 orders above the
   plate rate on a relatively thick (h similar to 1 m) shear zone. These
   and other predictions of the TP-pulse model are consistent with the
   independent sets of observational constraints for large crustal and
   subduction interplate earthquakes, and slow slip transients (North
   Cascadia), respectively. Locking of the slip soon after the diffusive
   transport of the heat and pore fluid becomes efficient significantly
   limits the maximum co-seismic temperature rise to values well below
   previous theoretical estimates. As a result, the onset of macroscopic
   melting and some of thermal decomposition reactions, recently suggested
   to explain strong co-seismic fault weakening, are precluded over much of
   the seismogenic zone.}},

Title = {{Prosthetic Reconstruction from the Tympanic Membrane to the Stapes Head

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{84-93}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{`Background: In the absence of the incus, many surgeons believe that
   reconstruction from the tympanic membrane to the stapes head is more
   effective than reconstruction to the stapes footplate. This has rarely
   been tested empirically. Published better clinical results with
   reconstruction to the stapes head might simply reflect less underlying
   disease in ears with an intact stapes superstructure.
   Objective: To compare vibration transmission of these two forms of
   prosthetic reconstruction.
   Methods: A fresh human cadaveric temporal bone model was used. Round
   window vibrations in response to sound in the ear canal were measured
   with a laser Doppler vibrometer. After incus removal, the discontinuity
   was repaired using a titanium prosthesis. Reconstruction from the
   tympanic membrane to the stapes head was compared to reconstruction to
   the stapes footplate.
   Results: Reconstruction of both types decreased round window vibrations
   by 10 to 15 dB between 500 and 3000 Hz compared to the intact middle
   ear. Reconstruction to the stapes head performed 5 to 10 dB better at
   lower frequencies (500-2000 Hz), but this was only statistically
   significant at 1 and 2 kHz.
   Conclusions: There is only a 5 to 10 dB mechanical advantage gained by
   reconstruction from the tympanic membrane to the stapes head compared to
   reconstruction to the footplate for frequencies between 1 and 2 kHz.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber reinforced plastic composite (FRPC) beams have been widely used as
   effective stand-alone structural elements and/or reinforcing agents in
   various engineering applications. Such lightweight, stiff and strong
   structural elements may suffer, however, from inter-ply defects
   (referred to as delaminations), arising from various causes and factors.
   A delamination in such structural components could propagate into
   severely large damage zone, thus compromising the structural integrity.
   Therefore, detection of delamination at an early stage is of paramount
   importance.
   The application of a relatively new empirical-mode-decomposition-based,
   non-destructive damage detection methodology for detecting delamination
   damage in composite beams is introduced. The method uses the vibration
   signature of the structure, captured through piezoelectric sensors. The
   integrity of the methodology is established through both experimental
   and computational investigations. The method was successful in
   distinguishing lengthwise and through-the-thickness locations of
   delamination, as well as the growth in delamination size. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{One of the challenges in field monitoring of grouted rock bolts, which
   normally have a short exposed end, is to detect the defects of the bolt
   or grout. In this paper, grouted rock bolts are studied using guided
   ultrasonic waves. Numerical modeling for grouted rock bolts is performed
   to assess the effects of insufficient rebar and missing grout. The
   numerical results are verified with laboratory tests on rock bolt
   samples. With introduction of correction factors at the reflection end,
   the results indicate that it is practically possible to identify
   insufficient rebar and grout defects with guided ultrasonic signals
   received at the exposed end. It also indicates that with the attenuation
   and wave velocity of guided waves, defective rock bolts with
   insufficient rebar length or missing grout in the ground can be detected
   with reasonable accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites is
   increasingly being considered in various applications where the
   composite is subjected to harsh hot and humid conditions. Although
   information on the performance of GFRP under hot and humid conditions is
   available, the characteristics and the response of perforated GFRP under
   such conditions have not been fully explored. In this article, the
   response of perforated GFRP plates subject to hot and humid environment
   is examined. The applicability and accuracy of Fick's model for
   establishing the amount of moisture absorption by such composites is
   examined, and an improved model is proposed. The article also
   demonstrates the influence of constant external loading on such
   perforated GFRP while undergoing conditioning in a hot and humid
   environment. Moreover, since the strength and stiffness of composites
   can be significantly affected by harsh environments, the degradation in
   the strength and stiffness of the perforated GFRP as a function of time
   is established. A new model is proposed wherein degradation of the
   strength of such perforated composites may be established as a function
   of time and geometric entities. The model can also account for the
   influence of the applied loading. POLYM. COMPOS. 2012. (c) 2012 Society

Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Static and dynamic problems for the elastic shallow shells periodically
   perforated by a large number of small holes of different shapes are
   solved using the asymptotic approach based on the combination of the
   asymptotic technique and the multi-scale homogenization method. Using
   the asymptotic homogenization method the original boundary-value problem
   is reduced to the combination of two types of problems. First one is a
   recurrent system of unit cell problems with the boundary condition of
   periodic continuation. The second problem is a homogenized
   boundary-value problem for the entire domain, characterized by the
   constant effective coefficients obtained from the solution of the unit
   cell problems. The unit cell problems are solved using the combination
   of the perturbation method and the technique of successive
   approximations. The method of perturbation of the shape of the boundary
   and the Schwarz alternating method are applied taking into account small
   size of holes. Simple engineering formulae for the effective stiffnesses
   of perforated shells are derived on the basis of the obtained asymptotic
   solutions. The error of the applied asymptotic techniques is estimated
   and the high accuracy of the obtained solutions is demonstrated. (C)

   localized increase of pore pressure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{We model landslide initiation as slip surface growth driven by locally
   elevated pore pressure, with particular reference to submarine slides.
   Assuming an elastic medium and friction that weakens with slip,
   solutions exist in which the slip surface may dynamically grow, without
   further pore pressure increases, at a rate of the order of the sediment
   shear wave speed, a situation comparable to earthquake nucleation. The
   size of the rupture at this transition point depends weakly on the
   imposed pore pressure profile; however, the amount of slip at the
   transition depends strongly on whether the pore pressure was broadly or
   sharply elevated. Sharper profiles may result in pore pressures reaching
   the total slope-normal stress before dynamic rupture is nucleated. While
   we do not account for modes of failure other than pure slip on a failure
   surface, this may be an indication that additional modes involving
   liquefaction or hydraulic cracking may be factors in the initiation of
   shallow slope failure. We identify two length scales, one geometrical
   (h, depth below the free surface) and one material (l, determined by the
   frictional weakening rate) and a transition in nucleation behavior
   between effectively ``deep{''} and ``shallow{''} limits dependent on
   their ratio. Whether dynamic propagation of failure is indefinite or
   arresting depends largely on whether the background shear stress is
   closer to nominal peak or residual frictional strength. This is
   determined in part by background pore pressures, and to consider the
   submarine case we simplify a common sedimentation/consolidation approach
   to reflect interest in near-seafloor conditions.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{500-508}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{We consider a coordinated location-inventory model where distribution
   centers (DCs) follow a periodic-review (R,S) inventory policy and system
   coordination is achieved by choosing review intervals at the DCs from a
   menu of permissible choices. We introduce two types of coordination:
   partial coordination where each DC may choose its own review interval
   from the menu, and full coordination where all the DCs have an identical
   review interval. While full coordination increases the location and
   inventory costs, it likely reduces the overall costs of running the
   system (when the operational costs such as delivery scheduling are taken
   into account). The problem is to determine the location of the DCs to be
   opened, the assignment of retailers to DCs, and the inventory policy
   parameters at the DCs such that the total system-wide cost is minimized.
   The model is formulated as a nonlinear integer-programming problem and a
   Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is proposed to solve it. Computational
   results show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient. The results
   of our computational experiments and case study suggest that the
   location and inventory cost increase due to full coordination, when
   compared to partial coordination, is not significant. Thus, full
   coordination, while enhancing the practicality of the model, is
   economically justifiable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A review on the relation between simulation and improvement in hospitals}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Simulation applications on operations management in
   hospitals are frequently published and claim to support decision-making
   on operations management subjects. However, the reported implementation
   rates of recommendations are low and the actual impact of the changes
   recommended by the modeler has hardly been examined. This paper
   examines: 1) the execution rate of simulation study recommendations, 2)
   the research methods used to evaluate implementation of recommendations,
   3) factors contributing to implementation, and 4) the differences
   regarding implementation between literature and practice.
   Results: Altogether 16 hospitals executed the recommendations (at least
   partially). Implementation results were hardly reported upon; 1 study
   described a before-and-after design, 2 a partial before and after
   design. Factors that help implementation were grouped according to 1)
   technical quality, of which data availability, validation/verification
   with historic data/expert opinion, and the development of the conceptual
   model were mentioned most frequently 2) process quality, with client
   involvement and 3) outcome quality with, presentation of results. The
   survey response rate of traceable authors was 61\%, 18 authors
   implemented the results at least partially. Among these responses,
   evaluation methods were relatively better with 3 time series designs and
   2 before-and-after designs.
   Conclusions: Although underreported in literature, implementation of
   recommendations seems limited; this review provides recommendations on
   project design, implementation conditions and evaluation methods to
   increase implementation.
   Methods: A literature review in PubMed and Business Source Elite on
   stochastic simulation applications on operations management in
   individual hospitals published between 1997 and 2008. From those
   reporting implementation, cross references were added. In total, 89
   papers were included. A scoring list was used for data extraction. Two
   reviewers evaluated each paper separately; in case of discrepancies,
   they jointly determined the scores. The findings were validated with a
   survey to the original authors.}},

Abstract = {{This study employs thermo-economic analysis to establish a
   homeowner-centric valuation of renewable energy technologies. The
   evaluation methodology is illustrated using several classes of renewable
   energy technology, including, ground-source heat pumps, wind turbines,
   photovoltaic panels, and solar thermal water heaters. Energy systems
   employing each of these technologies are examined when servicing the
   typical domestic energy loads of a single-detached home. Through the
   analysis, it is learned that single-home photovoltaic systems produce
   energy at an annual cost approximately four times that of grid
   electricity, while wind energy systems deliver this energy at
   approximately twice the cost of grid electricity. Further,
   single-detached homeowners currently heating with fuel oil and/or grid
   electricity may expect to save between \$1000 and \$1800 per year when
   switching to a ground-source heat pump system; whereas those considering
   the implementation of a solar thermal water heater can expect to spend
   an additional \$245 per year for hot water. Investigation of larger
   scale renewable systems examined the performance of wind turbines and
   ground-source heat pumps when serving groups of single-detached homes;
   wind turbines were found to exhibit significant economies of scale. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: The knee osteoarthritis biomechanics literature is varied in
   how researchers deal with the potentially confounding effects of
   differences in walking speed between individuals with osteoarthritis and
   healthy controls, and between increasing levels of knee osteoarthritis
   severity. While many studies choose to have participants walk at a
   self-selected pace in an attempt to observe and capture natural joint
   mechanics, some have chosen to have individuals walk at various speeds
   and analyze trials at pre-determined speeds. Others have chosen to
   statistically control for the confounding effects of speed by using an
   analysis of covariance model. This has made it difficult to assimilate
   findings of various studies into a consensus of biomechanical changes
   potentially associated with disease initiation and progression. And it
   begs the question of which method(s) are correct.
   Methods: A discussion around this point is overdue and this report is an
   attempt to begin this discussion using some examples from the knee
   osteoarthritis literature.
   Findings and Interpretation: Key conclusions of this report include the
   inappropriateness of using an analysis of covariance to statistically
   control for speed in studies of knee osteoarthritis, and the need to use
   caution when interpreting the results of studies that control for speed
   in different ways. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Several fluids are available for volume therapy to address
   hypovolemia. We focus on two hydroxyethyl starches (HES) available for
   volume expansion in Canada, HES 130/0.4 (Voluven(R)) and HES 260/0.45
   (Pentaspan(R)). Although information is available regarding their
   pharmacokinetic and risk/benefit profiles, this paper examines their
   viscous properties.
   Methods Dynamic viscosities of HES 130/0.4 and HES 260/0.45 were
   measured through capillary viscometry at 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C.
   The viscosities of the solutions were then measured through a closed
   flow loop at room temperature across physiologically relevant flow rates
   that maintained a laminar flow regime.
   Results Measured dynamic viscosity through capillary viscometry for HES
   130/0.4 and HES 260/0.45 was 2.76 centipoises (cP) and 7.62 cP,
   respectively, at 21 degrees C decreasing to 1.74 cP and 4.25 cP,
   respectively, at 37 degrees C. Pipe flow analysis found that HES 130/0.4
   (expiry 02/13) and HES 260/0.45 (expiry 10/10) displayed marginal
   variation in viscosity suggesting Newtonian behaviour. However, a sample
   of HES 130/0.4 (expiry 10/10) displayed an appreciable increase in
   viscosity (13\%) at higher flow rates suggesting shear thickening
   behaviour.
   Conclusion This study represents an innovative characterization of not
   only the viscosity of two commonly utilized HES solutions but also their
   viscous behaviour across physiologically relevant flow rates. The shear
   thickening behaviour of a sample of HES 130/0.40 (expiry 10/10) at high
   flow rates was not expected, and the effect this result may have on
   endothelial cell function is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to use FFT imaging techniques to measure
   in-plane resonances of MEMS devices from blurred microphotographs where
   the presence of resonance is not visually discernable. A method is
   presented for measuring the high-frequency (in the 10s-100s of kHz
   range) response characteristics of MEMS devices using only standard
   optical microscope cameras (15-30 Hz frame rate) and applying Fourier
   analysis of camera images of periodic patterns on the oscillating
   devices. In the frequency domain, in-plane blurring acts as a low pass
   filter, attenuating all frequency components, but preferentially
   attenuating the higher order harmonics. A theoretical formula for the
   blur-induced attenuation of the harmonics of Fourier series components
   is derived and it is shown that it follows a Bessel curve. The
   theoretical predictions were verified experimentally using a series of
   camera microphotographs of three different variations of an
   electro-thermally driven pad suspended on springs. The predicted
   attenuations of harmonics were observed and verified. The analysis of
   the measured attenuation was able to (1) determine in-plane resonant
   frequencies, (2) measure submicron motions and (3) characterize the
   nonlinear dynamics (modeled by the Duffing equation). The amplitude
   uncertainty of the FFT method for detecting in-plane resonant peaks at
   75 kHz and 3.5 V was found to be +/- 0.027 mu m using a single image and
   +/- 0.011 mu m using an average of 10 images.}},

Abstract = {{Hurley ST, Hatfield Murdock GL, Stanish WD, Hubley-Kozey CL. Is there a
   dose response for valgus unloader brace usage on knee pain, function,
   and muscle strength? Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:496-502.
   Objective: To examine whether there was a dose response for valgus
   unloader brace wear on knee pain, function, and muscle strength in
   participants with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.
   Design: In this single-group study, participants with medial compartment
   knee osteoarthritis were followed for approximately 6 months.
   Setting: Recruitment was conducted in the general community, and testing
   was performed at a university laboratory.
   Participants: A convenience sample of patients (N=32) who were
   prescribed a valgus unloader brace agreed to participate, met the
   inclusion criteria, and completed the baseline data collection.
   Twenty-four participants (20 men, 4 women) completed baseline and
   follow-up collections.
   Intervention: Participants wore their valgus unloader brace as needed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Knee extensor, flexor, and plantar flexor
   strength was tested at baseline and follow-up. Participants filled out
   Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
   and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
   questionnaires to assess pain and function. Self-selected walking
   velocity and stride length were objective measures of function. Brace
   usage (dose) and activity (step count) were recorded at least 4
   days/week for the study duration.
   Results: Positive relationships existed between brace wear usage and
   percent change in step count (r=.59, P=.006) and percent change in
   hamstrings strength (r=.37, P=.072). At follow-up, there was significant
   improvement in hamstrings strength (P=.013), and trends toward
   improvements in WOMAC pain (P=.059) and WOMAC function (P=.089).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that greater brace use may positively
   affect physical activity level, but there was minimal effect of brace
   wear dosage on lower-limb muscle strength. Only knee flexion showed a
   positive relationship. Our finding of no decreased muscle strength
   indicates that increased brace use over a 6-month period does not result
   in muscle impairment.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth in global demand for natural gas as a fuel has led to
   expansion of the production capacity of existing gas processing trains
   and the design of new process trains. The increasing complexity of high
   performance processing systems leads to more complex failure modes and
   new safety issues. To physical properties of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
   such as its cryogenic temperature and flammability and vapor dispersion
   characteristics, add additional concerns of potential safety issues.
   Therefore, continuous monitoring and implementation of appropriate
   actions are essential to prevent, control and mitigate unfavorable
   consequences of LNG production and use. The newly developed accident
   modeling approach, SHIPP (System Hazard Identification, Prediction and
   Prevention), is an important part of a comprehensive safety management
   system that helps to maintain and manage these safety issues. This
   approach is used to model accidents in gas processing facilities using
   safety barriers. It identifies possible causal factors and potential
   consequences and provides quantitative results by combining fault and
   event tree analyses. The predictive model employed in this approach
   helps to forecast the number of abnormal events in ensuing time
   intervals. In the current work, SHIPP has been validated using data from
   an LNG processing facility. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of damage in vital and high-cost infrastructures has been one
   of the major concerns of operators of such structures in the past two
   decades. The growing demands in oil and gas have forced extraction of
   such vital fuels in deep waters. Bolted joints are widely used in pipes
   transporting oil and gas in deep waters. However, they do develop
   in-service problems, such as loosened bolts, which if remained
   undetected, could cause significant environmental damage and economical
   loss, especially in the case of pipes used in deep-water oil extraction.
   In this study, the energy damage index (EDI) calculated based on a novel
   vibration-based damage detection methodology using the empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD) is used to establish the existence of damage due to
   loosened bolts in common industrial bolted joints. A complete finite
   element (FE) model is established to simulate the whole process using
   the implicit dynamic solver of the commercial software ABAQUSA. Also, a
   comprehensive experimental program was designed and carried out to
   verify the FE results. Results show that the EDI based on the EMD method
   is a powerful tool for not only detecting the damage, but also the
   progression of the damage in bolted joints.}},

   method was applied in order to account for the large amount of latent
   energy stored during melting of the PCM and the moving interface between
   the solid and liquid phases. The effects of the heat transfer fluid
   (HTF) velocity on the melting rate of the PCM were studied for
   configurations having between 0 and 18 fins. Results show that the
   overall heat transfer rate to the PCM increases with an increase in the
   HTF velocity. However, the effect of the HTF velocity was observed to be
   small in configurations having very few fins, owing to the large
   residual thermal resistance offered by the PCM. However, the effect of
   the HTF velocity becomes more pronounced with addition of fins; since
   the thermal resistance on the PCM side of the LHESS is significantly
   reduce by the large number of fins in the system.}},

Abstract = {{River water temperature is an important water quality parameter that
   also influences most aquatic life. Physical processes influencing water
   temperature in rivers are highly complex. This is especially true for
   the estimation of river heat exchange processes that are highly
   dependent on good estimates of radiation fluxes. Furthermore, very few
   studies were found within the stream temperature dynamic literature
   where the different radiation components have been measured and compared
   at the stream level (at microclimate conditions). Therefore, this study
   presents results on hydrometeorological conditions for a small tributary
   within Catamaran Brook (part of the Miramichi River system, New
   Brunswick, Canada) with the following specific objectives: (1) to
   compare between stream microclimate and remote meteorological
   conditions, (2) to compare measured long-wave radiation data with those
   calculated from an analytical model, and (3), to calculate the
   corresponding river heat fluxes. The most salient findings of this study
   are (1) solar radiation and wind speed are parameters that are highly
   site specific within the river environment and play an important role in
   the estimation of river heat fluxes; (2) the incoming, outgoing, and net
   long-wave radiation within the stream environment (under the forest
   canopy) can be effectively calculated using empirical formula; (3) at
   the study site more than 80\% of the incoming long-wave radiation was
   coming from the forest; (4) total energy gains were dominated by solar
   radiation flux (for all the study periods) followed by the net long-wave
   radiation (during some periods) whereas energy losses were coming from
   both the net long-wave radiation and evaporation. Conductive heat fluxes
   have a minor contribution from the overall heat budget (<3.5\%); (5) the
   reflected short-wave radiation at the water surface was calculated on
   average as 3.2\%, which is consistent with literature values. Results of
   this study contribute towards a better understanding of river heat
   fluxes and water temperature models as well as for more effective
   aquatic resources and fisheries management. Copyright (c) 2011 John

Title = {{Effect of Silastic Sheeting over the Round Window Niche on Sound
   Transmission in the Intact Human Middle Ear}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Silastic sheeting is commonly used in middle ear surgery to
   prevent the formation of adhesions between the tympanic membrane and the
   medial bony wall of the middle ear cavity. This sheeting is often
   placed, advertently or inadvertently, so as to cover the round window
   niche. The effects of mechanically shielding the round window niche in
   the presence of an intact tympanic membrane and ossicular chain have not
   been empirically studied to date.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of acoustically shielding the round
   window with 1 mm thick Silastic sheeting on middle ear sound
   transmission in otherwise intact cadaveric human temporal bones.
   Methods: Using a fresh human cadaveric temporal model, a computerized
   laser Doppler vibrometry system was used to measure vibrations at the
   umbo and on the stapes footplate in response to sound introduced into
   the ear canal. Stapes displacement was used as a measure of sound
   transmission. The measurements were repeated after shielding the round
   window using 1 mm thick Silastic sheeting.
   Results: We found that shielding the round window with Silastic produced
   no significant difference in the measurements at the stapes footplate.
   At the umbo, a slight increase in vibrations at 250 to 500 Hz was
   measured after shielding. This was on the order of 3 dB and was not
   statistically significant.
   Conclusion: In the presence of an intact tympanic membrane and ossicular
   chain, shielding the round window with Silastic sheeting has no
   clinically significant effect on sound transmission by the human middle
   ear.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to develop an Al-Cu-Mg alloy with a low
   Cu/Mg ratio suitable for press and sinter powder metallurgy (PM)
   processing. A bulk composition of Al-2.3Cu-1.6Mg was explored for this
   purpose. Data revealed that the alloy exhibited a normal response to
   uni-axial die compaction with a performance that was aligned with
   commercial blends. Temperature and tin content were found to influence
   the sintering response. Once optimised, near-full theoretical density
   was achieved in the sintered product. The alloy was also responsive to
   T6 heat treatment. Peak hardness was attained by solutionising at 530
   degrees C and then aging at 200 degrees C for 20 h. Tensile data
   revealed that the alloy exhibited a very well balanced combination of
   properties in the T1 and T6 tempers. In this sense, relatively high
   values of yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were accompanied
   by wrought-like stiffness and levels of tensile ductility that were
   abnormally high for press and sinter aluminium PM alloys.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the eVect of impaired
   quadriceps function on knee joint biomechanics and neuromuscular
   function during gait. Surface electromyograms, three-dimensional motion
   and ground reaction forces were collected during gait before and after
   20 healthy adults completed a high intensity quadriceps fatigue
   protocol. Pattern recognition techniques were utilized to examine
   changes in amplitude and temporal characteristics of all gait variables.
   The fatigue protocol resulted in decreased knee extensor torque
   generation and quadriceps median power frequencies for 18 of 20
   participants (p < 0.05). The gait data from these 18 participants was
   analyzed. The knee external rotation angle increased (p < 0.05), the net
   external flexion and external rotation moments decreased (p < 0.05), and
   the net external adduction moment increased (p < 0.05). Post-fatigue
   changes in periarticular muscle activation patterns were consistent with
   the biomechanical changes, but were not significantly altered. Even for
   this low demand task of walking the knee motion and loading
   characteristics were altered following a high intensity fatigue protocol
   in a manner that may place the knee joint at greater risk for joint

Abstract = {{An experimental program was conducted to investigate the behavior and

   concrete masonry infilled steel frame specimens as well as one bare

   orientation of the frame column. The effect of each parameter on the
   failure mode, ultimate load, and stiffness of specimens is presented and
   discussed. Test results were then used to assess the efficacy of
   equations for the design of masonry infills suggested in the current
   design standards of both Canada and United States. The results show that
   the current Canadian design guidelines provide a markedly conservative
   design of masonry infills whereas the American design standard gives an
   improved estimate of infill stiffness and strength when compared with

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background and purpose The trabecular metal tibial monoblock component
   (TM) is a relatively new option available for total knee arthroplasty.
   We have previously reported a large degree of early migration of the
   trabecular metal component in a subset of patients. These implants all
   appeared to stabilize at 2 years. We now present 5-year RSA results of
   the TM and compare them with those of the NexGen Option Stemmed cemented
   tibial component (Zimmer, Warsaw IN).
   Patients and methods 70 patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to
   receive either the TM implant or the cemented component. RSA examination
   was done postoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years.
   RSA outcomes were translations, rotations, and maximum total point
   motion (MTPM) of the components. MTPM values were used to classify
   implants as ``at risk{''} or ``stable{''}.
   Results At the 5-year follow-up, 45 patients were available for
   analysis. There were 27 in the TM group and 18 in the cemented group.
   MTPM values were similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.9). The TM components
   had significantly greater subsidence than the cemented components (p =
   0.001). The proportion of ``at risk{''} components at 5 years was 2 of
   18 in the cemented group and 0 of 27 in the TM group (p = 0.2).
   Interpretation In the previous 2-year report, we expressed our
   uncertainty concerning the long-term stability of the TM implant due to
   the high initial migration seen in some cases. Here, we report stability
   of this implant up to 5 years in all cases. The implant appears to
   achieve solid fixation despite high levels of migration initially.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Torrefaction of some non-lignocellulose waste biomass was attempted to
   examine if such materials could benefit from this process as
   conventional lignocellulose biomass does. Experiments were conducted on
   chicken litter, digested sludge, and undigested sludge from a
   municipality in Canada. Effects of two important torrefaction process
   parameters: temperature and residence time on the torrefaction yield
   were studied. For reference, torrefaction of three lignocellulose
   biomass (switch grass, coffee husk, and wood pellet) was also carried
   out in the same apparatus under identical conditions. A comparison of
   torrefaction yield and other properties of these biomass showed that in
   spite of the large difference in their constitution the torrefaction
   behaviour of non-lignocellulose and lignocellulose biomass were similar.
   The increase in energy density after torrefaction and the effect of
   temperature and residence time on torrefaction were also similar for
   these two types. The present research made an important addition to the
   existing database on torrefaction of biomass by adding missing
   information on torrefaction of sludge and poultry litter. Additionally,
   this work unearthed a potential option for production of composite
   pellets of waste (e.g., sludge) mixed with biomass (e.g., switch grass).}},

Abstract = {{The overall objective of this study was to investigate the potential
   impact on settled water quality of using cement kiln dust (CKD), a waste
   by-product, to replace quicklime in the active treatment of acidic mine
   water. Bench-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the treatment
   performance of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) slurries generated using
   four different CKD samples compared to a control treatment with
   quicklime (CaO) in terms of reducing acidity and metals concentrations
   in acid mine drainage (AMD) samples taken from the effluent of a
   lead/zinc mine in Atlantic Canada. Results of the study showed that all
   of the CKD samples evaluated were capable of achieving greater than 97\%
   removal of total zinc and iron. The amount of solid alkaline material
   required to achieve pH targets required for neutralization of the AMD
   was found to be higher for treatment with the CKD slurries compared to
   the quicklime slurry control experiments, and varied linearly with the
   free lime content of the CKD. The results of this study also showed that
   a potential benefit of treating mine water with CKD could be reduced
   settled sludge volumes generated in the active treatment process, and
   further research into the characteristics of the sludge generated from
   the use of CKD-generated calcium hydroxide slurries is recommended. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the experimental results of sawdust gasification
   in a spoutfluid bed reactor. Three scenarios were investigated in this
   study. In the base case scenario, a total of 15 experiments consisting
   of three different flow rates (55, 65 and 75m(3) h(-1)) of primary air
   of each of having five equivalence ratios (ER) (0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2 and
   0.15) were conducted. The influence of secondary air in the freeboard
   and the effect of the recirculation of carryover captured by the cyclone
   to the reactor's freeboard at an ER of 0.25 were investigated in two
   other scenarios. Higher heating values of 3.02 and 5.15?MJ?Nm- 3 were
   obtained with the ER values of 0.35 and 0.15, respectively, in the base
   case. However, opposite trend was observed for the tar content in the
   producer gas. At ER of 0.35, a value of 2.35 g Nm(-3) was found compared
   with 8.4 g Nm(-3) at ER of 0.15. The tar content in the producer gas was
   reduced from 5.63 to 1.53 g Nm(-3) when secondary air was supplied in
   the freeboard due to an increase in temperature. The gasification
   efficiency was increased from 24.96\% at the base case to 36.22\% with
   the recirculation of carryover. Higher heating value of producer gas was
   found to be 4.2-4.4MJ Nm(-3) in this case. The second law analysis of
   this process estimated the average exergy efficiency as 35.92\% at ER of
   0.35 and it increased with increasing ER. The recirculation of carryover
   not only increased the carbon conversion efficiency but also the exergy
   efficiency. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   into a 2.5mm by 3.1mm endoscopic form factor. The array is a forward
   looking kerfless design based on PMN-32\% PT with an element-to-element
   pitch of 38 microns. In order to achieve such a miniaturized form
   factor, a novel technique of wire bonding the array elements to a
   miniature flex circuit oriented in line with the forward looking
   ultrasound beam was developed. A technique of scratch dicing the back of
   the array was also implemented in order to improve directivity of the
   array elements The array was fabricated with a single P(DVF-TrFE)
   matching layer and a TPX lens for passive elevation focussing to a depth
   of 7mm. The two-way -6dB pulse bandwidth was measured to be 55\% and the
   average electromechanical coupling (k(T)) for the individual elements
   was measured to be 0.62. The one-way directivity pattern from single
   elements was measured to be +/- 25 degrees, which was shown to be a
   large improvement compared to an identical kerfless array. The -3dB
   elevation focus resulting from a TPX lens was measured to be 152 microns
   at the focal depth (similar to 7mm).}},

Abstract = {{Pre-attentive segmentation is one of important process for object-based
   visual perception of cognitive robots. This paper proposes a
   Bhattacharyya distance based irregular pyramid method for pre-attentive
   segmentation. This algorithm hierarchically builds each level of the
   irregular pyramid by accumulating similar and spatially close nodes at
   the level below, with the result that the final segments emerge in this
   process as they are represented by single nodes at certain levels. The
   Bhattacharyya distance is used to estimate the intra-level similarity so
   as to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to noise. The
   ability to self-determine the number of segments is also developed for
   the pyramidal accumulation process by proposing an adaptive neighbor
   search method. Experimental results have shown that the proposed
   algorithm outperforms existing image segmentation algorithms in terms of
   segmentation accuracy and robustness to noise.}},

Abstract = {{Cement-based solidification/stabilization (S/S) is a widely used
   source-controlled treatment method for contaminated sediments.
   Increasingly, the technology is being used to remediate sites that
   contain high molecular weight organic compounds. The low level of
   organic content in cement-based S/S mixtures often creates a need for
   organic additives in the mixtures in order to improve the level of
   sorption in the treatment process. Very little work has been published
   related to the quantification of the sorption of organic contaminants to
   cement-based S/S mixtures and the level of improvement afforded by
   additives such as fly ash and organoclays. The objective of this study
   is to examine the sorption levels of naphthalene to several
   cement-treated soil mixtures with and without organic additives (i.e.,
   fly ash and organoclay) using batch testing. It is found that the
   sorption values of naphthalene vary but appear to be dependent on the
   amount of organic carbon present in the mixture. In order to assess the
   potential benefit of this improved sorption for field applications,
   contaminant migration modeling is performed using the results obtained.
   It is shown that cement-based S/S remediation systems can provide
   long-term protection against naphthalene contaminant migration,
   especially cement-based S/S mixtures with organoclay additives, for the
   assumptions considered in the modeling.}},

Abstract = {{IPv6 is often deployed in wireless sensor networks, and the advantages
   of such a deployment are well reported. For researchers which wish to
   experiment with new protocols or cross-layer design, there is often a
   choice of which IPv6 stack to base their work on. The FlexibleIP (FIP)
   stack presented here is an open-source design which makes documentation,
   code readability, and ease of modification a priority. In addition FIP
   provides compile-time options to support a wide variety of devices; it
   can fit into an 8-bit microcontroller, but can still use features
   typical when targeting larger microcontroller such as dynamic memory
   allocation for buffering many packets. The stack also offers excellent
   support for cross-layer design and hardware acceleration, two areas of
   special interest for low-power design. Conformance testing of the stack
   assures it adheres to relevant standards, and static analysis of the
   code is also performed. In addition to presenting this work, the paper
   highlights some design criteria that any IPv6 stack targeting low-power
   wireless networks should consider.}},

Abstract = {{Automatically detecting objects of interest in videos is a challenging
   issue since there is no prior knowledge about which objects should be
   detected and what these objects look like. The objects of interest can
   be defined as salient ones and the saliency can be measured by surprise
   theory. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for automatic object
   detection. It involves two modules: surprise estimation and object
   localization. The surprise estimation module first uses the surprise
   theory to obtain a saliency map which indicates the novelty of each
   pixel compared with its previous states. The object localization module
   then determines where the salient objects locate based on the
   branch-and-bound search algorithm. Experimental results have shown that
   the objects of interest in videos can be successfully localized by using
   the proposed automatic detection method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the power allocation problem in a transmit
   diversity wireless system with mean channel gain information. For a
   given set of mean channel gains between nodes, the aim is to find the
   power allocation and corresponding network topology that minimizes the
   total transmit power for nodes involved in the cooperative
   communications between the source and the destination, where all of the
   transmitters use single omnidirectional antennas. Specifically, the
   selection of store-and-forward relays deploying Alamouti-type
   distributed space-time coding along a multihop connection is proposed
   for a network with randomly distributed nodes and Rayleigh fading. By
   adapting the transmission power, the proposed data forwarding and
   processing schemes control the selection of relay nodes utilizing
   space-time coding to minimize the total energy required to transmit the
   information. In addition to addressing the geometric analysis of the
   power-efficient topology problem, this paper also focuses on finding
   computationally efficient algorithms for the selection of relay nodes
   which will result in a topology formation requiring close to minimum
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{Power utilities strive for optimal economic operation of their electric
   networks while considering the challenges of escalating fuel costs and
   increasing demand for electricity. The dynamic economic dispatch (DED)
   occupies a prominent place in a power system's operation and control. It
   aims to determine the optimal power outputs of on-line generating units
   in order to meet the load demand subject to satisfying various
   operational constraints over finite dispatch periods. Similar to most
   real-world complex engineering optimization problems, the nonlinear and
   nonconvex characteristics are more prevalent in the DED problem.
   Therefore, obtaining a truly optimal solution presents a challenge. In
   this paper, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm - a recently
   introduced population-based technique - is utilized to solve the DED
   problem. Integrating a renewable-energy source and analyzing its impact
   is considered as well. A sample test system with a dispatch period of
   24-hour is designated to validate the outcomes. The promising results
   prove that the ABC algorithm has a great potential to be applied in
   different electric power system optimization areas.}},

Abstract = {{Real-world optimization problems are very difficult and have high

   limitations (i.e., local solution attainment and/or divergence) in

   prove to be competent in outperforming deterministic algorithms,
   especially when the complexity of the problem increases. Practitioners
   have utilized those unconventional algorithms for the past few decades.
   This paper presents an overview of the literature employing the
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in their solution approach. The
   ABC algorithm is a recently introduced population-based meta-heuristic
   optimization technique inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of
   honeybee swarms. Key features of the ABC algorithm, as well as its

Abstract = {{Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) comprise on wireless mobile nodes that
   are communicating with each other without any infrastructure. Vehicular
   Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) is a special type of MANETs in which vehicles
   with high mobility need to communicate with each other. In this paper,
   we present a novel framework for link availability of paths for static
   as well as dynamic networks. Moreover, we evaluate our frame work for
   routing protocols performance with different number of nodes in MANETs
   and in VANETs. We select three routing protocols namely Ad-hoc On-demand
   Distance Vector (AODV), Fish-eye State Routing (FSR) and Optimized Link
   State Routing (OLSR). Furthermore, we have also modified default
   parameters of selected protocols to check their efficiencies.
   Performance of these protocols is analyzed using three performance
   metrics; Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Normalized Routing Overhead (NRO)
   and End-to-End Delay (E2ED) against varying scalabilities of nodes. We
   perform these simulations with NS-2 using TwoRayGround propagation
   model. The SUMO simulator is used to generate a random mobility pattern
   for VANETs. From the extensive simulations, we observe that AODV
   outperforms among all three protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant advancements in wireless sensor networks (WSNs),
   energy conservation remains one of the most important research
   challenges. Researchers have investigated architectures and topologies
   that allow energy efficient operation of WSNs. One of the popular
   techniques in this regard is clustering. While many researchers have
   investigated cluster head selection, this paper investigates the cluster
   formation. In particular, we propose a novel scheme, the Fuzzy Logic
   Cluster Formation Protocol (FLCFP), which uses Fuzzy Logic Inference
   System (FIS) in the cluster formation process. We demonstrate that using
   multiple parameters in cluster formation reduces energy consumption. We
   compare our technique with the well known LEACH protocol to show that
   using a multi parameter FIS enhances the network lifetime significantly.

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new data collection scheme using mobile
   actors in a large scale wireless sensor network (WSN). A mobile actor,
   or for convenience, M-actor is a mobile node that has powerful energy
   source, computation, and communication features. The mobile node is able
   to move freely through the sensor deployment, traversing through the
   radio transmission range of wireless sensor nodes to collect the sensed
   data. Once data from all sensors is collected, the M-actor returns to
   the base station to off-load the collected data. This paper makes two
   contributions. First, we present a heuristic to compute collection
   points, referred to as the rendezvous points (RPs). These points are
   computed such that full coverage is guaranteed. Second, the optimal path
   for the M-actor is modeled using a genetic algorithm (GA)based traveling
   salesman problem (TSP). The proposed scheme is evaluated through
   simulations. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
   significant improvement in reducing the tour length for the M-actor when
   compared with other schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel structure is proposed for power dividing and
   combining at millimeter-wave bands. It presents lower loss compared to
   circuit level power combining since its power-combining occurs in air
   space; in comparison with the traditional spatial power combining, it
   uses metal enclosures to prevent possible radiation loss. Simulations
   were performed on the proposed structure and a prototype was developed
   and tested. It was found that efficiencies of power combining in the Ka
   band and E band are 93.3\% and 71.6\%, while the bandwidths of return
   loss less than -20dB are more than 3GHz in the Ka band and 6GHz in the E
   band, respectively. The advantages of it include: low loss since power
   combining occurs in free space; simple structure and easy fabrication
   due to the use of conventional waveguide and microstrip structures; easy
   integration with MMICs because of the use of microstrip lines; good
   efficiency performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce Compact-Security (C-Sec), an energy
   efficient link layer encryption protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks
   (VVSNs). The protocol minimizes energy consumption by eliminating the
   need for transmitting all header and trailer fields related to security,
   while keeping security functions and services intact. Such fields
   include message authentication code, freshness counter, and source
   address. Our work relies on merging security related data with the
   essential headers of the next packet. This will dramatically reduce
   security related communication overhead. In addition, it includes a
   unique security feature that does not exist in any of the current
   protocols: hiding the packet header information. C-Sec is implemented
   using Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language
   (VHDL). Experimental results using synthesis for Spartan-6 low-power
   FPGA demonstrates that the proposed protocol outperforms related work in
   terms of computational time and energy consumption, in addition to the
   large savings in communication energy and bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal economic-emission dispatch problem (EED) is addressed in
   this paper considering the environmental aspects. To solve this
   multi-objective problem, a modified bacterial foraging algorithm (MBFA)
   is implemented. In addition to minimizing the cost function, the
   minimization of NOx, SO2 and CO2 gaseous emissions is also considered
   using the weighted-sum method. The BFA is an evolutionary optimization
   technique inspired by the foraging behavior of the E. coli bacteria. The
   BFA has been successfully used to tackle small scale optimization
   problems. However, when applied to larger constrained problems, it shows
   poor convergence properties. To overcome these difficulties, due to the
   complexity and high-dimensionality of the search space of the EED
   problem, significant modifications are introduced. The MBFA is applied
   to obtain the optimal or near optimal load dispatch and capture the
   trade-off set of solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In case of high dynamic topology, reactive routing protocols provide
   quick convergence by faster route discoveries and route maintenance.
   Frequent broadcasts reduce routing efficiency in terms of broadcast
   cost; B-k, and expected time cost; E{[}t]. These costs are optimized
   using different mechanisms. So, we select three reactive routing
   protocols; Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source
   Routing (DSR), and DYnamic Manet On-demad (DYMO). We model Expanding
   Ring Search (ERS); an optimization mechanism in the selected protocols
   to reduce B-k and E{[}t]. A novel contribution of this work is
   enhancement of default ERS in the protocols to optimize B-k and E{[}t].
   Using NS-2, we evaluate and compare default-ERS used by these protocols;
   AODV-ERS1, DSR-ERS1 and DYMO-ERS1 with enhanced-ERS; AODV-ERS2, DSR-ERS2
   and DYMO-ERS2. From modeling and analytical comparison, we deduce that
   by adjusting Time-To-Live (T T L) value of a network, efficient
   optimizations of B-k and E{[}t] can be achieved.}},

   current source with dynamic biasing is proposed. To increase the output
   impedance, a bulk-driven gain-boosted cascode feedback amplifier is
   used. Two dynamic biasing circuits are introduced: one is used to
   adaptively bias the gate of the current source output transistor while
   the other is used to supplement current into the output node when the
   output voltage is low. In addition, the dynamic biasing circuits help to
   boost the output impedance further. Simulation results show that under
   0.6 V supply voltage, the minimum output voltage is below 100 mV and the
   output impedance is over 200 M Omega.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic ion exchange (MIEX (R)) is an emerging technology for
   disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor removal in the drinking water
   industry. Although recent research has demonstrated that this technology
   is capable of achieving excellent natural organic matter (NOM) removal,
   there is paucity of published research showing the efficacy of ion
   exchange (IX) technology in cold water conditions. The overall objective
   of this research was to evaluate at bench-scale the potential impact of
   cold water operating conditions on enhanced coagulation with alum, MIEX
   (R) and a combination of MIEX (R) and low dose alum. All three
   treatments were evaluated at 1 and 20 degrees C with settled water
   quality compared in terms of turbidity, UV254, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), trihalomethane formation potential
   (THMFP) and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP). The results of
   the study showed that all three technologies evaluated were
   significantly impacted by cold water operating conditions in terms of
   turbidity removal, and UV254 removal was significantly reduced in both
   the MIEX (R) and MIEX (R)-Alum processes. However, treatment of the
   surface water with the combined process resulted in the highest removal
   of DBP precursor material and lowest THMFP and HAAFP concentrations at
   both temperatures compared to the individual unit operations.}},

Abstract = {{Port knocking is a technique by which only a single packet or special
   sequence will permit the firewall to open a port on a machine where all
   ports are blocked by default. It is a passive authorization technique
   which offers firewall-level authentication to ensure authorized access
   to potentially vulnerable network services. In this paper, we present
   performance evaluation and analytical comparison of three widely used
   port knocking (PK) algorithms, Aldaba, FWKNOP and SIG-2. Comparative
   analysis is based upon ten selected parameters; Platforms (Supported
   OS), Implementation (PK, SPA or both), Protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP), Out
   of Order packet delivery, NAT (Network Address Translation), Encryption
   Algorithms, Root privileges (For installation and operation), Weak
   Passwords, Replay Attacks and IPv6 compatibility. Based upon these
   parameters, relative performance score has been given to each algorithm.
   Finally, we deduce that FWKNOP due to compatibility with windows client
   is the most efficient among chosen PK implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatically actuated torsional micromirror fabricated using
   MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology is a fundamental
   building block for many optical network applications, such as optical
   wavelength-selective switch, configurable optical add-drop multiplexers
   and optical cross-connects. A two-dimensional (2D) micromirror
   functioning with a flexible secondary tilting offers tremendous value
   for the network designers. Commonly, electrostatic MEMS micromirrors
   have been designed with a gimbal surrounding the mirror plate and four
   square electrodes underneath. The main disadvantage of this type of
   design is the X-Y tilts are extensively coupled, which makes design of a
   control system difficult. In this work, design and control of an
   electrostatically actuated 2D MEMS micromirror has been reported.
   Triangular shaped electrodes have been used to achieve relative
   decoupling and a multi-loop proportional, integral and derivative (PID)
   controller is designed. The simulation results show that decoupling for
   small tilting angles has been achieved and that the controller can
   achieve a larger controllable tilting angle than the pull-in angle
   resulting in significantly enhanced device performance and
   functionality.}},

   over 96 hours of operation. The higher rate of flux decline observed was
   related to the water quality parameters observed in the Collins Park
   source water. Membrane autopsies were conducted on virgin and fouled
   membranes using different techniques to compare the fouling propensity
   of the two feed waters. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) results showed considerable difference between
   the fouled membranes fed with two source waters. Analyses of full-scale

   Li-ion cells have been examined using high precision coulometry and

   LiCoO2/graphite Li-ion cells cycled at low rates and elevated
   temperatures. The differential voltage versus capacity, dV/dQ vs Q, of
   the cells was measured for all cycles during the extended cycling and
   fit using predicted dV/dQ vs Q plots calculated from Li/graphite and
   Li/LiCoO2 cells made from the same electrodes that were used in the
   commercial cells. From this analysis it was possible to determine
   fraction of positive and negative electrode masses that remained active
   as a function of cycle number and also the portion of capacity loss due
   to the relative slippage of the positive and negative electrode
   potential-capacity curves. A rapid impedance rise was observed near the

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Gordon Arthur Riley (1911-1985) is remembered for his pioneering work in
   the development of marine ecosystem models during the mid-20th century.
   Using models that were necessarily simple because of the limited
   understanding of plankton physiology at the time, as well as the fact
   that calculations had to be done by hand, Riley studied the processes
   that control plankton stocks, production, and nutrient cycling, notably
   at Georges Bank. His great achievement lay not so much in the simulation
   of plankton dynamics per se, but rather in bringing to the fore the
   concept of using modeling as a means of explaining and interpreting the
   dynamics of marine ecosystems.
   In this article, we examine Riley's approach and philosophy to ecosystem
   modeling, which we discuss in context of modern day approaches. In
   particular, we focus on his landmark paper describing a model study of
   the dynamics of phytoplankton production on Georges Bank (Riley, 1946:
   J. Mar. Res., 6, 54-73). After reconstructing the model, we show how
   Riley created new mathematical characterizations of the environmental
   dependencies of each process in the phytoplankton equation, and how
   these relate to modern day formulations. We then reproduce Riley's
   results and conduct further analyses and sensitivity tests which serve
   to illustrate Riley's conviction that mathematical models can provide
   clear, rational explanations for the observed temporal changes in
   ecosystems.
   Riley's methods and outlook are discussed in context of the ongoing
   debate about the merits of complex versus simple marine ecosystem
   models. Based on our analyses of Riley's model, as well as his own
   critiques, we argue that although recent decades have seen a
   proliferation of complex ecosystem models that are intended to reflect
   our expanded understanding, the doctrines proposed by Riley are no less
   relevant today. In particular, Riley noted that while increasing model
   complexity is generally desirable, it can only be done within the
   confines afforded by observational data and knowledge of the physiology
   and ecology of key species and their interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Fulfilling worldwide energy demand in the 21st century is the most
   challenging problem. Current technologies simply cannot meet these
   demands. Therefore, we need new discoveries in underlying core science
   and engineering to find answers to this problem. Nanotechnology offers
   the prospect of opening an entirely new frontier for energy exploration,
   the ability to stretch the limits of our current energy sources and to
   go beyond these sources into new and uncharted territories.
   Nanotechnology is poised to impact dramatically on all sectors of the
   energy industry. There is great potential in nanotechnology research to
   revolutionize the petroleum industry and for the industry to capitalize

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the effects of aging on the flexural stiffness and
   bending loading capacity of a perforated glass fiber-reinforced epoxy
   composite subjected to combined moisture and elevated temperature.
   Specimens, in the configuration of one-quarter of a perforated GFRP
   tube, were aged in 60\% humidity and temperatures of 40, 60, and 80
   degrees C, respectively. Moisture absorptions of the specimens were
   measured during the aging process, and bending tests were conducted on
   the specimens after aging. The SEM images were also captured to further
   examine the effects of the moisture absorption on the aged specimens.
   The results indicated that the increase in the aging temperature reduced
   the diffusion coefficient, thus inducing more moisture absorption by the
   composite and in turn causing more reduction in composite's flexural
   stiffness and bending capacity. Moreover, the ability of Fick's equation
   for predicting the moisture absorption rate in such perforated
   thin-walled composite configuration at various moisture contents and
   temperatures was also assessed. A semiempirical equation was developed
   and proposed by which the reduction of the stiffness in the perforated
   aged GFRP structures could be predicted.}},

Title = {{Handling and updating uncertain information in bow-tie analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Bow-tie analysis is a fairly new concept in risk assessment that can
   describe the relationships among different risk control parameters, such
   as causes, hazards and consequences to mitigate the likelihood of
   occurrence of unwanted events in an industrial system. It also
   facilitates the performance of quantitative risk analysis for an
   unwanted event providing a detailed investigation starting from basic
   causes to final consequences. The credibility of quantitative evaluation
   of the bow-tie is still a major concern since uncertainty, due to
   limited or missing data, often restricts the performance of analysis.
   The utilization of expert knowledge often provides an alternative for
   such a situation. However, it comes at the cost of possible
   uncertainties related to incompleteness (partial ignorance), imprecision
   (subjectivity), and lack of consensus (if multiple expert judgments are
   used). Further, if the bow-tie analysis is not flexible enough to
   incorporate new knowledge or evidence, it may undermine the purpose of
   risk assessment.
   Fuzzy set and evidence theory are capable of characterizing the
   uncertainty associated with expert knowledge. To minimize the overall
   uncertainty, fusing the knowledge of multiple experts and updating prior
   knowledge with new evidence are equally important in addition to
   addressing the uncertainties in the knowledge. This paper proposes a
   methodology to characterize the uncertainties, aggregate knowledge and
   update prior knowledge or evidence, if new data become available for the
   bow-tie analysis. A case study comprising a bow-tie for a typical
   offshore process facility has also been developed to describe the
   utility of this methodology in an industrial environment. (C) 2011

Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{231-241}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{A comparative evaluation of eight models used to predict the dispersed
   phase mass transfer coefficient was undertaken using recent drop size
   and mass transfer data obtained under well known and controlled
   hydrodynamic conditions encountered in screen-type static mixers. A wide
   range of experimental conditions were covered (epsilon = 1.5-117 W/kg,
   phi = 0.1-0.47) thereby allowing for proper assessment of the strength
   and weaknesses of each model.
   All models failed to properly predict the experimental results over a
   wide range of design and operating conditions with the exception of
   those that contain a system-specific adjustable fitting parameter.
   Although these models yielded reasonably acceptable order-of-magnitude
   predictions, they could not accurately account for the variations in the
   different parameters investigated. This shows that proper understanding
   of the various factors affecting the dispersed phase mass transfer
   coefficient is still incomplete and highlights the need for
   phenomenological models that can account for the various physicochemical
   and hydrodynamic conditions on the dispersed-phase mass transfer
   coefficient. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There exists clinical evidence of fractures in adjacent vertebrae
   subsequent to vertebral augmentation procedures, such as vertebroplasty
   (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP). A potential contributory factor to such
   fractures may be the excessive mismatch of mechanical properties between
   contemporary bone cements (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and
   bisphenol-a-glycidyl dimethacrylate (BIS-GMA)) and bone. Aluminum-free
   glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) present an interesting alternative to
   conventional bone cements. GPCs adhere to the philosophy that implant
   materials should have mechanical characteristics similar to those of the
   bone, and also offer chemical adhesion and intrinsic bioactivity.
   However, their influence on the loading patterns of augmented vertebrae
   (as compared with conventional bone cements) is not available in the
   literature. The present work investigates how the moduli of PMMA,
   BIS-GMA and GPC implants affect the stress distribution within a single,
   augmented vertebra, in both healthy and osteoporotic states. Using a
   finite element model of the L4 vertebra derived from computed tomography
   data, with simulated augmentation, it was found that, as cement
   stiffness increased, stress was redistributed from the cortical and
   trabecular bone to the cement implant. The GPC implant exhibited the
   least effect on stress redistribution in both the healthy and
   osteoporotic models compared to its acrylic counterparts. The
   significance of this work is that, under simulated physiological loading
   conditions, aluminum-free GPCs exhibit stress distribution throughout
   the vertebral body similar to that of the healthy bone. In comparison to
   conventional augmentation materials, the use of aluminum-free GPCs in VP
   and KP may help to ameliorate the clinical complication of adjacent
   vertebral body compression fractures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Currently, there exists a considerable demand within the automotive
   industry for the development of aluminium-silicon alloys that can be
   processed through powder metallurgy (PM) technologies. As such, a study
   aimed at the development of a new hypoeutectic aluminium-silicon PM
   alloy (Al-6Si-4.5Cu-0.5Mg-0.2Sn) was recently undertaken. Although the
   preliminary data were encouraging, it was postulated that a refinement
   of the bulk alloy chemistry could yield additional gains. In the present
   work, the sintering response mechanical properties of this alloy were
   enhanced by making controlled adjustments in composition. The influence
   of the amount and raw powdered sources of copper, magnesium and tin were
   the principal variables investigated. Using XRD and metallographic
   examination, it was determined that a decrease in the copper content to
   3.0 wt-\% improved ductility significantly. Furthermore, the
   incorporation of magnesium as an elemental powder versus an Al-Mg master
   alloy improved sintering behaviour significantly, while tin additions up
   to 0.2 wt-\% increased yield stress and hardness. The optimised alloy
   exhibited a threefold increase in ductility as well as a 25\% gain in
   yield strength.}},

   is a variable disease with changes in symptoms and airway function over
   many time scales. Airway resistance (Raw) is variable and thought to
   reflect changes in airway smooth muscle activity, but just how variation
   throughout the airway tree and the influence of gas distribution
   abnormalities affect Raw is unclear. We used a multibranch airway lung
   model to evaluate variation in airway diameter size, the role of
   coherent regional variation, and the role of gas distribution
   abnormalities on mean Raw ((R) over bar aw) and variation in Raw as
   described by the SD (SDRaw). We modified an anatomically correct airway
   tree, provided by Merryn Tawhai (The University of Auckland, New
   Zealand), consisting of nearly 4,000 airways, to produce temporal and
   spatial heterogeneity. As expected, we found that increasing the
   diameter variation by twofold, with no change in the mean diameter,
   increased SDRaw more than fourfold. Perhaps surprisingly, (R) over bar
   aw was proportional to SDRaw under several conditions-when either mean
   diameter was fixed, and its SD varied or when mean diameter varied, and
   SD was fixed. Increasing the size of a regional absence in gas
   distribution (ventilation defect) also led to a proportionate increase
   in both R (R) over bar aw and SDRaw. However, introducing regional
   dependence of connected airways strongly increased SDRaw by as much as
   sixfold, with little change in (R) over bar aw. The model was able to
   predict previously reported Raw distributions and correlation of SDRaw
   on Raw in healthy and asthmatic subjects. The ratio of SDRaw to (R) over
   bar aw depended most strongly on interairway coherent variation and only
   had a slight dependence on ventilation defect size. These findings may
   explain the linear correlation between variation and mean values of Raw
   but also suggest that regional alterations in gas distribution and local
   coordination in ventilation amplify any underlying variation in airway
   diameters throughout the airway tree.}},

Abstract = {{Fat-structured food materials are an important component of our diet.
   The role that fat plays in material functionality, flavor perception,
   texture and health characteristics is due in large part to its physical
   properties. An understanding of these physical properties is relevant
   from scientific, technological and medical perspectives. The physical
   properties of fat materials, are, in turn, governed by a complex
   confluence of the various structural levels in a fat material beginning
   with triglyceride molecules. The formation of nanoscale structural
   elements by these molecules is the first step in the formation of a fat
   material as we know it. This review shows how these microstructural
   elements can be imaged and characterized. It is also shown that the
   formation of these nanocrystals is affected by the attendant
   crystallization parameters. Through simulation and a discussion of van
   der Waals forces, it is shown that these nanoscale elements assemble
   into colloidal aggregates with fractal character. The influence of
   microstructure on the mechanical properties of a fat material is
   explained using a variety of mechanical models. Lastly, this review
   examines methods by which the properties and characteristics of the
   various structural levels can be engineered. Shear has been shown to
   affect the polymorphism and phase transition kinetics of triglyceride
   crystals. As well, shear has been shown to modify the aggregation of
   nanocrystals, with consequences for the porosity and diffusivity of oil
   through the fat crystal network.}},

Abstract = {{Perforated and slotted tubes are widely used as liners in oil and gas
   industry to facilitate the collection of products from reservoirs, and
   prevent sand migration to wellbore, which in return could cause product
   contamination and affect functionality of the pumps. The objective of
   this research is to establish the critical axial load of perforated
   E-glass/epoxy tubes using numerical and experimental methods. Firstly,
   in an experimental attempt, a total of six sets of composite tubes
   (three sets with perforations and three sets of intact (non perforated)
   tubes), having two different thicknesses and diameters, were fabricated
   and tested under axial compression. The reduction in the critical load
   and axial stiffness of the composite tubes was investigated
   experimentally. Secondly, a comprehensive numerical investigation was
   carried out, using the finite element method (FEM), to simulate the
   instability response of the intact and perforated composite tubes under
   compressive axial loading. The effect of various parameters such as the
   tube diameter, size, number of perforation and wall thickness were
   investigated in the current research. Good correlation is obtained
   between the experimental and numerical results. According to the
   results, the intact and perforated tubes showed similar instability mode
   shapes under the axial loading. However, the critical load and global
   stiffness of the perforated tubes were considerably reduced. (C) 2011

Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{197-212}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates equilibrium of a pressurized plastic fluid
   invading a tensile wellbore crack in a linear elastic, permeable rock.
   The crack is initially filled by pore fluid at ambient pressure, that is
   immiscibly displaced by the plastic fluid invading from the wellbore.
   The plastic fluid comes to rest to form a ``plug{''} within the
   elastically deformed crack when the limit equilibrium between the shear
   stresses generated at the fracture walls and the pressure drop between
   the wellbore wall and the crack tip is reached. The model assumes that
   the leak-off of the plastic fluid into the rock is negligible, while the
   displaced pore fluid in the crack tip region is freely exchanged with
   the surrounding permeable rock to maintain the ambient pressure level.
   When the crack length e is small or large compared to the wellbore
   radius R, the problem reduces to that of a pressurized edge or
   Griffith's crack, respectively, subjected to a uniform far-field
   confining stress. In these two end-member cases, the normalized solution
   for the net pressure distribution, the plug length, and the stress
   intensity factor at the crack tip is obtained as a function of two
   numbers - the normalized net fluid pressure at the crack inlet and at
   the crack tip (partial plugs only) - that embody the solution's
   dependence on the wellbore and the far field loading, the fluid yield
   strength, and the rock modulus. In the general case of an intermediate
   crack length (l similar to R), the normalized solution is a function of
   two additional parameters, the length-to-radius ratio and a normalized
   measure of the far field stress anisotropy, respectively, which accurate
   approximation is devised from an end-member solution using a rescaling
   argument. The equilibrium plug solutions are used to evaluate the
   breakdown pressure, the critical wellbore pressure at which the crack
   propagation condition is first met, and to analyze the stability of the
   ensuing crack propagation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) contain numerous sensor nodes having
   limited power resource, which report sensed data to the Base Station
   (BS) that requires high energy usage. Many routing protocols have been
   proposed in this regard achieving energy efficiency in heterogeneous
   scenarios. However, every protocol is not suitable for heterogeneous
   WSNs. Efficiency of protocol degrades while changing the heterogeneity
   parameters. In this paper, we first test Distributed Energy-Efficient
   Clustering (DEEC), Developed DEEC (DDEEC), Enhanced DEEC (EDEEC) and
   Threshold DEEC (TDEEC) under several different scenarios containing high
   level heterogeneity to low level heterogeneity. We observe thoroughly
   regarding the performance based on stability period, network life time
   and throughput. EDEEC and TDEEC perform better in all heterogeneous
   scenarios containing variable heterogeneity in terms of life time,
   however TDEEC is best of all for the stability period of the network.
   However, the performance of DEEC and DDEEC is highly effected by
   changing the heterogeneity parameters of the network.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasing to handle complex
   situations and functions. In these networks some of the nodes become
   Cluster Heads (CHs) which are responsible to aggregate data of from
   cluster members and transmit it to Base Stations (BS). Those clustering
   techniques which are designed for homogenous network are not enough
   efficient for consuming energy. Stable Election Protocol (SEP)
   introduces heterogeneity in WSNs, consisting of two type of nodes. SEP
   is based on weighted election probabilities of each node to become CH
   according to remaining energy of nodes. We propose Heterogeneity-aware
   Hierarchal Stable Election Protocol (HSEP) having two level of energies.
   Simulation results show that HSEP prolongs stability period and network
   lifetime, as compared to conventional routing protocols and having
   higher average throughput than selected clustering protocols in WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with increase in ageing population, Health care market keeps
   growing. There is a need for monitoring of Health issues. Body Area
   Network consists of wireless sensors attached on or inside human body
   for monitoring vital Health related problems e. g, Electro Cardiogram
   (ECG), ElectroEncephalogram (EEG), ElectronyStagmography(ENG) etc. Data
   is recorded by sensors and is sent towards Health care center. Due to
   life threatening situations, timely sending of data is essential. For
   data to reach Health care center, there must be a proper way of sending
   data through reliable connection and with minimum delay. In this paper
   transmission delay of different paths, through which data is sent from
   sensor to Health care center over heterogeneous multi-hop wireless
   channel is analyzed. Data of medical related diseases is sent through
   three different paths. In all three paths, data from sensors first
   reaches ZigBee, which is the common link in all three paths. After
   ZigBee there are three available networks, through which data is sent.
   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for
   Microwave Access (WiMAX), Universal Mobile Telecommunication System
   (UMTS) are connected with ZigBee. Each network (WLAN, WiMAX, UMTS) is
   setup according to environmental conditions, suitability of device and
   availability of structure for that device. Data from these networks is
   sent to IP-Cloud, which is further connected to Health care center. Main
   aim of this paper is to calculate delay of each link in each path over
   multi-hop wireless channel.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid is a modified form of electrical grid where generation,
   transmission, distribution and customers are not only connected
   electrically but also through strong communication network with each

   achieving good communication link among them, it is very necessary to
   find suitable protocol. In this paper, we discuss different hardware
   techniques for power monitoring, power management and remote power
   controlling at home and transmission side and also discuss the
   suitability of Zigbee for required communication link. Zigbee has major
   role in monitoring and direct load controlling for efficient power
   utilization. It covers enough area needed for communication and it works
   on low data rate of 20Kbps to 250Kbps with minimum power consumption.

Abstract = {{This work focusses on analyzing the optimization strategies of routing

   against modeled constraints, we select four cluster based routing
   protocols; Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), Threshold
   Sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network (TEEN), Stable Election
   Protocol (SEP), and Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC). To
   validate our mathematical framework, we perform analytical simulations

Abstract = {{In this paper, we compare problems of cluster formation and cluster-head
   selection between different protocols for data aggregation and
   transmission. We focus on two aspects of the problem: (i) how to guess
   number of clusters required to proficiently consume available sources
   for a sensor network, and (ii) how to select number of cluster-heads to
   cover up sensor networks more proficiently. A sensor in Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSNs) can communicate directly only with other sensors that
   are within a radio range in a cluster. However, in order to enable
   communication between sensors not within communication range, they must
   form new clusters in distributed sensors. Several clustering algorithms
   such as LEACH, DEEC, and SEP have been proposed with the objectives of
   energy minimization, route-path selection, increased connectivity and
   network longevity. LEACH protocol and the similar ones assume an energy
   homogeneous system where a node is not likely to fail due to failure in
   connectivity and packet dropping. More recent protocols like SEP and
   TEEN considered the reverse that is energy heterogeneity which is more
   applicable to case of WSNs. We developed a bi-dimensional chain model to
   select average number of for DEEC. Simulation results are used to
   compare performance of different protocols to found optimal solutions of
   above mentioned problems.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evidence showed heat transfer improvements in laminated
   films made from polyethylene outer layers and an aluminum core. The
   mechanism for the heat transfer enhancements apply only to heat sources
   that do not cover the entire laminate sheet domain, i.e. finite heat
   sources. Seeded salt hydrate PCMs, used for seasonal heat storage, and
   ceramic stovetop heating elements are examples of finite heat sources.
   Theoretical 1D, symmetric heat balance equations were solved to predict
   temperature distributions in the aluminum core of the laminate sheets as
   well as the overall rate of heat transfer. Simulations in COMSOL
   Multiphysics 4.2a proved that the 1D equations captured the heat
   transfer mechanism with equal accuracy to 2D symmetric finite element
   solutions. Model validation was achieved using IR thermography of
   laminate films that were heated from behind with electric heating
   strips. Waste laminate sheets from post-consumer Tetra Pak cartons were
   obtained in house and from Klabin's paper mill in Piracicaba, Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a carrier frequency offset (CFO) correction
   technique for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) by
   exploiting baseband characteristics of the Nyquist sampled received
   signal Fourier transform. The novelty of our algorithm is to capture the
   inter-carrier interference (ICI) effects using a cost function called
   CFO characteristic function (CF). The CFO CF is derived analytically by
   considering the structured nature of CFO effects. Using pilot data in an
   OFDM frame, we convert the matrix relation capturing the ICI effects in
   the OFDM signal to a functional representation of CFO. By finding
   numerically the root of this function, the CFO is estimated and
   consequently canceled. The computational complexity of the proposed
   receiver is significantly reduced by working with efficient numerical
   methods for root estimation. Robustness of the proposed ICI reduction is
   demonstrated at the expense of an increased computational complexity at
   the receiver, making this scheme attractive in practical communication
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-reactors offer distinct advantages over batch reactors currently
   used within the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Their high
   surface area-to-volume ratios allow for increased heat and mass
   transfer, which is important for controlling reaction selectivity. In
   addition, micro-reactors are compatible with continuous processing
   technology, circumventing the time delays inherent to batch systems.
   Rapid mixing of reactants within micro-reactors is, however, limited by
   the inherent difficulty of generating turbulence at reduced geometry
   scales. Several different passive mixing strategies have been proposed
   in order to produce eddy-based secondary flows and chaotic mixing. This
   study examines the effectiveness of these strategies by comparing the
   energy-density normalized heat and mass transfer coefficients for a
   selection of industrial micro-reactors. First single, then two-phase
   liquid-liquid experiments were conducted. Pressure drop measurements
   were obtained to calculate friction factors and to verify the presence
   of eddy-based secondary flows. A hot heat exchange fluid and temperature
   measurements were used to estimate the internal convective heat transfer
   coefficients within each structure. Volumetric mass transfer
   coefficients were also determined for the mutual extraction of partially
   miscible n-butanol and water. Semi-empirical correlations for the
   reactors' friction factor and Nusselt number as well as a description of
   the overall mass transfer coefficient based on energy dissipation are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed experimental and computational
   investigation of the effects of scalloping on the mixing mechanisms of a
   scaled 12-lobe turbofan mixer. Scalloping was achieved by eliminating
   approximately 70\% of the lobe sidewall area. Measurements were made
   downstream of the mixer in a co-annular wind tunnel and the simulations
   were carried out using an unstructured RAINS solver, Numeca FINE/Hexa,
   with k-omega SST model. In the core flow, the swirl angle was varied
   from 0 degrees to 30 degrees. At high swirl angles, a three-dimensional
   separation bubble was formed on the lobe's suction surface penetration
   region and resulted in the generation of a vortex at the lobe valley.
   The valley vortex quickly dissipated downstream. Most of the swirl was
   removed by the lobes, but scalloping allowed residual swirl to persist
   downstream of the mixer. The interaction of the swirling flow and the
   vortices resulted in improved mixing rates for the scalloped mixer.
   Inlet swirl up to 100 provided improved mixing rates, reduced pressure
   loss and thrust loss for both mixers. High inlet swirl resulted in
   improved mixing but produced higher pressure and thrust losses as
   compared to the zero swirl case. At high swirl, the scalloped mixer
   resulted in better mixing and lower pressure losses than the unscalloped
   mixer, but at the expense of reduced thrust.}},

   dispersion curve of the semiconductor/dielectric interface. The surface
   plasmon waves, when excited, become short wavelength waves in the
   optical frequency or THz region. A silicon/air structure was used as our
   semiconductor/dielectric material combination, and comparisons were made
   to optical plasmons generated without losses. Our initial numerical
   calculation results show enormous potential for use in several
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced cermets based on titanium carbide (TiC), with a ductile nickel
   aluminide (Ni3Al) binder, have shown significant promise for use in a
   variety of demanding wear environments, due to a combination of high
   strength and good corrosion behaviour. In the present study, TiC-Ni3Al
   composites were produced by melt infiltration, using aqueous slip cast
   TiC preforms, and Ni3Al binder contents from 10 to 50 vol. \%. These
   samples were subjected to spherical indentation testing, with applied
   loads from 250 to 2000 N, using WC-Co spheres ranging in diameter from
   1.19 to 2.38 mm. Indentation stress-strain curves were determined and
   compared to the calculated elastic (i.e. Hertzian) response. The bonded
   interface method was used to examine the subsurface damage of the
   cermets after indentation. Significant deformation of the binder and the
   eventual fracture of TiC grains were observed. The nature of the
   quasi-plasticity of TiC-Ni3Al, and the affect of binder content on
   surface and subsurface deformation, are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier
