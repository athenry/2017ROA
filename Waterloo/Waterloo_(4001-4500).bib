Abstract = {{This study investigates the suitability of multivariate techniques,
   including principal component analysis and discriminant function
   analysis, for analysing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and heavy
   metal-contaminated aquatic sediment data. We show that multivariate
   ``fingerprint{''} analysis of relative abundances of contaminants can
   characterize a contamination source and distinguish contaminated
   sediments of interest from background contamination. Thereafter,
   analysis of the unstandardized concentrations among samples contaminated
   from the same source can identify migration pathways within a study area
   that is hydraulically complex and has a long contamination history,
   without reliance on complex hydrodynamic data and modelling techniques.
   Together, these methods provide an effective tool for drinking water
   source monitoring and protection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A basic hierarchical graph model with three decision makers is developed
   and used to analyze a water diversion conflict in China. This
   hierarchical graph model combines two component graph models. The
   theoretical framework of the combined model is constructed using the
   decision makers, states, moves, and preference structures from the
   component models. Theorems are developed to relate stable states in the
   hierarchical model to stable states in local graph models. This novel
   approach can avoid direct calculation for four hierarchical stabilities.
   This methodology is applied to a water diversion conflict in China,
   consisting of conflicts at two locations where it is proposed to divert
   water from the south to the north of the country. The analytical results
   show how decision makers can obtain strategic resolutions for the entire

Journal = {{FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-60}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The goal of runtime verification is to monitor the behavior of a system
   to check its conformance to a set of desirable logical properties. The
   literature of runtime verification mostly focuses on event-triggered
   solutions, where a monitor is invoked when an event of interest occurs
   (e.g., change in the value of some variable). At invocation, the monitor
   evaluates the set of properties of the system that are affected by the
   occurrence of the event. This constant invocation introduces two major
   defects to the system under scrutiny at run time: (1) significant
   overhead, and (2) unpredictability of behavior. These defects are
   serious obstacles when applying runtime verification on safety-critical
   systems that are time-sensitive by nature.
   To circumvent the aforementioned defects in runtime verification, in
   this article, we introduce a novel time-triggered approach, where the
   monitor takes samples from the system with a constant frequency, in
   order to analyze the system's health. We describe the formal semantics
   of time-triggered monitoring and discuss how to optimize the sampling
   period using minimum auxiliary memory. We show that such optimization is
   NP-complete and consequently introduce a mapping to Integer Linear
   Programming. Experiments on a real-time benchmark suite show that our
   approach introduces bounded overhead and effectively reduces the
   involvement of the monitor at run time by using negligible auxiliary
   memory. We also show that in some cases it is even possible to reduce
   the overall overhead of runtime verification by using our time-triggered
   approach when the structure of the system allows choosing a long enough
   sampling period.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of thermal creep on the development of gaseous fluid flow
   and heat transfer in rectangular microchannels with constant wall
   temperature are investigated in the slip-flow regime. Thermal creep
   arises from tangential temperature gradients, which may be significant
   in the entrance region of channels, and affects the velocity and
   temperature fields particularly in low Reynolds number flows. In the
   present work, the Navier-Stokes and energy equations coupled with
   velocity-slip and temperature-jump conditions applied at the channel
   walls are solved numerically using a control-volume technique. Despite
   the constant wall temperature, tangential temperature gradients form in
   the gas layer adjacent to the wall due to the temperature-jump
   condition. The effects of slip/jump and thermal creep on the flow
   patterns and parameters are studied in detail for a wide range of
   channel aspect ratios and, Knudsen and Reynolds numbers. Furthermore,
   the effects of variable properties on velocity-slip and, friction and
   heat transfer coefficients are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental approach using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   has been applied to quantify the solid/liquid interface kinetics during
   the isothermal solidification stage of transient liquid phase (TLP)
   bonding in an Ag-Au-Cu ternary alloy solid/liquid diffusion couple.
   Eutectic Ag-Au-Cu foil interlayers were coupled with pure Ag base metal
   to study the effects of two solutes on interface motion. Experimental
   effects involving baseline shift and primary solidification contribute
   to a systematic underestimation of the fraction of liquid remaining. A
   temperature program has been used to quantify and correct these effects.
   The experimental results show a linear relationship between the
   interface position and the square root of the isothermal hold time. The
   shifting tie line composition at the interface has been shown to affect
   the DSC results; however, the impact on the calculated interface
   kinetics has been shown to be minimal in this case. This work has
   increased the knowledge of isothermal solidification in ternary alloy
   systems and developed accurate experimental methods to characterize
   these processes, which is valuable for designing TLP bonding schedules.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and morphology of beta-Mg17Al12 intermetallic phase in
   resistance spot-welded AZ80 Mg alloy were investigated by means of
   optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
   The influence of intermetallic phase on mechanical strength was studied
   by tensile shear testing and fractography. The results showed that
   continuous networks of beta-Mg17Al12 formed along grain boundaries in
   both the nugget and heat-affected zone of the spot-welded AZ80 Mg alloy.
   Those continuous grain-boundary beta-Mg17Al12 networks acted as
   effective crack propagation paths, which had negative effects on the
   weld strength. Post-weld solution heat treatment effectively reduced the
   amount of beta-Mg17Al12 and broke the grain-boundary intermetallic
   networks in both the nugget and heat-affected zone. This significantly
   increased the weld strength of AZ80 Mg alloy and changed the fracture
   mode from nugget pull-out in the as-welded condition to

   Fe-Al phase), pure Zn coating, pre-existing Fe-Al phase and fresh steel
   without any coating. The presence of Zn coating was found to
   significantly improve the wettability of liquid filler on steel.
   However, Mg-Zn products enriching at the seam head tended to cause
   cracking. The weak bonding of Mg-Zn products and Fe-Al layer was mainly
   responsible for the decreased tensile strength and interfacial failure
   that occurred in joints with the first two coatings. For joints with the
   latter two coatings, the thickness of newly formed Fe-Al layer
   determined the mechanical properties. The reaction layer formed at the
   Mg/fresh steel was thin, inducing interfacial failure, whereas the joint
   with pre-existing Fe-Al phase fractured at the seam, indicating that the
   pre-existing Fe-Al phase was beneficial to formation and growth of the
   Fe-Al phase.}},

Abstract = {{Laser-tungsten inert gas (TIG) hybrid welding has been developed for
   joining Mg alloys to Zn coated steel in a lap joint configuration. The
   joint could not be produced in laser or arc welding only, while
   acceptable joints without obvious defects were obtained with a
   relatively wide processing window in the hybrid process. Two reaction
   layers were observed to form at the interface and were identified as
   Mg-Zn eutectic structure (alpha-Mg + MgZn) and Fe3Al phase by TEM
   analysis. In some cases, Al6Mn phase also formed adjacent to the Fe-Al
   reaction layer. The tensile-shear strength attained the maximum value of
   68 MPa, representing 52.3\% joint efficiency relative to Mg base metal.
   The element Al from AZ31B Mg alloys diffused to the liquid/solid
   interface and then reacted with the elements from steel, such as Fe and
   Mn, contributing to the metallurgical bonding at the interface. The weak
   bonding between Mg-Zn reaction layer and newly formed Fe-Al layer
   resulted in the interfacial failure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The determination of work programmes for bridges that maximise benefit
   to all stakeholders requires consideration of not only the condition of
   the elements of which a bridge is comprised, but also the performance of
   the structure as a whole. This is required because although some costs
   can be related to the condition of the elements, others, such as the
   costs of travelling over the bridge, cannot. One possible methodology to
   do this involves linking relevant costs to structure performance states
   (SPS) that are determined from the element condition states (CSs).
   However, even a bridge with a moderate number of elements and element
   CSs results in a large number of possible SPSs and an unwieldy amount of
   required work to estimate the costs associated with each. This work can
   be drastically reduced, however, by exploiting the almost linear system
   behaviour of the bridge that can occur between many combinations of
   element CSs. This article presents a methodology for relating SPSs to
   element CSs for the purpose of determining structure level costs. This
   methodology is demonstrated in several examples, wherein the effects of
   exploiting the linearity of the system behaviour to reduce the
   computational effort are also explored.}},

Abstract = {{We present theory of the carrier-optical interaction in 1D systems based

   As representative parameters, we chose the GaAs. Results and discussion
   section is based on the simplified model such as 2 x 2 k.p model (two
   transverse modes). Even though 2 x 2 k.p model is simple enough, it
   shows many phenomena that have not been seen before. We focus mainly on
   the ballistic extraction of photogenerated free carriers at the
   radiative limit which is described by the self-energy term derived in
   dipole approximation and solved in self-consistent manner with Keldysh
   quantum kinetic equations. Any relaxation or non-radiative recombination
   mechanisms as well as excitonic features are neglected. Effect of
   non-locality of electron-photon self energy term is considered and
   discussed. Spontaneous emission is also considered and shown to be small
   in short devices under medium bias conditions. Electron and hole spatial
   current oscillations are seen and discussed. It is shown that neglecting
   off-diagonal correlation in the band index not only produces
   quantitatively wrong results but it also alters the qualitative picture.
   All simulations are done in the full-rank approximation, with all
   spatial and band correlation effects kept intact. This allows us to
   study not only quantitative effects but also qualitative behaviour. (C)

   significant differences are observed for the reflectance characteristics
   of the s- and p-polarized beams. A narrow wavelength band of increased
   absorption is reported by analyzing the reflectance using the finite
   difference time domain method. The center wavelength of this band shifts
   toward higher wavelengths as the diameter of the nanowires increases
   achieving tunable absorption spectra within the nanowires. The
   wavelength band shifts at a rate of approximately 3.3 nm with every 1 nm
   increment in diameter. The increased absorption is achieved due to modal
   excitation and near-field coupling between the nanowires. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{The phase transformations occurring as a function of the ball milling
   energy injected into the hydride system (LiNH2 + nMgH(2)), having molar
   ratios n = 0.5-2.0, have been thoroughly studied. The milling energy in
   a magneto-mill is estimated by a semi-empirical method. Xray diffraction
   (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements show that for
   the molar ratios n < 1.0 three new phases such as LiH, amorphous
   Mg(NH2)(2) (a-Mg(NH2)(2)) and Li2Mg(NH)(2) are formed during ball
   milling depending on the injected quantity of milling energy. Hydrogen
   is not released during milling when the LiH and a-Mg(NH2)(2) hydrides
   are being formed whereas the formation of the Li2Mg(NH())2 hydride phase
   is always accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen. For the molar
   ratios n >= 1.0, at a low level of injected milling energy, the hydride
   phases formed are LiH and a-Mg(NH2)(2). The latter reacts with MgH2
   during further milling to form the new phase MgNH whose formation is
   also accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen. Based on the
   experimental data we established an approximate hydride phase-injected
   milling energy diagram for various levels of injected milling energy and
   the molar ratios. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Objective: Vehicle impacts with fixed roadside structures, such as
   poles, constitute a significant portion of road fatalities in North
   America. The purpose of this study was to evaluate occupant response in
   pole crash scenarios and compare the current vehicle kinematic-based
   injury metrics to occupant-based metrics to determine whether the
   vehicle metrics are representative of the injury levels sustained by an
   occupant.
   Methods: To better understand vehicle and occupant response during
   impact with a pole, frontal crash scenarios with 3 common pole types (a
   rigid pole, a rigid pole with a frangible base, and a deforming or
   energy-absorbing pole) were investigated at various impact velocities. A
   numerical model of a Hybrid III human surrogate was integrated with a
   numerical model of a mid-size sedan, including improvements to the
   vehicle and seat models, and implementation of an air bag and restraint
   system. The vehicle model was validated using the National Highway
   Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) frontal crash data for varying
   impact velocities into a rigid wall. A numerical model of a
   high-energy-absorbing pole was developed and validated, along with a
   rigid pole and a previously developed breakaway pole, to examine the
   effects of pole compliance on the vehicle and occupant response.
   Occupant response was investigated at varying impact velocities with the
   poles aligned with the vehicle centerline. Offset impacts were then
   investigated with the energy-absorbing pole aligned with the driver-side
   crush structure.
   Results: The vehicle kinematic response metrics currently used to
   evaluate poles were compared to the currently accepted occupant injury
   response metrics and it was found, in general, that the occupant-based
   injury criteria predicted lesser injury than the vehicle kinematic
   response metrics for the same impact scenario. Specifically, the
   occupant impact velocity provided trends that differed from all other
   metrics. This can be attributed in part to the improvement in vehicle
   safety systems not accounted for by the vehicle-based metrics.
   Conclusions: For the same impact scenario, the breakaway pole resulted
   in the lowest predicted injury metrics for the vehicle occupant but was
   noted to be a potential threat to pedestrians and other nearby road
   users. The rigid pole resulted in the highest occupant injury
   predictions, whereas the energy-absorbing steel pole resulted in injury
   metrics below the threshold values, controlled the vehicle deceleration,
   and detached from the base only at higher velocity impacts. Appropriate
   evaluation of energy-absorbing poles requires consideration of the
   occupant response in addition to the current kinematic criteria.}},

Abstract = {{New experimental results are presented on the effects of surfactant and
   water concentrations on pipeline flow of emulsions. For a fixed water
   concentration of 30\% by volume, the flow behavior of water-in-oil
   emulsions containing eight different surfactant concentrations (0, 0.05,
   0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2\% by wt based on oil) was investigated in
   five different diameter horizontal pipes. The surfactant used was
   oil-soluble Emsorb 2503 (sorbitan trioleate). The influence of water
   concentration on the pipeline flow behavior of emulsions was determined
   by varying the water concentration from 30 to 80\% by volume in
   increments of 5\%. The emulsions were water-in-oil type until the water
   concentration was 40\% by volume. Upon further increase in the water
   concentration, inversion of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion to oil-in-water
   (O/W) emulsion occurred at a water concentration of 45\% by volume. The
   unstable W/O emulsion without surfactant exhibits drag reduction
   behavior in turbulent flow; that is, the friction factor data fall well
   below the single-phase Blasius equation. With the addition of
   surfactant, the W/O emulsion becomes more homogeneous and the friction
   factor data fall close to the Blasius equation. However, the surfactant
   stabilized W/O emulsions exhibit a significant delay in transition from
   laminar to turbulent regime. The delay in laminar to turbulent
   transition depends on the pipe diameter. The O/W emulsions obtained upon
   phase inversion of surfactant-stabilized W/O emulsion behave as truly
   homogeneous fluids in that there is no delay in transition and that the
   friction factor data follow the Blasius equation.}},

Abstract = {{Various technologies and materials have been applied for the storage of
   clean gas energy, which also could control the combustion process to
   reduce CO2 emissions. Over the years, microporous and mesoporous
   materials have been developed as useful technology for gas storage and
   separation. However, no materials can adequately meet the needs of all
   applications. The present paper gives an overview of the various
   materials for gas storage and separation. The results showed that
   carbonaceous adsorbents were the most potential for meeting the US DoE
   system targets for gas (methane and hydrogen) storage. Meanwhile, the
   properties of metal organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks
   (thermodynamics and kinetics) had significant improvements with the
   development of material science. Further, zeolites performed well in CO2
   separation, but necessitated a high temperature for recovery. It was
   concluded that the utility of any new material will ultimately be
   determined not only by its material performance but also by its system
   performance, and much work is still required to be performed in the
   application of microporous and mesoporous materials for gas storage and
   separation in the future. (C) 2013 Curtin University of Technology and

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for more secure operation of space missions has
   led to emergence of cryptographic mechanisms aboard spacecrafts.
   However, cryptographic applications are extremely sensitive to bit-flips
   caused by radiation-induced single event upsets (SEUs). A traditional
   approach to mitigate SEUs in space applications has been the triple
   modular redundancy (TMR). However, such technique incurs large overheads
   in implementation area and power. An efficient approach to achieve fault
   tolerance in the secure hash standard (SHS) and in the keyed-hash
   message authentication code (HMAC) is introduced. When compared with TMR
   the proposed scheme not only achieves higher resistance against SEUs,
   but it also reduces implementation area requirements and power
   consumption. Results obtained through field-programmable gate array
   (FPGA) implementation show that HMAC/SHA-512 (secure hash algorithm)
   utilizes, on average, 53\% less area and less power compared with the
   traditional TMR technique. Furthermore, the memory and registers of the
   HMAC/SHA-512 module are approximately 171 and 491 times more resistant
   against SEUs than TMR. This research is crucial for enabling the
   efficient employment of security mechanisms onboard space systems.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates renewable energy alternatives to reduce diesel
   fuel dependency on electricity generation in Ontario's remote northern
   communities; currently, these communities use diesel fuel as the sole
   energy source to produce electricity. The current operation is complex,
   involving several stakeholders, high operating costs, and a considerable
   CO footprint. Several of these communities have electric load
   restrictions that limit further building construction and economic
   growth. This preliminary work discusses the barriers for renewable
   energy (RE) projects in northern Ontario communities by analyzing the
   current economic structure, the high capital costs, the available
   natural resources, and the installation and operation complexity. Also,
   a detailed analysis of six scenarios is presented; three scenarios
   consider a solar and/or wind-diesel system with a low RE penetration of
   7\% without any excess energy, whereas other three scenarios increase
   the RE penetration to 18\%, requiring a dump load, an additional small
   diesel engine, or a battery storage system. The proposed systems reduce
   fuel consumption, operating costs and CO emissions, considering the
   investment, operation and maintenance costs and constraints in remote

Abstract = {{Increasing energy demand has been a big challenge for current society,
   as the fossil fuel sources are gradually decreasing. Hence, development
   of renewable and sustainable energy sources for the future is considered
   one of the top priorities in national strategic plans. Bioenergy can
   meet future energy requirements - renewability, sustainability, and even
   carbon-neutrality. Bioenergy production from wastes and wastewaters is
   especially attractive because of dual benefits of energy generation and
   contaminant stabilization. There are several bioenergy technologies
   using wastes and wastewaters as electron donor, which include anaerobic
   digestion, dark biohydrogen fermentation, biohydrogen production using
   photosynthetic microorganisms, and bioelectrochemical systems (BESs).
   Among them BES seems to be very promising as we can produce a variety of
   value-added products from wastes and wastewaters, such as electric
   power, hydrogen gas, hydrogen peroxide, acetate, ethanol etc. Most of
   the traditional BES uses a membrane to separate the anode and cathode
   chamber, which is essential for improving microbial metabolism on the
   anode and the recovery of value-added products on the cathode.
   Performance of BES lacking a membrane can be seriously deteriorated, due
   to oxygen diffusion or substantial loss of synthesized products. For
   this reason, usage of a membrane seems essential to facilitate BES
   performance. However, a membrane can bring several technical challenges
   to BES application compared to membrane-less BES. These challenges
   include poor proton permeability, substrate loss, oxygen back diffusion,
   pH gradient, internal resistance, biofouling, etc. This paper aims to
   review the major technical barriers associated with membranes and future
   research directions for their application in BESs.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effect of solids retention times (SRT) on dissolved
   methane concentration in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor
   (AnMBR) operated at SRT 20d and 40d at ambient temperature (23 +/- 1
   degrees C). Daily methane production was 196 +/- 17mL/d and 285 +/-
   18mL/d for SRT 20d and 40d, respectively. In comparison, the average
   concentration of dissolved methane in AnMBR permeates was 9.9 +/-
   2.3mg/L for SRT 20d (close to thermodynamic equilibrium), which was
   decreased to 4.3 +/- 0.3mg/L for SRT 40d. We often found oversaturation
   of dissolved methane at SRT 20d, which means that mass transfer of
   dissolved methane from liquid to gas phase is dynamic at this short SRT.
   However, we never detected oversaturation of dissolved methane at SRT
   40d, due to slow endogenous decay kinetics. Higher daily methane
   production at SRT 40d than that at SRT 20d indicates that methane was
   supplementarily produced from biomass electrons by endogenous decay.
   This study shows that operation of AnMBRs under long SRT can keep low
   dissolved methane concentration in AnMBR permeate, along with high
   methane yield.}},

Abstract = {{The perfect electromagnetic conducting (PEMC) boundary, a nonreciprocal
   generalization of both perfect electric conducting (PEC) and perfect
   magnetic conducting (PMC) boundaries, is modeled in the finite
   difference time domain (FDTD) method. Since the PEMC boundary condition
   requires collocation of same components of both electric and magnetic
   fields at the boundary grids, which is not compatible with the original
   FDTD algorithm, its implementation in FDTD is challenging and requires
   modification in the algorithm. To do this task, first, the original FDTD
   cell is modified by inserting the required field components not present
   in the original cell. Then, a novel formulation is developed for
   updating fields' components at the boundary. Modeling of a PEMC planar
   interface, a corner point, and a wedge point are presented. Finally,
   numerical examples are presented to show stability, accuracy, and
   applicability of the proposed approach. Validation is achieved by
   comparisons with existing analytic methods and/or conventional FDTD for
   special cases of PEC and PMC boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Networked systems are often subject to environmental uncertainties and
   communication delays, which make timely and accurate information
   exchange among neighbours difficult or impossible. This study
   investigates the distributed consensus problem of dynamical networks of
   multi-agents in which each agent can only obtain noisy and delayed
   measurements of the states of its neighbours. The authors consider
   consensus protocols that take into account both the noisy measurements
   and the communication time delays, and introduce the notions of almost
   sure average-consensus and pth moment average-consensus. Using a
   convergence theorem for continuous-time semimartingales and moment
   inequality techniques for stochastic delay differential equations, the
   authors establish sufficient conditions for both almost sure and moment
   average-consensus. These results naturally generalise to networks with
   arbitrary and Markovian switching topologies. The consensus protocol
   considered here can be applied to networks with arbitrary bounded
   communication delays, which appears to the first consensus algorithm
   that is both average preserving and robust to arbitrarily sized delays.
   Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate the theoretical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{A decentralized network of one Primary User (PU) and several Secondary
   Users (SU) is studied. PU is licensed to exploit the resources, while
   the party of SUs intend to share the resources with PU. Each SU must
   guarantee to not disturb the performance of PU beyond a certain level,
   while maintaining a satisfactory quality of service for itself. It is
   proposed that each secondary transmitter adopts a Randomized Masking
   (RM) strategy with full average transmission power where it remains
   silent or transmits a symbol in its codeword independently from
   transmission slot to transmission slot. We consider a setup where the
   primary transmitter is unaware of channel coefficients, code-books of
   secondary users and the number of secondary users. SUs are anonymous to
   each other, i.e, they are unaware of each others' code-books, however,
   each SU is smart in the sense that it is aware of the code-book of PU,
   channel coefficients and the number of active SUs. Invoking the concept
   of epsilon-outage capacity, we define the (epsilon, nu)-admissible
   region as the set of masking probabilities for each SU such that the
   probability of outage for PU is maintained under a threshold epsilon in
   a case where PU sets its transmission rate at a fraction nu of its
   epsilon-outage capacity as if there were no SUs in the network. The
   masking probability of SUs is designed through maximizing the average
   (with respect to channel coefficients) achievable rate per SU over the
   (epsilon, nu)-admissible region. In our analysis, the primary receiver
   treats interference as noise, however, each secondary receiver has the
   option to decode and cancel the interference caused by PU, while
   treating the signals of other SUs as noise. In another approach,
   referred to as Continuous Transmission with Power Control (CTPC), each
   SU transmits continuously (no masking is applied), however, it adjusts
   its transmission power in order to yield the largest value for average
   achievable rate per SU. The schemes RM and CTPC are compared for
   different values of transmission power for each SU and PU and distance
   between different users. It is observed that neither of RM or CTPC
   always outperforms the other in various scenarios in terms of the
   underlying system parameters. A combination of RM and CTPC referred to
   as Randomized Masking with Power Control (RMPC) is also investigated
   where each SU controls both its probability of masking and average
   transmission power. It is demonstrated through simulations that RMPC can
   outperform both RM and CTPC.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of time asynchronism on the performance of
   compute-and-forward strategy in relay networks is considered. While the
   key idea in compute-and-forward is to decode a linear synchronous
   combination of the transmitted codewords, the relays receive random
   asynchronous versions of the combinations due to the distributed nature
   of the network. Over a symbol-asynchronous network, we show that by
   using a simple equalizer as a part of the signaling scheme, one can
   transform the asynchronous system into a synchronous one albeit with a
   smaller channel gain. With frame-asynchronism, we propose to use extra
   antennas at the relays to efficiently remove the asynchronous delays. By
   applying a linear filter with a delay-dependent structure before the
   decoder of compute-and-forward, the achievable rate is maximized at all
   signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs).}},

Abstract = {{Sharpness is an important determinant in visual assessment of image
   quality. The human visual system is able to effortlessly detect blur and
   evaluate sharpness of visual images, but the underlying mechanism is not

   mostly based on edge width, local gradient, or energy reduction of
   global/local high frequency content. Here we understand the subject from
   a different perspective, where sharpness is identified as strong local
   phase coherence (LPC) near distinctive image features evaluated in the
   complex wavelet transform domain. Previous LPC computation is restricted
   to be applied to complex coefficients spread in three consecutive dyadic
   scales in the scale-space. Here we propose a flexible framework that
   allows for LPC computation in arbitrary fractional scales. We then
   develop a new sharpness assessment algorithm without referencing the
   original image. We use four subject-rated publicly available image
   databases to test the proposed algorithm, which demonstrates competitive
   performance when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.(1)}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the design of optimal multiresolution vector

   Given a CRC-coded broadcast system with multiresolution vector
   quantization (MRVQ), a closed-form formula for the weighted end-to-end
   distortion (EED) is first derived under random index assignment. The
   closed-form expression is then further utilized to identify necessary
   optimality conditions to minimize the EED, from which an iterative
   algorithm is proposed for quantization design. Experiments conducted
   under both the point-to-point and broadcast channels demonstrate that
   for a wide range of channel error probability, inclusion of CRC
   significantly reduces the EED without sacrificing bandwidth. Further
   analyses are conducted to determine the best tradeoff between bits

   energy limitation, and assigns the most valuable packets to different
   radio interfaces in order to minimize the video quality distortion.
   First, the problem is formulated as MINLP which is known to be NP-hard.
   Then we employ a piecewise linearization approach and solve the problem
   using a cutting plane method which reduces the associated complexity
   from MINLP to a series of MIPs. Finally, for practical implementation in
   MTs, we approximate the video transmission framework using a two-stage
   optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
   framework exhibits very close performance to the exact problem solution.
   In addition, the proposed framework, unlike the existing solutions in
   literature, offers a choice for desirable trade-off between the achieved
   video quality and the MT operational period per battery charging.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative communication is a promising and practical technique for
   realizing spatial diversity through a virtual antenna array formed by
   multiple antennas of different nodes. There has been a growing interest
   in designing and evaluating efficient cooperative medium access control
   (MAC) protocols in recent years. With the objective of translating a
   cooperative diversity gain at the physical layer to cooperative
   advantages at the MAC layer, an efficient cooperative MAC protocol
   should be able to accurately identify a beneficial cooperation
   opportunity, efficiently select the best relay(s), and coordinate the
   cooperative transmission at low cost and complexity. However, due to the
   randomness of channel dynamics, node mobility, and link interference,
   the design of an efficient cooperative MAC protocol is of great
   challenge, especially in a wireless multi-hop mobile network. In this
   article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing
   cooperative MAC protocols according to their specific network scenarios
   and associated research problems. Three critical issues (i.e., when to
   cooperate, whom to cooperate with, and how to cooperate) are discussed
   in details, which should be addressed in designing an efficient
   cooperative MAC protocol. Open research issues are identified for
   further research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes interactive voice response (IVR) technology to
   enhance progress tracking of projects and as-built documentation. First,
   possible site events and tracking needs of construction activities have
   been analyzed based on literature and sample daily progress forms.
   Accordingly, activity logical-flow diagrams have been developed to guide
   IVR sessions. Afterward, the IVR technology has been implemented to
   enhance an existing e-mail-based framework for as-built documentation by
   integrating a cloud-based IVR service and a customized scheduling
   application. The IVR features work by either receiving calls from
   supervisors at any time or by configuring eligible activities to
   automatically initiate calls to their supervisors. Compared with lengthy
   e-mails, the IVR sessions are interactive, minimize the questions asked,
   and allow supervisors to specify site events and any requests for
   information. Responses are also received instantaneously to update the
   schedule and visualize the latest as-built information directly on the
   daily segments of a schedule. The paper contributes to automating
   site-data collection, designing low-cost voice applications for
   construction, facilitating bidirectional communication between site
   personnel and head office, and enhancing project tracking and control.

Abstract = {{Nanofibers are useful in many areas due to their outstanding
   characteristics, most importantly their small size and high
   surface-area-to-volume ratio. Recently, drug delivery systems using
   polymer nanofibers have gained significant attention. For these systems,
   a chopped nanofiber is required because the amount of drug released
   depends on the length of the fiber. Electrospinning is a simple method
   of fabricating polymer nanofibers. In the process, a high voltage is
   used to electrify a liquid jet which ultimately produces a solid
   nanofiber. The jet ejects when a high voltage is applied and vice versa.
   It is therefore possible to fabricate and chop nanofibers by controlling
   the value of the voltages applied. In this paper, an IGBT-based pulsed
   power supply, which can produce square pulses with a width of a few
   hundred microseconds and amplitudes up to 10 kV, has been designed and
   built. It was able to fabricate and chop nanofibers with polyethylene
   oxide (PEO) and a biodegradable polymer, sodium alginate blended with
   PEO, utilizing the aforementioned pulsed power supply. A jet always
   ejected during the pulse-on voltage when the duty ratio is more than
   40\%, with a minimum pulsewidth of approximately 80 ms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel feature-based technique for path
   optimization problems, in which the performance index is defined to
   minimize the energy consumption of a rover with consideration of
   terrain, kinematic, and dynamic constraints. The proposed method
   estimates rover energy consumption by discretizing a path and by
   extracting statistical data for fast calculation of the performance
   index. The concepts of grouped data and data discretization techniques
   are used to analyze the energy-related data obtained from the search
   environment. The method improves runtime computation by statistically
   calculating the energy consumption of a rover for a defined path, rather
   than solving the dynamic equations of the rover. This technique is
   computationally more efficient than other energy optimization approaches
   when it estimates rover energy consumption with sufficient accuracy. The
   Genetic Algorithm (GA) solver is integrated to the approach to
   illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm. Additionally, a
   hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is developed for the validation of
   the rover's power flow as it traverses through the optimal path by
   incorporating rover hardware components within real-time simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a method for automatic planning of optimal
   paths for a group of robots that satisfy a common high-level mission
   specification. The motion of each robot is modeled as a weighted
   transition system, and the mission is given as a linear temporal logic
   (LTL) formula over a set of propositions satisfied at the regions of the
   environment. In addition, an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be
   satisfied. The goal is to minimize a cost function that captures the
   maximum time between successive satisfactions of the optimizing
   proposition while guaranteeing that the formula is satisfied. When the
   robots can follow a given trajectory exactly, our method computes a set
   of optimal satisfying paths that minimize the cost function and satisfy
   the LTL formula. However, if the traveling times of the robots are
   uncertain, then the robots may not be able to follow a given trajectory
   exactly, possibly violating the LTL formula during deployment. We handle
   such cases by leveraging the communication capabilities of the robots to
   guarantee correctness during deployment and provide bounds on the
   deviation from the optimal values. We implement and experimentally
   evaluate our method for various persistent surveillance tasks in a road
   network environment.}},

Abstract = {{Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer and it is costly for
   dermatologists to screen every patient for melanoma. There is a need for
   a system to assess the risk of melanoma based on dermatological
   photographs of a skin lesion. However, the presence of illumination
   variation in the photographs can have a negative impact on lesion
   segmentation and classification performance. A novel multistage
   illumination modeling algorithm is proposed to correct the underlying
   illumination variation in skin lesion photographs. The first stage is to
   compute an initial estimate of the illumination map of the photograph
   using a Monte Carlo nonparametric modeling strategy. The second stage is
   to obtain a final estimate of the illumination map via a parametric
   modeling strategy, where the initial nonparametric estimate is used as a
   prior. Finally, the corrected photograph is obtained using the final
   illumination map estimate. The proposed algorithm shows better visual,
   segmentation, and classification results when compared to three other
   illumination correction algorithms, one of which is designed
   specifically for lesion analysis.}},

   compounds reduced by 46 to 86\% as the inorganic slug crossed the
   monitoring transect. The cumulative mass discharge across the monitoring
   transect was 19 to 58\% lower than that expected without persulfate
   injection. After the inorganic injection slug was flushed from the
   source zone a partial rebound (40 to 80\% of baseline levels) of mass

Abstract = {{The distribution of charge carriers inside the active region of a

   scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) and scanning capacitance

   single module thickness in the active region of the device have been
   resolved for the first time using high-resolution SSRM and SCM
   techniques at room temperature. SSRM and SCM measurements on the quantum
   well-barrier structure were calibrated utilizing known GaAs dopant
   staircase samples. Doping concentrations derived from SSRM and SCM
   measurements were found to be in quantitative agreement with the
   designed average doping values of the n-type active region in the
   terahertz quantum cascade laser. The secondary ion mass spectroscopy
   provides a partial picture of internal device parameters, and we have

Abstract = {{Interest is increasing in plastic compounding plants that offer
   tailor-made resins. Such plants produce a wide range of products in
   small quantities and with frequent changeovers. The underlying
   scheduling problem has been extensively researched; however, the concept
   of incorporating qualities of the finished product in the problem of
   plastics compounding has not been considered. We express product
   qualities as an additional problem constraint so that the production
   schedule ensures product quality. The additional constraint makes this
   mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) problem more difficult to solve.
   Several case studies are solved to illustrate the utility of the
   proposed approach. Experiments demonstrated that qualities of the
   finished product can be ensured a priori if the appropriate relations
   are developed and integrated in the optimisation model. As well, this
   paper provides insight into the economic aspects of the scheduling
   problem under consideration. Experiments showed that none of the cost
   components (operation, raw material, inventory, penalty or utilities)
   can alone play the role of the optimisation criterion. (c) 2012 Canadian

Abstract = {{Miscible gas injection (MGI) processes such as miscible CO2 flooding
   have been in use as attractive EOR options, especially in conventional
   oil reserves. Optimal design of MGI is strongly dependent on parameters
   such as gas-oil minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), which is normally
   determined through expensive and time-consuming laboratory tests. Thus,
   developing a fast and reliable technique to predict gas-oil MMP is
   inevitable. To address this issue, a smart model is developed in this
   paper to forecast gas-oil MMP on the basis of a feed-forward artificial
   neural network (FF-ANN) combined with particle swarm optimisation (PSO).
   The MMP of a reservoir fluid was considered as a function of reservoir
   temperature and the compositions of oil and injected gas in the proposed
   model. Results of this study indicate that reservoir temperature among
   the input parameters selected for the PSO-ANN has the greatest impact on
   MMP value. The developed PSO-ANN model was examined using experimental
   data, and a reasonable match was attained showing a good potential for
   the proposed predictive tools in estimation of gas-oil MMP. Compared
   with other available methods, the proposed model is capable of
   forecasting oil-gas MMP more accurately in wide ranges of thermodynamic
   and process conditions. All predictive models used other than the
   PSO-ANN model failed in providing a good estimate of the oil-gas MMP of
   the hydrocarbon mixtures in Azadegan oilfield, Iran. (c) 2013 Canadian

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of a
   concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) arch bridge under tridirectional
   spatial seismic motions using the pseudo-excitation method. Formulations
   for modelling tridirectional spatial ground motions at varying site
   conditions are first derived. A site response analysis is presented for
   the tridirectional motions based on deterministic wave propagation
   theory, assuming that the base rock motions consist of out-of-plane SH
   wave or in-plane combined P and SV waves propagating into the multiple
   layered site with an assumed incident angle. Integration between the
   structural health monitoring (SHM) technique and the structural seismic
   analysis is proposed and conducted for the finite element (FE) model
   calibration of the CFST arch bridge through the model updating approach.
   Using the calibrated FE model, stochastic seismic analysis of the CFST
   arch bridge is conducted in a comprehensive and systematic way, by
   considering the dimensionality, incoherence effect, wave-path effect of
   ground motions, and local site effects with different and irregular site
   conditions. Critical conclusions are drawn and can be applied in the
   actual seismic design of the half-through CFST arch bridges under
   tridirectional multiple excitations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel multicopy routing protocol, called
   Self-Adaptive Utility-based Routing Protocol (SAURP), for Delay Tolerant
   Networks (DTNs) that are possibly composed of a vast number of devices
   in miniature such as smart phones of heterogeneous capacities in terms
   of energy resources and buffer spaces. SAURP is characterized by the
   ability of identifying potential opportunities for forwarding messages
   to their destinations via a novel utility function-based mechanism, in
   which a suite of environment parameters, such as wireless channel
   condition, nodal buffer occupancy, and encounter statistics, are jointly
   considered. Thus, SAURP can reroute messages around nodes experiencing
   high-buffer occupancy, wireless interference, and/or congestion, while
   taking a considerably small number of transmissions. The developed
   utility function in SAURP is proved to be able to achieve optimal
   performance, which is further analyzed via a stochastic modeling
   approach. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the developed
   analytical model and compare the proposed SAURP with a number of
   recently reported encounter-based routing approaches in terms of
   delivery ratio, delivery delay, and the number of transmissions required
   for each message delivery. The simulation results show that SAURP
   outperforms all the counterpart multicopy encounter-based routing
   protocols considered in the study.}},

Abstract = {{Civil infrastructure assets require continuous renewal actions to
   modernize inventory and sustain operability. However, allocating limited
   renewal funds among numerous asset components represents a complex
   optimization problem. Earlier efforts using genetic algorithms (GAs)
   optimized medium-sized problems, yet exhibited steep performance
   degradation as problem size increased. In this research, data
   compression is first used to cluster and abstract the large data of a
   network-level problem. Optimizing compressed models, however, did not
   result in high quality solutions. To address large size problems, a GA
   with segmentation approach was introduced. Segmentation breaks down a
   large-scale network-level problem into segments, allocates budget based
   on the relative criticality of the segment, and combines the results of
   all segment optimizations. The proposed GA with segmentation mechanism
   has been tested on different sized problems and was able to optimize
   very large problems with no performance degradation. The proposed GA
   with segmentation method is simple and logical; furthermore, it can be
   used on variety of asset types to improve fund allocation for
   infrastructure renewal.}},

   polynomial multiplication and Toeplitz matrix vector product (TMVP). We
   first recall the best known three-way split formulas for polynomial
   multiplication: the formulas with six recursive multiplications given by
   Sunar in a 2006 IEEE Transactions on Computers paper and the formula
   with five recursive multiplications proposed by Bernstein at CRYPTO
   2009. Second, we propose a new set of three-way split formulas for
   polynomial multiplication that are an optimization of Sunar's formulas.
   Then, we present formulas with five recursive multiplications based on
   field extension. In addition, we extend the latter formulas to TMVP. We
   evaluate the space and delay complexities when computations are
   performed in parallel and provide a comparison with best known methods.}},

Abstract = {{Computing the product of a Toeplitz matrix and a vector arises in
   various applications including cryptography. In this paper, we consider
   Toeplitz matrices and vectors with entries in IF2. For improved
   efficiency in such computations, large Toeplitz matrices and vectors are
   recursively split and special formulas with subquadratic arithmetic
   complexity are applied. To this end, we first present a formula for the
   five-way splitting and then provide a generalization for the k-way
   splitting, where k is an arbitrary integer. These formulas can be used
   to compute a Toeplitz matrix-vector product (TMVP) of size n with an
   arithmetic complexity of O(n(logk) ((k(k+1)/2))).}},

Abstract = {{Rather consistent power conversion efficiencies have been achieved in

   standard and inverted device configurations demonstrates that the
   inverted configuration is more suitable for achieving thicker active
   layers when a high hole mobility donor is used. We attribute this to the
   longer hole collection path in the inverted structure, which can benefit
   from using a high hole mobility material. Our results will be very
   useful for the development of new semiconductor materials and the design
   of device structures for more feasible manufacturing of large area OPV

Abstract = {{Digital displays, as the replacement of traditional static signs, have
   gained increasing popularity for out-of-home advertising. Latest
   advancements in smartphone, wireless communication, and digital display
   technologies make it possible to design new interactive signage systems
   linking the digital content with the physical digital displays. Although
   recent studies have demonstrated the trend of cyber-physical
   interaction, they are not generally scalable for multiple users, and
   none of them support interaction with multiple displays in one location.
   Smart Signage, a ``draggable{''} cyber-physical broadcast/multicast
   (B/M) media system is proposed in this paper. With a novel
   cyber-physical B/M protocol that synchronizes the content on the digital
   displays with the smartphones, it supports one-to-many interaction by
   allowing multiple users acquiring content from one display with a
   ``dragging{''} hand gesture. With the embedded display orientation
   information in the same protocol, Smart Signage supports many-to-many
   interaction by allowing users obtaining content from the digital display
   they are pointing at with their smartphones. Users' quality of
   experience, which is characterized by the response time, is carefully
   studied in this paper to guarantee the performance of this
   cyber-physical interactive display system.}},

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a wormhole attack resistant secure neighbor
   discovery (SND) scheme for a centralized 60-GHz directional wireless
   network. Specifically, the proposed SND scheme consists of three phases:
   the network controller (NC) broadcasting phase, the network nodes
   response/authentication phase, and the NC time analysis phase. In the
   broadcasting phase and the response/authentication phase, local time
   information and antenna direction information are elegantly exchanged
   with signature-based authentication techniques between the NC and the
   legislate network nodes, which can prevent most of the wormhole attacks.
   In the NC time analysis phase, the NC can further detect the possible
   attack using the time-delay information from the network nodes. To solve
   the transmission collision problem in the response/authentication phase,
   we also introduce a novel random delay multiple access (RDMA) protocol
   to divide the RA phase into M periods, within which the unsuccessfully
   transmitting nodes randomly select a time slot to transmit. The optimal
   parameter setting of the RDMA protocol and the optional strategies of
   the NC are discussed. Both neighbor discovery time analysis and security
   analysis demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed
   SND scheme in conjunction with the RDMA protocol.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents new insights on the synthesis of nano-ZnO on reduced
   graphite oxide (rGO) composite via a microwave-assisted route and its
   use as a potential sorbent to adsorb hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at ambient
   conditions. Depending on the synthesis methods, the nano-sized ZnO on
   rGO presents different characteristics, in particular the degree of
   nano-ZnO dispersion on the surface of the rGO. Microwave-assisted
   reduction was able to offer a mild reduction to the oxygen-containing
   functional groups attached on the surface of graphite oxide (GO). Those
   oxygen-containing functional groups provide the bridge and the terminal
   groups between zinc oxide and the rGO surface. Because those functional
   groups act as anchor sites for metal ions, it was possible to achieve
   uniformly distributed nano-sized ZnO particles on the surface of the rGO
   sheets. In addition, they accelerate oxygen activation for H2S
   adsorption. H2S adsorption tests at ambient conditions were conducted.
   The 1-D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) had been used for reference in order to
   investigate the functionality of 2-D rGO substrate. Also, the effects of
   the different synthesis methods (microwave vs. reflux) were evaluated
   for H2S adsorption. The adsorption capacity increased dramatically for
   the microwave-assisted composite compared to the composite manufactured
   using the reflux method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bending is a common strain path observed in various metal forming
   operations. In this paper, a rate-dependent crystal plasticity model is
   incorporated into the commercial software LS-DYNA to analyze the effect
   of five common Face Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal orientations on the
   surface roughness developed during bending. Single crystals and
   polycrystals are modeled and the developed surface roughness is
   quantified. The models treat single crystals as a range of orientations
   that lie within 10 degrees of the specified orientation, mimicking the
   many subgrains that form during the deformation of aluminum single
   crystal. Polycrystals are treated in the same fashion but instead
   contain a mix of specified orientations of different texture components
   of rolled aluminum sheets. Second derivative surface roughness
   calculations are done both perpendicular and parallel to the bend axis.
   The simulations reveal that the presence of the Brass and S orientations
   greatly increases surface roughness. Surface roughness is seen to
   correlate well with a lack of strain accommodating capability of
   texture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A ballast resistor is utilized in a low density vertically aligned
   carbon nanotube array. Based on the nature of the ballast resistor, the
   uniformity of the emission improves remarkably. A highly stable field
   emission current is obtained under a constant voltage and a current
   density of 300 mA/cm(2) is achieved. Joule heat generated by this field
   emission current increases the temperature of the CNT array
   significantly. The high temperature changes the emission to Schottky
   emission regime. The Schottky emission achieves 900 mA/cm(2), which is
   three times the field emission current density. Simulation result shows
   the corresponding temperature is about 1700 K. A color change of the
   emission area is observed after the experiment. When compared to the
   conventional Schottky cathode, the emitter is self-heating and no extra
   heater is needed. This is the first report of a successful utilization
   of a ballast resistor in a CNT based emission array and the first
   observation of Schottky emission from a vertically aligned CNT array

   on the process performance than the solvent to feed ratio. At low
   concentrations of PZ, every 1 wt\% increase in PZ enhanced the percent
   CO2 recovery by about 10\%. Finally, the results also indicated that the
   best trade-off between CO2 recovery and energy consumption occurred at
   the PZ concentration of 5 wt\%, in a 45 wt\% aqueous MDEA solvent. (c)

Abstract = {{Antenna beam tilting or steering requires multiple antenna elements to
   be phase shifted and arranged in the form of an array. This article
   presents a novel method to tilt the main beam of a microstrip patch by
   partially covering it with a high dielectric-constant superstrate. The
   beam tilting is possible because of the dual-slot radiation mechanism of
   the microstrip antenna. In effect, the electromagnetic radiation from
   the covered radiating slot reaches the far-field with an additional
   phase with respect to the uncovered slot, resulting in an inclined beam
   whose angle depends on the superstrate's refractive index.
   Experimentally and numerically, a beam deflection of 25 degrees is
   achieved when a microstrip patch is partially covered with a superstrate
   having a dielectric constant of 10. Moreover, the proposed structure
   provides gain enhancement of about 3 dB. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Turbulent drag reduction (DR) behavior of mixed nonionic polymer and
   anionic surfactant solutions in water was studied in a pipeline set up
   to explore the synergic effects of mixed additives on DR. The
   concentration of polymer polyethylene oxide (PEO) was varied from 0 to
   2000ppm and the concentration of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
   was varied from 0 to 5000ppm. The critical aggregation concentration
   (CAC), where the interaction between the polymer and the surfactant
   begins, and the polymer saturation point (PSP), where the polymer
   molecules become saturated with the surfactant, were determined using
   electrical conductivity and surface tension measurements. As the polymer
   concentration was increased the CAC decreased but the PSP increased. The
   relative viscosity showed a remarkable increase upon the addition of
   surfactant to the polymer solution due to extension of polymer chains
   caused by the formation of micelles on the backbone of the polymer
   molecules. The data exhibited a considerable increase in DR in the case
   of mixed polymer/surfactant systems. The percent reduction in friction
   factor was as high as 79 when 3000ppm or more surfactant was added to
   the 500ppm polymer solution. Furthermore, the drag reduction behavior of
   the polymer solution changed from so-called Type A to Type B. In Type A
   drag reduction, a transition from laminar to turbulent regime is
   observed with a clear-cut onset point. In Type B drag reduction, no
   transition or onset point is observed; the data fall on a gradual
   extension of the laminar line.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate whether the appearance of a human face can be
   utilized for diagnostic purposes, which have been practiced for
   thousands of years in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this paper
   aims to present a computerized facial image analysis system by using
   quantitative chromatic features for disease diagnosis applications. A
   face image acquisition device is dedicatedly designed to acquire image
   samples from volunteers who have three types of health conditions:
   normal health, icterohepatitis, and severe hepatitis. Then, after color
   calibration on the acquired images to remove noises caused by lighting
   fluctuations, quantitative dominant color features are extracted by
   fuzzy clustering method. In order to further improve the diagnosis
   accuracy, a feature selection procedure is involved to identify the most
   discriminative feature subset for the diagnostic classification. Lastly,
   based on these selected quantitative feature, each face image could be
   diagnosed into different health groups. Experiments are conducted based
   on a database which includes over 300 sample images, and the result
   shows that the overall diagnosis accuracy between healthy samples and
   other two diseases is higher than 88\%. Hence the feasibility of disease
   diagnosis by inspecting the chromatic feature of human face could be
   verified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a multiobjective control technique for integration
   of distributed generation (DG) resources to the electrical power
   network. The proposed strategy provides compensation for active,
   reactive, and harmonic load current components during connection of DG
   link to the grid. The dynamic model of the proposed system is first
   elaborated in the stationary reference frame and then transformed into
   the synchronous orthogonal reference frame. The transformed variables
   are used in control of the voltage source converter as the heart of the
   interfacing system between DG resources and utility grid. By setting an
   appropriate compensation current references from the sensed load
   currents in control circuit loop of DG, the active, reactive, and
   harmonic load current components will be compensated with fast dynamic
   response, thereby achieving sinusoidal grid currents in phase with load
   voltages, while required power of the load is more than the maximum
   injected power of the DG to the grid. In addition, the proposed control
   method of this paper does not need a phase-locked loop in control
   circuit and has fast dynamic response in providing active and reactive
   power components of the grid-connected loads. The effectiveness of the
   proposed control technique in DG application is demonstrated with
   injection of maximum available power from the DG to the grid, increased
   power factor of the utility grid, and reduced total harmonic distortion
   of grid current through simulation and experimental results under
   steady-state and dynamic operating conditions.}},

Title = {{Numerical Modeling of Interstitial Fluid Flow Coupled with Blood Flow
   through a Remodeled Solid Tumor Microvascular Network}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Modeling of interstitial fluid flow involves processes such as fluid
   diffusion, convective transport in extracellular matrix, and
   extravasation from blood vessels. To date, majority of microvascular
   flow modeling has been done at different levels and scales mostly on
   simple tumor shapes with their capillaries. However, with our proposed
   numerical model, more complex and realistic tumor shapes and capillary
   networks can be studied. Both blood flow through a capillary network,
   which is induced by a solid tumor, and fluid flow in tumor's surrounding
   tissue are formulated. First, governing equations of angiogenesis are
   implemented to specify the different domains for the network and
   interstitium. Then, governing equations for flow modeling are introduced
   for different domains. The conservation laws for mass and momentum
   (including continuity equation, Darcy's law for tissue, and simplified
   Navier-Stokes equation for blood flow through capillaries) are used for
   simulating interstitial and intravascular flows and Starling's law is
   used for closing this system of equations and coupling the intravascular
   and extravascular flows. This is the first study of flow modeling in
   solid tumors to naturalistically couple intravascular and extravascular
   flow through a network. This network is generated by sprouting
   angiogenesis and consisting of one parent vessel connected to the
   network while taking into account the non-continuous behavior of blood,
   adaptability of capillary diameter to hemodynamics and metabolic
   stimuli, non-Newtonian blood flow, and phase separation of blood flow in
   capillary bifurcation. The incorporation of the outlined components
   beyond the previous models provides a more realistic prediction of
   interstitial fluid flow pattern in solid tumors and surrounding tissues.
   Results predict higher interstitial pressure, almost two times, for
   realistic model compared to the simplified model.}},

Abstract = {{The oil industry is increasingly interested in improving the planning of
   their operations, because of the dynamic nature of the oil business.
   This study intends to establish an iterative integration approach for
   the tactical and operational planning of multisite refining networks.
   Tactical and operational mathematical models are proposed. Both models
   are two-stage stochastic linear programs in which uncertainty is
   incorporated into the dominant random parameters at each decision level.
   Decisions made. in the oil industry differ based on multisite network
   echelon (spatial integration) and planning horizon (temporal
   integration). Spatial integration is discussed at the tactical level,
   whereas temporal integration is discussed with respect to the
   interaction between the two levels. In the proposed temporal integration
   approach (iterative approach), there is a cyclic information flow
   between the two models. An industrial scale study using data from the
   Brazilian oil industry was conducted to discuss the benefits of
   integration in a stochastic environment}},

Title = {{Effect of molecular weight distribution on e-beam exposure properties of
   polystyrene}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Polystyrene is a negative electron beam resist whose exposure properties
   can be tuned simply by using different molecular weights (Mw). Most
   previous studies have used monodisperse polystyrene with a
   polydispersity index (PDI) of less than 1.1 in order to avoid any
   uncertainties. Here we show that despite the fact that polystyrene's
   sensitivity is inversely proportional to its Mw, no noticeable effect of
   very broad molecular weight distribution on sensitivity, contrast and
   achievable resolution is observed. It is thus unnecessary to use the
   costly monodisperse polystyrene for electron beam lithography. Since the
   polydispersity is unknown for general purpose polystyrene, we simulated
   a high PDI polystyrene by mixing in a 1: 1 weight ratio two polystyrene
   samples with Mw of 170 and 900 kg mol(-1) for the high Mw range, and 2.5
   and 13 kg mol(-1) for the low Mw range. The exposure property of the
   mixture resembles that of a monodisperse polystyrene with similar number
   averaged molecular weight (Mn) over bar, which indicates that it is (Mn)
   over bar rather than (Mw) over bar (weight averaged molecular weight)
   that dominates the exposure properties of polystyrene resist. This also
   implies that polystyrene of a certain molecular weight can be simulated
   by a mixture of two polystyrenes having different molecular weights.}},

Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{We describe a multi-mode quantum memory for propagating microwave
   photons that combines a solid-state spin ensemble resonantly coupled to
   a frequency tunable single-mode microwave cavity. We first show that
   high efficiency mapping of the quantum state transported by a free
   photon to the spin ensemble is possible both for strong and weak
   coupling between the cavity mode and the spin ensemble. We also show
   that even in the weak coupling limit unit efficiency and faithful
   retrieval can be obtained through time reversal inhomogeneous dephasing
   based on spin echo techniques. This is possible provided that the cavity
   containing the spin ensemble and the transmission line are impedance
   matched. We finally discuss the prospects for an experimental
   implementation using a rare-earth doped crystal coupled to a
   superconducting resonator.}},

Title = {{Assessing the role of feed water constituents in irreversible membrane
   fouling of pilot-scale ultrafiltration drinking water treatment systems}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3364-3374}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) approach together with
   principal component analysis (PCA) was used for assessing hydraulically
   irreversible fouling of three pilot-scale ultrafiltration (UF) systems
   containing full-scale and bench-scale hollow fiber membrane modules in
   drinking water treatment. These systems were operated for at least three
   months with extensive cycles of permeation, combination of back-pulsing
   and scouring and chemical cleaning. The principal component (PC) scores
   generated from the PCA of the fluorescence EEMs were found to be related
   to humic substances (HS), protein-like and colloidal/particulate matter
   content. PC scores of HS- and protein-like matter of the UF feed water,
   when considered separately, showed reasonably good correlations with the
   rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling for long-term UF operations.
   In contrast, comparatively weaker correlations for PC scores of
   colloidal/particulate matter and the rate of hydraulically irreversible
   fouling were obtained for all UP systems. Since, individual correlations
   could not fully explain the evolution of the rate of irreversible
   fouling, multi-linear regression models were developed to relate the
   combined effect of HS-like, protein-like and colloidal/particulate
   matter PC scores to the rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling for
   each specific UF system. These multi-linear regression models revealed
   significant individual and combined contribution of HS- and protein-like
   matter to the rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling, with
   protein-like matter generally showing the greatest contribution. The
   contribution of colloidal/particulate matter to the rate of
   hydraulically irreversible fouling was not as significant. The addition
   of polyaluminum chloride, as coagulant, to UP feed appeared to have a
   positive impact in reducing hydraulically irreversible fouling by these
   constituents. The proposed approach has applications in quantifying the
   individual and synergistic contribution of major natural water
   constituents to the rate of hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling
   and shows potential for controlling UP irreversible fouling in the
   production of drinking water. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A molecular dynamics simulation based on the embedded-atom method was

   premelting points. Unlike the previous theoretical models, our model can
   predict both complete melting and surface premelting points for a wider
   size range of NPs. Programmed heating at an equal rate was applied to
   all sizes of NPs. Melting kinetics showed three different trends that
   are, respectively, associated with NPs in the size ranges of 4 to 7 rim,
   8 to 10 nm, and 12 to 20 nm. NPs in the first range melted at a single
   temperature without passing through a surface premelting stage. Melting
   of the second range started by forming a quasi-liquid layer that
   expanded to the core, followed by the formation of a liquid layer of 1.8
   nm thickness that also subsequently expanded to the core with increasing
   temperature and completed the melting process. For particles in the
   third range, the 1.8 nm liquid layer was formed once the thickness of
   the quasi-liquid layer reached S rim. The liquid layer expanded to the
   core and formed thicker stable liquid layers as the temperature
   increased toward the complete melting point. The ratio of the
   quasi-liquid layer thickness to the NP radius showed a linear
   relationship with temperature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a three-dimensional mathematical model for
   steamflooding in heavy oil saturated naturally fractured carbonate
   reservoirs where the governing equations are written for the matrix and
   fracture media, separately. Uncertainties associated with the shape
   factor for the communication between the matrix and fracture was
   eliminated through setting a continuity boundary condition at the
   interface. Using this boundary condition, the solution method employed
   differs from the most of the modeling simulations reported in the
   literature. The Newton-Raphson approach was also used for solving mass
   and energy balance equations. The recovery factor and cumulative steam
   to oil ratio were obtained as a function of steam injection rate,
   temperature, and also characteristics of the fractured media such as
   matrix size and permeability. The numerical solution clearly shows that
   fractures play an important role in improving the conduction of heat
   into the matrix part It is also concluded that the matrix size and total
   permeability are the most important parameters affecting the dependent
   variables involved in steamflooding in this type of reservoir. The
   results obtained from the mathematical modeling were compared with the
   real data, exhibiting a reasonable agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for the steady-state response of an infinite beam
   resting on a visco-elastic foundation and subjected to a concentrated
   load moving with a constant velocity are developed in this paper. The
   beam responses investigated are deflection, bending moment, shear force
   and contact pressure. The mechanical resistance of the foundation is
   modeled using two parameters ks and ts ks accounts for soil resistance
   due to compressive strains in the soil and ts accounts for the
   resistance due to shear strains. Since this model represents the ground
   behavior more accurately than the Winkler spring model, the developed
   solutions produce beam responses that are closer to reality than those
   obtained using the existing solutions for Winkler model. The dynamic
   beam responses depend on the damping present in the system and on the
   velocity of the moving load. Based on the study, dynamic amplification
   curves are developed for beam deflection. Such amplification curves for
   deflection, bending moment, shear force and contact pressure can be
   developed for any beam-foundation system and can be used in design.

Abstract = {{An `energy hub' comprises of the interactions of different energy loads
   and sources for power generation, storage and conversion: This paper
   presents an energy hub consisting of nuclear plants, Wind turbines,
   solar panels, reactors electrolyzers, and fuel cells. The hub serves to
   replace existing coal-based power generating facilities to meet
   electricity and hydrogen demands for industrial and transportation,
   sectors, as projected in 2030. Equipment sizing and costing analysis for
   different energy production technologies and hydrogen storage were
   considered using Matlab/Simulink. Several energy hub designs with
   various technological combinations were analyzed, and a profitability
   analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of each energy hub.
   The proposed models also evaluate the environmental benefits of the
   future energy hub and outline the best hub configurations. It was found
   that the most economical energy hub is when nuclear reactor was operated
   throughout the year at a capacity near to the grid's average annual
   electricity demand. Underground hydrogen storage emerged as the most
   economical option for all hubs analyzed, and any excess power was
   converted to hydrogen for sale in the industrial and transportation

Abstract = {{A cavitation model has been developed for the internal two-phase flow of
   diesel and biodiesel fuels in fuel injectors under high injection
   pressure conditions. The model is based on the single-fluid mixture
   approach with newly derived expressions for the phase change rate and
   local mean effective pressure-the two key components of the model. The
   effects of the turbulence, compressibility, and wall roughness are
   accounted for in the present model and model validation is carried out
   by comparing the model predictions of probable cavitation regions,
   velocity distribution, and fuel mass flow rate with the experimental
   measurement available in literature. It is found that cavitation
   inception for biodiesel occurs at a higher injection pressure, compared
   to diesel, due to its higher viscosity. However, supercavitation occurs
   for both diesel and biodiesel at high injection pressures. The
   renormalization group (RNG) k - epsilon model for turbulence modeling is
   reasonable by comparing its performance with the realizable k - omega
   and the shear stress transport (SST) k - omega models. The effect of
   liquid phase compressibility becomes considerable for high injection
   pressures. Wall roughness is not an important factor for cavitation in
   fuel injectors.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive connection of single phase solar generators which are also
   called microFITs (micro feed-in tariff), to distribution systems may
   lead to a phase unbalance condition, a problem further complicated due
   to the widespread use of single phase loads. Energy losses also change
   significantly when microFITs are implemented. This paper addresses these
   problems with respect to the connection of a large number of microFITs
   and single phase loads to three phase distribution systems. In this
   research, a probabilistic model has been utilized for estimating hourly
   solar irradiance, and a genetic algorithm has been employed as a means
   of generating a non-dominated Pareto front for minimizing the current
   unbalance and energy loss in the distribution system. A decision-making
   process has been developed in order to determine a single optimum
   solution from the Pareto front generated. Operational controls, such as
   voltage drop, transmission limits, and voltage unbalance limits, are
   taken into consideration in this analysis. In the context of smart
   grids, the proposed algorithm will facilitate the deployment of
   small-sized solar generators. The proposed method has been applied on an
   IEEE 123 bus distribution system in order to demonstrate the validity of
   the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of reinforcement particles significantly
   influences the tensile behavior of particle-reinforced composites. In
   this study, the role of particle clustering on the macroscopic and
   microscopic behavior of these composites in the absence of damage was
   numerically investigated. An infinite material containing a periodic
   distribution of clustered, elastic, spherical particles was modeled
   using a unit cell approach. Three types of multi-particle unit cells
   were simulated with different arrangements of clustered particles as
   well as different cluster densities. The uniaxial stress-strain curves
   in tension were compared with the curves obtained from single-particle
   unit cell simulations. It was shown that clustering of particles
   increases the plastic strain accumulated in the matrix and slightly
   increases the work hardening rate. More importantly, it was observed
   that while the influence of the particle distribution on the overall
   behavior of the composite was not significant in uniaxial tension, the
   maximum principal stress inside the particles is acutely sensitive to
   the particle cluster morphology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting is a promising technology for extending the lifetime
   of battery-powered sensor networks. Due to time variations of harvested
   energy, one of the main challenging issues is to maximize the
   uninterrupted sampling rates of all sensor nodes, which represents the
   network performance. Most of existing works do not consider the limited
   capacity of rechargeable battery. In this paper, we are concerned with
   how to adaptively decide the sampling rate for each rechargeable sensor
   node with a limited battery capacity to maximize the overall network
   performance. To solve this problem, we firstly propose an adaptive
   Energy Allocation sCHeme (EACH) for each sensor node to manage its
   energy use in an efficient way. Then we develop a Distributed Sampling
   Rate Control (DSRC) algorithm to obtain the optimal sampling rate.
   Furthermore, an Improved adaptive Energy Allocation sCHeme (IEACH) is
   proposed to reduce the impact due to imprecise estimation of harvested
   energy. Extensive simulations using real experimental data obtained from
   Baseline Measurement System (BMS) of Solar Radiation Research Laboratory
   are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.}},

   mechanism of the reaction and sintering bonding process were basically
   made clear by using TGA-FTIR, FE-SEM and XRD, further, a reasonable

Abstract = {{The Cu+Ag mixed nanoparticles were prepared based on the chemical
   reduction method. The polymer coated on the Cu+Ag mixed nanoparticles
   can protect Cu nanoparticles from oxidation. The metal-metal joint of
   silver plated Cu bulks was investigated with the use of Cu+Ag mixed
   nanoparticles. The bonding experiments show that joint with shear
   strength about 20 MPa was formed at the bonding temperature above 250
   degrees C under 5 MPa using Cu+Ag mixed nanoparticles. The strength of
   bonding using Cu+Ag mixed nanoparticles is lower than that of bonding
   using pure Ag nanoparticles. This may be due to the fact that the
   sintering between the Cu nanoparticles and Ag nanoparticles is more
   difficult than the sintering between Ag nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Sintering of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is increasingly being used as a
   driving mechanism for joining in the microelectronics industry. We
   therefore performed molecular dynamics simulations based on the embedded
   atom method (EAM) to study pressureless sintering kinetics of two Ag NPs
   in the size range of (4 to 20 nm), and sintering of three and four Ag
   NPs of 4 nm diameter. We found that the sintering process passed through
   three main stages. The first was the neck formation followed by a rapid
   increase of the neck radius at 50K for 20 nm particles and at 10 K for
   smaller NPs. The second was characterized by a gradual linear increase
   of the neck radius to particle radius ratio as the temperature of the
   sintered structure was increased to the surface premelting point.
   Different than previous sintering studies, a twin boundary was formed
   during the second stage that relaxed the sintered structure and
   decreased the average potential energy (PE). The third stage of
   sintering was a rapid shrinkage during surface premelting of the
   sintered structure. Based on pore geometry, densification occurred
   during the first stage for three 4 nm particles and during the second
   stage for four 4 nm particles. Sintering rates obtained by our
   simulation were higher than those obtained by theoretical models
   generally used for predicting sintering rates of microparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The unique physicochemical properties of hydrogels have attracted
   considerable attention in their drug storage and delivery applications.
   Herein, a series of acrylamide based hydrogels with different charges
   (cationic, neutral, and anionic) under different pH (I, 7, and 13) were
   prepared via an inverse emulsion polymerization process. The effects of
   pH and aqueous to organic phase (w/o) ratio on the size of the produced
   hydrogels were studied. Fluorescein was used as the model drug to assess
   and optimize the encapsulation efficiency of the hydrogels. Optical
   microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy were carried out to
   examine the existence and distribution of fluorescein inside the
   hydrogels. It was found that the hydrogels were swollen to the greatest
   extent at pH = 13 and their size increased with decreasing w/o ratio.
   Fluorescein was molecularly dispersed within the cationic and anionic
   hydrogels at pH = 13 with an encapsulation efficiency of similar to 45
   wt\%. This study provides a convenient method to prepare hydrogels with
   the required properties and demonstrates the potential of using
   hydrogels to store and stabilize therapeutics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   propose a multi-unit sequential sealed-bid first-price auction to
   optimize the payoff of each SU. Then, we derive an expression for the

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the benefits of amplify-and-forward (AF)
   relaying in the setup of multiantenna wireless networks. For this
   purpose, random sequential (RS) relaying is studied. It is shown that
   random unitary matrix multiplication at the relay nodes empowers the RS
   scheme to achieve a better diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) as
   compared to the traditional AF relaying. First, the RS scheme is proved
   to achieve the optimum DMT for a multiantenna full-duplex single-relay
   two-hop network. Applying this result, a new achievable DMT is derived
   for the case of multiantenna half-duplex parallel relay network.
   Interestingly, it turns out that the DMT of the RS scheme is optimum for
   the case of multiantenna two parallel noninterfering half-duplex relays.
   Furthermore, random unitary matrix multiplication is shown to also
   improve the DMT of the nonorthogonal AF relaying scheme for the case of
   a multiantenna single relay channel. Finally, the general case of
   multiantenna full-duplex relay networks is studied. First, a new
   lower-bound is derived on its DMT using the RS scheme. Furthermore,
   maximum multiplexing gain of the network is also shown to be achievable
   by traditional amplify-forward relaying. The gain value is equal to the
   minimum vertex cut-set of the underlying graph of the network, which can
   be computed in polynomial time in terms of the number of network nodes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the sequence families of which maximum correlation is
   determined by the Weil bound of exponential sums are revisited. Using
   the same approach, two new constructions with large family sizes and low
   maximum correlation are given. The first construction is an analog of
   one recent result derived from the interleaved structure of Sidel'nikov
   sequences. For a prime p and an integer M vertical bar(p - 1), the new
   M-ary sequence families of period p are obtained from irreducible
   quadratic polynomials and known power residue-based sequence families.
   The new sequence families increase family sizes of the known power
   residue-based sequence families, but keep the maximum correlation
   unchanged. In the second construction, the sequences derived from the
   Weil representation are generalized, where each new sequence is the
   elementwise product of a modulated Sidel'nikov sequence and a modulated
   trace sequence. For positive integers d < p and, M vertical bar(p(n) -
   1)the new family consists (M - 1)p(nd) of sequences with period p(n) -
   1, alphabet size Mp, and the maximum correlation bounded by (d + 1)root

Abstract = {{The simple, computationally efficient HB-like entity authentication
   protocols based on the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem have
   attracted a great deal of attention in the past few years due to the
   broad application prospect in low-cost RFID tags. However, all previous
   protocols are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack discovered by
   Ouafi, Overbeck, and Vaudenay. In this paper, we propose a lightweight
   authentication protocol named LCMQ and prove it secure in a general
   man-in-the-middle model. The technical core in our proposal is a special
   type of circulant matrix, for which we prove the linear independence of
   matrix vectors, present efficient algorithms on matrix operations, and
   describe a secure encryption against ciphertext-only attack. By
   combining all of those with LPN and related to the multivariate
   quadratic problem, the LCMQ protocol not only is provably secure against
   all probabilistic polynomial-time adversaries, but also transcends
   HB-like protocols in terms of tag's computation overhead, storage
   expense, and communication cost.}},

   {[}N-1-naphthyl-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (NPB:MoO3) and
   4,4-N,N-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP:MoO3) was used to enhance the hole
   conduction in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). It is found that
   the OLED using NPB:MoO3 10nm/CBP:MoO3 5nm showed a much increased
   current density than the one using NPB:MoO3 5nm/CBP:MoO3 5nm at a given
   voltage larger than 4V, mainly because the hole transport barrier across
   the p-doped heterojunction in the former device became smaller than that
   in the latter device with the driving voltage increasing, despite the
   fact that the 10-nm NPB:MoO3 in the former device caused more Ohmic loss
   than the 5-nm one in the latter device. As a result of the higher
   conductivity of NPB:MoO3 than that of CBP:MoO3, the OLED using the
   combination of 15-nm NPB:MoO3 and 5-nm CBP:MoO3 showed significantly
   increased performance than the one using the single 20-nm CBP:MoO3. We
   provide a useful way of advancing the OLEDs toward the practical
   applications in general lighting and flat-panel displays.}},

   the addition of Mg to an Al-1.1Cu alloy increases the nucleation rate of
   clusters in the quenched/aged state by increasing the effective driving
   force for nucleation, enhancing the dislocation stress relaxation and
   decreasing the surface energy associated with the Cu-rich co-clusters of
   Cu-Mg. Furthermore, we show that it is thermodynamically favorable for
   small subcritical clusters to have higher affinity for Mg than larger
   post-critical Cu-rich clusters, particularly depicting a two-stage

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency is a crucial requirement for energy-aware ad hoc
   networks. Cooperative communications can be applied to significantly
   reduce and balance energy consumption. However, this advantage mainly
   depends on efficient cooperative strategies, i.e., the joint issue of
   relay node selection and transmit power control. In this paper, we
   propose a cooperative behavior control scheme, which determines
   cooperative strategies by using the correlated equilibrium (CE).
   Specifically, we first model a cooperative behavior control game where
   the individual utility function is derived from the energy efficiency in
   terms of the global max-min fairness with the outage performance
   constraint. Since the CE can achieve better performance by helping the
   noncooperative players to coordinate their strategies, we employ the CE
   to analyze the proposed game. Next, we derive the condition under which
   the CE is Pareto optimal and employ linear programming duality to show
   its closed-form expression. Furthermore, we design a linear programming
   method and a distributed learning algorithm based on the regret matching
   procedure to achieve the CE, respectively. Simulation results
   demonstrate that our scheme achieves good convergence, Pareto
   optimality, and max-min fairness.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the electron-accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)
   moiety has been receiving considerable attention for constructing
   donor-acceptor (D-A) type organic semiconductors for a variety of
   applications, particularly for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and
   organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Through association of the DPP unit with
   appropriate electron donating building blocks, the resulting D-A
   molecules interact strongly in the solid state through intermolecular
   D-A and pi-pi interactions, leading to highly ordered structures at the
   molecular and microscopic levels. The closely packed molecules and
   crystalline domains are beneficial for intermolecular and interdomain
   (or intergranular) charge transport. Furthermore, the energy levels can
   be readily adjusted, affording p-type, n-type, or ambipolar organic
   semiconductors with highly efficient charge transport properties in
   OTFTs. In the past few years, a number of DPP-based small molecular and
   polymeric semiconductors have been reported to show mobility close to or
   greater than 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). DPP-based polymer semiconductors have
   achieved record high mobility values for p-type (hole mobility: 10.5
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), n-type (electron mobility: 3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), and
   ambipolar (hole/electron mobilities: 1.18/1.86 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) OTFTs
   among the known polymer semiconductors. Many DPP-based organic
   semiconductors have favourable energy levels and band gaps along with
   high hole mobility, which enable them as promising donor materials for
   OPVs. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 6.05\% were achieved
   for OPVs using DPP-based polymers, demonstrating their potential
   usefulness for the organic solar cell technology. This article provides
   an overview of the recent exciting progress made in DPP-containing
   polymers and small molecules that have shown high charge carrier
   mobility, around 0.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) or greater. It focuses on the
   structural design, optoelectronic properties, molecular organization,
   morphology, as well as performances in OTFTs and OPVs of these high

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between sunshine duration and solar
   radiation received on the earth's surface. Sixty-nine thousand pairs of
   sunshine radiation readings from 670 sites were analyzed. A
   generalization of the Angstrom-Prescott equation of the form (K) over
   bar = (K) over bar (clear) {[}beta + (1 - beta)S-gamma] was found to
   most efficiently fit the data and suggests the relationship between the
   average daily atmospheric transmittance (K) over bar and the sunshine
   fraction S is non-linear. The suggested reason for this non-linearity is
   that a reduced sunshine fraction not only decreases the clear sky
   radiation duration, but also the radiation transmitted through clouds,
   i.e. clouds get optically thicker with decreasing S. This finding is
   supported on theoretical grounds and by analyzing instantaneous solar
   radiation measurements from Australia and Germany.
   Representing the sunshine fraction in terms of the proportion of beam
   radiation reaching the earth's surface S = (H) over bar (b)vertical
   bar(H) over bar (b,clear) leads to a fundamental connection between the
   monthly average diffuse fraction and the sunshine radiation
   relationship. Moreover, it confirms the non-linearity of the latter
   relationship, which was previously questioned because of limited data
   and/or poor quality sunshine measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   mixing enhances both hole and electron transport. The higher
   conductivity may be attributed to a higher concentration of ``free{''}

Title = {{Measurement of stressstrain behaviour of human hair fibres using optical
   techniques}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COSMETIC SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{238-243}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Synopsis Many studies have presented stressstrain relationship of human
   hair, but most of them have been based on an engineering stressstrain
   curve, which is not a true representation of stressstrain behaviour. In
   this study, a more accurate true' stressstrain curve of human hair was
   determined by applying optical techniques to the images of the hair
   deformed under tension. This was achieved by applying digital image
   cross-correlation (DIC) to 10x magnified images of hair fibres taken
   under increasing tension to estimate the strain increments. True strain
   was calculated by summation of the strain increments according to the
   theoretical definition of true' strain. The variation in diameter with
   the increase in longitudinal elongation was also measured from the 40x
   magnified images to estimate the Poisson's ratio and true stress. By
   combining the true strain and the true stress, a true stressstrain curve
   could be determined, which demonstrated much higher stress values than
   the conventional engineering stressstrain curve at the same degree of
   deformation. Four regions were identified in the true stressstrain
   relationship and empirical constitutive equations were proposed for each
   region. Theoretical analysis on the necking condition using the
   constitutive equations provided the insight into the failure mechanism
   of human hair. This analysis indicated that local thinning caused by
   necking does not occur in the hair fibres, but, rather, relatively
   uniform deformation takes place until final failure (fracture)
   eventually occurs. Resume De nombreuses etudes ont presente des
   relations contrainte-deformation d'un cheveu humain, mais la plupart
   d'entre elles ont ete fondees sur courbe contrainte-deformation
   artificielle qui n'est pas une vraie representation du comportement
   contrainte-deformation. Dans cette etude, une mesure plus precise, une
   vraie courbe contrainte-deformation d'un cheveu humain a ete determinee
   en appliquant des techniques optiques aux images des cheveux deformes
   sous tension. Ceci fut obtenu en appliquant sur la correlation croisee
   (DIC) des images numeriques agrandies 10X des cheveux prises sous
   tension croissante pour estimer les increments de deformation. La
   deformation vraie a ete calculee par sommation des increments de
   deformation en fonction de la definition theorique de la << vraie >>
   tension. La variation de diametre avec l'augmentation de l'allongement
   longitudinal est egalement mesuree a partir des images agrandies 40X,
   afin d'estimer le coefficient de Poisson et le stress vrai. En combinant
   la vraie tension et le stress vrai, une veritable courbe
   contrainte-deformation peut etre determinee, qui a montre les valeurs
   des contraintes beaucoup plus eleves que la courbe
   contrainte-deformation conventionnelle au meme degre de deformation.
   Quatre regions ont ete identifiees dans la vraie relation
   contrainte-deformation et des equations empiriques equations
   constitutives ont ete proposees pour chaque region. L'analyse theorique
   de la condition de striction en utilisant les equations constitutives de
   la condition permet de mieux comprendre le mecanisme de rupture du
   cheveu humain. Cette analyse a revele qu'un amincissement local cause
   par striction ne se produit pas dans les fibres capillaires, mais,
   plutot, une deformation relativement uniforme a lieu jusqu'a la finale
   defaillance (rupture).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we obtain analytical approximations for various
   performance measures for a large fluid stochastic network that operates
   under a balanced fair bandwidth allocation policy. Balanced fairness
   results in the insensitivity of the stationary distribution of the
   number in the system to the precise distribution of file sizes. Balanced
   fairness has been shown to coincide with proportional fairness in large
   systems. The model we consider is that of servers operating under
   balanced fair rate allocations that are accessed by a large number of
   independent heterogeneous flows characterized by their arrival rate and
   general distributions of the file sizes; and a maximum service rate
   associated with each type of flow. The largeness of the system is
   parameterized by a scaling parameter that scales the arrival rates and
   capacity in such a way that the ratio is fixed. By exploiting a
   connection of the congestion probabilities with multirate Erlang loss
   systems, we use local limit large deviation methods to obtain accurate
   approximations as the scaling increases. The paper first discusses the
   single link case which is then extended to the case of a parking lot
   model that is a special case of tree networks.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for the dynamic performance of gas separation with

   along the permeator length (both residue/permeate streams) with minimal

   solution technique were applied to investigate dynamic performance of
   several membrane module configurations for methane recovery from biogas

   N2 and CH4. Recycle ratio plays a crucial role, and optimum recycle
   ratio vital for the retentate recycle to permeate and permeate recycle
   to feed operation was found. From the concept of two recycle operations,

Abstract = {{A systematic and holistic watershed model comparison and selection
   process, integrating a full range of relevant criteria, is illustrated
   here. The process consists of screening for a set of candidate models on
   the basis of prerequisite model attributes; assessing hydrologic

   assessing operational logistics performance, reflecting somewhat
   subjective but centrally important issues around relative feasibility
   and suitability of candidate models in the intended context of use; and
   integrating the hydrologic and operational performance results, which
   are each evaluated using a weighted-matrix approach, into a single
   coherent and comprehensive ranking system. The process was applied to
   evaluation of watershed models for operational hydroelectric inflow
   forecasting in British Columbia, Canada. An important feature of the
   study was its horse-race project management approach, involving a
   supervised competition between expert teams using different models but
   the same data sets. Four models passed the prescreening phase, and these
   were evaluated for three test basins representing contrasting
   geophysical regimes. The model selection process presented here is
   believed to be potentially very broadly useful. DOI:

Title = {{Experimental and Numerical Methods for Detection of Voids in Wood Poles
   Using Ultrasonic Testing}},

Abstract = {{Utility wood poles are extensively used to support
   electrical-transmission and distribution lines in North America. Wood
   poles are exposed to extreme weather conditions, making them vulnerable
   to internal deterioration resulting in loss of pole strength, which can
   compromise the reliability of energy supply to customers. Ultrasonic
   testing is a nondestructive method that has been used for evaluation of
   the internal condition of in-service wood poles. However, the current
   assessment criterion is mostly based only on the first arrival of
   compression waves. This paper presents experimental and numerical
   methods for the detection of voids in wood poles using ultrasonic waves;
   the wood is considered as an orthotropic material. This investigation
   involves ultrasonic testing of a red-pine pole without and with a void.
   Changes in both compression wave velocity and wave attenuation are used
   to identify the presence of a void. An orthotropic finite-element model,
   calibrated with experimental results, is used to study the propagation
   of ultrasonic waves in a cross section of red-pine poles. Experimental
   and numerical results show that for a void-pole diameter ratio of
   phi(void)/phi(pole) = 0.2 and frequency of 50 kHz (lambda = 1.7
   phi(void)), the wave velocity across the pole decreases an average of
   20\%, whereas the wave is attenuated by a factor of 10. Thus, the
   consideration of wave attenuation in addition to wave velocity is
   critical to improve the reliability of current methodologies. The
   compression wavefront shows a triangular shape before reaching the pith
   of the wood pole, after which it shows a circular shape, as in the case
   of an isotropic material. In addition, the surface wave shows
   displacements mostly in the radial direction instead of the typical
   retrograde ellipse in an isotropic medium. (c) 2013 American Society of

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Voiced speech is a highly complex process involving coupled interactions
   between the vocal fold structure, aerodynamics, and acoustic field.
   Reduced-order lumped-element models of the vocal fold structure, coupled
   with various aerodynamic and acoustic models, have proven useful in a
   wide array of speech investigations. These simplified models of speech,
   in which the vocal folds are approximated as arrays of lumped masses
   connected to one another via springs and dampers to simulate the
   viscoelastic tissue properties, have been used to study phenomena
   ranging from sustained vowels and pitch glides to polyps and vocal fold
   paralysis. Over the past several decades a variety of structural,
   aerodynamic, and acoustic models have been developed and deployed into
   the lumped-element modeling framework. This paper aims to provide an
   overview of advances in lumped-element models and their constituents,
   with particular emphasis on their physical foundations and limitations.
   Examples of the application of lumped-element models to speech studies
   will also be addressed, as well as an outlook on the direction and
   future of these models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A water-soluble rhodium catalyst has been found to be an efficient
   catalyst for hydrogenation of unsaturated polymers in the absence of any
   organic solvent. Natural rubber (NR) latex and synthetic polyisoprene
   (PIP) emulsion were hydrogenated using rhodium trichloride (RhCl3 center
   dot 3H(2)O) and different ligand types, triphenylphosphine (PPh3),
   trisulfonated triphenylphosphine (TPPTS) and monosulfonated
   triphenylphosphine (TPPMS) as a catalyst precursor. The hydrogenated NR
   and PIP were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1
   NMR). A low degree of hydrogenation (HD) was observed when using
   RhCl3/PPh3 or RhCl3/TPPTS. In contrast, a high HD of 85.8\% was achieved
   by using RhCl3/TPPMS. The catalytic behavior could be well explained by
   the Hartley ionic spherical micelle model. The HD increased with
   increasing catalyst amount, reaction temperature and H-2 pressure. The
   catalyst activity of RhCl3/TPPMS for NR hydrogenation was found to be
   lower than that for PIP hydrogenation for all conditions due to
   impurities in the latex, including protein. The hydrogenated NR (86\%HD)
   has high thermal stability with a maximum decomposition temperature of
   466 degrees C and a glass transition temperature of -60 degrees C. From
   dynamic mechanical analysis, hydrogenated NR had a maximum storage
   modulus due to the saturated carbon domains of the ethylene propylene
   segments in the polymer chains. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

   Naturally Fractured Carbonate Reservoirs}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Appropriate production method selection for Viscous Oil (e. g., Heavy
   Oil, Extra Heavy Oil, and Bitumen) Naturally Fractured Carbonate
   Reservoirs (VO NFCRs) mostly depends on the quality of the fluid and
   reservoir properties. Selection of a particular production method for a
   reservoir is generally evaluated through an exhaustive experimental,
   field pilot, and mathematical modeling approach. In the absence of
   robust and quick predictive tools, using connectionist techniques for
   performance prediction of a particular production method can be a
   valuable asset. In this study, a new screening tool is developed based
   on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) optimized with Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) to assess the performance of steamflooding in VO
   NFCRs. As expected, Recovery Factor (RF) and Cumulative Steam to Oil
   Ratio (CSOR) during steamflooding are highly affected by the magnitudes
   of oil saturation and viscosity. The developed PSO-ANN model,
   conventional ANN and statistical correlations were examined using real
   data. Comparison of the predictions and real data implies the
   superiority of the proposed PSO-ANN model with an absolute average error
   percentage < 6.5\%, a determination coefficient (R-2) > 0.98, and Mean
   Squared Error (MSE) < 0.06, in contrast with conventional ANN model and
   empirical correlations for prediction of RF and CSOR. This indicates a
   great potential for application of hybrid PSO-ANN models to screen
   Viscous Oil carbonate reservoirs for steamflooding. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   7.5 mm x 3 mm. The filter employs a via-less Coplanar Waveguide to
   microstrip transition and the layout is configured to allow ease of
   adjusting and tuning. The filter with via-less Coplanar Waveguide
   input/output pads is measured in an RF cryogenic probe station at 77 and

Abstract = {{CO2-expanded water (CXW), CO2-expanded methanol (CXM), and CO2-expanded

   the removal of Wilkinson's catalyst from HNBR with assistance of various
   chelating agents including ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),

   diethylenetriamine (DETA), N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA),
   and N,N,N',N',N `'-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA). The
   performance of each extraction system consisting of a CXL and a
   chelating agent was carefully evaluated. CXM and PMDETA constitute the
   optimal extraction system. The reactions involved in this system were
   analyzed to identify the challenges for successful extraction. The
   extraction rates were measured as a function of temperature and
   pressure, respectively. 80 degrees C and 6 MPa were considered as the
   most favourable conditions. In addition, the effect of the HNBR sample
   thickness on the extraction performance was examined. Thinner samples
   showed advantages in promoting the extraction rate. This green
   separation technique was verified with a residue containing only 59 ppm
   rhodium after a sequential operation at 80 degrees C and 6 MPa. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Ba-, K-, and Ba-K-based NOX storage/reduction (NSR) catalysts were
   prepared, with and without Sn as a promotor. Catalysts and catalyst/soot
   mixtures were evaluated for NOX reduction and soot oxidation under
   standard NSR cycling conditions. The activity study was accompanied by
   dispersion measurements, TEM, XRD, and XPS characterization. It was
   found that modification with Sn did not significantly influence NOX
   adsorption, however, Sn notably enhanced soot oxidation for Ba-based
   systems. This was correlated to Pt oxidation state modification. Also
   the addition of Sn to the Pt-Ba and Pt-Ba-K catalysts lowered the onset
   temperature of S release. The Pt-Ba-K catalyst had higher stability
   against S-poisoning, likely due to the preferential adsorption of S onto
   K-species, partially maintaining Ba sites for NOX trapping. (C) 2012

Volume = {{207}},
Pages = {{220-226}},

Abstract = {{The effect of an axial Pt distribution along a diesel oxidation catalyst
   (DOC) was investigated by comparing a standard catalyst, with a
   homogeneously distributed Pt amount along the length, with a
   non-homogeneously distributed catalyst (zoned). The zoned catalyst had
   more Pt located at the upstream portion, and less downstream, while
   maintaining the same total amount of Pt as the standard case. The
   effects of flow rate on NO, CO or C3H6 oxidation, and during oxidation
   of NO and C3H6 as a mixture, were used for the comparison. The reaction
   details along the catalyst were also resolved using spatially resolved,
   capillary inlet mass spectrometry (Spaci-MS). Results showed that the
   performance of the two catalysts were similar at low flow rate and with
   a single reacting gas, while the zoned sample worked better for CO and
   C3H6 oxidation as the flow rate increased, and better for NO oxidation
   in the NO/C3H6 gas mixture. With CO or C3H6 oxidation, the superior
   performance of the zoned sample was due to a larger, localized exotherm
   and a decreased self-poisoning effect. The exothermic heat produced in
   the front part of the zoned catalyst allowed it to reach higher
   temperature at the front faster than the homogeneous/standard sample and
   it also lowered the effect of self-poisoning by converting most of the
   reactants in the front part. NO oxidation, being kinetically more
   challenging, occurred along the entire length of catalyst at low
   temperature, not achieving near 100\% conversion in these tests.
   Spatially resolved experiments during C3H6 and NO oxidation, as a
   mixture, showed that NO oxidation started after C3H6 was consumed.
   Therefore, for the zoned sample, C3H6 was oxidized closer to the inlet
   portion of the catalyst, where a higher density of Pt was located,
   leaving the rest of the catalyst available for NO oxidation. However,
   with the standard sample, C3H6 oxidation utilized a larger part of the
   catalyst leaving a smaller portion of the monolith for NO oxidation. (C)

Abstract = {{The electron acceptor building block for pi-conjugated copolymers,
   3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-diketopyrrolo{[}3,2-b]pyrrole (isoDPPT), was
   synthesized following two routes. The comparison between isoDPPT and
   widely investigated 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-diketopyrrolo{[}3,4-c]pyrrole
   (DPPT) in terms of molecular orbital computations, single crystal X-ray
   diffraction, optical absorption and cyclic voltammogram was utilized to
   elucidate structural and electronic structure differences between the
   two cores. Both units are found to be planar in the solid state, exhibit
   similar LUMO energy, however, isoDPPT exhibits a much deeper HOMO
   energy. Six isoDPPT-based polymers with optical bandgaps spanning from
   1.44 to 1.76 eV were synthesized by copolymerizing isoDPPT with the
   following building blocks: 2,2'-bithiophene (for P1),
   4,4'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno{[}3,2-b:2',3'-d]silole (for P2),
   3,3'''-didodecylquaterthiophene (for P3),

   3,3'-bis(dodecyloxy)-2,2'-bithiophene (for P6). Field-effect transistors
   and bulk heterojunction solar cells based on isoDPPT copolymers were
   fabricated and the response compared vis-a-vis to those of some
   DPPT-based polymers. Hole mobility (mu(h)) of 0.03 cm(2)/(V.s) and solar
   cell power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.1\% were achieved for

Abstract = {{We designed and demonstrated a terahertz quantum cascade laser based on
   indirect pump injection to the upper lasing state and phonon scattering
   extraction from the lower lasing state. By employing a rate equation
   formalism and a genetic algorithm, an optimized active region design
   with four-well GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As cascade module was obtained and
   epitaxially grown. A figure of merit which is defined as the ratio of
   modal gain versus injection current was maximized at 150 K. A fabricated
   device with a Au metal-metal waveguide and a top n(+) GaAs contact layer
   lased at 2.4 THz up to 128.5 K, while another one without the top n(+)
   GaAs lased up to 152.5 K (1.3 (h) over bar omega/k(B)). The experimental
   results have been analyzed with rate equation and nonequilibrium Green's
   function models. A high population inversion is achieved at high
   temperature using a small oscillator strength of 0.28, while its
   combination with the low injection coupling strength of 0.85 meV results
   in a low current. The carefully engineered wavefunctions enhance the
   quantum efficiency of the device and therefore improve the output
   optical power even with an unusually low injection coupling strength.

Abstract = {{The development of safe and efficient nonviral gene delivery carriers
   has received a great deal of attention in the past decade. A class of
   amphipathic peptides has shown to be able to cross cell membranes and
   deliver cargo to the intracellular environment. Here, we introduce an
   18-mer amphipathic peptide, C6M1, as a modified version of peptide C6
   for short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. The importance of tryptophan
   residues and the effect of peptide sequence modification on its
   solubility, secondary structure, cytotoxicity, and uptake efficiency
   were investigated The solubility of C6M1 in aqueous solutions was
   greatly enhanced compared to that of C6, confirmed by surface tension
   and anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid fluorescence measurements. C6M1
   had a random/helical structure in water with the ability to attain a
   helical conformation in the presence of anionic components or membrane
   mimicking environments The modification significantly reduced the
   cytotoxicity of the peptide, making it a safer carrier for siRNA
   delivery. C6M1 was also found similar to 90\% more efficient than C6 in
   delivering Cy3-labeled siRNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium carbonate, or calcite, scale is frequently encountered in
   oilfield operations. In a reservoir, when brine is produced, it is
   disturbed because the brine is moved to lower temperature and pressure
   areas. The dissolved concentration of calcium carbonate is greatly
   influenced by temperature and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide gas
   over the water. The net result of a drop in temperature and pressure may
   therefore be an increase or a decrease in the calcium carbonate
   saturation ratio as determined by the temperature change relative to the
   pressure change. In this article, a simple Arrhenius-type function is
   developed to estimate the combined effect of temperature and carbon
   dioxide pressure on calcium carbonate dissolved concentration in
   oilfield brines. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with
   reported data in the literature with average absolute deviation being
   less than 2\%. The tool developed in this study can be of immense
   practical value for engineers to have a quick check of combined effect
   of temperature and carbon dioxide pressure on calcium carbonate
   dissolved concentration at various conditions without opting for any
   field or experimental trials. In particular, engineers would find the
   approach to be user friendly with transparent calculations involving no

Title = {{Failure of silver nanowire transparent electrodes under current flow}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Silver nanowire transparent electrodes have received much attention as a
   replacement for indium tin oxide, particularly in organic solar cells.
   In this paper, we show that when silver nanowire electrodes conduct
   current at levels encountered in organic solar cells, the electrodes can
   fail in as little as 2 days. Electrode failure is caused by Joule
   heating which causes the nanowires to breakup and thus create an
   electrical discontinuity in the nanowire film. More heat is created, and
   thus failure occurs sooner, in more resistive electrodes and at higher
   current densities. Suggestions to improve the stability of silver
   nanowire electrodes are given.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed target allocation and tracking is an important research
   problem. This problem is complex but has many applications in various
   domains, including, pervasive computing, surveillance and military
   systems. In this paper we propose a technique to solve the target to
   sensor allocation problem by modeling the problem as a hierarchical
   Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (HDCOP). Distributed
   Constrain Optimization Problems (DCOPs) tend to be computationally
   expensive and often intractable, particularly in large problem spaces
   such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). To address this challenge we
   propose changing the sensor to target allocation as a hierarchical set
   of smaller DCOPs with a shared system of constraints. Thus, we avoid
   significant computational and communication costs. Furthermore, in
   contrast to other DCOP modeling methods, a non-binary variable modeling
   is employed to reduce the number of intra-agent constraints. To evaluate
   the performance of the proposed approach, we use the surveillance system
   of the Regional Waterloo Airport as a test case. Two DCOP solution
   algorithms are considered, namely, the Distributed Breakout Algorithm
   (DBA) and the Asynchronous Distributed Optimization (ADOPT). We evaluate
   the computational and communication costs of these two algorithms for
   solving the target to sensor allocation problem using the proposed
   hierarchical formulation. We compare the performance of these algorithms
   with respect to the incurred computational and communication costs. (C)

Abstract = {{The performance of a single cell flowing electrolyte-direct methanol
   fuel cell (FE-DMFC) was experimentally studied and its performance was
   compared to a regular DMFC. The active area of the fuel cell was
   approximately 25 cm(2). Serpentine channels were used for both the
   methanol and air flows. Two combinations of Nafion (R) polymer
   electrolyte membranes (PEMs) were used in the MEAs. These were
   NR-212/N-117 (Type 1) and NR-212/NR-212 (Type 2). For this study,
   diluted sulphuric acid was used as the electrolyte, which flows through
   a channel made of a polyethylene porous material. The flowing
   electrolyte conditions (e.g., flow rate, channel thickness and sulphuric
   acid concentration), the methanol concentration, and the fuel cell
   temperatures were varied to study how these parameters affect the
   overall performance of the FE-DMFC. Type 1 MEA used in conjunction with
   2 M methanol produced the highest current density. The power density
   decreased when the thickness of the flowing electrolyte channel was
   increased, and the performance of the fuel cell increased when the
   temperature of the fuel cell was increased, as expected. The results
   show that the performance of the present FE-DMFC was similar to a DMFC
   using the same active area and a single MEA (Nafion (R) N-117). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The organic/electrode interfaces in organic solar cells are
   systematically studied for their light, heat, and electrical stability
   in an inert atmosphere. Various extraction layers are examined for their
   effect on device stability, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)

   as well as LiF, Cs2CO3, and lithium acetylacetonate (Liacac) for
   electron extraction layers. The organic/metal interface is shown to be
   inherently photo-unstable, resulting in significant losses in device
   efficiency with irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   measurements of the organic/aluminum interface suggest that the
   photo-induced changes are chemical in nature. In general, interfacial
   layers are shown to substantially reduce photo-degradation of the active
   layer/electrode interface. In spite of their photo-stability, several
   interfacial layers present at the active layer/cathode interface suffer
   from thermal degradation effects due to temperature increases under
   exposure to light. Electrical aging effects are proven to be negligible

Abstract = {{Very active carbon-supported Ir modified with transition metal M
   catalysts (M = V, Co, Ni and Ti) were synthesized by an ethylene glycol
   (EG) reduction method as novel, suitable anode electrode materials for
   polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) applications. IrM
   nanoparticles showed a narrow particle size distribution centered around
   2-3 nm, and were uniformly dispersed on Vulcan XC-72 supports.
   Investigation of the catalytic activity by means of linear sweep
   voltammetry (LSV) employing a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup has
   revealed that the activities of these catalysts follows the order of
   IrCo/C > IrV/C > IrNi/C > IrTi/C > commercial Pt/C > Ir/C toward the
   hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Membrane electrode assemblies (MEA)
   prepared with the IrM/C anode catalysts demonstrated the beneficial
   impact of transition metal addition during catalyst synthesis, with
   IrCo/C and IrV/C providing the highest MEA power densities. EDX results
   indicated that these two catalysts contained negligible Co and V
   contents, respectively, indicating a beneficial dealloying effect
   resulting from HCl addition during catalyst synthesis. Herein, IrM/C
   materials are presented as promising replacements to conventional
   platinum based materials for utilization as anode electrocatalysts for

Title = {{NOX storage and reduction over a perovskite-based lean NOX trap catalyst}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{66-74}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Typical lean NOX trap (LNT) catalysts contain Pt, which catalyzes NO
   oxidation and NOX reduction, and an alkali or alkaline earth material
   for NOX storage via nitrate formation. The catalyst is operated in a
   cyclic mode, with one phase of the cycle under oxidizing conditions
   where NOX is trapped, and a second phase, which is reductant-rich
   relative to O-2, where stored NOX is reduced to N-2. A recently
   developed catalyst uses a perovskite material as part of the LNT
   formulation for the oxidation reactions thereby eliminating the need for
   Pt. Pd and Rh are still added, to accommodate hydrocarbon oxidation and
   NO reduction, respectively. NO oxidation kinetics over the fully
   formulated and bare perovskite material were determined, with NO, O-2
   and NO2 orders being at or near 1, 1 and -1, respectively for both
   samples. The fully formulated sample, which contains Ba supported on the
   perovskite, was evaluated in terms of NOX trapping ability and NOX
   reduction as a function of temperature and reduction phase properties.
   Trapping and overall performance increased with temperature to 375
   degrees C, primarily due to improved NO oxidation, as NO2 is more
   readily trapped, or better diffusion of nitrates away from the initial
   trapping sites or into the Ba particles. At higher temperatures nitrate
   stability decreased, thus decreasing the trapping ability. At these
   higher temperatures, a more significant amount of unreduced NOX formed
   during the reduction phase, primarily due to nitrate instability and
   decomposition and the relative rates of the NOX and oxygen storage (OS)
   component reduction reactions. Most of the chemistry observed was
   similar to that observed over Pt-based LNT catalysts. However, there
   were some distinct differences, including a stronger nitrate diffusion
   resistance at low temperature, a more significant reductant-induced
   nitrate decomposition reaction and nitrate inhibition of OSC reduction
   at the onset of the regeneration phase. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Aerosolized metal nanoparticles have numerous existing and emerging
   applications in materials science, but their functionality in these

   laser-induced incandescence (TiRe-LII) has been investigated as a
   candidate for sizing aerosolized metal nanoparticles, which requires an
   accurate model of the heat transfer through which the laser-energized
   particles re-equilibrate with the bath gas. This paper presents such a
   model for molybdenum nanoparticles, which is then used to analyze
   experimental TiRe-LII data made on aerosols of molybdenum nanoparticles
   in helium, argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. While it is possible to
   estimate the particle size distribution width, recovering particles
   sizes requires independent knowledge of the thermal accommodation

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to evaluate the worth of installing
   renewable distributed generation (DG) in distribution networks.
   Moreover, the work optimally allocates these DG units in the
   distribution network to maximize the worth of the connection to the
   local distribution company (LDC), as well as the customers connected to
   the system. The proposed methodology helps the LDC to better assess the
   benefits of the renewable DG units' proposed connections and to identify
   the optimal buses on which to connect these DG units. The benefits
   considered in this paper are deferral of upgrade investments, reduction
   of the cost of energy losses, and reliability improvement, which is
   represented by the interruption cost reduction. The proposed methodology
   takes into consideration the uncertainty and variability associated with
   the output power of renewable DG as well as the load variability. The
   planning problem of determining the optimal location and sizes of DG
   units is defined as multi-objective mixed integer programming.}},

Abstract = {{Although wind power as a renewable energy is assumed to be an
   advantageous source of energy, its intermittent nature causes
   difficulties especially in the islanding mode of operation. Conventional
   synchronous generators can help to compensate for wind fluctuations, but
   the slow behavior of such systems may result in stability concerns.
   Here, the virtual inertia method, which imitates the kinetic inertia of
   synchronous generator, is used to improve the system dynamic behavior.
   Since the proposed method focuses on short-term oscillations and
   incorporates no long-term power regulation, it needs no mass storage
   device. Thus, the method is economical. To prevent any additional cost,
   the rotating mass connected to the DFIG shaft or a super-capacitor
   connected to the DC-link of a back-to-back inverter of a wind power
   generator could be used. The concept and the proposed control methods
   are discussed in detail. Eigen-value analysis is used to study how the
   proposed method improves system stability. The advantages and
   disadvantages of using DFIG rotating mass or super-capacitor as the
   virtual inertia source are compared. The proposed approach also shows
   that while virtual inertia is not incorporated directly in long-term
   frequency and power regulation, it may enhance the system steady-state
   behavior indirectly. A time domain simulation is used to verify the
   results of the analytical studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel cooperative protocol has been proposed to provide
   a proper voltage control for multiple feeders having a transformer
   tap-changer (LTC), unbalanced load diversity (station with different

   feeder. The proposed cooperative protocol has been defined according to
   the distributed control technology, where LTC and DG units are
   considered as control agents. Two conflicting objectives have been
   defined for each control agent. The first objective aims to achieve the
   system requirements by minimizing the voltage deviation and the second
   objective aims to achieve the device requirements by reducing the tap
   operation and maximizing the energy capture for LTC and DG units,
   respectively. The interior structures of the control agents and the
   communication acts between them have been designed to achieve the best
   compromise between the two objectives of each control agent. The
   effectiveness of the proposed cooperative scheme has been verified via
   different case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of determining the elastic buckling strengths of unbraced
   steel frames subjected to variable loadings can be expressed as a pair
   of maximization and minimization problems with stability constraints
   based on the concept of storey-based buckling which accounts for the
   lateral stiffness interaction among columns in a storey while resisting
   applied loads. The maximization and minimization problems can be solved
   by either linear programming method or nonlinear programming method
   depends on whether an approximation on the column stiffness being
   applied or not. Compared with the nonlinear programming method, the
   linear programming method based on Taylor series approximation on column
   stiffness is considerably simpler and more suitable for engineering
   practice but the frame buckling strengths may be overestimated in some
   cases, which may result in unconservative designs. In this study, a
   secant approximation of the column stiffness is introduced. Then, a
   modified linear programming method based on the secant approximation is
   proposed. Four unbraced steel frames are investigated to illustrate that
   the linear programming method in light of the secant approximation can
   yield conservative results and maintain simplicity.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A new approach to generate chaotic phenomenon, called chaos
   entanglement, is proposed in this paper. The basic principle is to
   entangle two or multiple stable linear subsystems by entanglement
   functions to form an artificial chaotic system such that each of them
   evolves in a chaotic manner. Firstly, a new attractor, entangling a
   two-dimensional linear subsystem and a one-dimensional one by sine
   function, is presented as an example. Dynamical analysis shows that both
   entangled subsystems are bounded and all equilibra are unstable saddle
   points when chaos entanglement is achieved. Also, numerical computation
   shows that this system has one positive Lyapunov exponent, which implies
   chaos. Furthermore, two conditions are given to achieve chaos
   entanglement. Along this way, by different linear subsystems and
   different entanglement functions, a variety of novel chaotic attractors
   have been created and abundant complex dynamics are exhibited. Our
   discovery indicates that it is not difficult any more to construct new
   artificial chaotic systems/networks for engineering applications such as
   chaos-based secure communication. Finally, a possible circuit is given
   to realize these new chaotic attractors.}},

Abstract = {{The use of pulsed electric field (PEF) is considered as one of the most
   promising nonthermal food treatment methods. One of the design
   challenges in applying PEF technology is the design of the treatment
   chamber. In this paper, the effect of using multiple treatment zones on
   both the pulse shape and killing efficiency of PEF technology is
   addressed. With the increase in treatment zones, the loading effects
   and, hence, the circuit impedance changes result in changing both the
   pulsewidth and pulse shape. The changes have resulted in generating
   simple exponentially decaying pulses to oscillatory pulses, with
   significant reduction in pulsewidths. On the other hand, the increase in
   treatment zones also results in increased number of pulses applied as
   the liquid flows through different zones. It is therefore important to
   investigate the effects of treatment chamber impedance characteristics
   on PEF treatment performance, considering different liquids with a wide
   range of conductivity.}},

   aging was simulated by thermal aging the blend at temperatures up to 80

   aging. In both cases, two sets of aging times were applied: ``short{''}
   term (a parts per thousand currency sign16 hour aging) and ``long{''}
   term (@168 hour aging). The short term tests were used to generate
   momentary master curves by applying time/aging-time and time/moisture
   superposition principles. Using the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)
   expression, the model parameters determined from curve fitting master
   curves were used to predict longer term stress relaxation behaviour. The
   predictions, verified against experimental results, showed reasonable
   agreement for all hygothermal exposure conditions except for full

Abstract = {{A new numerical algorithm is presented to solve the problem of switching
   noise in multilayer circuit boards and packages. The algorithm is based
   on domain decomposition using the finite-difference frequency-domain
   (FDFD) method. Each layer of the multilayer board or package is modeled
   using a standard 2-D FDFD scheme and linked to other layers through a
   multiport network that effectively incorporates the via circuit models
   between the layers. It is shown that the algorithm is simple to
   implement and is highly efficient for multilayer boards or packages as
   the overall FDFD system matrix is highly sparse, thus can be solved very
   efficiently using advanced sparse matrix solvers. Furthermore,
   successive solution of the system matrix for different source and victim
   locations does not call for new fill of the system matrix, thus allowing
   efficient analysis of different source and victim locations. To validate
   the new algorithm, we manufacture a three-layer board, measure the
   scattering parameters between two specific locations, and obtain strong
   agreement with the solution obtained using the FDFD scheme introduced
   here.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a mixed-technology extended Doherty amplifier
   using asymmetrical voltage biasing with an LDMOS main device and a GaN
   auxiliary device to improve the power utilization factor of the

   achieve reconfigurable back-off power ranges and an extended bandwidth
   without using a mixed-signal setup. The analysis also highlights the
   relationship between power utilization and the range of the
   reconfigurable back-off power level. Finally, we demonstrate that the
   proposed amplifier can be optimally configured for a given modulated
   signal to obtain the highest average efficiency. A 180-W
   mixed-technology prototype Doherty amplifier measured peak and back-off
   efficiencies greater than 50\% when configured for 6, 8, and 10 dB of
   back-off power level at 790, 870, and 960 MHz under continuous-wave

   actuation and gripping maneuvers were achieved by thermally activating
   processed material regions which possessed unique phase transformation

   existence of each thermomechanical material domain was confirmed through
   differential scanning calorimetry analysis. Independent thermomechanical
   recoveries of each embedded shape memory were captured using tensile
   testing methods. Deployment of each embedded shape memory was achieved
   using resistive heating, and in situ resistivity measurements were used

Abstract = {{Asphaltene precipitation (AP) is recognized as a complicated occurrence
   that results in weakening reservoir characteristics and subsequent
   considerable decline in oil production rate. Asphaltene instability
   occurs due to variations in thermodynamic properties such pressure,
   temperature, and mixture composition. AP prediction is an important
   design factor in implementation of any enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
   process. In this study, experiments were conducted using some light oil
   samples to measure important phase behavior properties such as the
   bubble point pressure (BPP) and the amount of precipitated asphaltenes.
   A thermodynamics model was also developed to determine equilibrium
   compositions of the oil samples, considering AP. Then, potential
   application of a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model,
   optimized by the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), was proposed
   to estimate BPP and the amount of AP. Comparison between the ICA-ANN
   predictions and the experimental data shows that the average absolute
   error between data originated from these two different approaches is
   less than 5\%. In addition, it was found that temperature and pressure
   have the greatest impacts on AP during natural depletion. Employing
   laboratory PVT data, the thermodynamics framework resulted in
   construction of an asphaltene precipitation envelope. This study implies
   that utilization of an appropriate PVT model along with the ICA-ANN
   approach in the investigation of AP leads to more reliable predictions
   compared to the conventional ANN and also a scaling model. The outcomes
   of this study appear to be useful in the design stage of more-efficient
   EOR processes.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogenated polyisoprene (HPIP)-SiO2 nanocomposites were synthesized
   via differential microemulsiion polymerization followed by diimide
   hydrogenation. First, the isoprene monomer was polymerized on the silane
   treated nanosilica by differential microemulsion polymerization to
   obtain polyisoprene (PIP)-SiO2 nanoparticles with a particle size of 43
   nm. PIP-SiO2 latex was subsequently hydrogenated at the carbon-carbon
   double bonds by diimide reduction in the presence of hydrazine and
   hydrogen peroxide with boric acid as promotor to provide HPIP-SiO2
   nanocomposites. Core-shell morphology consisting of silica as the
   nano-core encapsulated by HPIP as the nano-shell was formed. The highest
   hydrogenation degree of 98 \% was achieved at a ratio of hydrogen
   peroxide to hydrazine of 1.5:1. The nanosized HPIP-SiO2 at 98 \%
   hydrogenation showed a maximum degradation temperature of 521 degrees C
   resulting in excellent thermal stability, compared with unfilled PIP
   (387 degrees C). A new nanocomposite of HPIP-SiO2 could be used as a
   novel nanofiller in natural rubber. Consequently, HPIP-SiO2/NR
   composites had improved mechanical properties and exhibited a good

Abstract = {{In this article, a computational modeling method of the multiaxial
   stress-strain notch analysis has been developed to compute
   elasto-plastic notch-tip stress-strain responses using linear elastic
   finite element results of notched components. Application and validation
   of the multiaxial stress-strain notch analysis model were presented by
   comparing computed results of the model to the experimental data of SAE
   1070 steel notched shaft subjected to several nonproportional load
   paths. Based on the comparison between the experimental and computed
   strain histories, the elasto-plastic stress-strain model predicted notch
   strains with reasonable accuracy using linear elastic finite element
   stress histories. The elasto-plastic stress-strain notch analysis model
   provides an efficient and simple analysis method preferable to expensive
   experimental component tests and more complex and time-consuming
   incremental nonlinear finite element analysis. The elasto-plastic
   stress-strain model can thus be employed to perform fatigue life and

Abstract = {{Dielectric zinc magnesium titanate (ZMTO) was synthesized by a facile
   co-precipitation method using TiOSO4 as the Ti source. The decomposition
   and phase evolvement of the as-prepared precipitates during heat
   treatment were characterized by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and
   Fourier-transforming infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. X-ray diffractometry
   shows that different pH levels have a significant influence on the
   crystallization of the as-prepared precipitate due to the magnesium
   doping content. SEM images and EDS data show that fine hexagonal (Zn,
   Mg)TiO3 powders with a Mg doping content of 229 at.\% could be obtained
   at a pH of 9 and a calcination temperature of 800 degrees C. After
   sintering at 1000 degrees C, hexagonal (Zn, Mg)TiO3 demonstrated a
   dielectric constant of 26-24 along with a low dielectric loss of 9.82 x
   10(-4)-6.35 x 10(-4) at measurement frequencies between 10(8) and 10(9)

Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of soils can be inferred via curve fitting of the
   transfer function between the excitation and the induced strain using a
   resonant column device. The shape of the measured transfer function is
   distorted and differs from that of the theoretical transfer function
   because of different shear strain levels at different frequencies in the
   specimen. The difference becomes more pronounced with increasing shear
   strain levels. This study presents a new methodology for the evaluation
   of dynamic properties from an improved transfer function. In this
   methodology, the soil specimen is excited using a sinusoidal carrier
   excitation at the desired strain level coupled with simultaneous
   excitation of a very small strain random noise. The desired strain level
   induced by the fixed sine controls the resonant frequency of the
   specimen, whereas the small strain random noise (always kept small)
   determines the shape of the transfer function and thus the damping
   coefficient. The results indicate excellent matching of the transfer
   function obtained from the proposed method and the theoretical transfer
   function at all shear strain levels. The new methodology also shows good
   potential for the evaluation of dynamic properties of soils as a
   function of frequency in resonant column testing.}},

Abstract = {{In the article, the dynamic surface tension of sodium lignosulfonate
   (SL) aqueous solutions are investigated using an axisymmetric drop shape
   analysis-profile method. The data are analyzed by the Langmuir, Frumkin,

   indicate that the Langmuir model's results with two adjustable

   Langmuir adsorption equation is used to correlate the dynamic adsorption
   processing. The aggregation between SL molecules and the variation of

Title = {{Evaluating noise reduction techniques while considering anatomical noise
   in dual-energy contrast-enhanced mammography}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors describe modifications to previously developed
   cascaded systems analysis to include the anatomical noise in evaluation
   of dual-energy noise reduction techniques. Previous models have ignored
   the anatomical noise in theoretical analysis of noise reduction
   techniques. The inclusion of anatomical noise leads to more accurate
   estimation of potential noise reduction improvements and optimization.
   Methods: The model is applied to dual-energy contrast-enhanced
   mammography. The effect of linear noise reduction filters on the
   anatomical noise is taken into account using cascaded systems analysis.
   The noise model is included in the ideal observer detectability for
   performance evaluation of the noise reduction techniques.
   Results: Dual-energy image noise with and without including the effect
   of anatomical noise in noise reduction technique analysis is reported.
   The theoretical model is compared with clinical images from a previous
   dual-energy contrast enhanced mammography clinical study and good
   agreement is observed. The results suggest that the inclusion of
   anatomical noise in the evaluation and comparison of noise reduction
   techniques is highly warranted for more accurate analysis.
   Conclusions: This work establishes a useful extension to dual-energy
   cascaded systems analysis for maximizing image quality using noise
   reduction techniques. The extension includes the effect of linear image
   filtering, such as that used for noise reduction, on anatomical noise.
   The results suggest that the inclusion of anatomical noise in the
   evaluation of noise reduction techniques can lead to more accurate
   optimization, noise, and performance estimations. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Australia has considerable hot rock geothermal energy potential. This
   results from the widespread occurrence of basement rocks (granites in
   particular) in which heat is generated by natural radioactive decay.
   There are extensive areas where temperatures are estimated to reach at
   least 200 C at around 5 km depth. In Australia, there is also potential
   for lower temperature geothermal resources associated with
   naturally-circulating waters in aquifers deep in a number of sedimentary
   basins (Hot Sedimentary Aquifer Geothermal). These are potentially
   suitable for electricity generation and direct use.
   This paper will focus on the need to improve geothermal energy
   utilization in Australia, challenges facing it and the future benefits,
   This study shows, there is a significant potential for energy savings
   through greater use of geothermal energy in some regions of Australia.

Abstract = {{A multi-walled carbon nanotube and polypyrrole composite (PPy/MWNT) was
   synthesized by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer on the surface
   of MWNT. As-prepared PPy/MWNT composite was mixed with an aqueous
   suspension of nanosized sulfur particle, followed by heat-treatment to
   obtain an S/PPy/MWNT ternary composite. High resolution transmission
   electronic microscopy shows the formation of a highly developed
   core-shell tubular structure consisting of PPy/MWNT composite with
   uniform sulfur coating on its surface. Polypyrrole, with its high
   adhesion ability to MWNT, acts as a binder to connect sulfur and MWNTs,
   as well as absorbs polysulfides into its porous structure to improve the
   cyclability of the S/PPy/MWNT composite in Li/S batteries. The MWNT core
   provides a highly conductive and mechanically flexible framework,
   enhancing the electronic conductivity and consequently the rate
   capability of the material. This ternary composite cathode sustains
   960.7 mAh g(-1) reversible specific discharge capacity after 40 cycles

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{110-128}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A new method is developed for analysis of flexible foundations (beams)
   on spatially random elastic soil. The elastic soil underneath the beams
   is treated as a continuum, characterized by spatially random Young's
   modulus and constant Poisson's ratio. The randomness of the soil Young's
   modulus is modeled using a two-dimensional non-Gaussian, homogeneous
   random field. The beam geometry and Young's modulus are assumed to be
   deterministic. The total potential energy of the beam-soil system is
   minimized, and the governing differential equations and boundary
   conditions describing the equilibrium configuration of the system are
   obtained using the variational principles of mechanics. The differential
   equations are solved using the finite element and finite difference
   methods to obtain the beam and soil displacements. Four different beam
   lengths, representing moderately short, moderately long and long beams
   are analyzed for beam deflection, differential settlement, bending
   moment and beam shear force. The statistics of the beam responses are
   investigated using Monte Carlo simulations for different beam-soil
   modulus ratios and for different variances and scales of fluctuations of
   the soil Young's modulus. Suggestions regarding the use of the analysis
   in design are made. A novelty in the analysis is that the
   two-dimensional random heterogeneity of soil is taken into account
   without the use of traditional two-dimensional numerical methods, which
   makes the new approach computationally efficient. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{On the Optimal Compressions in the Compress-and-Forward Relay Schemes}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2613-2628}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the classical compress-and-forward relay scheme developed by Cover
   and El Gamal, the decoding process operates in a successive way: the
   destination first decodes the compression of the relay's observation and
   then decodes the original message of the source. Recently, several
   modified compress-and-forward relay schemes were proposed, where the
   destination jointly decodes the compression and the message, instead of
   successively. Such a modification on the decoding process was motivated
   by realizing that it is generally easier to decode the compression
   jointly with the original message, and more importantly, the original
   message can be decoded even without completely decoding the compression.
   Thus, joint decoding provides more freedom in choosing the compression
   at the relay. However, the question remains in these modified
   compress-and-forward relay schemes-whether this freedom of selecting the
   compression necessarily improves the achievable rate of the original
   message. It has been shown by El Gamal and Kim in 2010 that the answer
   is negative in the single-relay case. In this paper, it is further
   demonstrated that in the case of multiple relays, there is no
   improvement on the achievable rate by joint decoding either. More
   interestingly, it is discovered that any compressions not supporting
   successive decoding will actually lead to strictly lower achievable
   rates for the original message. Therefore, to maximize the achievable
   rate for the original message, the compressions should always be chosen
   to support successive decoding. Furthermore, it is shown that any
   compressions not completely decodable even with joint decoding will not
   provide any contribution to the decoding of the original message. The
   above phenomenon is also shown to exist under the repetitive encoding
   framework recently proposed by Lim et al., which improved the achievable
   rate in the case of multiple relays. Here, another interesting discovery
   is that the improvement is not a result of repetitive encoding, but the
   benefit of delayed decoding after all the blocks have been finished. The
   same rate is shown to be achievable with the simpler classical encoding
   process of Cover and El Gamal with a block-by-block backward decoding
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a scenario where a source node wishes to
   broadcast two confidential messages for two respective receivers via a
   Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. An
   eavesdropper also receives the transmitted signal via another MIMO
   channel. We first consider the discrete memoryless channel and obtain
   the capacity region of the degraded channel. The secret dirty paper
   coding (SDPC) region as an achievable rate region for the general
   discrete channel is introduced. Relying on the results for the discrete
   channel, we fully characterize the secrecy capacity region of MIMO
   broadcast channel. It is shown that the SDPC scheme is optimal. The
   converse part of the proof relies on the generalized Costa's entropy
   power inequality and a new channel enhancement strategy in which we only
   need to enhance the channels of the legitimate receivers, and the
   channel of the eavesdropper remains unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive encoding and decoding based on binary low-density
   parity-check codes with syndrome accumulation (SA-LDPC-IED) is proposed
   and investigated. Assume that the source alphabet is GF(2) and the side
   information alphabet is finite. It is first demonstrated how to convert
   any classical universal lossless code C-n (with block length n and side
   information available to both the encoder and decoder) into a universal
   SA-LDPC-IED scheme. It is then shown that with n the word error
   probability approaching 0 subexponentially with, the compression rate
   (including both the forward and backward rates) of the resulting
   SA-LDPC-IED scheme is upper bounded by a functional of that of C-n,
   which in turn approaches the compression rate of C-n for each and every
   individual sequence pair (x(n), y(n)) and the conditional entropy rate
   (H (X vertical bar Y)for any stationary, ergodic source and side
   information (X, Y) as the average variable node degree (l) over bar of
   the underlying LDPC code increases without bound. When applied to the
   class of binary source and side information (X, Y) correlated through a
   binary symmetrical channel with crossover probability unknown to both
   the encoder and decoder, the resulting SA-LDPC-IED scheme can be further
   simplified, yielding even improved rate performance versus the bit error
   probability when (l) over bar is not large. Simulation results (coupled
   with linear time belief propagation decoding) on binary source-side
   information pairs confirm the theoretic analysis and further show that
   the SA-LDPC-IED scheme consistently outperforms the Slepian-Wolf coding
   scheme based on the same underlying LDPC code. As a by-product,
   probability bounds involving LDPC established in the course are also
   interesting on their own and expected to have implications on the
   performance of LDPC for channel coding as well.}},

Abstract = {{In this part II of the study, three new trigeneration systems are
   examined. These systems are SOFC-trigeneration, biomass-trigeneration,
   and solar-trigeneration systems. This study reveals that the maximum
   trigeneration-exergy efficiencies are about 38\% for the
   SOFC-trigeneration system, 28\% for the biomass-trigeneration system and
   18\% for the solar-trigeneration system. Moreover, the maximum cost per
   exergy unit for the SOFC-trigeneration system is approximately 38 \$/GJ,
   for the biomass-trigeneration system is 26 \$/GJ, and for the
   solar-trigeneration system is 24 \$/GJ. This study reveals that the
   solar-trigeneration system offers the best thermoeconomic performance
   among the three systems. This is because the solar-trigeneration system
   has the lowest cost per exergy unit. Furthermore, the
   solar-trigeneration system has zero CO2 emissions and it is based on a
   free renewable energy source. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Two common anionic surfactants, sodium oleate (SO) and sodium dodecyl
   benzene sulfonate (SDBS) were used to re-suspend iron oxide
   nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. At certain SO concentrations, the SO
   formulations produced highly stable suspensions. In contrast,
   SDBS-stabilized nanoparticles exhibited poor stability at all
   concentrations. The adsorption isotherm of SO on iron oxide
   nanoparticles revealed that stable suspensions were obtained when the
   equilibrium SO concentration (after adsorption) reached its critical
   micelle concentration (CMC). At this ``optimal{''} condition, the
   maximum SO adsorption was reached, and the zeta-potential of the
   particles was highly negative (similar to -50 mV). According to the SO
   isotherm, this optimal formulation coincided with the formation of a
   highly compact SO bilayer. The SDBS isotherm, on the other hand,
   revealed that SDBS is not strongly adsorbed on the surface of iron oxide
   nanoparticles and that is likely that a patchy, loosely packed bilayer,
   is formed on the surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles when the
   equilibrium SDBS concentration reaches its CMC. The DLVO theory
   confirmed the connection between formulation conditions and the
   corresponding stability. This works confirmed that the formation of a
   surfactant bilayer is an important element in producing stable
   nanoparticle suspensions with anionic surfactants. It was also confirmed
   that for anionic surfactants, electrostatic repulsions are an important
   factor in establishing an energy barrier against flocculation. This work
   also introduced two more elements into the design of nanoparticle
   suspensions. The first element is that, in order to ensure the best
   possible dispersion, the surfactant concentration in solution at
   equilibrium with the adsorbed surfactant should be close or slightly
   above its CMC. The second element is that the molecular structure of the
   surfactant should facilitate the formation of closely packed bilayers.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogenation of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) is an important research
   topic in the field of chemical modification of unsaturated polymers.
   This review provides an overview of the fundamental data, challenges,
   and recent advances in the research area of homogeneous hydrogenation of
   NBR. Besides NBR and its hydrogenation product HNBR, some other
   important elastomers such as styrene butadiene rubber (SBR),
   polybutadiene rubber (BR), polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-polystyrene
   (SBS block copolymer), and natural rubber (NR) were also involved for
   the related hydrogenation reactions and characterization. A brief
   comparison of hydrogenation catalysts including the heterogeneous and
   homogeneous catalysts was first conducted and the importance of rhodium
   (Rh) complex catalysts for homogeneous hydrogenation of elastomers was
   addressed. This article continued to discuss the reaction pathways for
   realization of the homogeneous hydrogenation of NBR. This was followed
   by an examination of the microstructures and characterization techniques
   of NBR and HNBR. After that the recovery/recycle of precious metal
   catalysts from the reaction substrate, which have been drawing much
   attention from industrial manufacturers, was reviewed and highlighted in
   this article. The applications of HNBR were then summarized. In the end,
   future research directions were suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a tool to evaluate the
   potential implications of pathogens in a water supply or other media and
   is of increasing interest to regulators. In the case of potentially
   pathogenic protozoa (e.g. Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts), it
   is well known that the methods used to enumerate (oo)cysts in samples of
   water and other media can have low and highly variable analytical
   recovery. In these applications, QMRA has evolved from ignoring
   analytical recovery to addressing it in point-estimates of risk, and
   then to addressing variation of analytical recovery in Monte Carlo risk
   assessments. Often, variation of analytical recovery is addressed in
   exposure assessment by dividing concentration values that were obtained
   without consideration of analytical recovery by random beta-distributed
   recovery values. A simple mathematical proof is provided to demonstrate
   that this conventional approach to address non-constant analytical
   recovery in drinking water QMRA will lead to overestimation of mean
   pathogen concentrations. The bias, which can exceed an order of
   magnitude, is greatest when low analytical recovery values are common. A
   simulated dataset is analyzed using a diverse set of approaches to
   obtain distributions representing temporal variation in the oocyst
   concentration, and mean annual risk is then computed from each
   concentration distribution using a simple risk model. This illustrative
   example demonstrates that the bias associated with mishandling
   non-constant analytical recovery and non-detect samples can cause
   drinking water systems to be erroneously classified as surpassing risk
   thresholds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir characterization involves describing different reservoir
   properties quantitatively using various techniques in spatial
   variability. Nevertheless, the entire reservoir cannot be examined
   directly and there still exist uncertainties associated with the nature
   of geological data. Such uncertainties can lead to errors in the
   estimation of the ultimate recoverable oil. To cope with uncertainties,
   intelligent mathematical techniques to predict the spatial distribution
   of reservoir properties appear as strong tools. The goal here is to
   construct a reservoir model with lower uncertainties and realistic
   assumptions. Permeability is a petrophysical property that relates the
   amount of fluids in place and their potential for displacement. This
   fundamental property is a key factor in selecting proper enhanced oil
   recovery schemes and reservoir management. In this paper, a soft sensor
   on the basis of a feed-forward artificial neural network was implemented
   to forecast permeability of a reservoir. Then, optimization of the
   neural network-based soft sensor was performed using a hybrid genetic
   algorithm and particle swarm optimization method. The proposed genetic
   method was used for initial weighting of the parameters in the neural
   network. The developed methodology was examined using real field data.
   Results from the hybrid method-based soft sensor were compared with the
   results obtained from the conventional artificial neural network. A good
   agreement between the results was observed, which demonstrates the
   usefulness of the developed hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm
   optimization in prediction of reservoir permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The human body has many biomechanical degrees of freedom, and thus,
   multiple movement strategies can be employed to execute a given task.
   Joint loading patterns and risk of injury are highly sensitive to the
   movement strategy employed. This paper develops a computational
   framework to automatically identify and recognize different movement
   strategies to perform a task from human motion data. A divisive
   clustering approach is developed to identify movement strategies. Hidden
   Markov models (HMMs) are trained with the clustered observation
   sequences to generate strategy-specific models that are improved
   iteratively by using the maximum likelihood to relocate sequences to the
   most suitable cluster. Differences in individual joint trajectories are
   compared across strategies using a stochastic distance measure. The
   proposed algorithm is compared against three existing algorithms-joint
   contribution vector, decision tree, and HMM-based agglomerative
   clustering. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
   performs better than existing algorithms to detect motion strategies and
   automatically determine the differences between the strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a weather generator that produces new values of
   precipitation to generate realistic weather sequences. The model has
   been applied to a network of 14 meteorological stations around the Upper
   Thames River Basin (UTRB), Ontario, Canada. We developed a simple model
   that employs the k-nearest neighbor resampling approach with gamma
   kernel perturbation. This gamma kernel perturbation enables the
   production of new values rather than merely reshuffling the historical
   data to generate realistic weather sequences. Daily precipitation was
   simulated at all the locations in and around the considered basin. The
   comparison of simulated data to the observed data led to the conclusion
   that the proposed perturbation algorithm performs quite well at
   preserving the monthly and annual historical statistics. The improved
   model was shown to produce precipitation amounts different from those
   observed in the past record. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000615.

Abstract = {{In distributed systems, resource prediction is an important but
   difficult topic. In many cases, multiple prediction is needed rather
   than only performing prediction at a single future point in time.
   However, traditional approaches are not sufficient for multi-step-ahead
   prediction. We introduce a pattern fusion model to predict
   multi-step-ahead CPU loads. In this model, similar patterns are first
   extracted from the historical data via calculating Euclidean distance
   and fluctuation pattern distance between historical patterns and current
   sequence. For a given pattern length, multiple similar patterns of this
   length can often be found and each of them can produce a prediction. We
   also propose a pattern weight strategy to merge these prediction.
   Finally, a machine learning algorithm is used to combine the prediction
   results obtained from different length pattern sets dynamically.
   Empirical results on four real-world production servers show that this
   approach achieves higher accuracy on average than existing approaches
   for multi-step-ahead prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Reducing the dimensionality of the data has been a challenging task in
   data mining and machine learning applications. In these applications,
   the existence of irrelevant and redundant features negatively affects
   the efficiency and effectiveness of different learning algorithms.
   Feature selection is one of the dimension reduction techniques, which
   has been used to allow a better understanding of data and improve the
   performance of other learning tasks. Although the selection of relevant
   features has been extensively studied in supervised learning, feature
   selection in the absence of class labels is still a challenging task.
   This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised feature selection,
   which efficiently selects features in a greedy manner. The paper first
   defines an effective criterion for unsupervised feature selection that
   measures the reconstruction error of the data matrix based on the
   selected subset of features. The paper then presents a novel algorithm
   for greedily minimizing the reconstruction error based on the features
   selected so far. The greedy algorithm is based on an efficient recursive
   formula for calculating the reconstruction error. Experiments on real
   data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
   comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised feature
   selection.}},

Volume = {{91}},

Pages = {{862-869}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new approach to model discrimination is presented that
   takes advantage of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. It combines
   an experimental criterion first proposed by Roth (Roth, Design of
   Experiments for Discrimination Among rival Models, PhD, Thesis,
   Princeton University, New Jersey, USA, 1965) with an adaptation of a
   model selection method described by Chib and Jeliazkov {[}Chib and
   Jeliazkov, Stat. Neerl. 59, 3044 (2005)], which uses an
   AcceptanceRejection MetropolisHastings algorithm to evaluate the model
   marginal likelihood thus enabling the calculation of model posterior
   probabilities. It does so without requiring any linearisation of
   nonlinear models. In designing model discrimination experiments using
   the Roth criterion, MCMC methods are again used to find the mean of the
   predicted values by integrating over the entire parameter probability
   density function. The method is illustrated using the well-known
   chemical reaction kinetics example first discussed by Box and Hill
   {[}Box and Hill, Technometrics 9, 5771 (1967)]. The results indicate
   that the method is very successful in identifying the correct model.
   Higher error levels and more complex kinetics require on average more
   model discrimination experiments. (c) 2012 Canadian Society for Chemical

Abstract = {{We report a lateral amorphous-selenium (a-Se) metal-semiconductor-metal
   photodetector with a blocking contact. The blocking contact, a polyimide
   layer, is shown to significantly reduce the dark current even at high
   applied biases that result in high photo-to-dark-current ratios, thus
   leading to wide dynamic range and high signal-to-noise ratio. The use of
   the polyimide blocking contact prevents the injection of both holes and
   electrons and improves considerably upon the dark current of previously
   reported lateral a-Se detectors. The presence of charge trapping at the
   polyimide/a-Se interface is found to be negligible through the use of
   pulsed light experiments. The effects of electrode spacing and electrode
   width on device performance are investigated through experiment and
   simulation for device optimization. From the devices that are
   fabricated, it is found that the dark current is strongly dependent on
   the comb fingers density while the same trend is not observed for the
   photocurrent. It is found that the device with 10-mu m electrode spacing
   and 10-mu m electrode width has the best performance in terms of photo
   and dark current. This paper demonstrates the promise of low-cost
   lateral a-Se devices for use in indirect conversion large area digital
   medical X-ray imaging applications, such as chest radiography, real-time
   fluoroscopy, and cone beam computed tomography.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of tool geometry on material flow during friction stir
   welding of dissimilar aluminium alloys is investigated. Sheets of Al
   2024 and Al 6061 alloys are friction stir welded in lap and butt
   configurations using different welding conditions. Optical microscopy
   with serial sectioning is utilised to systematically study material flow
   when small variations are made to the tool pin. It is shown that three
   flat features on the pin impose vertical material flow which can promote
   intermixing. When a threaded tool is used, the material flow and
   formation of the intermixed region depends on the orientation of the
   base materials, since the differences in viscosity of material on the
   advancing versus retreating side of the tool will inhibit intermixing.
   Decreasing the travel speed will promote intermixing by increasing the
   residence time to compensate for the differences in material viscosity
   that otherwise limit intermixing.}},

Abstract = {{Multicopy routing strategies have been considered the most applicable
   approaches to achieve message delivery in Delay Tolerant Networks
   (DTNs). Epidemic routing and two-hop forwarding routing are two
   well-reported approaches for delay tolerant networks routing which allow
   multiple message replicas to be launched in order to increase message
   delivery ratio and/or reduce message delivery delay. This advantage,
   nonetheless, is at the expense of additional buffer space and bandwidth
   overhead. Thus, to achieve efficient utilization of network resources,
   it is important to come up with an effective message scheduling strategy
   to determine which messages should be forwarded and which should be
   dropped in case of buffer is full. This paper investigates a new message
   scheduling framework for epidemic and two-hop forwarding routing in
   DTNs, such that the forwarding/dropping decision can be made at a node
   during each contact for either optimal message delivery ratio or message
   delivery delay. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed
   message scheduling framework can achieve better performance than its
   counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic hydrogenation of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) latex
   was achieved by using in situ synthesized RhCl(PPh3)(3) catalyst.
   Water-soluble rhodium salt (RhCl3) was used as the catalyst precursor
   which was reacted in situ with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) to form
   RhCl(PPh3)(3). Compared with using solid RhCl(PPh3)(3), hydrogenation of
   NBR latex using the in situ RhCl(PPh3)(3) showed a faster hydrogenation
   reaction. Based on the retention of catalyst in the polymer, it was
   revealed that the efficiency of in situ synthesis and the diffusion of
   the catalyst from the aqueous phase into the polymer particles were
   crucial in achieving the required high degree of hydrogenation. As a
   result, it was discovered that by introducing a small amount of alcohol
   (e.g. RhCl3 = 0.52 mmol/L, PPh3 = 18 mmol/L, ethanol/total NBR latex =
   1/10 volume ratio) to the feed latex, the in situ synthesized catalyst
   could be used in the hydrogenation reaction very efficiently. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We measured the lattice and subband electronic temperatures of terahertz
   quantum cascade devices based on the optical phonon-scattering assisted
   active region scheme. While the electronic temperature of the injector
   state (j = 4) significantly increases by Delta T = T-e(4) - T-L similar
   to 40 K, in analogy with the reported values in resonant phonon scheme
   (Delta T similar to 70-110 K), both the laser levels (j = 2,3) remain
   much colder with respect to the latter (by a factor of 3-5) and share
   the same electronic temperature of the ground level (j = 1). The
   electronic population ratio n(2)/n(1) shows that the optical phonon
   scattering efficiently depopulates the lower laser level (j = 2) up to
   an electronic temperature T-e similar to 180 K. (C) 2013 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Thermochemical properties and microstructures of the composite of Al
   nanoparticles and NiO nanowires were characterized. The nanowires were
   synthesized using a hydrothermal method and were mixed with these

   composites showed dispersed NiO nanowires decorated with Al
   nanoparticles. Thermal analysis suggests the influence of NiO mass ratio
   was insignificant with regard to the onset temperature of the observed
   thermite reaction, although energy release values changed dramatically
   with varying NiO ratios. Reaction products from the fuel-rich composites
   were found to include elemental Al and Ni, Al2O3, and AlNi. The
   production of the AlNi phase, confirmed by an ab initio molecular
   dynamics simulation, was associated with the formation of some metallic
   liquid spheres from the thermite reaction.}},

Abstract = {{We present a phase-field crystal model for structural transformations in

   correlation kernel developed in Greenwood et al. for describing
   structural transformations in pure materials {[}Greenwood, Provatas, and

   two-point correlation function for multicomponent alloys that uses the
   local species concentrations to interpolate between different crystal
   structures. A simplified version of the model is derived for the
   particular case of three-component (ternary) alloys, and its equilibrium
   properties are demonstrated. Dynamical equations of motion for the
   density and multiple species concentration fields are derived, and the
   robustness of the model is illustrated with examples of complex
   microstructure evolution in dendritic and eutectic solidification and
   solid-state precipitation. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.87.134105}},

Abstract = {{Polymers offer many advantageous physical properties as structural
   materials for MEMS and microfluidics. Additionally, polymers support
   rapid and inexpensive fabrication methods. Patterning metals on polymer
   microstructures is, however, much more challenging than doing so on
   conventional substrates such as silicon or glass. As a result, metal
   layers within polymeric devices are typically fabricated on
   non-polymeric substrates, and the polymer layers are then fabricated on
   top, which greatly constrains the variety of structures that can be
   built. A wider range of devices could be fabricated if there was a
   reliable method for producing and patterning stable metal films on a
   photo-polymer. Lab-on-chip (LOC) systems in particular would benefit
   from low-cost, corrosion-resistant, thermally stable metal films
   embedded in polymer structures. To date, however, there have been no
   demonstrations that combine all of these characteristics. We present
   here a method for patterning a film of aluminum on the photopolymer KMPR
   and treating the film to stabilize its resistivity. We demonstrate the
   production and stability of the films and demonstrate that they are
   suitable for use as heaters and/or temperature sensors at temperatures
   up to 165 degrees C - well beyond the required temperatures for mainstay
   LOC functions such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Coupled sensitivity of optical fiber sensors to structural strain and
   temperature has been a long lasting problem for reliable measurements in
   environments where both parameters are varying. This problem has been a
   driving force for the employment of methods to compensate the effect of
   one parameter. In this paper, a packaged dual-parameter optical fiber
   Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for the simultaneous measurement of
   structural strain and temperature using a single FBG is presented. The
   sensor consists of FBGs with on-fiber silver thin films synthesized by a
   laser direct write method. The new sensor design, fabrication,
   packaging, and calibration are addressed. A customized test rig and a
   sensor calibration package are designed and built. The performance of
   the sensor for the concurrent measurement of strain and temperature is
   investigated by analyzing the experimental data, and the characteristic
   curves for the calibration of the sensor are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrothermal technique to simultaneously remove a SiO2 template and
   crystallize a TiO2 outer layer was used to create magnetically
   separable, hollow rattle-type nanoparticles consisting of a magnetic
   Fe3O4 core contained within a hollow TiO2 shell. Fe3O4 cores
   approximately 240 nm in diameter were synthesized, subsequently coated
   by SiO2 and finally coated with TiO2. This was followed by a
   hydrothermal treatment to selectively etch the silica, resulting in
   rattle-type particles with a final outer shell diameter of approximately
   390 nm. The product of hydrothermal treatment were rattle-type particles
   with increased crystallinity and a 68\% increase in surface area.
   Characterization confirmed the ability to etch a hard SiO2 template
   through use of a simple and benign thermal treatment with pure water,
   while simultaneously introducing a crystalline phase into the TiO2
   active layer. The potential of the particles to be employed as a
   catalyst in UV induced advanced water treatment for removal of organic
   contaminants was evaluated through a colorimetric photocatalytic
   degradation assay using methylene blue as a model contaminant. The
   ability of the particles to be magnetically separated from solution
   after treatment and recycled for consecutive treatment cycles was then
   demonstrated. This technique for selectively removing a hard SiO2
   template while simultaneously crystallizing a TiO2 shell avoids the use
   of hazardous chemical etchants or complex processing, rendering the
   synthesis of hierarchical, multimaterial, hollow, porous rattle-type
   particles a simple, attractive, and environmentally friendly
   ``one-pot{''} technique for potential industrial application.}},

Title = {{Development of an electrotransformation protocol for genetic
   manipulation of Clostridium pasteurianum}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reducing the production cost of, and increasing revenues
   from, industrial biofuels will greatly facilitate their proliferation
   and co-integration with fossil fuels. The cost of feedstock is the
   largest cost in most fermentation bioprocesses and therefore represents
   an important target for cost reduction. Meanwhile, the biorefinery
   concept advocates revenue growth through complete utilization of
   by-products generated during biofuel production. Taken together, the
   production of biofuels from low-cost crude glycerol, available in
   oversupply as a by-product of bioethanol production, in the form of thin
   stillage, and biodiesel production, embodies a remarkable opportunity to
   advance affordable biofuel development. However, few bacterial species
   possess the natural capacity to convert glycerol as a sole source of
   carbon and energy into value-added bioproducts. Of particular interest
   is the anaerobe Clostridium pasteurianum, the only microorganism known
   to convert glycerol alone directly into butanol, which currently holds
   immense promise as a high-energy biofuel and bulk chemical.
   Unfortunately, genetic and metabolic engineering of C. pasteurianum has
   been fundamentally impeded due to lack of an efficient method for
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transfer.
   Results: This work reports the development of an electrotransformation
   protocol permitting high-level DNA transfer to C. pasteurianum ATCC 6013
   together with accompanying selection markers and vector components. The
   CpaAI restriction-modification system was found to be a major barrier to
   DNA delivery into C. pasteurianum which we overcame by in vivo
   methylation of the recognition site (5'-CGCG-3') using the M. FnuDII
   methyltransferase. With proper selection of the replication origin and
   antibiotic-resistance marker, we initially electroporated methylated DNA
   into C. pasteurianum at a low efficiency of 2.4 x 10(1) transformants mu
   g(-1) DNA by utilizing conditions common to other clostridial
   electroporations. Systematic investigation of various parameters
   involved in the cell growth, washing and pulse delivery, and outgrowth
   phases of the electrotransformation procedure significantly elevated the
   electrotransformation efficiency, up to 7.5 x 10(4) transformants mu
   g(-1) DNA, an increase of approximately three order of magnitude. Key
   factors affecting the electrotransformation efficiency include
   cell-wall-weakening using glycine, ethanol-mediated membrane
   solubilization, field strength of the electric pulse, and sucrose
   osmoprotection.
   Conclusions: C. pasteurianum ATCC 6013 can be electrotransformed at a
   high efficiency using appropriately methylated plasmid DNA. The
   electrotransformation method and tools reported here should promote
   extensive genetic manipulation and metabolic engineering of this
   biotechnologically important bacterium.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a new methodology for the simultaneous process
   flowsheet and control design of dynamic systems under uncertainty using
   a model predictive control (MPC) strategy. Although several
   methodologies that include structural decisions in the analysis have
   been reported, only a few have considered a model-based control strategy
   such as MPC. An iterative decomposition framework that includes a
   dynamic flexibility analysis, a robust dynamic feasibility test, a
   nominal stability analysis, and a robust asymptotic stability test is
   presented for optimal process flowsheet selection. While previous
   methodologies have formulated the dynamic feasibility and stability
   analysis as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, the
   present method formulates these analyses as convex problems for which
   efficient numerical algorithms exist. The simultaneous process flowsheet
   and MPC design method was tested on a system of Continuous Stirred Tank
   Reactors (CSTRs) with multiple inlet streams. The results show that the
   optimal design obtained by the present method remained feasible and
   asymptotically stable in the presence of the critical realizations in
   the disturbances. Comparisons between the designs obtained by the
   present MPC-based method and those obtained with other design
   approaches, i.e., optimal steady-state design and simultaneous design
   and control using a multiloop proportional and integral (PI) control
   scheme, are presented and discussed in this work.}},

Abstract = {{A volumetric contact dynamics model has been proposed for the purpose of
   generating reliable and rapid simulations of contact dynamics. Forces
   and moments between bodies in contact can be expressed in terms of the
   volume of interference between the undeformed geometries. This allows
   for the modeling of contact between complex geometries and relatively
   large contact surfaces, while being computationally less expensive than
   finite element methods. However, the volumetric model requires
   experimental validation. Models for simple geometries in contact have
   been developed for stationary and dynamic contact, and an apparatus has
   been developed to experimentally validate these models. This paper
   focuses on validation of the normal contact models. Measurements of
   forces and displacements will be used to identify the parameters related
   to the normal force, i.e., the volumetric stiffness and hysteretic
   damping factor for metallic surfaces. The experimental measurements are
   compared with simulated results to assess the validity of the volumetric
   model.}},

   investments in solar PV generation. In a previous work, the authors
   presented an investor-oriented planning model for optimum selection of
   solar PV investment decisions. In this paper, a method for determining
   the sensitivity indices, based on the application of duality theory on
   the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, pertaining to the
   solar PV investment model is presented. The sensitivity of the
   investors' profit to various parameters, for a case study in Ontario,
   Canada are presented and discussed and these are found to be very close
   to those obtained using the Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference
   (individual parameter perturbation) based approaches. Furthermore, a
   novel relationship is proposed between the sensitivity indices and the
   investor's profit for a given confidence level to evaluate the risk for
   an investor in solar PV projects.}},

Title = {{Earlier springs decrease peak summer productivity in North American
   boreal forests}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the northern high latitudes, alternative hypotheses with regards to
   how warming-related shifts in seasonality influence ecosystem
   productivity exist. Increased plant growth associated with a longer
   growing season may enhance ecosystem productivity, but shifts to earlier
   springs may also negatively influence soil moisture status and
   productivity during the peak of the growing season. Here, we analyzed
   nearly three decades (1982-2008) of observational records and derived
   products, including satellite microwave and optical imagery as well as
   upscaled ecosystem flux observations, to better understand how shifts in
   seasonality impact hydrology and productivity in the North American
   boreal forests. We identified a dominant adverse influence of earlier
   springs on peak summer forest greenness, actual evapotranspiration and
   productivity at interannual time scales across the drier western and
   central sections of the North American boreal forests. In the vast
   regions where this spring onset mechanism operates, ecosystem
   productivity gains from earlier springs during the early portion of the
   growing season are effectively cancelled through corresponding losses in
   the later portion. Our results also indicate that recent decadal shifts
   towards earlier springs and associated drying in the midst of the
   growing season over western North American boreal forests may have
   contributed to the reported declines in summer productivity and
   increases in tree mortality and fire activity. With projections of
   accelerated northern high-latitude warming and associated shifts to
   earlier springs, persistent soil moisture deficits in peak summer may be
   an effective mechanism for regional-scale boreal forest dieback through
   their strong influence on productivity, tree mortality and disturbance
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The wireless networks lack a physical boundary due to the broadcasting
   nature of wireless transmissions. The security has become a critical
   concern in the physical layer of wireless networks. Physical-layer
   security techniques are effective in resolving the boundary, efficiency
   and link reliability issues, but they can not be able to guarantee
   security with probability 1. In this work, we present a cross-layer
   security scheme for STBC system. By introducing a distort signal set the
   sender randomly flip-flops between the distort signal set and the
   orthogonal code set to confuse the attacker. The physical-layer security
   is enhanced as a result. In the proposed scheme the physical-layer may
   rely on upper-layer encryption techniques for security, which results in
   a cross-layer security scheme. Our approach can guarantee enhanced
   security with probability 1 in the wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we formalize a general Frequency Domain Packet Scheduling
   (FDPS) problem for 3GPP LTE Downlink (DL). The DL FDPS problem
   incorporates the Single-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (SU-MIMO)
   technique, and can express various scheduling policies, including the
   Proportional-Fair metric, the MaxWeight scheduling, etc. For LTE DL
   SU-MIMO, the constraint of selecting only one MIMO mode (transmit
   diversity or spatial multiplexing) per user in each transmission time
   interval (TTI) increases the hardness of the FDPS problem. We prove the
   problem is MAX SNP-hard, which implies approximation algorithms with
   constant approximation ratios are the best we can expect. Subsequently,
   we propose an approximation algorithm of polynomial runtime. The
   solution is based on a greedy method for maximizing a non-decreasing
   submodular function over a matroid. The algorithm can solve the general
   DL FDPS problem with an approximation ratio of 4. We implement the
   proposed algorithm and compare its performance with other well-known
   schedulers.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle transport to the opening of the single nanopore created on
   the cell membrane during the electroporation is studied. First, the
   permeabilization of a single cell located in a microchannel is
   investigated. When the nanopores are created, the transport of the
   nanoparticles from the surrounding liquid to the opening of one of the
   created nanopores is examined. It was found that the negatively charged
   nanoparticles preferably move into the nanopores from the side of the
   cell membrane that faces the negative electrode. Opposite to the
   electro-osmotic flow effect, the electrophoretic force tends to draw the
   negatively charged nanoparticles into the opening of the nanopores. The
   effect of the Brownian force is negligible in comparison with the
   electro-osmosis and the electrophoresis. Smaller nanoparticles with
   stronger surface charge transport more easily to the opening of the
   nanopores. Positively charged nanoparticles preferably enter the
   nanopores from the side of the cell membrane that faces the positive
   electrode. On this side, both the electrophoretic and the
   electro-osmotic forces are in the same directions and contribute to
   bring the positively charged particles into the nanopores.}},

Abstract = {{A number of recent source coding techniques compress the source signal
   into multiple layers such that a destination is able to reconstruct the
   original signal (with some distortion) even if it has not received all
   the layers. Implementation of such source coding techniques in wireless
   networks requires the application of coding mechanisms (such as
   multilayer coding) which allow unequal error protection for different
   layers of the transmitted data. In this paper, we study the performance
   of multilayer coding for quasi-static fading channels where the source
   and the destination are equipped with multiple antennas and the
   Channel-State-Information (CSI) is only known at the destination. We
   limit the study to the scenarios where the destination is only able to
   perform successive-decoding (joint-decoding is not possible) and the
   objective is to find the design of a multilayer code which maximizes the
   average data rate received at the destination. To this end, we first
   propose a design rule for constructing a proper multilayer code for
   Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) networks. Furthermore, the paper
   presents a procedure which uses the proposed design rule to determine
   the parameters of the multilayer code. The performance of the designed
   multilayer coding scheme is then studied for different network setups.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental techniques for investigating the piano hammer-string
   interaction are described. It is argued that the accuracy, consistency,
   and scope of conclusions of previous studies can be compromised by
   limitations of the conventional methods relating to key inputs; physical
   distortion; numerical distortion, particularly when differentiation or
   integration of measured signals is used to derive primary response
   variables; contact identification; and synchronization issues. These
   problems are discussed, and experimental methods that have been devised
   to avoid them are described and illustrated by detailed results from a
   study of the hammer-string interaction in a vertical piano. High
   resolution displacements are obtained directly by non-contact high-speed
   imaging and quantitative motion tracking. The attention focused on
   achieving very accurate and consistent temporal and spatial alignment,
   including the objective procedure used for contact identification,
   allows meaningful comparisons of responses from separate tests. String
   motion at the strike point and on each side of it, as well as hammer
   motion, is obtained for eight dynamic levels from 1.06 to 2.98 m/s
   impact velocity. Detailed observations of the force-compression behavior
   of the hammer interacting with real strings are presented. The direct
   effects of hammer shank deflection and agraffe string pulses on the
   interaction are also highlighted. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of

Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{156-170}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ductile tearing process in low carbon steel brazed joints with copper
   filler metal is studied using the Cohesive Zone Model. The Cohesive Zone
   Model is characterized by two parameters related to the cohesive
   strength and cohesive energy. A new method is developed to estimate the
   Cohesive Zone Model parameters through direct experimental measurements
   and numerical modeling. The cohesive energy of the brazed joints is
   obtained from the fracture test results performed on the single-edge
   notched bend specimens. Based on the obtained cohesive energy parameter,
   the fracture test is simulated using a cohesive zone finite element
   model. A unique value for the joint cohesive strength is determined by
   best fitting the finite element results to the experimental load-crack
   mouth opening displacement curves. The merit of the characterized
   Cohesive Zone Model is explored by finite element modeling of the
   tensile test performed on the single-edge notched tension specimens. The
   load-crack mouth opening displacement curve obtained from the finite
   element modeling conforms to the corresponding tensile test results.
   Furthermore, the effect of the crack tip stress constraint on the
   plastic zone shape and size is successfully captured by the model. The
   good agreement between the finite element simulation results and the
   experimental data demonstrates the applicability of the Cohesive Zone
   Model for fracture analysis of the brazed joints. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Gas diffusion through porous media is critical for the high current
   density operation of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, where the
   electrochemical reaction becomes rate limited by the diffusive flux of
   reactants. Precise knowledge of the diffusivity through various
   components in a fuel cell is necessary for accurate modeling and
   analysis. However, many experimental measurements of diffusivity in
   literature have high measurement uncertainty. In this study, an
   improvement to the accuracy of the Loschmidt cell method is presented
   for measuring the diffusivity through materials with a submillimeter
   thickness. The diffusivity through various gas diffusion layers (GDLs)
   is measured, and the relative differences between GDLs are explained
   using scanning electron microscopy and the method of standard
   porosimetry. The experimental results from this study and others in
   current literature are used to develop a generalized correlation for the
   diffusibility as a function of porosity in the through-plane direction

Abstract = {{There is significant interest in the synthesis of discrete-state random
   fields, particularly those possessing structure over a wide range of
   scales. However, given a model on some finest, pixellated scale, it is
   computationally very difficult to synthesize both large- and small-scale
   structures, motivating research into hierarchical methods. In this
   paper, we propose a frozen-state approach to hierarchical modeling, in
   which simulated annealing is performed on each scale, constrained by the
   state estimates at the parent scale. This approach leads to significant
   advantages in both modeling flexibility and computational complexity. In
   particular, a complex structure can be realized with very simple, local,
   scale-dependent models, and by constraining the domain to be annealed at
   finer scales to only the uncertain portions of coarser scales; the
   approach leads to huge improvements in computational complexity. Results
   are shown for a synthesis problem in porous media.}},

Abstract = {{In a generic decision process, optimal stopping theory aims to achieve a
   good tradeoff between decision performance and time consumed, with the
   advantages of theoretical decision-making and predictable decision
   performance. In this paper, optimal stopping theory is employed to
   develop an effective hybrid model for the mode decision problem, which
   aims to theoretically achieve a good tradeoff between the two
   interrelated measurements in mode decision, as computational complexity
   reduction and rate-distortion degradation. The proposed hybrid model is
   implemented and examined with a multiview encoder. To support the model
   and further promote coding performance, the multiview coding mode
   characteristics, including predicted mode probability and estimated
   coding time, are jointly investigated with inter-view correlations.
   Exhaustive experimental results with a wide range of video resolutions

Abstract = {{This paper presents a pole-placement technique to achieve active
   vibration damping, as well as high bandwidth disturbance rejection and
   positioning, in ball screw drives. The pole-placement approach is simple
   and effective, with an intuitive physical interpretation, which makes
   the tuning process straightforward in comparison to existing controllers
   which actively compensate for structural vibrations. The tracking
   performance of the drive is improved through feedforward control using
   inverted plant dynamics and a novel trajectory prefilter. The prefilter
   is designed to remove tracking error artifacts correlated to the
   velocity, acceleration, jerk and snap (fourth derivative) of the
   commanded trajectory. By applying the least-squares method to the data
   from a single tracking experiment, the prefilter can be tuned quickly
   and reliably. The proposed controller has been compared to the P-PI
   position-velocity cascade controller commonly used in industry. The
   controller design, stability analysis and experimental results are
   discussed in the paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a frequency-agile Doherty amplifier capable of
   efficiently amplifying multiband wireless signals located at widely
   spaced frequencies. Starting with the study of the load modulation
   concept in the Doherty technique and the various frequency-dependent
   components involved in its realization, this paper suggests a simplified
   and effective design methodology for the development of frequency-agile
   and reconfigurable Doherty amplifiers using a small number of
   electronically tunable devices. As a proof of concept, a reconfigurable
   Doherty power amplifier (PA) prototype is designed and fabricated to
   operate at 1.9, 2.14, and 2.6 GHz. The measurement results obtained
   using a continuous-wave signal revealed drain efficiencies of
   approximately 70\% and 60\% at the peak power and 6 dB back-off power,
   respectively, for the three targeted operating frequencies. In addition,
   the reconfigurable Doherty amplifier was successfully linearized when
   driven with 20-MHz wavelength code-division multiple access and longterm
   evolution signals, using a Volterra-based digital predistrtion algorithm
   which exploits a pruned Volterra series.}},

Abstract = {{This paper expounds the systematic modeling of the behavior of radio

   depth. The knowledge of the RF PA is then exploited in limiting the
   number of kernels consequently addressing the complexity of the Volterra
   series which has been the key hindrance to its wider practical adoption.
   In the proposed Volterra series model, performance is assessed and
   compared to memory polynomial model and dynamic deviation reduction
   Volterra models when used to linearize different high-power amplifiers
   driven with wideband signals of bandwidth up to 40 MHz. Significant
   linearization performance is achieved using a reduced number of kernels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for evaluating alternative corrosion

   girder bridge in Wallis, Switzerland. Painted carbon steel and unpainted
   weathering steel girders are investigated. The investigated preservation
   interventions are the following: protection by painting, protection by
   metalizing, and replacement. Deterioration of the girders by corrosion
   is modeled probabilistically. Following the methodology demonstration,
   sensitivity studies are performed, wherein the corrosion environment,
   traffic volume, and detour length during interventions are varied. The
   effects of these variations on the various benefit types are then
   discussed and the conditions under which the various corrosion

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been an interest in fabrication of X-ray sensors
   based on bacteriorhodopsin, a proton pump protein in cell membrane of
   Halobacterium salinarium. Therefore, a better understanding of

   WinXCom program to calculate the mass attenuation coefficient of
   bacteriorhodopsin and its comprising amino acids for photon energies
   from 1 keV to 100 GeV. These amino acids include alanine, arginine,
   asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine,
   isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine,
   threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, Asx1, Asx2, Glx1 and Glx2. We
   then use that data to calculate effective atomic number and electron
   densities for the same range of energy. We also emphasize on two ranges
   of energies (10-200 keV and 1-20 MeV) in which X-ray imaging and

Abstract = {{The performance of high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell
   (HT-PEMFC) is significantly affected by the carbon monoxide (CO) in
   hydrogen fuel, and the flow channel design may influence the CO
   poisoning characteristics by changing the reactant flow. In this study,
   three-dimensional non-isothermal simulations are carried out to
   investigate the comprehensive flow channel design and CO poisoning
   effects on the performance of HT-PEMFCs. The numerical results show that
   when pure hydrogen is supplied, the interdigitated design produces the
   highest power output, the power output with serpentine design is higher
   than the two parallel designs, and the parallel-Z and parallel-U designs
   have similar power outputs. The performance degradation caused by CO
   poisoning is the least significant with parallel flow channel design,
   but the most significant with serpentine and interdigitated designs
   because the cross flow through the electrode is stronger. At low cell
   voltages (high current densities), the highest power outputs are with
   interdigitated and parallel flow channel designs at low and high CO
   fractions in the supplied hydrogen, respectively. The general
   distributions of absorbed hydrogen and CO coverage fractions in anode
   catalyst layer (CL) are similar for the different flow channel designs.
   The hydrogen coverage fraction is higher under the channel than under
   the land, and is also higher on the gas diffusion layer (GDL) side than
   on the membrane side; and the CO coverage distribution is opposite to
   the hydrogen coverage distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A power/ground plane pair is proposed using a novel planar
   electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure for isolating the

   the novel EBG is designed by etching slots in a ``C{''} shape on the
   power plane while maintaining the ground plane solid. Without cascading
   hybrid periodic structures, it shows an efficient mitigation of PGN
   within an ultra-wideband frequency range of 0.25-2.18 GHz. In this
   paper, the equivalent circuit model and cavity mode analysis for the
   novel EBG unit cell are given to quickly predict the lower and upper
   bound cutoff frequency, respectively. The dispersion diagram of the
   proposed EBG structure is validated by insertion loss measurements with
   ports at different locations of the unit cell for different modes. The
   result shows that there is a good consistency between the simulated and

Abstract = {{Recently, the development of medical instrumentation has advanced less
   invasive therapeutic operations. Micro device navigation through the
   human body, especially blood vessels, is an important part of minimally
   invasive techniques. Remote actuation is critical in order to manipulate
   the micro object inside the body. To achieve remote control within the
   cardiovascular system, magnetic propulsion offers an advantage over
   conventional actuation methods eliminating carry-on power supplies. A
   general magnetic propulsion system is composed of several electromagnets
   assembled with different orientations and positions. For remote
   actuation, the magnetic field produced plays an important role in
   initiating appropriate induction on micro devices. The effect of the
   electromagnets' arrangement is studied in this paper. Moreover, an
   optimization criterion is introduced here by which the performance of
   two effective but different structures is compared. Finally, the optimum
   structure, which improves actuator efficiency in micro scale
   applications, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of resilient in-network consensus in
   the presence of misbehaving nodes. Secure and fault-tolerant consensus
   algorithms typically assume knowledge of nonlocal information; however,
   this assumption is not suitable for large-scale dynamic networks. To
   remedy this, we focus on local strategies that provide resilience to
   faults and compromised nodes. We design a consensus protocol based on
   local information that is resilient to worst-case security breaches,
   assuming the compromised nodes have full knowledge of the network and
   the intentions of the other nodes. We provide necessary and sufficient
   conditions for the normal nodes to reach asymptotic consensus despite
   the influence of the misbehaving nodes under different threat
   assumptions. We show that traditional metrics such as connectivity are
   not adequate to characterize the behavior of such algorithms, and
   develop a novel graph-theoretic property referred to as network
   robustness. Network robustness formalizes the notion of redundancy of
   direct information exchange between subsets of nodes in the network, and
   is a fundamental property for analyzing the behavior of certain
   distributed algorithms that use only local information.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of stabilizing a linear system over a wireless
   network using a simple in-network computation method. Specifically, we
   study an architecture called the ``Wireless Control Network{''} (WCN),
   where each wireless node maintains a state, and periodically updates it
   as a linear combination of neighboring plant outputs and node states.
   This architecture has previously been shown to have low computational
   overhead and beneficial scheduling and compositionality properties. In
   this paper we characterize fundamental topological conditions to allow
   stabilization using such a scheme. To achieve this, we exploit the fact
   that the WCN scheme causes the network to act as a linear dynamical
   system, and analyze the coupling between the plant's dynamics and the
   dynamics of the network. We show that stabilizing control inputs can be
   computed in-network if the vertex connectivity of the network is larger
   than the geometric multiplicity of any unstable eigenvalue of the plant.
   This condition is analogous to the typical min-cut condition required in
   classical information dissemination problems. Furthermore, we specify
   equivalent topological conditions for stabilization over a wired (or
   point-to-point) network that employs network coding in a traditional way
   - as a communication mechanism between the plant's sensors and
   decentralized controllers at the actuators.}},

   This paper characterizes various decap implementations including
   MOS-based decaps, multilayer metal decaps, and metal-insulatormetal
   decaps using postlayout simulations in a 65-nm CMOS technology, and
   provides an outline for determining the most optimal selection and

Abstract = {{The emerging vehicular networks are targeted to provide efficient
   communications between mobile vehicles and fixed roadside units (RSU),
   and support mobile multimedia applications and safety services with
   diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we propose
   a busy tone based medium access control (MAC) protocol with enhanced QoS
   provisioning for life critical safety services. By using busy tone
   signals for efficient channel preemption in both contention period (CP)
   and contention free period (CFP), emergency users can access the
   wireless channel with strict priority when they compete with multimedia
   users, and thus achieve the minimal access delay. Furthermore, through
   efficient transmission coordination on the busy tone channel, contention
   level can be effectively reduced, and the overall network resource
   utilization can be improved accordingly. We then develop an analytical
   model to quantify the medium access delay of emergency messages.
   Extensive simulations with Network Simulator (NS)-2 validate the
   analysis and demonstrate that the proposed MAC can guarantee reliable
   and timely emergency message dissemination in a vehicular network.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of mobile IPv6 heterogeneous networks enhances
   networking performance; however, it also breaks mobile node's anonymity
   and location privacy. In this paper, we propose an anonymous and
   location privacy preserving (ALPP) scheme that consists of two
   complementary subschemes: anonymous home binding update and anonymous
   return routability. In addition, anonymous mutual authentication and key
   establishment schemes have been proposed to work in conjunction with
   ALPP to authenticate a mobile node to its foreign gateway and create a
   shared key between them. ALPP adds anonymity and location privacy
   services to mobile IPv6 signaling to achieve mobile senders and
   receivers' privacy. Unlike existing schemes, ALPP alleviates the
   trade-off between the networking performance and the achieved privacy
   level. Combining onion routing and anonymizer in ALPP scheme increases
   the achieved location privacy level where no entity in the network
   except the mobile node itself can identify this node's location. Using
   entropy model, we show that ALPP achieves higher degree of anonymity
   than the mix-based scheme. The anonymous home binding update and
   anonymous return routability subschemes require less computation
   overheads and thwart both internal and external adversaries. Simulation
   results demonstrate that our schemes have low control packets routing
   delays and are suitable for the seamless handover. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The present paper is focused on performing a thorough investigation of
   first order Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) including an inhomogeneous
   turbulent mixing model for the conditional scalar dissipation rate to
   predict autoignition. Autoignition of a hydrogen and nitrogen fuel
   mixture in a heated coflow of air is examined. A sensitivity analysis is
   proposed for the autoignition length with respect to the mixing field,
   as well as a comparison of the effects of the inhomogeneous turbulent
   and Amplitude Mapping Closure (AMC) mixing models. The choice of
   turbulence constants only change predicted ignition length by
   approximately 5 \% when applied to the AMC mixing model. Predictions of
   ignition length performed by the inhomogeneous model are lower than that
   of the AMC model by up to 15 \%. The current ignition predictions are in
   reasonable agreement with the experimental data and previous simulation
   results. Two of the four regimes observed experimentally are reproduced
   qualitatively. Further improvement may be gained by using large eddy
   simulation and a gradient model for the conditional velocity in the
   inhomogeneous turbulent mixing model.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and frequent construction progress tracking provides critical
   input data for project systems such as cost, schedule control, and
   billing. Unfortunately, conventional progress tracking is labor
   intensive, sometimes subject to negotiation, and often driven by arcane
   rules. Attempts to improve progress tracking have recently focused on
   automation, using technologies such as three-dimensional imaging, global
   positioning systems, ultra wide band (UWB) indoor locating, handheld
   computers, voice recognition, wireless networks, and other technologies
   in various combinations. However, one limit of these approaches is their
   focus on counting objects or milestones rather than value. In this
   paper, a four-dimensional model recognition-driven automated progress
   tracking system that transforms objects to their earned values is
   examined via the analysis of data from the construction of a steel
   reinforced concrete structure and a steel structure. It is concluded
   that automated, object oriented recognition systems that convert each
   object to its earned value can substantially improve the accuracy of
   progress tracking, and thus, better support project systems like
   billing. The contribution of this study is an argument based on
   scientific results for refocusing future research onto automated earned
   value tracking, which is ultimately what is needed in practice. DOI:

Abstract = {{Waste-activated sludge (WAS) samples that were generated over a range of
   solids residence times (SRTs) under controlled operating conditions were
   employed in bench-scale sonication tests to characterize the impact of
   physical pretreatment processes on WAS anaerobic digestion and to assess
   the applicability of indicators for characterizing WAS digestibility.
   Physical, chemical, and biochemical analyses were conducted on raw and
   pretreated WAS samples and the results were compared to those obtained
   in biochemical methane potential (BMP) and biochemical acid potential
   (BAP) tests. The solublization responses indicated that the materials
   that were solublized were affected by the WAS SRT and sonication level.
   Despite differences in solublization responses, BMP tests revealed that
   sonication only marginally increased the ultimate biodegradability of
   the sludges. NH4 responses from the BMP tests and volatile fatty acids
   (VFAs) responses from the BAP tests were found to be indicative of the
   impact of sonication on the rate of hydrolysis and
   acidification/ammonification. Both responses suggested an increase in
   the rate of hydrolysis, which is typically the rate-limiting process in
   WAS digestion. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000657. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Improving the reliability of micro-electronic devices depends in part on
   developing a more in-depth understanding of dislocations because
   dislocations are barriers to charge carriers. To this end, the
   quasi-static simulation of discrete dislocations dynamics in materials
   under mechanical and electrical loads is presented. The simulations are
   based on the extended finite element method, where dislocations are
   modelled as internal discontinuities. The strong and weak forms of the
   boundary value problem for the coupled system are presented. The
   computation of the Peach-Koehler force using the J-integral is
   discussed. Examples to illustrate the accuracy of the simulations are
   presented. The motion of the network of the dislocations under different
   electrical and mechanical loads is simulated. It was shown that even in
   weak piezoelectric materials the effect of the electric field on plastic
   behaviour is significant.}},

   polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) based nanopartides are the novel

   poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-5 mol\% 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV-S),
   poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-11 mol\% 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV-11) and
   poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-15 mol\% 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV-15) were used
   as a nanocarrier for encapsulation of Ellipticine (EPT). EPT is a model
   anticancer drug. Physicochemical characteristics such as particle size,
   its morphology and zeta potential of blank and EFT loaded PHBV-S,
   PHBV-11 and PHBV-15 nanoparticles were studied. In vitro cytotoxicity
   tests confirmed that the blank PHBV-S, PHBV-11 and PHBV-15 nanoparticles
   were demonstrating significant biocompatibility without affecting the
   survival of cancer cell line A549. The loading efficiency of EPT in PHBV
   nanoparticles was observed in the range of 39.32 to 45.65\%. The \%
   inhibition of cancer cell line A549 ranged from 64.28 to 67.77\% in
   comparison to EPT alone in which \% inhibition found to be <= 45.11\%.
   The IC50 value for each of three different formulations of EPT loaded
   PHBV nanoparticles ranged from 1.00 to 131 mu g/mL. The order of \%
   inhibition of cancer cell line A549 for drug loaded nanoparticles was
   EPT-PHBV-15>EPT-PHBV-S>EPT-PHBV-11. This system had demonstrated a great
   potential to increase the cytotoxic effect of EPT by increasing its
   bioavailability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   between the blank and the die. Peak HTCs obtained at the end of the

   temperatures, the time-dependent deformation of contact asperities is
   associated with a transient regime in which calculated HTCs are a
   function of the initial stamping temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic stability of precipitated phases at the steel-Ni-Mg
   alloy interface during laser brazing of Ni-plated steel to AZ31B
   magnesium sheet using AZ92 magnesium alloy filler wire has been
   evaluated using FactSage thermochemical software. Assuming local
   chemical equilibrium at the interface, the chemical
   activity-temperature-composition relationships of intermetallic
   compounds that might form in the steel-Ni interlayer-AZ92 magnesium
   alloy system in the temperature range of 873 K to 1373 K (600 A degrees
   C to 1100 A degrees C) were estimated using the Equilib module of
   FactSage. The results provided better understanding of the phases that
   might form at the interface of the dissimilar metal joints during the
   laser brazing process. The addition of a Ni interlayer between the steel
   and the Mg brazing alloy was predicted to result in the formation of the
   AlNi, Mg2Ni, and Al3Ni2 intermetallic compounds at the interface,
   depending on the local maximum temperature. This was confirmed
   experimentally by laser brazing of Ni electro-plated steel to AZ31B-H24
   magnesium alloy using AZ92 magnesium alloy filler wire. As predicted,
   the formation of just AlNi and Mg2Ni from a monotectic and eutectic

Abstract = {{FAST TCP is important for promoting data-intensive applications since it
   can cleverly react to both packet loss and delay for detecting network
   congestion. This paper provides a continuous time model and extensive
   stability analysis of FAST TCP congestion-control mechanism in
   bufferless Optical Burst Switched Networks (OBS). The paper first shows
   that random burst contentions are essential to stabilize the network,
   but cause throughput degradation in FAST TCP flows when a burst with all
   the packets from a single round is dropped. Second, it shows that FAST
   TCP is vulnerable to burst delay and fails to detect network congestion
   due to the little variation of round-trip time, thus unstable. Finally
   it shows that introducing extra delays by implementing burst
   retransmission stabilizes FAST TCP over OBS. The paper proves that FAST
   TCP is not stable over barebone OBS. However, it is locally,
   exponentially, and asymptotically stable over OBS with burst
   retransmission. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the survivable routing problem in WDM mesh
   networks where the objective is to minimize the total number of
   wavelengths used for establishing working and protection paths in the
   WDM networks. The past studies for survivable routing suffers from the
   scalability problem when the number of nodes/links or connection
   requests grows in the network. In this paper, a novel path-based shared
   protection framework, namely inter group shared protection (I-GSP), is
   proposed where the traffic matrix can be divided into multiple
   protection groups (PGs) based on specific grouping policy. Optimization
   is performed on these PGs such that sharing of protection wavelengths is
   considered not only inside a PG, but between the PGs. Simulation results
   show that I-GSP based integer linear programming model, namely, ILP-II
   solves the networks in a reasonable amount of time for which a regular
   integer linear programming formulation, namely, ILP-I becomes
   computationally intractable. For most of the cases the gap between the
   optimal solution and the ILP-II stays within 6\%. The proposed ILP-II
   model yields a scalable solution for the capacity planning in the
   survivable optical networks based on the proposed I-GSP protection
   architecture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A solid-state membrane of a polymer/ionic liquid miscible mixture,
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF6) doped with lithium perchlorate (LiClO4),
   was prepared and characterized. Miscibility, segmental dynamics, glass
   transition and ionic conductivity were investigated. Based on the
   results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), the system is fully miscible and of
   single phase. Broadening of the glass transition was observed when
   increasing the amount of ionic liquid, which can be attributed to
   mobility and flexibility differences between the polymer and ionic
   liquid. A large dynamical asymmetry and intrinsic mobility difference
   allow segmental and structural motion/relaxation over a wider
   temperature range by increasing the amount of ionic liquid. Saturation
   recovery spinlattice relaxation time (T1) versus temperature obtained
   from 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed high mobility of
   lithium ions, which was almost temperature independent. Lithium ion
   conductivity significantly increases with increasing ionic liquid
   amount. It is concluded that lithium ion mobility and its conduction is
   positively correlated to segmental dynamics of ion carriers in this
   model system, which is more noticeable in mixtures with higher amounts
   of the ionic liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Technology adoption is not a new venue for research. Much work of
   decision modeling, diffusion of new technology and statistical analysis
   of survey data has been done. Some studies focus on finding the optimal
   forms of technology to adopt within a complementarity framework, but
   there is no mention of finding an optimal path from a firm's current
   state to its optimal state. This represents a significant gap in the
   literature. The paper applies a constrained shortest path problem to
   training and technology adoption decisions by firms. Given the current
   set of training and technology adoption the method solves for what
   technology/practice should be adopted or removed from the complete set
   of combinations and in what order so as to maximize performance subject
   to budget constraints. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   application of the constrained shortest path problem to technology
   adoption decisions.
   A modified version of the Lagrangian relaxation with enumeration method
   is developed and tested using randomly generated constrained shortest
   path problems and compared to current leading algorithms. The modified
   Lagrangian relaxation method was shown to outperform some leading
   methods for the constructed test problems. We used workplace and
   employee level data from a linked employer-employee survey (1999-2004).
   We found that the best practices using profit are not the same as for
   labor productivity. We find that the path for labor productivity growth
   consistently includes computer adoption and on-the-job training. For
   profit growth, both classroom training and employer sponsored career
   development training are always present in the constrained shortest
   path. For static profit, adoption of computer-controlled/assisted
   technology is present throughout the constrained shortest path. (C) 2012

   1.5d-8d, at Reynolds numbers in the range of 160-220. The presence of
   Mode A instabilities were confirmed for cylinder spacings larger than
   4d, as well as the T3 modes at a cylinder spacing of 3d. It was found
   that the 3D structures resulting from the Mode A instabilities have
   significant effects on the Strouhal number and forces acting on the
   cylinders. However, for the Reynolds numbers studied, the forces acting
   on the upstream cylinder were less affected by the 3D instabilities than
   in the single cylinder case. It was also found that the T3 mode has a

   values as low as < 4\% over a broad wavelength range of 400 nm < lambda
   < 650 nm. These anti-reflective properties together with enhanced
   infrared absorption in the core-shell nanowire facilitates enhancement
   in external quantum efficiency using two different active shell
   materials: amorphous silicon and nanocrystalline silicon. As a result,
   the core-shell nanowire device exhibits a short-circuit current

Abstract = {{We experimentally investigated the effect of oscillator strength
   (radiative transition diagonality) on the performance of resonant
   phonon-based terahertz quantum cascade lasers that have been optimized
   using a simplified density matrix formalism. Our results show that the
   maximum lasing temperature (T-max) is roughly independent of laser
   transition diagonality within the lasing frequency range of the devices
   under test (3.2-3.7 THz) when cavity loss is kept low. Furthermore, the
   threshold current can be lowered by employing more diagonal transition
   designs, which can effectively suppress parasitic leakage caused by
   intermediate resonance between the injection and the downstream
   extraction levels. Nevertheless, the current carrying capacity through
   the designed lasing channel in more diagonal designs may sacrifice even
   more, leading to electrical instability and, potentially, complete
   inhibition of the device's lasing operation. We propose a hypothesis
   based on electric-field domain formation and competition/switching of
   different current-carrying channels to explain observed electrical
   instability in devices with lower oscillator strengths. The study
   indicates that not only should designers maximize T-max during device
   optimization but also they should always consider the risk of electrical
   instability in device operation. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The interactions between surfactants and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC)
   grafted with a 600 Da polypropylene glycol (M600) were investigated by
   isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (NMR). The M600-grafted NCC prepared by reacting
   carboxylated NCC with amine-terminated M600 via a peptide coupling
   reaction, which was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). Three types of surfactants with dodecyl alkyl
   chain and different head groups, namely cationic
   dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DoTAB), anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS), and nonionic poly (ethylene glycol) dodecyl ether (Brij 30) were
   studied. Strong electrostatic interaction was only observed between
   M600-grafted NCC and DoTAB, due to the binding of opposite charges.
   Hydrophobic interaction was displayed for the M600-grafted NCC/SDS
   system, and negligible interaction between M600-grafted NCC and Brij 30
   was observed. Physical mechanisms describing the interactions of

Abstract = {{TiO2 nanobelt membranes with hierarchical structure were successfully
   synthesized by sequentially autoclaving Ti at 190 degrees C for 3 d in
   the presence of 10 M NaOH and 10 M KOH solutions. Microstructural
   characterization revealed TiO2 nanoparticles joining together and on the
   surface of nanobelts. These hierarchical structures form a three
   dimensional porous membrane which significantly enhances both surface
   specific area and light absorption, resulting in improved chemical
   adsorption capacity and photocatalytic degradation efficiency relative
   to nanobelts with smooth surfaces using methylene blue as a model
   molecule. The adsorption of methylene blue to these structures follows a
   pseudo-second order kinetics chemisorption mechanism with rate-limited
   diffusion correlated to pore structure and size. The dominant reactive
   oxygen species are identified as hydroxyl radicals and valence band
   holes through the scavenging reaction. The synergistic enhancement of
   filtration through surface adsorption and photocatalytic degradation is
   also demonstrated in a prototype photocatalytic membrane reactor with UV
   excitation at 365 nm. The reuse of nanobelt membranes after annealing
   shows the excellent recovery of TiO2 catalyst. These studies may
   contribute to additional applications of hierarchical TiO2 nanobelt
   membranes, including those harnessing sunlight for water treatment. (C)

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1558-1569}},

Abstract = {{Phased anaerobic digestion is a promising technology and may be a
   potential source of bioenergy production. Anaerobic digesters are widely
   used for sewage sludge stabilization and thus a better understanding of
   the microbial process and kinetics may allow increased volatile solids
   reduction and methane production through robust process operation. In
   this study, we analyzed the impact of phase separation and operational
   conditions on the biokinetic characteristics and communities of bacteria
   associated with four phased anaerobic digestion systems. In addition to
   significant differences between bacterial communities associated with
   different digester operating temperatures, our results also revealed
   that bacterial communities in the phased anaerobic digestion systems
   differed between the 1st and 2nd phase digesters and we identified
   strong community composition correlations with several measured
   physicochemical parameters. The maximum specific growth rates of
   propionate oxidizing bacteria (POB) in the mesophilic and thermophilic
   1st phases were 11 and 23.7 mgCOD mgCOD(-1) d(-1), respectively, while
   those of the mesophilic and thermophilic 2nd-phase digesters were 6.7
   and 18.6 mgCOD mgCOD(-1) d(-1), respectively. Hence, the biokinetic
   characteristics of the FOB population were dependent on the digester
   loading. In addition, we observed that the temperature dependency factor
   (0) values were higher for the less heavily loaded digesters as compared
   to the values obtained for the 1st-phase digesters. Our results
   suggested the appropriate application of two sets of POB biokinetic that
   reflect the differing growth responses as a function of propionate
   concentration (and/or organic loading rates). Also, modeling
   acetogenesis in phased anaerobic sludge digestion systems will be
   improved considering a population shift in separate phases. On the basis
   of the biokinetic values estimated in various digesters, high levels of
   propionate in the thermophilic digesters may be best explained by the
   establishment of FOB with low affinities (high K-s) for propionate.
   Achieving low levels of propionate with either thermophilic or short HRT
   digesters is challenging and a relatively long HRT mesophilic digester
   should be employed for this purpose. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An effective photolithographic process was investigated to fabricate

   undercut size was found critical for successful pattern fabrication.
   Effects of Ni thickness, temperature and H2O content on Ni pattern
   microstructure were evaluated. Ni/YSZ pattern anodes with 0.5 mu m thick
   Ni was tested in dry H-2 at 550 degrees C without significantly changing
   the TPB line. Ni/YSZ pattern anodes with Ni thickness of 0.8 mu m were
   tested at 550 degrees C under dry and humidified H-2 (3-50\% H2O)
   conditions without TPB line change. At 700 degrees C, and for 0.8 mu m
   thick patterns, the TPB length showed pronounced change in H-2 with
   10-50\% H2O. Significant increase in TPB length due to holes formation
   was observed at 800 degrees C with 3\% and 10\% H2O. Ni/YSZ pattern
   anodes with 1.0 mu m thick Ni was stable in H-2 with 3\% H2O in the
   range 550-800 degrees C, with TPB line only slightly modified. However,
   distinct change of TPB line and Ni microstructure was observed with
   10-70\% H2O above 700 degrees C. Stabilization of the polarization
   resistance depends on temperature. To accelerate stabilization of the
   cell, pre-treatment of the cell in H-2 with 3\% H2O at 750 degrees C or

Abstract = {{Lead is commonly used in medical radiology departments as a shielding
   material. Lead-based protective materials are also used by clinical
   personnel during X-ray image-guided interventional radiology (IVR)
   procedures. However, lead is extremely toxic and prolonged exposure to
   it can result in serious health concerns. Polymer composites, on the
   other hand, can be designed to be lead-free in addition to being
   lightweight, conformable, cost effective, and potentially capable of
   significantly attenuating X-rays. Nanomaterials have unique material
   properties that can be exploited to develop novel lead-free
   radiation-protection materials. In this study, polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) nanocomposites were fabricated using different weight percentages
   (wt \%) of bismuth oxide (BO) nanopowder. The attenuation properties of
   the nanocomposites were characterized using diagnostic X-ray energies
   from 40 to 150 kV tube potential and were compared to the attenuation
   characteristics of 0.25-mm-thick pure lead sheet. The PDMS/BO
   nanocomposite (44.44 wt\% of BO and 3.73-mm thick) was capable of
   attenuating all the scattered X-rays generated at a tube potential of 60
   kV, which is the beam energy commonly employed in IVR. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Exploiting the emulsification properties of low cost, environmentally
   safe Gum Arabic we demonstrate a high yield process to produce a few
   layer graphene with a low defect ratio, maintaining the pristine
   graphite structure. In addition, we demonstrate the need for and
   efficacy of an acid hydrolysis treatment to remove the polymer residues
   to produce 100\% pure graphene. The scalable process gives yield of up
   to 5 wt\% graphene based on 10 g starting graphite. The graphene product
   is compared with reduced graphene oxide produced through Hummer's method
   using UV-visible spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The two
   graphene materials show significant difference in these
   characterizations. Further, the film fabricated from this graphene
   exhibits 20 times higher electrical conductivity than that of the
   reduced graphene oxide. Sonication processing of graphite with
   environmentally approved biopolymers such as Gum Arabic opens up a
   scalable avenue for production of cheap graphene.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has raised the possibility of
   using engineered nanoparticles that interact within biological
   environments for treatment of diseases. Nanoparticles interacting with
   cells and the extracellular environment can trigger a sequence of
   biological effects. These effects largely depend on the dynamic
   physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, which determine the
   biocompatibility and efficacy of the intended outcomes. Understanding
   the mechanisms behind these different outcomes will allow prediction of
   the relationship between nanostructures and their interactions with the
   biological milieu. At present, almost no standard biocompatibility
   evaluation criteria have been established, in particular for
   nanoparticles used in drug delivery systems. Therefore, an appropriate
   safety guideline of nanoparticles on human health with assessable
   endpoints is needed. In this review, we discuss the data existing in the
   literature regarding biocompatibility of nanoparticles for drug delivery
   applications. We also review the various types of nanoparticles used in
   drug delivery systems while addressing new challenges and research
   directions. Presenting the aforementioned information will aid in
   getting one step closer to formulating compatibility criteria for
   biological systems under exposure to different nanoparticles. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Sub-micron scale nanocrystalline ruthenium columnar structures with
   average grain sizes of approximately 4 nm were fabricated by using
   electron beam lithography and electroplating techniques. Small scale
   ruthenium columns with several different cross-sectional geometries -
   solid core, keyhole, hollow, and x-shaped, were successfully
   manufactured. Uniaxial compressive plastic flow stress results of these
   ruthenium specimens revealed that they are not sensitive to the column
   diameters investigated, i.e. size independent. This suggests that the
   mechanical strength size dependence of nanocrystalline previously
   reported in literature may be suppressed or reduced if the grain size is
   significantly smaller than the external structure dimension. In
   addition, results indicated that the mechanical strengths of ruthenium
   nanocrystalline structures are not influenced by the cross-sectional
   geometry of the specimens. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   along with a high coulombic efficiency, while the liquid electrolyte

Abstract = {{The simplest chlorinated aromatic compound, chlorobenzene, was selected
   as a model organic pollutant to examine the photochemical destruction
   process in the gas phase, for potential application to flue gas
   treatment where oxygen, water, and sulfur dioxide may also be present.
   The degradation products under various reaction conditions were detected
   and found to include benzene, phenol, chlorophenol, chlorobiphenyls,
   HOCl, and HCl. The degradation pathways were elucidated based on the
   detected products and the literature. It was confirmed that
   dechlorination occurs before the aromatic ring is broken and that
   biphenyls can be formed. However, in the presence of added ozone, the
   formation of chlorobiphenyls was suppressed. The presence of sulfur
   dioxide resulted in attachment onto the aromatic ring, as confirmed by
   the S C bond in the FTIR spectrum, and the formation of a
   benzenesulfonic acid intermediate.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosized ethylenepropylene rubber (EPM) latex with a particle size of
   47 nm was synthesized via an alternative route consisting of isoprene
   (IP) polymerization followed by hydrogenation. First, the IP monomer was
   polymerized by differential microemulsion polymerization to obtain
   polyisoprene (PIP) rubber latex with a particle size of 42 nm. The
   structure of synthetic PIP was hydrogenated at the carboncarbon double
   bonds to produce an ethylenepropylene copolymer by diimide reduction in
   the presence of hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide using boric acid as
   promotor. The degree of hydrogenation was determined by proton nuclear
   magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy and the structure of the
   ethylenepropylene copolymer was identified by 13C-NMR spectroscopy. In
   nanosized PIP hydrogenation, the hydrogenation level was found to be
   increased by boric acid addition. An EPM yield of 94\% was achieved
   using a hydrogen peroxide : hydrazine ratio of 1.5 : 1. The EPM produced
   from PIP has high thermal stability with the maximum decomposition
   temperature of 510 degrees C and a glass transition temperature of -42.4
   degrees C close to commercial ethylenepropylene diene rubber. Dynamic
   mechanical analysis indicated that EPM had a maximum storage modulus due
   to the saturated carbons domains of the ethylene segments in the polymer
   chains. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 2013}},

Abstract = {{An Eulerian rate formulation of finite strain elastoplasticity is
   developed based on a fully integrable rate form of hyperelasticity
   proposed in Part I of this work. A flow rule is proposed in the Eulerian
   framework, based on the principle of maximum plastic dissipation in
   six-dimensional stress space for the case of J(2) isotropic plasticity.
   The proposed flow rule bypasses the need for additional evolution laws
   and/or simplifying assumptions for the skew-symmetric part of the
   plastic velocity gradient, known as the material plastic spin. Kinematic
   hardening is modeled with an evolution equation for the backstress
   tensor considering Prager's yielding-stationarity criterion. Nonlinear
   evolution equations for the backstress and flow stress are proposed for
   an extension of the model to mixed nonlinear hardening. Furthermore,
   exact deviatoric/volumetric decoupled forms for kinematic and kinetic
   variables are obtained. The proposed model is implemented with the
   Zaremba-Jaumann rate and is used to solve the problem of rectilinear
   shear for a perfectly plastic and for a linear kinematic hardening
   material. Neither solution produces oscillatory stress or backstress
   components. The model is then used to predict the nonlinear hardening
   behavior of SUS 304 stainless steel under fixed-end finite torsion.
   Results obtained are in good agreement with reported experimental data.
   The Swift effect under finite torsion is well predicted by the proposed
   model.}},

Abstract = {{An integrable Eulerian rate formulation of finite deformation elasticity
   is developed, which relates the Jaumann or other objective corotational
   rate of the Kirchhoff stress with material spin to the same rate of the
   left Cauchy-Green deformation measure through a deformation dependent
   constitutive tensor. The proposed constitutive relationship can be
   written in terms of the rate of deformation tensor in the form of a
   hypoelastic material model. Integrability conditions, under which the
   proposed formulation yields (a) a Cauchy elastic and (b) a Green elastic
   material model are derived for the isotropic case. These determine the
   deformation dependent instantaneous elasticity tensor of the material.
   In particular, when the Cauchy integrability criterion is applied to the
   stress-strain relationship of a hyperelastic material model, an Eulerian
   rate formulation of hyperelasticity is obtained. This formulation proves
   crucial for the Eulerian finite strain elastoplastic model developed in
   part II of this work. The proposed model is formulated and integrated in
   the fixed background and extends the notion of an integrable hypoelastic
   model to arbitrary corotational objective rates and coordinates.
   Integrability was previously shown for the grade-zero hypoelastic model
   with use of the logarithmic (D) rate, the spin of which is formulated in
   principal coordinates. Uniform deformation examples of rectilinear
   shear, closed path four-step loading, and cyclic elliptical loading are
   presented. Contrary to classical grade-zero hypoelasticity, no shear
   oscillation, elastic dissipation, or ratcheting under cyclic load is
   observed when the simple Zaremba-Jaumann rate of stress is employed.}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to provide the cumulative failure
   distribution (CDF) for degrading, uncertain, and dynamic systems. The
   uniqueness and novelty of the methodology is that long service time over
   which degradation occurs has been augmented with much shorter cycle time
   over which there is uncertainty in the system dynamics due to uncertain
   design variables. The significance of the proposed methodology is that
   it sets the foundation for setting realistic life-cycle management
   policies for dynamic systems. The methodology first replaces the
   implicit mechanistic model with a simple explicit meta-model with the
   help of design of experiments and singular value decomposition, then
   transforms the dynamic, time variant, probabilistic problem into a
   sequence of time invariant steady-state probability problems using
   cycle-time performance measures and discrete service time, and finally,
   builds the CDF as the summation of the incremental service-time failure
   probabilities over the planned life time. For multiple failure modes and
   multiple discrete service times, set theory establishes a sequence of
   true incremental failure regions. A practical implementation of the
   theory requires only two contiguous service-times. Probabilities may be
   evaluated by any convenient method, such as Monte Carlo and the
   first-order reliability method. Error analysis provides ways to control
   errors with regards to probability calculations and meta-model fitting.
   A case study of a common servo-control mechanism shows that the new
   methodology is sufficiently fast for design purposes and sufficiently
   accurate for engineering applications.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is
   not well understood. It is partly because previous studies have been
   unable to relate dynamic knee muscle forces during sports activities
   such as landing from a jump to the strain in the ACL. We present a
   combined in vivo/in vitro method to relate the muscle group forces to
   ACL strain during jump-landing using a newly developed dynamic knee
   simulator. A dynamic knee simulator system was designed and developed to
   study the sagittal plane biomechanics of the knee. The simulator is
   computer controlled and uses six powerful electromechanical actuators to
   move a cadaver knee in the sagittal plane and to apply dynamic muscle
   forces at the insertion sites of the quadriceps, hamstring, and
   gastrocnemius muscle groups and the net moment at the hip joint. In
   order to demonstrate the capability of the simulator to simulate dynamic
   sports activities on cadaver knees, motion capture of a live subject
   landing from a jump on a force plate was performed. The kinematics and
   ground reaction force data obtained from the motion capture were input
   into a computer based musculoskeletal lower extremity model. From the
   model, the force-time profile of each muscle group across the knee
   during the movement was extracted, along with the motion profiles of the
   hip and ankle joints. This data was then programmed into the dynamic
   knee simulator system. Jump-landing was simulated on a cadaver knee
   successfully. Resulting strain in the ACL was measured using a
   differential variable reluctance transducer (DVRT). Our results show
   that the simulator has the capability to accurately simulate the dynamic
   sagittal plane motion and the dynamic muscle forces during jump-landing.
   The simulator has high repeatability. The ACL strain values agreed with
   the values reported in the literature. This combined in vivo/in vitro
   approach using this dynamic knee simulator system can be effectively
   used to study the relationship between sagittal plane muscle forces and
   ACL strain during dynamic activities.}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of momentum is often used in controlling underactuated
   mechanical systems with symmetry. If a symmetry-breaking force is
   applied to the system, then the momentum is not conserved any longer in
   general. However, there exist forces linear in velocity such as the
   damping force that break the symmetry but induce a new conserved
   quantity in place of the original momentum map. This paper formalizes a
   new conserved quantity which can be constructed by combining the time
   integral of a general damping force and the original momentum map
   associated with the symmetry. From the perspective of stability
   theories, the new conserved quantity implies the corresponding variable
   possesses the self recovery phenomenon, i.e., it will be globally
   attractive to the initial condition of the variable. We discover that
   what is fundamental in the damping-induced self recovery is not the
   positivity of the damping coefficient but certain properties of the time
   integral of the damping force. The self recovery effect and theoretical
   findings are demonstrated by simulation results using the two-link
   planar manipulator and the torque-controlled inverted pendulum on a
   passive cart. The results in this paper will be useful in designing and
   controlling mechanical systems with underactuation.}},

Abstract = {{Smart sensing and wireless communication technologies enable the
   electric power grid system to deliver electricity more efficiently
   through the dynamic analysis of the electricity demand and supply. The
   current solution is to extend the traditional static electricity pricing
   strategy to a time-based one where peak-time prices are defined to
   influence electricity usage behavior of customers. However, the
   time-based pricing strategy is not truly dynamic and the electricity
   resource cannot be optimally utilized in real time. In this paper, we
   propose a usage-based dynamic pricing (UDP) scheme for smart grid in a
   community environment, which enables the electricity price to correspond
   to the electricity usage in real time. In the UDP scheme, to simplify
   price management and reduce communication overhead, we introduce
   distributed community gateways as proxies of the utility company to
   timely respond to the price enquiries from the community customers. We
   consider both community-wide electricity usage and individual
   electricity usage as factors into price management: a customer gets
   higher electricity unit price if its own electricity usage becomes
   larger under certain conditions of the community- wide collective
   electricity usage. Additionally, we protect the privacy of the customers
   by restricting the disclosure of the individual electricity usage to the
   community gateways. Lastly, we provide privacy and performance analysis
   to demonstrate that the UDP scheme supports real-time dynamic pricing in
   an efficient and privacy-preserving manner.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized inverter control is essential in distributed generation
   (DG) microgrids for low deployment/operation cost and high reliability.
   However, decentralized inverter control suffers from a limited system
   stability mainly because of the lack of communications among different
   inverters. In this paper, we investigate stability enhancement of the
   droop based decentralized inverter control in microgrids. Specifically,
   we propose a power sharing based control strategy which incorporates the
   information of the total real and reactive power generation of all DG
   units. The information is acquired by a wireless network (such as a
   WiFi, ZigBee, and/or cellular communication network) in a decentralized
   manner. Based on the desired power sharing of each DG unit and the
   acquired information of total generation, additional control terms are
   added to the traditional droop controller. We evaluate the performance
   of the proposed control strategy based on small-signal stability
   analysis. As timely communication may not be established for a microgrid
   with low-cost wireless communication devices, two kinds of analytical
   models are developed with respect to negligible and nonnegligible
   communication delays, respectively. Extensive numerical results are
   presented to demonstrate the system stability under the proposed control
   strategy with respect to different communication delays.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a computerised system for measuring muscle thicknesses of
   the transverse abdominus (TrA), internal oblique and external oblique
   muscles based on ultrasonography is presented. The system is designed to
   allow for quantitative analysis of changes in muscle recruitment and
   activity, which facilitates the study of such changes and its
   relationship with low back pain. The abdominal muscle area was localised
   and imaged under different standing conditions using B-mode
   ultrasonography. To account for issues such as misalignments due to
   probe and subject motion as well as speckle noise inherent to
   ultrasonography, automatic ensemble registration is performed on the
   acquired images using a sequential quadratic programming approach based
   on a novel log-Rayleigh likelihood function. Regions of interest are
   then automatically identified based on the medial border of the TrA for
   the purpose of quantitative muscle thickness measurements. Experimental
   results show that the proposed system achieves registration errors of
   under 0.4mm when compared with ground-truth measurements, as well as
   allow for the measurement of muscle thickness changes in the millimetre
   range. The proposed system is currently in operational use as an
   analysis tool for studying the relationship between abdominal muscle
   thickness changes and postural changes.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular communication networks, such as the 802.11p and Wireless
   Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) technologies, are becoming a
   fundamental platform for providing real-time access to safety and
   entertainment information. In particular, infotainment applications and,
   consequently, IP-based communications, are key to leverage market
   penetration and deployment costs of the 802.11p/WAVE network. However,
   the operation and performance of IP in 802.11p/WAVE are still unclear as
   the WAVE standard guidelines for being IP compliant are rather minimal.
   This paper studies the 802.11p/WAVE standard and its limitations for the
   support of infrastructure-based IP applications, and proposes the
   Vehicular IP in WAVE (VIP-WAVE) framework. VIP-WAVE defines the IP
   configuration for extended and non-extended IP services, and a mobility
   management scheme supported by Proxy Mobile IPv6 over WAVE. It also
   exploits multi-hop communications to improve the network performance
   along roads with different levels of infrastructure presence.
   Furthermore, an analytical model considering mobility, handoff delays,
   collisions, and channel conditions is developed for evaluating the
   performance of IP communications in WAVE. Extensive simulations are
   performed to demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical model and the
   effectiveness of VIP-WAVE in making feasible the deployment of IP
   applications in the vehicular network.}},

Abstract = {{Global Positioning System (GPS) localization has been attracting
   attention recently in various areas, including intelligent
   transportation systems (ITSs), navigation systems, road tolling, smart
   parking, and collision avoidance. Although, various approaches for
   improving localization accuracy have been reported in the literature,
   there is still a need for more efficient and more effective measures
   that can ascribe some level of accuracy to the localization process.
   These measures will enable localization systems to manage the
   localization process and resources to achieve the highest accuracy
   possible and to mitigate the impact of inadequate accuracy on the target
   application. The localization accuracy of any GPS system depends heavily
   on both the technique it uses to compute locations and the measurement
   conditions in its surroundings. However, while localization techniques
   have recently started to demonstrate significant improvement in
   localization performance, they continue to be severely impacted by the
   measurement conditions in their environment. Indeed, the impact of the
   measurement conditions on the localization accuracy in itself is an
   ill-conditioned problem due to the incongruent nature of the measurement
   process. This paper proposes a scheme to address localization accuracy
   estimation. This scheme involves two steps, namely, measurement
   condition disambiguation and enhanced location accuracy classification.
   Real-life comparative experiments are presented to demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed scheme in classifying GPS localization accuracy
   under various measurement conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) palm print has proved to be a significant
   biometrics for personal authentication. Three-dimensional palm prints
   are harder to counterfeit than 2-D palm prints and more robust to
   variations in illumination and serious scrabbling on the palm surface.
   Previous work on 3-D palm-print recognition has concentrated on local
   features such as texture and lines. In this paper, we propose three
   novel global features of 3-D palm prints which describe shape
   information and can be used for coarse matching and indexing to improve
   the efficiency of palm-print recognition, particularly in very large
   databases. The three proposed shape features are maximum depth of palm
   center, horizontal cross-sectional area of different levels, and radial
   line length from the centroid to the boundary of 3-D palm-print
   horizontal cross section of different levels. We treat these features as
   a column vector and use orthogonal linear discriminant analysis to
   reduce their dimensionality. We then adopt two schemes: 1) coarse-level
   matching and 2) ranking support vector machine to improve the efficiency
   of palm-print recognition. We conducted a series of 3-D palm-print
   recognition experiments using an established 3-D palm-print database,
   and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can greatly reduce
   penetration rates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we formulate a flow-based framework for the joint
   optimization of resource allocation, transmission coordination, and user

   incorporating these three important network processes together and by
   unifying the analysis of pico base stations and relay nodes, our
   framework can act as an important engineering tool for understanding the
   performance of different configurations. We use the resulting
   formulations to characterize the performance of different combinations
   of resource allocation schemes and transmission coordination mechanisms.
   We obtained important engineering insights regarding the interplay of
   these network processes. In particular, under the deployment of pico
   base stations, we find that partially shared deployment outperforms the
   co-channel deployment, with or without transmission coordination. In
   contrast, the results also show that the deployment of relay nodes does
   not offer meaningful throughput gains for any choice of resource

Title = {{An effective thermal conductance tuning mechanism for uncooled

Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{81-88}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing demand on infrared (IR) detectors for imaging harsh
   environment processes, widening the application range of uncooled
   microbolometer arrays has become an important research area. An
   efficient way of increasing this range is tuning the thermal conductance
   of the microbolometer array using electrostatic actuation, which is
   usually achieved by directly applying an actuation voltage to the
   substrate. However, this method does not allow pixel-by-pixel actuation,
   limiting the tunability. In this paper, we present a new method of
   actuation which uses the micromirror located below the microbolometer as
   the actuation terminal. We demonstrate that using micromirror actuation,
   the thermal conductance can be tuned by a factor of three. An analytical
   model to calculate the thermal conductance of this new type of
   microbolometer is presented. Results of the model are compared to finite
   element simulations and experimental measurements on a test structure
   fabricated for this purpose, showing good agreement. The new tuning
   mechanism provides a fairly linear thermal conductance tunability, thus
   making it a promising thermal conductance controlling mechanism for
   adaptive IR detectors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 can flow upward and leak through thief zones due to buoyancy effect
   during geological sequestration. To tackle this issue, the ex situ
   dissolution (ESD) concept was introduced aiming at full dissolution of
   CO2 at the surface, before it is injected into the ground, to increase
   the storage capacity and lower the risk of leakage. A mathematical model
   for CO2 droplets evolution in the ESD process is presented, followed by
   an experimental investigation to verify the proposed model. The
   developed model accounts for the droplet break-up process and transient
   mass transfer involved in the ESD. A number of mathematical correlations
   were developed to compute the average droplet size, break-up frequency,
   and droplet population in a turbulent dispersion regime. Experimental
   and mathematical results revealed that a minimum stable CO2 droplet is
   achievable within a pipeline length of less than 50 m if the CO2 volume
   fraction is in the range of 5-15\% and the brine flow rate varies
   between 0.25 and 2.0 Mt/yr. An acceptable agreement between the
   predicted and experimental droplet size distributions is observed. This
   study confirms that the ESD can reduce the leakage risk because of the
   formation of fine CO2 droplets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   changed the mode of failure under monotonic loading from splitting to
   pullout. The beams with the first stirrup spacing when tested under
   repeated loading failed by bond fatigue while the beams with the second
   stirrup spacing failed by flexure at the end of a debonded region that
   started from the support. The failure mechanism is discussed for each

Abstract = {{This paper reports a lab-on-a-chip device that can automatically detect
   and sort particles based on their size differences with a high
   resolution. The PDMS-glass microfluidic chip is made by soft-lithography
   technique. A differential resistive pulse sensor is employed to
   electrically detect the sizes of the particles in EOF generated by
   applying DC voltages across channels. The detected resistive pulse
   sensor signals, whose amplitudes are proportional to particles' sizes,
   will automatically trigger the sorting process that is controlled by
   applying a voltage pulse (36 V) whenever a target particle is detected.
   This method was applied to automatically detect and sort polystyrene
   particles and microalgae in aqueous solutions. Sorting 5 m polymer
   particle from a mixture of 4- and 5-m polystyrene particles in aqueous
   solution, i.e. 1 m sorting resolution, was demonstrated. The device
   described in this paper is simple, automatic, and label-free with high
   sorting resolution. It has wide applications in sample pretreatment and

Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{313-318}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged standing in an occupational setting has long been associated
   with the development of low back pain. In response to this, researchers
   have investigated various interventions that can alleviate low back pain
   and discomfort, such as anti-fatigue mats, shoe insoles, and more
   recently, sloped platforms. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the effects of a sloped surface on kinematics and trunk muscle thickness
   during quiet and prolonged occupational standing. Eleven participants
   performed 1-mm quiet standing tasks on three surfaces - level ground,
   incline, and decline - followed by 16-min of prolonged standing in each
   condition. Trunk, lumbar, and global pelvis angles were measured during
   each standing condition, and muscle thickness measurements of erector
   spinae and the lateral abdominal wall were taken during the quiet
   standing task. During quiet standing, there were systematic changes in
   trunk, lumbar, and pelvis angles with the different surfaces; however,
   these changes were not accompanied by systematic changes in muscle
   thickness. The responses found during the quiet standing were consistent
   during prolonged standing. As a result, the reduced perceived low back
   pain found when using sloped platforms is likely not the result of
   changes in morphology of the trunk musculature, but might be related to
   the altered kinematics caused by standing on these platforms. Crown

Abstract = {{The reliability concern associated with radiation-induced soft errors in
   embedded memories increases as semiconductor technology scales deep into
   the sub-40-nm regime. As the memory bit-cell area is reduced, single
   event upsets (SEUs) that would have once corrupted only a single
   bit-cell are now capable of upsetting multiple adjacent memory bit-cells
   per particle strike. While these error types are beyond the error
   handling capabilities of the commonly used single error correction
   double error detection (SEC-DED) error correction codes (ECCs) in
   embedded memories, the overhead associated with moving to more
   sophisticated double error correction (DEC) codes is considered to be
   too costly. To address this, designers have begun leveraging selective
   bit placement to design SEC-DED codes capable of double adjacent error
   correction (DAEC) or triple adjacent error detection (TAED). These codes
   can be implemented for the same check-bit overhead as the conventional
   SEC-DED codes; however, no codes have been developed that use both DAEC
   and TAED together. In this paper, a new ECC scheme is introduced that
   provides not only the basic SEC-DED coverage but also both DAEC and
   scalable adjacent error detection (xAED) with a reduction in
   miscorrection probability as well. Codes capable of up to 11-bit AED
   have been developed for both 16- and 32-bit standard memory word sizes,
   and a (39, 32) SEC-DED-DAEC-TAED code implementation that uses the same
   number of check-bits as a conventional 32-data-bit SEC-DED code is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{A system to resolve an intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) signal into
   its component motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) is presented. The
   system is intended mainly for clinical applications where several
   physiological parameters of motor units (MUs), such as their motor unit
   potential (MUP) templates and mean firing rates, are of interest. The
   system filters an EMG signal, detects MUPs, and clusters and classifies
   the detected MUPs into MUPTs. Clustering is partially based on the
   K-means algorithm, and the supervised classification is implemented
   using a certainty-based algorithm. Both clustering and supervised
   classification algorithms use MUP shape and MU firing pattern
   information along with signal dependent assignment criteria to obtain
   robust performance across a variety of EMG signals. During
   classification, the validity of extracted MUPTs are determined using
   several supervised classifiers; invalid trains are corrected and the
   assignment threshold for each train is adjusted based on the estimated
   validity (i.e., adaptive classification). Performance of the developed
   system in terms of accuracy (A(c)), assignment rate (A(r)), correct
   classification rate (CCr), and the error in estimating the number of
   MUPTs represented in the set of detected MUPs (E-NMUPTs) was evaluated
   using 32 simulated and 30 real EMG signals comprised of 3-11 and 3-15
   MUPTs, respectively. The developed system, with average CCr of 86.4\%
   for simulated and 96.4\% for real data, outperformed a previously
   developed EMG decomposition system, with average CCr of 71.6\% and
   89.7\% for simulated and real data, by 14.7\% and 6.7\%, respectively.
   In terms of, E-NMUPTs the new system, with average E-NMUPTs of 0.3 and
   0.2 for simulated and real data respectively, was better able to
   estimate the number of MUPTs represented in a set of detected MUPs than
   the previous system, with average E-NMUPTs of 2.2 and 0.8 for simulated
   and real data respectively. For both the simulated and real data used,
   variations in A(c), A(r), and E-NMUPTs for the newly developed system
   were lower than for the previous system, which demonstrates that the new
   system can successfully adjust the assignment criteria based on the
   characteristics of a given signal to achieve robust performance across a
   wide variety of EMG signals, which is of paramount importance for
   successfully promoting the clinical application of EMG signal
   decomposition techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Deterioration of reinforced concrete structures caused by corrosion of
   steel reinforcement is currently a major concern affecting the safety
   and functionality of our infrastructure. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   materials have shown tremendous potential as an alternative
   reinforcement for reinforced and prestressed concrete structures. FRPs
   have been used in a wide variety of structural applications, from
   reinforced concrete deck slabs to posttensioned parking garages.
   However, one promising application for FRP reinforcing bars which has
   yet to be investigated thoroughly is their use in reinforced concrete
   slab bridges. This paper presents the results of an experimental study
   on 10 full-scale glass FRP (GFRP)-reinforced slab bridge strips
   posttensioned with 0, 2, or 4 carbon FRP (CFRP) tendons with and without
   shear reinforcement. The tendons were either fully bonded or fully
   nonbonded to evaluate the effect of bond on the serviceability and
   ultimate performance of the slabs, particularly in terms of their
   deformability. Based on the test results, the addition of prestressed
   CFRP tendons resulted in significantly improved serviceability and
   ultimate load-carrying capacity with good deformability. DOI:

Abstract = {{The influence of periodic excitation from synthetic jet actuators on
   boundary-layer separation and reattachment over a NACA 0025 airfoil at a
   low Reynolds number is studied. Flow-visualization results showed a
   vertical jet pulse accompanied by two counter-rotating vortices being
   produced at the exit of the simulated slot, with the vortices shed at
   the excitation frequency. Hot-wire measurements determined the maximum
   jet velocity for a range of excitation frequencies and voltages, and
   were used to characterize the excitation amplitude in terms of the
   momentum coefficient C-mu. With the synthetic jet actuator installed in
   the airfoil, flow-visualization results showed that excitation produces
   boundary-layer reattachment, with the associated significant reduction
   in wake width. Wake-velocity measurements were performed to characterize
   the effect of flow-control excitation amplitude and frequency on airfoil
   drag and wake topology. The results demonstrate that C-mu is the primary
   governing flow-control parameter. Applying excitation above a specific
   C-mu threshold produced a 50\% reduction in drag, significantly
   affecting wake topology. However, power consumption of a piezoelectric
   synthetic jet actuator depends substantially on the excitation
   frequency. Hence, by varying excitation frequency, significant gains in
   efficiency are possible.}},

   under three main service disciplines, namely, shortest processing time

   and shortest remaining processing time, in comparison with the processor
   sharing (PS) service discipline. It is shown that the SPTNP is a better
   choice over the PS service discipline when the traffic load is high, and
   that the preemption reduces the mean response time when the data file
   size (service time requirement) follows a heavy tailed distribution. The
   response time analysis can be used for call admission control to ensure

Abstract = {{A novel model is presented to address the problem of semantic clustering
   of geo-objects in very high resolution panchromatic satellite images.
   The proposed model combines a probabilistic topic model with a
   multiscale image representation into an automatic framework by embedding
   both document and scale selections. The probabilistic topic model is
   used to characterize the statistical distributions of both intraclass
   appearance and inter-class coherence of geo-objects within documents,
   i.e., squared sub-images. Because the bag-of-words assumption involved
   in the probabilistic topic models does not consider the spatial
   coherence between topic labels, the multiscale image representation is
   designed to provide a self-adaptive spatial regularization for various
   geo-object categories. By introducing scale and document selections, the
   automatic framework integrates the probabilistic topic model and the
   multiscale image representation to ensure that words on a site should be
   allocated the same topic label no matter what documents they reside in.
   Consequently, unlike the traditional method of applying topic models for
   analyzing satellite images, the process of explicitly generating a set
   of documents before modeling and then combining multiple labels for a
   word on a given site is unnecessary. Gibbs sampling is adopted for
   parameter estimation and image clustering. Extensive experimental
   evaluations are designed to first analyze the effect of parameters in
   the proposed model and then compare the results of our model with those
   of some state-of-the-art methods for three different types of images.
   The results indicate that the proposed algorithm consistently
   outperforms these exiting state-of-the-art methods in all of the
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new statistical design method for maximizing the
   manufacturing yield of engineering systems for which the realizations of
   design parameters are assumed to be dependent random variables. Like in
   many practical situations, the method assumes that the joint
   distribution of design parameters is unicnown and their marginal
   distributions can be estimated but are not necessarily symmetrical. This
   is a difficult problem to which little research has been devoted, other
   than using some brute force search methods. We use a Frank copula to
   construct the joint distribution of correlated random variables.
   Kumaraswamy density function is used to approximate their marginal
   distributions because of its flexibility and simplicity. The proposed
   method is based on the approximation of the yield integral over the
   largest rectangular hypercube (n-box) that is contained in the feasible
   region. It tries to maximize the yield by relocating and resealing the
   box so that higher portion of the manufacturing yield is captured by
   this box. No integration is necessary since the yield of any given
   design is approximated by evaluating the cumulative distribution of the
   copula at the endpoints of the associated n-box. Finally, the actual
   yield of the optimal design is tested using Monte-Carlo simulation. This
   requires generating correlated random samples from the chosen copula
   distribution. One tutorial example and two practical design problems
   demonstrate the applications of the proposed method. Computational
   results show that the optimal designs significantly increase the
   manufacturing yield and this observation is verified using Monte-Carlo
   simulation. (C) 2012 The Franldin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fresh water consumption and wastewater management is a mandatory task to
   conserve water resources and to reduce wastewater discharge from
   chemical production processes. Such objectives have been addressed in
   many industrial sectors which consume large amounts of fresh water.
   Possibilities for reducing wastewater volumes by regeneration and
   recycling routes in the pulp and paper industry are analyzed. During
   pulp preparation and paper making processes by the Kraft pulping method
   a large amount of water is required to deliver the finished paper
   product. Reverse osmosis (RO) is applied for the analyses as an
   interception separation technology to reduce salt concentrations in
   wastewater streams for recycling purposes. The RO network synthesis
   problem is formulated as mixed integer nonlinear programming model which
   is solved using the general algebraic modeling system. A preliminary
   cost estimate indicates economic incentives by installation of RO units
   to avoid wastewater discharge and generate relatively clean water
   streams for inter-plant usage.}},

Abstract = {{A constant delay (CD) logic style is proposed in this paper, targeting
   at full-custom high-speed applications. The CD characteristic of this
   logic style regardless of the logic type makes it suitable in
   implementing complicated logic expressions such as addition. CD logic
   exhibits a unique characteristic where the output is pre-evaluated
   before the inputs from the preceding stage is ready. This feature offers
   performance advantage over static and dynamic domino logic styles in a
   single-cycle multistage circuit block. Several design considerations
   including timing window width adjustment and clock distribution are
   discussed. Using 65-nm general-purpose CMOS technology, the proposed
   logic demonstrates an average speedup of 94\% and 56\% over static and
   dynamic domino logic, respectively, in five different logic gates.
   Simulation results of 8-bit ripple carry adders show that CD logic is
   39\% and 23\% faster than the static and dynamic-based adders,
   respectively. CD logic also demonstrates 39\% speedup and 64\% (22\%)
   energy-delay product (EDP) reduction from static logic at 100\% (10\%)
   data activity in 32-bit carry lookahead adders. For 8-bit Wallace tree
   multiplier, CD logic achieves a similar speedup with at least 50\% EDP
   reduction across all data activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the impact of climate change, as projected by two
   Global Climate Models (GCMs) on the occurrence of extreme precipitation
   events in the Upper Thames River Basin in the Canadian province of
   Ontario. The modelling approach presented herein involves a two-stage
   process of generating daily weather data followed by disaggregation to
   an hourly time step of select variables for some events. Monthly change
   fields for three weather variables (maximum temperature, minimum
   temperature, and precipitation) were obtained from the output of two
   GCMs. The historical data set is modified by applying change fields to
   the weather variables simultaneously and then using this as the driving
   data set for an improved K-nearest neighbour weather-generating model.
   Weather sequences representative of climatic conditions in 2050 were
   simulated. Disaggregation of precipitation data is carried out using a
   new method that is a hybrid key site approach. A distinct practical
   advantage of the approach presented here is that extreme wet and dry
   spells are simulated, which is crucial for evaluation of effective flood
   and drought management policies for the basin.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The locations of the control hardware are typically a design variable in
   controller design for distributed parameter systems. In order to obtain
   the most efficient control system, the locations of control hardware as
   well as the feedback gain should be optimized. These optimization
   problems are generally non-convex. In addition, the models for these
   systems typically have a large number of degrees of freedom.
   Consequently, existing optimization schemes for optimal actuator
   placement may be inaccurate or computationally impractical. In this
   paper, the feedback control is chosen to be an optimal linear quadratic
   regulator. The optimal actuator location problem is reformulated as a
   convex optimization problem. A subgradient-based optimization scheme
   which leads to the global solution of the problem is used to optimize
   actuator locations. The optimization algorithm is applied to optimize
   the placement of piezoelectric actuators in vibration control of
   flexible structures. This method is compared with a genetic algorithm,
   and is observed to be faster and more accurate. Experiments are
   performed to verify the efficacy of optimal actuator placement.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of laser applications and the introduction of high
   efficiency lasers (e. g. fiber lasers), laser material processing has
   gained increasing importance in a variety of industries. Among the
   applications of laser technology, laser cladding has received
   significant attention due to its high potential for material processing
   such as metallic coating, high value component repair, prototyping, and
   even low-volume manufacturing. In this paper, two optimization methods
   have been applied to obtain optimal operating parameters of Laser Solid
   Freeform Fabrication Process (LSFF) as a real world engineering problem.
   First, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was implemented for
   real-time prediction of melt pool geometry. Then, a hybrid evolutionary
   algorithm called Self-organizing Pareto based Evolutionary Algorithm
   (SOPEA) was proposed to find the optimal process parameters. For further
   assurance on the performance of the proposed optimization technique, it
   was compared to some well-known vector optimization algorithms such as
   Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Strength Pareto
   Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA 2). Thereafter, it was applied for
   simultaneous optimization of clad height and melt pool depth in LSFF
   process. Since there is no exact mathematical model for the clad height
   (deposited layer thickness) and the melt pool depth, the authors
   developed two Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to estimate
   these two process parameters. Optimization procedure being done, the
   archived non-dominated solutions were surveyed to find the appropriate
   ranges of process parameters with acceptable dilutions. Finally, the
   selected optimal ranges were used to find a case with the minimum rapid
   prototyping time. The results indicate the acceptable potential of
   evolutionary strategies for controlling and optimization of LSFF process
   as a complicated engineering problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a set of n mobile wireless nodes, which have
   no information about each other. The only information a single node
   holds is its current location and future mobility plan. We develop a
   two-phase distributed self-stabilizing scheme for producing a bounded
   hop-diameter communication graph. In the first phase, nodes construct a
   temporary underlying topology and disseminate their current location and
   mobility plans. This is followed by a second phase, in which nodes
   construct the desired topology under two modes: static and dynamic. The
   static mode provides a fixed topology which does not change in spite of
   node movements; the dynamic mode allows the topology to change; however,
   the hop-diameter remains the same. We provide an O(lambda,
   lambda(2))-bicriteria approximation (in terms of total energy
   consumption and network lifetime, respectively) algorithm in the static
   mode: for an input parameter lambda, we construct a static h-bounded hop
   communication graph, where h = n/lambda + log lambda. In the dynamic
   mode, given a parameter h, we construct an optimal (in terms of network
   lifetime) h-bounded hop communication graph when every node moves with
   constant speed in a single direction along a straight line during each
   time interval. Our results are validated through extensive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue process consists, from the engineering point of view, of
   three stages: crack initiation, fatigue crack growth, and the final
   failure. It is also known that the fatigue process near notches and
   cracks is governed by local strains and stresses in the regions of
   maximum stress and strain concentrations. Therefore, the fatigue crack
   growth can be considered as a process of successive crack increments,
   and the fatigue crack initiation and subsequent growth can be modeled as
   one repetitive process. The assumptions mentioned above were used to
   derive a fatigue crack growth model based, called later as the UniGrow
   model, on the analysis of cyclic elastic-plastic stresses-strains near
   the crack tip. The fatigue crack growth rate was determined by
   simulating the cyclic stress-strain response in the material volume
   adjacent to the crack tip and calculating the accumulated fatigue damage
   in a manner similar to fatigue analysis of stationary notches. The
   fatigue crack growth driving force was derived on the basis of the
   stress and strain history at the crack tip and the Smith-Watson-Topper
   (SWT) fatigue damage parameter, D = sigma(max)Delta epsilon/2. It was
   subsequently found that the fatigue crack growth was controlled by a
   two-parameter driving force in the form of a weighted product of the
   stress intensity range and the maximum stress intensity factor, Delta K
   (p) K (max) (1-p) . The effect of the internal (residual) stress induced
   by the reversed cyclic plasticity has been accounted for and therefore
   the two-parameter driving force made it possible to predict the effect
   of the mean stress including the influence of the applied compressive
   stress, tensile overloads, and variable amplitude spectrum loading. It
   allows estimating the fatigue life under variable amplitude loading
   without using crack closure concepts. Several experimental fatigue crack
   growth datasets obtained for the Al 7075 aluminum alloy were used for
   the verification of the proposed unified fatigue crack growth model. The
   method can be also used to predict fatigue crack growth under constant
   amplitude and spectrum loading in various environmental conditions such
   as vacuum, air, and corrosive environment providing that appropriate
   limited constant amplitude fatigue crack growth data obtained in the
   same environment are available. The proposed methodology is equally
   suitable for fatigue analysis of smooth, notched, and cracked
   components.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we studied the copolymerization of ethylene and different
   alpha-olefins (propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene) using
   aluminohydride zirconocene systems supported on modified silica. The
   copolymerization reactions were carried out in hexanes, at different
   Al/Zr ratios, using two different comonomer concentrations. The effect
   of comonomer type on catalyst activity and polymer molecular weight and
   chemical composition distributions (MWD and CCD) was compared. Average
   comonomer incorporation was determined by C-13 NMR and the CCD by
   crystallization elution fractionation (CEF). Most of the
   copolymerizations showed very high catalytic activity (up to 4000 Kg
   PE/mol Zr), and the molecular weight was higher for the copolymers
   containing 1-octene, demonstrating that aluminohydride zirconocene
   systems can copolymerize ethylene and alpha-olefins effectively.}},

Abstract = {{With the pervasiveness of smart phones and the advance of wireless body
   sensor networks (BSNs), mobile Healthcare (m-Healthcare), which extends
   the operation of Healthcare provider into a pervasive environment for
   better health monitoring, has attracted considerable interest recently.
   However, the flourish of m-Healthcare still faces many challenges
   including information security and privacy preservation. In this paper,
   we propose a secure and privacy-preserving opportunistic computing
   framework, called SPOC, for m-Healthcare emergency. With SPOC, smart
   phone resources including computing power and energy can be
   opportunistically gathered to process the computing-intensive personal
   health information (PHI) during m-Healthcare emergency with minimal
   privacy disclosure. In specific, to leverage the PHI privacy disclosure
   and the high reliability of PHI process and transmission in m-Healthcare
   emergency, we introduce an efficient user-centric privacy access control
   in SPOC framework, which is based on an attribute-based access control
   and a new privacy-preserving scalar product computation (PPSPC)
   technique, and allows a medical user to decide who can participate in
   the opportunistic computing to assist in processing his overwhelming PHI
   data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed SPOC framework
   can efficiently achieve user-centric privacy access control in
   m-Healthcare emergency. In addition, performance evaluations via
   extensive simulations demonstrate the SPOC's effectiveness in term of
   providing high-reliable-PHI process and transmission while minimizing
   the privacy disclosure during m-Healthcare emergency.}},

Abstract = {{The structural application of lightweight magnesium alloys in the
   automotive industry inevitably involves dissimilar welding with steels
   and the related durability issues. This study was aimed at evaluating
   the microstructural change and fatigue resistance of Mg/steel resistance
   spot welds, in comparison with Mg/Mg welds. The microstructure of Mg/Mg
   spot welds can be divided into: base metal, heat affected zone and
   fusion zone (nugget). However, the microstructure of Mg/steel dissimilar
   spot welds had three different regions along the joined interface: weld
   brazing, solid-state joining and soldering. The horizontal and vertical
   Mg hardness profiles of Mg/steel and Mg/Mg welds were similar. Both
   Mg/steel and Mg/Mg welds were observed to have an equivalent fatigue
   resistance due to similar crack propagation characteristics and failure
   mode. Both Mg/steel and Mg/Mg welds failed through thickness in the
   magnesium sheet under stress-controlled cyclic loading, but fatigue
   crack initiation of the two types of welds was different. The crack
   initiation of Mg/Mg welds was occurred due to a combined effect of
   stress concentration, grain growth in the heat affected zone (HAZ), and
   the presence of Al-rich phases at HAZ grain boundaries, while the
   penetration of small amounts of Zn coating into the Mg base metal
   stemming from the liquid metal induced embrittlement led to crack
   initiation in the Mg/steel welds. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Photo-excitation of plasmons in nano-systems initially results in highly

   nanostructures is almost uniform because heat diffusion equilibrates the

   irradiation with femtosecond pulses enables visualization of the
   location of plasmonic heating because thermal effects such as
   plasmon-induced melting are frozen in at the initial location of energy
   deposition. Simulations show plasmonic heating is related to the
   orientation of the laser polarization and to the geometry of partially

Abstract = {{Vibration control plays a crucial role in many structures, especially in
   the lightweight ones. One of the most commonly practiced method to
   suppress the undesirable vibration of structures is to attach patches of
   the constrained layer damping (CLD) onto the surface of the structure.
   In order to consider the weight efficiency of a structure, the best
   shapes and locations of the CLD patches should be determined to achieve
   the optimum vibration suppression with minimum usage of the CLD patches.
   This paper proposes a novel topology optimization technique that can
   determine the best shape and location of the applied CLD patches,
   simultaneously. Passive vibration control is formulated in the context
   of the level set method, which is a numerical technique to track shapes
   and locations concurrently. The optimal damping set could be found in a
   structure, in its fundamental vibration mode, such that the maximum
   modal loss factor of the system is achieved. Two different plate
   structures will be considered and the damping patches will be optimally
   located on them. At the same time, the best shapes of the damping
   patches will be determined too. In one example, the numerical results
   will be compared with those obtained from the experimental tests to
   validate the accuracy of the proposed method. This comparison reveals
   the effectiveness of the level set approach in finding the optimum shape
   and location of the CLD patches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The destruction of a chlorinated aromatic compound by UV photolysis and
   advanced oxidation was examined for potential use in air emissions
   treatment. The fluence rate distribution in a photoreactor was analyzed
   by a finite model, and this was used to estimate quantum yield and
   photonic efficiency for the photochemical decomposition of chlorobenzene
   in air. The analysis indicates that the quantum yield was constant at
   approximately 115\%, but the presence of the common flue gas components
   sulfur dioxide and water could increase it to approximately 145\%.
   Ozone, which strongly absorbs UV photons and promotes radical chain
   reactions, enhanced the quantum yield to 1534\% when present at 2253
   ppm. When SO2 or ozone are present, ``effective{''} quantum yield may be
   more informative for analysis, since it includes the number of photons

   from 3.9\% to 108.7\%, with low values indicating that photons were
   wasted in processes that did not degrade the target organic. An analysis
   of photonic efficiency shows that the photo-reactor is more efficient at
   high concentrations of the target organic pollutant, and when ozone or
   sulfur dioxide are present. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transesterification of soybean oil was carried out over calcium oxide
   supported on Al2O3 as solid base catalysts. Solid base catalysts were
   synthesized by wet impregnation of CaO on acidic, basic and neutral
   Al2O3. Solid basic catalysts investigated in this study were
   characterized by BET surface area, XRD, FTIR, CO2-TPD and TG/DTA
   techniques. Formation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in this study
   was influenced by the nature of the catalyst prepared on different Al2O3
   supports. CaO supported on neutral-Al2O3 exhibited higher FAME yield and
   the activation energy was determined to be 30.7 kJ/mol. The formation of
   the calcium diglyceroxide (CDG), on the surface of CaO supported on
   neutral Al2O3 was established by C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The catalytic
   system (with CaO + COG) on neutral Al2O3 showed higher activity in the
   transesterification of soybean oil. Among the catalysts studied the
   conversion of soybean oil to FAME formation was as follows:
   CaO/neutral-Al2O3 > CaO/basic-Al2O3 > CaO/acidic-Al2O3. The presence of
   COG on neutral Al2O3 probably contributes to the higher activity. To our
   knowledge, this is the first report on identifying the formation of CDG
   on neutral Al2O3 during the production of biodiesel. (C) 2012 Published

Abstract = {{The microstructures, tensile and fatigue properties of weld-bonded (WB)
   AZ31B-H24 Mg/Mg joints with different sizes of bonding area were
   evaluated and compared with the adhesive-bonded (AB) Mg/Mg joints.
   Typical equiaxed dendritic structures containing divorced eutectic
   Mg17Al12 particles formed in the fusion zone of both WB-1 (with a
   bonding area of 35 mm x 35 mm) and WB-0.5 (with a bonding area of 17.5
   mm x 35 mm) joints. Less solidification shrinkage cracking was observed
   in the WB-0.5 joints than WB-1 joints. While the WB-0.5 joints exhibited
   a slightly lower maximum tensile shear stress than the AB-0.5 joints
   (with a bonding area of 17.5 mm x 35 mm), the energy absorption was
   equivalent. Although the AB-0.5 joints exhibited a higher fatigue
   resistance at higher cyclic stress levels, both the AB-0.5 and WB-0.5
   joints showed an equivalent fatigue resistance at lower cyclic stress
   levels. A higher fatigue limit was observed in the WB-0.5 joints than in
   the WB-1 joints owing to the presence of fewer shrinkage pores. Cohesive
   failure mode along the adhesive layer in conjunction with partial nugget
   pull-out from the weld was observed at the higher cyclic loads, and
   fatigue failure occurred in the base metal at the lower cyclic loads.

Abstract = {{Soy protein hydrolysates, produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of soy
   protein isolate (SPI) with pepsin and pancreatin, were subjected to
   sequential ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF). Heat treatment
   of SPI prior to enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated for its effect on
   ORAC and FCR antioxidant capacity of the fractions. The ORAC antioxidant
   capacity was significantly higher than the FCR antioxidant capacity for
   any given fraction. The UF permeate fractions (MW smaller than 10 kDa),
   containing approximately 50\% of the feed total solids, displayed higher
   ORAC antioxidant capacity compared to the corresponding feed and
   retentate fractions for soy protein hydrolysate produced from SPI with
   heating (H-SPH) and without heating (SPH). In contrast, the FCR
   antioxidant capacity of the UF fractions was affected by SPI heating.
   The UF permeate fraction had higher FCR antioxidant capacity when
   compared to the UF retentate for SPH produced from SPI with no heating.
   The NF permeate fractions produced at pH 8 with a 2.5 kDa MWCO thin film
   composite membrane displayed the highest ORAC antioxidant capacity, 5562
   mu mol TE g(-1) TS (SPH) and 5187 mu mol TE g(-1) TS (H-SPH). Due to the
   significant improvement of the ORAC antioxidant capacity with a loose NF
   membrane at pH 8, the potential for NF as a viable industrial
   fractionation process for soy protein hydrolysates with antioxidant
   capacity was demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development of a pore construction data analysis technique for

   atomic force microscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{429}},
Pages = {{373-383}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{A new data analysis method, the pore construction technique, was
   developed for use in analyzing images resulting from atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). This technique was developed to overcome the
   limitations of traditionally employed methods for determining the pore
   size distribution and characterization of membranes. The method was
   developed using Matlab software. It starts by detecting all regions in
   the image that have a 3D conical pore geometry. The pore data is then
   extracted, and data filters are applied to determine the final shape and
   dimension of each pore in the image. The pore construction technique was
   applied to AFM images obtained from a commercial ultrafiltration
   membrane, and resulted in consistent pore size distribution data from
   three different membrane fibers. The new technique also provided
   additional membrane characteristics including porosity and pore density,
   and could automatically detect membrane pores, all of which cannot be
   done by AFM manual cross-section methods. The pore construction
   technique resulted in membrane pore size distribution profiles that were
   similar to FE-SEM results. These improvements in AFM image analysis
   resulted in reliable and essential pore size data which will make AFM a
   more valuable tool for membrane characterization and similar
   applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{The deployment of wireless sensor networks for healthcare applications
   have been motivated and driven by the increasing demand for real-time
   monitoring of patients in hospital and large disaster response
   environments. A major challenge in developing such sensor networks is
   the need for coordinating a large number of randomly deployed sensor
   nodes. In this study, we propose a multi-parametric clustering scheme
   designed to aid in the coordination of sensor nodes within cognitive
   wireless sensor networks. In the proposed scheme, sensor nodes are
   clustered together based on similar network behaviour across multiple
   network parameters, such as channel availability, interference
   characteristics, and topological characteristics, followed by mechanisms
   for forming, joining and switching clusters. Extensive performance
   evaluation is conducted to study the impact on important factors such as
   clustering overhead, cluster joining estimation error, interference
   probability, as well as probability of reclustering. Results show that
   the proposed clustering scheme can be an excellent candidate for use in
   large scale cognitive wireless sensor network deployments with high
   dynamics.}},

   demonstrated in this paper. For most microfluidic applications, it is
   desired to mix different streams of solutions rapidly in a continuous
   flow mode. Therefore, in this work, we consider a mixing chamber
   containing an electrically conducting particle and the mixing chamber is
   located in the middle of a microchannel. Vortices are generated around
   the electrically conducting particle in an aqueous solution due to the
   interaction of the applied electric field and the induced surface charge
   on the particle. These vortices will enhance significantly the mixing of
   different solutions around the particle. The effectiveness of mixing the
   two streams entering the mixing chamber is numerically studied as
   functions of the applied electric field. Excellent mixing can be
   achieved in this system under two perpendicularly applied electric
   fields. The proposed micro-mixer is simple and easy to be fabricated for
   lab-on-a-chip applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Localization is an essential issue in wireless sensor networks because
   many applications require the sensor nodes to know their locations with
   a high degree of precision. Various localization methods based on mobile
   anchor nodes have been proposed for assisting the sensor nodes to
   determine their locations. However, none of these methods attempt to
   optimize the trajectory of the mobile anchor node. Accordingly, this
   paper presents a path planning scheme, which ensures that the trajectory
   of the mobile anchor node minimizes the localization error and
   guarantees that all of the sensor nodes can determine their locations.
   The obstacle-resistant trajectory is also proposed to handle the
   obstacles in the sensing field. The performance of the proposed scheme
   is evaluated through a series of simulations with the ns-2 network
   simulator. The results show that the proposed path planning algorithm
   yields both a lower localization error and a higher percentage of
   localized sensor nodes than existing path planning schemes.}},

Abstract = {{We spectrally demonstrate for the first time that an amorphous selenium
   metal-semiconductor-metal detector can be used for the measurement of
   ultraviolet photons (200-400 nm) generated from a portable
   battery-operated microplasma that is used as a light source. An
   advantage of this low-cost detector is that the device structure allows
   photons to strike the light-sensitive layer directly rather than through
   electrodes or blocking layers. Another advantage is that despite
   operation at high electric fields of up to 43 V/mu m, the dark current
   of the detector at room temperature is 3 pA/mm(2). Therefore, detector
   cooling is not required, and this facilitates portability for
   measurements on-site (i.e., in the field and away from a laboratory).
   Spectral response was monitored using a scanning monochromator, and it
   was compared with that obtained by a portable spectrometer fitted with a
   linear charge-coupled device detector. To demonstrate detector
   responsivity, emission signals with an appreciable signal-to-noise ratio
   were obtained by introducing nanogram amounts of the sample into the
   microplasma.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured magnesium nickel oxide Mg0.6Ni0.4O was successfully
   synthesized by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS)
   followed by heat treatment. The effect of the precursor composition and
   calcination temperature on the Mg0.6Ni0.4O powder properties was
   investigated. These particles were used as an additive to prepare
   S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite via ball-milling with sulfur. The composite
   preparation conditions were optimized to achieve the higher specific
   surface area without compromising the sample crystallinity. The SEM
   observation revealed that the sulfur morphology was drastically changed
   by the Mg0.6Ni0.4O addition, from smooth to rough agglomerated
   particles. This change has enhanced the electrochemical performance of
   the composite cathode. Cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests
   demonstrated enhanced reversibility and high sulfur utilization in a
   Li/S cell with S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O cathode, delivering about 850 mAh g(-1) of
   reversible capacity at the initial cycle. The effect of the Mg0.6Ni0.4O
   heat treatment temperature on the S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O cycling performance was
   also investigated. The cathode with Mg0.6Ni0.4O calcined at 700 degrees
   C exhibited enhanced capacity retention which could be due to its high
   specific surface area and nanosized structure. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper, radio resource allocation in a heterogeneous wireless
   access medium is investigated. Mobile terminals (MTs) are equipped with
   multiple radio interfaces and are assumed to have multi-homing
   capabilities. A novel algorithm, namely prediction based resource
   allocation algorithm, is proposed for the resource allocation. Unlike
   the existing solutions in literature, the proposed algorithm does not
   require a central resource manager to perform the radio resource
   allocation. The MT plays an active role in the resource allocation
   operation by requesting a bandwidth share from each available network
   based on the available resources at the network, such that the total
   allocated bandwidth from different networks satisfies the MT service
   requirement. The proposed algorithm is suitable for implementation in a
   dynamic environment with call arrivals and departures, and relies on
   network cooperation to perform the decentralized radio resource
   allocation in an efficient manner. Simulation results are presented to
   investigate the performance tradeoffs of the proposed algorithm.}},

Title = {{On Managing Interferences under Heterogeneous CSIT Feedback for

Abstract = {{Multi-user transmission, enabled through spatial multiplexing, is a
   promising technique in wireless systems by sending information to more
   than one user on a common resource block. Although efficient, precise
   channel information is needed in order to minimize the possible
   interferences. Motivated by its importance, the study investigates
   interference management in multi-user downlink systems under
   heterogeneous feedback of channel state information to the transmitter
   (CSIT). In the considered scenario, the base station (BS) can obtain
   different levels of channel realization information from the users under
   multi-user transmission. In particular we focus on a generic scenario
   with two user equipments (UEs), one (UE-1) being able to provide a
   perfect CSIT to the BS and the other (UE-2) unable to, where an
   effective transmission strategy at the BS is proposed with the premise
   of mitigating interference at UE-1. Unfortunately the absence of CSIT
   for UE-2 pushes it in interference-limited regime. To this end, two
   approaches are considered in the study: one by developing additional
   spatial diversity, and the other via advanced receiver design at UE-2.
   We investigate both of the options and show that the rate of UE-2 gets
   significantly improved in both cases. However hardware and RF design
   constraints may make the advanced receiver design solution preferable
   over the spatial diversity solution. We then put this heterogeneous CSIT
   feedback system in the context of long term evolution (LTE) of third
   generation partnership project (3GPP) where interference cannot be
   nulled out even for UE-1 due to the feedback of low level quantized CSIT
   and the restriction of the use of a very limited set of beamformers. The
   paper demonstrates that the advanced interference-aware receiver design
   can bring significant gains in the considered scenario, thereby
   underlining the necessity of intelligent receiver-processing in modern
   wireless systems.}},

   shift was attributed to local heating which was further confirmed by the
   reduction in red shift of the Raman spectrum at lower incident powers

Abstract = {{Numerical analysis of the hydrodynamics and kinetics of copper
   deposition on a copper rotating disk electrode during voltammetry at a
   scan rate of 100 mVs(-1) is conducted to determine the impact of fitting
   for the system parameters using a 1-dimensional model when the process
   operates under transition (1000 rpm) and turbulent (1500 rpm) velocity
   flow conditions. The 1-dimensional model is based on solution of the
   transient mass transport equation for Cu(II) utilizing the well-known
   series solution by von Karman and Cochran for the fluid velocity. The
   suitability of using this model is assessed by comparison to an axially
   symmetric 2-dimensional model of the system. In the 2-dimensional model,
   the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved first
   for the pressure and the fluid velocity components which are then used
   in the transient mass transport equation. The turbulent viscosity is
   estimated using the k-epsilon model. In both models, transport of Cu(II)
   by diffusion and convection is coupled to the flux associated with its
   reduction at the cathode surface. The velocity obtained from the
   1-dimensional model is found to be accurate only at locations within a
   distance of similar to 1.4 x 10(-5) m from the electrode. Although no
   significant differences are found for the fitted kinetic parameters
   obtained using the two models, the diffusion coefficient of Cu(II)
   fitted using the 1-dimensional model exceeds that obtained from the
   2-dimensional model by approximately 44\%. The model with the fitted
   parameters can accurately predict the experimental behavior at a
   different CuSO4 concentration, although larger deviations arise when the
   scan rate is reduced to 5 mVs(-1). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dopamine is a ``sticky{''} biomolecule containing the typical functional
   groups of mussel adhesive proteins. It can self-polymerize into a
   nanoscale thin film on various surfaces. We investigated the surface,
   adhesion, friction, and cracking properties of polydopamine (PDA) thin
   films for their effective transfer to functional devices and
   biocompatible coatings. A series of surface characterizations and
   mechanical tests were performed to reveal the static and dynamic
   properties of PDA films coated on glass, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),
   and epoxy. We found that PDA films are highly hydrated under wet
   conditions because of their porous membrane-like nanostructures and
   hydrophilic functional groups. Upon dehydration, the films form cracks
   when they are coated on soft substrates due to internal stresses and the
   large mismatch in elastic modulus. The adhesive pull-off force or the
   effective work of adhesion increased with the contact time, suggesting
   dynamic interactions at the interface. A significant decrease in
   friction forces in water was observed on all three material surfaces
   coated with PDA; thus, the film might serve as a water-based lubrication
   coating. We attributed the different behavior of PDA films in air and in
   water to its hydration effects. These research findings provide insight
   into the stability, mechanical, and adhesive properties of the PDA
   films, which are critical for their applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an examination of the erosion
   resistance of two-part room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone
   rubber (SiR) nanocomposites. The SiR composites were filled with 7 nm
   size fumed silica and 1.5 mu m size micro-silica. Separate samples were
   prepared using conventional mechanical mixing and an electrospinning
   technique, and their erosion resistances were compared. The
   electrospinning technique allows for a higher volume fraction of
   nanofiller and micro-filler in the composites as compared to the
   conventional samples. The erosion resistances were tested using both an
   infrared-laser-based source and the ASTM D2303 standard inclined plane
   tracking and erosion method (IPT). The experimental results for the
   eroded mass, tracking voltage, and tracking time show that the erosion
   resistances of electrospun samples are much greater than those of
   conventional samples. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and
   variable tracking patterns of the conventional samples after the IPT
   tests suggest an improvement in the dispersion of the fillers within the
   electrospun samples compared to the conventional samples. Power analysis
   during the IPT tests also shows that more power is required to track and
   erode electrospun samples before sample failure occurs than is needed
   for conventional samples, which suggests improved bonding between the
   fillers and the silicone rubber matrix. These findings also are
   supported by the results of thermo-gravimetric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance of silicone rubber composites containing
   0, 10 and 30 wt \% loading of silica filler is investigated in the
   initial-tracking voltage test method of the inclined plane test under AC
   and DC showing the most inferior erosion class under +DC followed by -DC
   and then AC. DC as compared to AC dry-band arcing characteristics are
   analyzed by conducting leakage current measurements prior to and after
   the inception of dry-band arcing. At high test voltages, instability of
   the contaminant rivulet is found to be an important factor in the
   development of dry band arcing and, consequently, biasing the test
   outcomes when equal voltages of rms AC and DC are selected. The initial
   tracking voltage in ASTM D2303 is, therefore, proposed as a reliable
   approach by which +DC and -DC test voltages can be reliably selected. A
   coefficient of variation parameter is also proposed as a useful mean of
   selecting the equivalent DC voltages, and the validity of the parameter
   is verified experimentally using the initial-tracking voltage test
   method. Erosion in the constant voltage method is investigated under DC
   by applying the equivalent voltages and compared to AC. Based on this
   methodology, it is suggested that an improvement in silicone rubber
   compositions is needed for DC. Moreover, the need to select the creepage
   distance of polymer insulators designed for AC, yet to be used under DC,
   with reference to tracking/erosion performance is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Common-mode voltages (CMVs) can lead to premature failure of the motor
   insulation system in medium-voltage current-source-fed drives. By
   analyzing the CMV values at all switching states under different
   operating conditions of a current-source-inverter (CSI)-based motor
   drive, this paper first indicates that the CMV peaks are produced by the
   zero states in most of the cases. The nonzero-state (NZS) modulation
   techniques employed in voltage-source converters are adapted for use in
   a space-vector-modulated current-source converter (CSC) to reduce the
   CMV magnitude. For NZS modulation in CSCs, the nearest three-state (NTS)
   modulation sequences are designed with good low-order harmonic
   performances in their linear modulation region of m(a) >= 0.67 and with
   no increase in the device switching frequency. A combined
   active-zero-state (AZS) modulation technique is also proposed as
   compensation, for a lower modulation index in the range of 0.4-0.67,
   when a compromise is made between the dc-link current minimization and
   high input power factor control. The simulation and experimental results
   are provided to validate the CMV reduction effects and harmonic
   performances of the NTS and combined AZS modulation methods in CSI-fed
   drives.}},

Abstract = {{Electroporation of a single cell in a microchannel was studied. The
   effects of electrical (e.g., strength of the electric pulse) and
   geometrical (e.g., microchannel height, electrode size and position)
   parameters on cell membrane permeabilization were investigated. The
   electrodes were assumed to be embedded in the walls of the microchannel;
   the cell was suspended between these two electrodes. By keeping the
   electric pulse constant, increasing the microchannel height reduces the
   number and the radius of the biggest nanopores, as well as the
   electroporated area of the cell membrane. If the width of the electrodes
   is bigger than the cell diameter, the transmembrane potential will be
   centralized and have a sinusoidal distribution around the cell if
   nanopores are not generated. As the width of the electrode decreases and
   becomes smaller than the cell diameter, the local transmembrane
   potential decreases; in the nonelectroporative area, the transmembrane
   potential distribution deviates from the sinusoidal behavior; the
   induced transmembrane potential also concentrates around the poles of
   the cell membrane (the nearest points of the cell membrane to the
   electrodes). During cell membrane permeabilization, the biggest
   nanopores are initially created at the poles and then the nanopore
   population expands toward the equator. The number of the created
   nanopores reaches its maximal value within a few microseconds; further
   presence of the electric pulse may not influence the number and location
   of the created nanopores anymore but will develop the generated
   nanopores. Strengthening the electric pulse intensifies the size and
   number of the created nanopores as well as the electroporated area on
   the cell membrane.}},

Abstract = {{The acquisition of laser range measurements can be a time consuming
   process for situations where high spatial resolution is required. As
   such, optimizing the acquisition mechanism is of high importance for
   many range measurement applications. Acquiring such data through a
   dynamically small subset of measurement locations can address this
   problem. In such a case, the measured information can be regarded as
   incomplete, which necessitates the application of special reconstruction
   tools to recover the original data set. The reconstruction can be
   performed based on the concept of sparse signal representation.
   Recovering signals and images from their sub-Nyquist measurements forms
   the core idea of compressive sensing (CS). A new saliency-guided
   CS-based algorithm for improving the reconstruction of range image from
   sparse laser range measurements has been developed. This system samples
   the object of interest through an optimized probability density function
   derived based on saliency rather than a uniform random distribution.
   Particularly, we demonstrate a saliency-guided sampling method for
   simultaneously sensing and coding range image, which requires less than
   half the samples needed by conventional CS while maintaining the same
   reconstruction performance, or alternatively reconstruct range image
   using the same number of samples as conventional CS with a 16 dB
   improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. For example, to achieve a
   reconstruction SNR of 30 dB, the saliency-guided approach required 30\%
   of the samples in comparison to the standard CS approach that required
   90\% of the samples in order to achieve similar performance. Crown

   digestion at 35 and 55 degrees C was characterized by employing this
   developed method. There was not an apparent relationship between the
   precipitated sulfur and nonsoluble iron concentrations in sludges. Raw
   WAS had a more consistent organic sulfur fractionation because of its
   relatively homogeneous composition. The organic-sulfur-containing
   components (proteins) of WAS had reduced degradability as compared with
   that in primary sludge during anaerobic digestion. Digestion at 55

Abstract = {{Tone-mapping operators (TMOs) that convert high dynamic range (HDR) to
   low dynamic range (LDR) images provide practically useful tools for the
   visualization of HDR images on standard LDR displays. Different TMOs
   create different tone-mapped images, and a natural question is which one
   has the best quality. Without an appropriate quality measure, different
   TMOs cannot be compared, and further improvement is directionless.
   Subjective rating may be a reliable evaluation method, but it is
   expensive and time consuming, and more importantly, is difficult to be
   embedded into optimization frameworks. Here we propose an objective
   quality assessment algorithm for tone-m apped images by combining: 1) a
   multiscale signal fidelity measure on the basis of a modified structural
   similarity index and 2) a naturalness measure on the basis of intensity
   statistics of natural images. Validations using independent
   subject-rated image databases show good correlations between subjective
   ranking score and the proposed tone-mapped image quality index (TMQI).
   Furthermore, we demonstrate the extended applications of TMQI using two
   examples-parameter tuning for TMOs and adaptive fusion of multiple
   tone-mapped images.(1)}},

Abstract = {{Acid number is an important quality parameter for biodiesel and
   biodiesel blends and has been included in various quality standards
   including ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214. In this paper, a new simple and
   green potentiometric method based on green chemistry approaches has been
   developed to determine the acid number of biodiesel and biodiesel
   blends. This new method uses a reduced amount of titration solvent and
   recommends the use of a small sample size instead of large sample size
   as stated in the ASTM reference method D664. A time-efficient electrode
   cleaning procedure has been developed which completely eliminates the
   use of toxic solvents for cleaning the electrodes. This proposed green
   method significantly reduced the maximum \% error from 101\% to only
   -18\% and repeatability was decreased from 290\% to 100\% when compared
   to ASTM D 664 method using the sample size of 2 g. This proposed green
   analytical method could be used for the determination of acid number of
   biodiesel and biodiesel blends in R\&D as well as in industrial quality
   control laboratories as a simple, time-efficient, cost effective, and
   environmentally friendly method for acid number determination. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The transmission of strain fields in adhesively bonded MEMS strain
   sensors is analyzed. In strain sensors that are attached to host
   structures using adhesive layers such as epoxy, complete strain transfer
   to the sensor is hindered due to the influence of the adhesive layer on
   the transfer. This paper presents an analytical model, validated by
   finite element method simulation, to provide insight and accurate
   formulation for strain transfer mechanism for bonded sensors. A
   shear-lag parameter has been introduced to account for the component
   geometry and properties. The model is capable of predicting the strain
   transmission ratio through a sensor gauge factor, and it clearly
   establishes the effects of the flexibility, length, and thickness of the
   adhesive layer and MEMS sensor substrate. Finally, modifications to
   sensor substrates, by the implementation of micromachined tapered edges
   and trench etching, are proposed in order to increase the strain
   transmission ratio. It has been found, for the selected case study, that
   the sensor sensitivity could be enhanced by up to 30\%. This work on
   bonding analysis is applicable for performance prediction and
   calibration in sensor systems design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel enhanced total variation optimization
   segmentation (ETVOS) approach consisting of two phases to segmentation
   of various sea-ice types. In the total variation optimization phase, the
   Rudin-Osher-Fatemi total variation model was modified and implemented
   iteratively to estimate the piecewise constant state from a nonpiecewise
   constant state (the original noisy imagery) by minimizing the total
   variation constraints. In the finite mixture model classification phase,
   based on the pixel distribution, an expectation maximization method was
   performed to estimate the final class likelihood using a Gaussian
   mixture model. Then, a maximum likelihood classification technique was
   utilized to estimate the final class of each pixel that appeared in the
   product of the total variation optimization phase. The proposed method
   was tested on a synthetic image and various subsets of RADARSAT-2
   imagery, and the results were compared with other well-established
   approaches. With the advantage of a short processing time, the visual
   inspection and quantitative analysis of segmentation results confirm the
   superiority of the proposed ETVOS method over other existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{A new formulation is required to provide a proper power flow analysis in
   islanded microgrids taking into consideration their special philosophy
   of operation. In this paper, a novel and generic three-phase power flow
   algorithm is formulated for islanded microgrids. The algorithm is novel
   since it adapts the real characteristics of the islanded microgrid
   operation; i.e., 1) some of the distributed generation (DG) units are
   controlled using the droop control methods and their generated active
   and reactive power are dependent on the power flow variables; 2) the
   steady-state system frequency is considered as one of the power flow
   variables. The proposed algorithm is generic, where the features of
   distribution systems, i.e., three-phase feeder models, unbalanced loads
   and load models have been taken in consideration. Further, all possible
   operation modes of DG units (droop, PV, or PQ) have been considered. The
   problem has been formulated as a set of nonlinear equations. A globally
   convergent Newton-trust region method has been proposed to solve this
   set of nonlinear equations. The proposed algorithm is a helpful tool to
   perform accurate steady state studies of the islanded microgrid.
   Different case studies have been carried out to test the effectiveness

Abstract = {{Recently, integration of distributed generation (DG) in distribution
   systems has increased to high penetration levels. The impact of DG units
   on the voltage stability margins has become significant. Optimization
   techniques are tools which can be used to locate and size the DG units
   in the system, so as to utilize these units optimally within certain
   limits and constraints. Thus, the impacts of DG units issues, such as
   voltage stability and voltage profile, can be analyzed effectively. The
   ultimate goal of this paper is to propose a method of locating and
   sizing DG units so as to improve the voltage stability margin. The load
   and renewable DG generation probabilistic nature are considered in this
   study. The proposed method starts by selecting candidate buses into
   which to install the DG units on the system, prioritizing buses which
   are sensitive to voltage profile and thus improve the voltage stability
   margin. The DG units' placement and sizing is formulated using
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming, with an objective function of
   improving the stability margin; the constraints are the system voltage
   limits, feeders' capacity, and the DG penetration level.}},

Abstract = {{This study continues previous work which showed that the anomalous

   use of cyclic voltammetry (CV) or pulse reverse (PR) plating. The
   research focuses on aspects not considered in this previous work: the
   effects of the anion and agitation in the plating bath. A comparison is
   made of Co-Ni electrodeposition using the CV and PR techniques in
   sulfate and chloride baths at pH 3 containing equimolar Co(II) and
   Ni(II) concentrations under both stirred and unstirred conditions. The
   anomalous behavior can be significantly suppressed and even eliminated
   with current efficiencies above 90 \% through use of PR plating, in
   particular, but only if carried out in a chloride solution under
   quiescent conditions. Both metal ion reduction during the cathodic
   portion and oxidation of the coating during anodic polarization are
   accelerated in the chloride solution relative to that in the sulfate
   solution. Electrolyte agitation exacerbates anomalous deposition and
   reduces the current efficiency by enhancing mass transport of Co(II) and
   H+ to and from the electrode. The origin of anomalous deposition and
   effects of the chloride ion are examined in terms of coordination
   chemistry and ligand field theory. This analysis suggests that oxidation
   of the Co-Ni coating in the chloride solution during anodic polarization
   of the PR and CV cycles when cobalt preferentially dissolves is crucial
   to suppressing the anomalous behavior. Examination of the coatings shows
   that the anion type, degree of agitation of the electrolyte, and
   electroplating technique significantly affects their microstructure and
   roughness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a combined fabrication method for creating a
   bi-material micro-scale coating on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) optical
   sensors using laser-assisted maskless microdeposition (LAMM) and
   electroless nickel plating. This bi-material coating alters the
   sensitivity of the sensor where it also acts as a protective layer. LAMM
   is used to coat bare FBGs with a 1-2 mu m thick conductive silver layer
   followed by the electroless nickel plating process to increase layer
   thickness to a desired level ranging from 1 to 80 mu m. To identify an
   optimum coating thickness and predict its effect on the sensor's
   sensitivity to force and temperature, an optomechanical model is
   developed in this study. According to the model if the thickness of the
   Ni layer is 30-50 mu m, maximum temperature sensitivity is achieved. Our
   analytical and experimental results suggest that the temperature
   sensitivity of the coated FBG with 1 mu m Ag and 33 mu m Ni is almost
   doubled compared to a bare FBG with sensitivity of 0.011 +/- 0.001 nm
   degrees C-1. In contrast, the force sensitivity is decreased; however,
   this sensitivity reduction is less than the values reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Facial diagnosis is an important diagnostic tool, and has been practiced
   by various traditional medicines for thousands of years. However, due to
   its qualitative and subjective nature, it cannot be accepted in
   mainstream medicine. To circumvent these issues, computerized facial
   diagnosis using color and texture features are extracted from facial
   blocks representing a facial image. A facial color gamut is constructed
   and six centroids located to help calculate the facial color feature
   vector. As for the texture feature, a 2-dimensional Gabor filter with
   various scales and orientations are applied. Both features are combined
   to diagnosis the face. The experimental results were carried out on a
   large dataset consisting of 142 Health and 1038 Disease samples. Using
   both extracted features facial gloss was first detected and employed to
   distinguish Health and Disease samples with an average accuracy of
   99.83\%. Illnesses in Disease were also separated by the analysis of
   each facial block. The best result was achieved using all facial blocks,
   which successfully classified (>71\%) six illnesses. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The conversion of rotary to translational motion in lead screw drives
   occurs at the meshing lead screw and nut threads. A decreasing
   coefficient of friction with sliding velocity, may lead to instabilities
   in these drives. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed
   for a two degrees of freedom lead screw drive model. This controller has
   two objectives: to regulate the lead screw angular velocity to a preset
   value and to attenuate friction-induced vibrations. Only upper and/or
   lower bounds of system parameters are assumed to be known. In addition,
   in the development of the controller no specific model is assumed for
   the dependence of the coefficient of friction on the relative sliding
   velocity. Two modifications are applied to the basic discontinuous
   sliding mode controller to eliminate the inherent chattering problem and
   to limit the controlled input torque levels. Numerical simulation
   results are presented that show the applicability and the performance of
   the proposed controller.}},

Abstract = {{We propose RACE, a report-based payment scheme for multihop wireless
   networks to stimulate node cooperation, regulate packet transmission,
   and enforce fairness. The nodes submit lightweight payment reports
   (instead of receipts) to the accounting center (AC) and temporarily
   store undeniable security tokens called Evidences. The reports contain
   the alleged charges and rewards without security proofs, e. g.,
   signatures. The AC can verify the payment by investigating the
   consistency of the reports, and clear the payment of the fair reports
   with almost no processing overhead or cryptographic operations. For
   cheating reports, the Evidences are requested to identify and evict the
   cheating nodes that submit incorrect reports. Instead of requesting the
   Evidences from all the nodes participating in the cheating reports, RACE
   can identify the cheating nodes with requesting few Evidences. Moreover,
   Evidence aggregation technique is used to reduce the Evidences' storage
   area. Our analytical and simulation results demonstrate that RACE
   requires much less communication and processing overhead than the
   existing receipt-based schemes with acceptable payment clearance delay
   and storage area. This is essential for the effective implementation of
   a payment scheme because it uses micropayment and the overhead cost
   should be much less than the payment value. Moreover, RACE can secure
   the payment and precisely identify the cheating nodes without false
   accusations.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Channel zapping time is a critical quality of experience (QoE) metric
   for IP-based video delivery systems such as IPTV. An interesting zapping
   acceleration scheme based on time-shifted subchannels (TSS) was recently
   proposed, which can ensure a zapping delay bound as well as maintain the
   picture quality during zapping. However, the behaviors of the TSS-based
   scheme have not been fully studied yet. Furthermore, the existing
   TSS-based implementation adopts the traditional IP multicast, which is
   not scalable for a large-scale distributed system. Corresponding to such
   issues, this paper makes contributions in two aspects. First, we resort
   to theoretical analysis to understand the fundamental properties of the
   TSS-based service model. We show that there exists an optimal subchannel
   data rate which minimizes the redundant traffic transmitted over
   subchannels. Moreover, we reveal a start-up effect, where the existing
   operation pattern in the TSS-based model could violate the zapping delay
   bound. With a solution proposed to resolve the start-up effect, we
   rigorously prove that a zapping delay bound equal to the subchannel time
   shift is guaranteed by the updated TSS-based model. Second, we propose a
   destination-oriented-multicast (DOM) assisted zapping acceleration
   (DAZA) scheme for a scalable TSS-based implementation, where a
   subscriber can seamlessly migrate from a subchannel to the main channel
   after zapping without any control message exchange over the network.
   Moreover, the subchannel selection in DAZA is independent of the zapping
   request signaling delay, resulting in improved robustness and reduced
   messaging overhead in a distributed environment. We implement DAZA in
   ns-2 and multicast an MPEG-4 video stream over a practical network
   topology. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   validity of our analysis and DAZA scheme.}},

   including the activation energies for the main polymerization steps. The
   ethylene polymerization kinetics with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO are first
   order with respect to the ethylene concentration. Catalyst deactivation
   also follows first-order kinetics. Chain transfer to the monomer is the
   dominant chain-transfer reaction in this system; transfer to MAO also
   happens to a lesser extent, but beta-hydride elimination is negligible

Abstract = {{Turbulent drag reduction behavior of mixed polymer-surfactant systems
   (anionic polymer/cationic surfactant; nonionic polymer/cationic
   surfactant; nonionic polymer/anionic surfactant) was studied in a
   pipeline flow loop to explore the role of surfactants in mechanical
   degradation of polymers. The polymers investigated were nonionic
   polyethylene oxide (PEO) and anionic polyacrylamide (PAM). The
   surfactants studied were cationic octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride
   (OTAC) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The pipeline flow
   results obtained for PAM/OTAC mixtures support the idea that the coiling
   of polymer molecules does not protect the polymer molecules against
   shear degradation. The addition of oppositely charged cationic
   surfactant (OTAC) to anionic polymer (PAM) results in coiling of polymer
   molecules. The coiled polymer molecules undergo faster mechanical
   degradation than stretched polymer molecules. The addition of surfactant
   (cationic OTAC or anionic SDS) to nonionic polymer PEO increases the
   resistance of polymer molecules against shear degradation. This is
   reflected in the pipeline flow results. The effect is more significant
   for anionic surfactant (SDS) than for cationic surfactant (OTAC)
   especially at high concentrations of surfactant; the smaller size of the
   headgroup of anionic surfactant monomers allows them to have a greater
   influence on the polymer molecules. These results support the idea that
   extended polymer chains are more resistant to mechanical degradation as
   compared with coiled polymer molecules. The polymer chains undergo
   extension due to repulsion between the neighboring surfactant micelles
   attached to the backbone of the polymer chains.}},

   membrane fuel cell flow channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{150-160}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Water dynamics in the flow channel of a proton exchange membrane fuel
   cell is significantly important to water management and removal. In this
   study, volume-of-fluid method is used to investigate numerically the
   three-dimensional water dynamics in a flow channel with a hydrophilic
   needle. It is found that water transport and dynamics in this novel flow
   channel are quite different from the conventional channel. Liquid water
   droplet, introduced on the electrode surface, is removed through
   capillary effect once touching the hydrophilic needle. This is desirable
   since the electrode surface becomes free of liquid water, avoiding the
   flooding and blockage of reactant gas transport into the electrode.
   Increasing the contact area between the water droplet and needle,
   through an increase in the diameter or length of the needle, can
   facilitate water removal from the electrode surface because of greater
   capillary effect, but it also increases the pressure drop in the channel
   due to greater blockage by the needle. Overall, the pressure drop in the
   modified channel is still small compared to the pressure drop in a
   serpentine flow channel, making the present approach viable for use in
   the conventional parallel flow channels for proton exchange membrane
   fuel cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High quality, large size volumetric imaging of biological tissue with
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) requires large number and high
   density of scans, which results in large data acquisition volume. This
   may lead to corruption of the data with motion artifacts related to
   natural motion of biological tissue, and could potentially cause
   conflicts with the maximum permissible exposure of biological tissue to
   optical radiation. Therefore, OCT can benefit greatly from different
   approaches to sparse or compressive sampling of the data where the
   signal is recovered from its sub-Nyquist measurements. In this paper, a
   new energy-guided compressive sensing approach is proposed for improving
   the quality of images acquired with Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT) and
   reconstructed from sparse data sets. The proposed algorithm learns an
   optimized sampling probability density function based on the energy
   distribution of the training data set, which is then used for sparse
   sampling instead of the commonly used uniformly random sampling. It was
   demonstrated that the proposed energy-guided learning approach to
   compressive FD-OCT of retina images requires 45\% fewer samples in
   comparison with the conventional uniform compressive sensing (CS)
   approach while achieving similar reconstruction performance. This novel
   approach to sparse sampling has the potential to significantly reduce
   data acquisition while maintaining image quality. (C) 2013 Optical

   Results from the proposed correlation are successfully compared to

Abstract = {{This paper gives an overview of the error-in-variables-model (EVM)
   procedure for parameter estimation with nonlinear models. It is shown
   that the nested-iterative EVM algorithm, used in this work, is efficient
   and powerful, since it provides both true values of the variables and
   the best estimates of the parameters. The step by step illustration
   along with evaluation techniques for results, are followed by further
   discussion about the importance and advantages of combining EVM with
   design of experiments strategies. With the focus on the performance of
   the EVM algorithm, an illustrative example of reactivity ratio
   estimation in copolymerization is included, with single-response
   (composition data) and multi-response (triad fraction data) scenarios.

Abstract = {{Poly(acrylic acid-co-N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide) hydrogel films were
   synthesized by copolymerizing acrylic acid (AAc) with
   N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as a cross-linker via photo
   polymerization in the spacing confined between two glass plates. NMR
   spectroscopy was utilized to determine the cross-linking density. We
   found that the cross-linking density determined by NMR is higher than
   that expected from the feed concentrations of cross-linkers, suggesting
   that MBA is more reactive than AAc and the heterogeneous nature of the
   cross-linking. In addition to the swelling tests, indentation tests were
   performed on the hydrogel films under water to investigate effects of
   the cross-linking density on the adhesion and mechanical properties of
   the hydrogel films in terms of adhesive pull-off force and Hertz-type
   elastic modulus. As the cross-linker concentration increased, the
   effective elastic modulus of the hydrogel films increased dramatically
   at low cross-linking densities and reached a high steady-state value at
   higher cross-linking densities. The pull-off force decreased with
   increasing crosslinker concentration and reached a lower force plateau
   at high cross-linking densities. An optimal ``trade-off{''}
   cross-linking density was determined to be 0.02 mol fraction of MBA in
   the hydrogel, where balanced elastic modulus and adhesive pull-off force
   can be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of separating N unknown
   non-stationary signals using as many observed mixtures. Using short-term
   Fourier Transform (STFT) of the mixtures along with a classification
   approach based on affinity propagation (AP) clustering provide an
   efficient technique for separating non-stationary signals. The proposed
   method is featured by its simplicity and improved classification
   compared to other existing TF based signal separation methods. The
   method can tackle both the mono-component as well as multi-component
   signals and its assumptions about the mixing matrix are more relaxed
   than other existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first signal separation approach based on AP clustering. Besides
   improved clustering the AP does not require apriori knowledge of the
   number of clusters. Examples, using synthetic as well as real-life data,
   are presented to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed

   prevalent throughout the signal processing world. Traditionally,
   measures such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence are employed, but these

   mean discrepancy is a modern distance measure that is computationally
   simpler - involving the inner product between the difference in means of
   two groups' feature distributions - yet statistically powerful, because
   these distributions are mapped into a high-dimensional, nonlinear
   feature space using kernels, whereupon the means are estimated via the
   Parzen estimator. We apply this metric and leverage several powerful
   data representations from the supervised image classification world,
   such as bag-of-visual-words and sparse combinations of SIFT descriptors,
   to locate scene change points in videos with promising results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for driver's eye tracking, based on
   an improved version of a particle filter. We use two different state
   transition models and two different observation models distributions in
   order to adapt the tracking depending on the situation. The first state
   transition model is based on autoregressive model and is robust to face
   rotation. The second one is based on head motion and is efficient
   despite rapid head movements. The first observation model is based on
   pupil detection. Although very accurate, it is not extremely robust to
   head rotations. For that, we add a second observation model, based on
   similarity between eye candidates and a subspace trained offline. This
   approach is robust to important face rotations or partial occlusion.
   Evaluation has been done with an infrared camera on different people
   executing a challenging sequence of movements. Results show that our
   method is robust to face rotation, partial occlusion, and illumination

Abstract = {{Among the current tools of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI),
   high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) excels in its ability
   to delineate complex directional patterns of water diffusion at any
   predefined location within the brain. It is known that HARDI signals
   present a practical trade-off between their directional resolution and
   their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), suggesting the need for effective
   denoising algorithms for HARDI measurements. The most effective
   approaches to alleviate this problem have been proven to be those which
   exploit both the directional and the spatial regularity of HARDI
   signals. Unfortunately, many of these algorithms entail substantial
   computational burdens. Accordingly, we propose a formulation of the
   problem of reconstruction of HARDI signals which leads to a particularly
   simple numerical implementation. The proposed algorithm allows for the
   separation of the original problem into procedural steps which can be
   executed in parallel, which suggests its computational advantage.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an approach for lower-leg pose recovery from ambulatory
   sensors is implemented and validated in a clinical setting. Inertial
   measurement units are attached to patients undergoing physiotherapy. The
   sensor data is combined with a kinematic model within an extended Kalman
   filter framework to perform joint angle estimation. Anthropometric joint
   limits and process noise adaptation are employed to improve the quality
   of the joint angle estimation. The proposed approach is tested on 7
   patients following total hip or knee joint replacement surgery. The
   proposed approach achieves an average root-mean-square error of 0.12

Abstract = {{The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index has been attracting an increasing
   amount of attention recently in the video coding community as a
   perceptual criterion for testing and optimizing video codecs. Meanwhile,
   the arrival of the new MPEGH/H.265 High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)
   standard creates new opportunities and challenges in perceptual video
   coding. In this paper, we first elaborate what are the attributes that
   make SSIM a good candidate for perception-based development of HEVC and
   future video coding standards for both testing and optimization
   purposes. We then address the computational issues in practical
   applications of SSIM in HEVC, in particular the trade-off between
   efficient computation and accurate estimation of SSIM when working with
   video codecs that have sophisticated block partitioning structures and
   aim for encoding videos with a wide range of spatial resolutions.}},

Abstract = {{Image denoising has been an active research topic in the past decades
   for its broad real-world applications, but surprisingly little work has
   been dedicated to the quality assessment of denoised images. In this
   work, we first build a database that contains noisy images at different
   noise levels and denoised images created by both classical and
   state-of-the-art denoising algorithms. We then carry out a subjective
   experiment using a multi-stimulus ranking approach to evaluate and
   compare the quality of the denoised images. Data analysis shows that
   there are both considerable agreement and significant variations between
   human subjects on their opinions of denoised images. Our results also
   show that state-of-the-art objective image quality models only
   moderately correlate with subjective opinions, and further
   investigations that involve both structural fidelity and naturalness
   measures are desirable in future development of advanced objective

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel High-Level Information Fusion architecture
   based on a fuzzy extension to Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN).
   Modeling both semantic and causal relationships between the existing
   entities in a specific context, MEBN are deemed a very well-studied and
   theoretically rich approach that takes advantage of the expressiveness
   power of First-order Logic, and uncertainty management of Bayesian
   Networks. However, MEBN lack the capability of modeling the ambiguity
   which is intrinsic to the knowledge gained through human language. In
   this paper, a fuzzy extension to MEBN is proposed based on the concept
   of Fuzzy Bayesian Networks, and a novel ambiguity propagation approach
   is introduced further. The applicability of the proposed architecture is
   investigated by implementing a Collision Warning System in Vehicular
   Ad-hoc Networks. It is shown that our system is capable of not only
   dealing with both semantic and causal relationships between the existing
   entities, but it also handles the inherent ambiguity which lies in the
   input information very efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Demand response (DR) and energy storage (ES) have the potential to

   penetration in islanded microgrids is also investigated. A mathematical
   model is developed for the islanded mode operation of a microgrid. The
   optimization is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
   problem, which is solved using the CPLEX solver in the General Algebraic
   Modeling System (GAMS) platform. A case study is carried out to
   illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model. The numerical results
   show the effectiveness of the coordinated operation of ES with DR on

Abstract = {{the short term load forecasting plays a critical role in power system
   operation and economics. The accuracy of short term load forecasting is
   very important since it affects generation scheduling and electricity
   prices, and hence an accurate short term load forecasting method should
   be used. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm optimized Radial Basis
   Function network (GA-RBF) with a fuzzy corrector for the problem of
   short term load forecasting. In order to demonstrate this system
   capability, the system has been compared with four well known techniques
   in the area of load forecasting. These techniques are the multi-layer
   feed forward neural network, the RBF network, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference System and the genetic programming. The data used in this
   study is a real data of the Egyptian electrical network. The weather
   factors represented in the minimum and the maximum daily temperature
   have been included in this study. The GA-RBF with the fuzzy corrector
   has successfully forecasted the future load with high accuracy compared
   to that of the other load forecasting techniques included in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Until now, distribution systems have radial structure with
   unidirectional power flows and a simple protection scheme. As one of the
   smart grid objectives and in order to face the continuous demand growth,
   there is a trend to connect more distributed generation (DG units) to
   distribution networks. In order to realize this aim and to increase the
   maximum loadability, meshed network architecture has been suggested. For
   this reason, in this paper three possible arrangements for distribution
   networks (i.e., base radial configuration, radial configuration obtained
   from a reconfiguration problem, and meshed network) have been
   investigated and compared with each other. The three network
   configurations are compared in terms of feeder losses, maximum
   loadability, voltage profile and maximum DG penetration level. The
   comparison has been tested on the 33 bus balanced and 19 bus unbalanced
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The continued demand for higher performance in modern microprocessors
   places strict timing constraints on the high performance modules such as
   dynamic circuits and register files. In addition, the increased process
   variations in scaled technologies results in delay variations around its
   nominal value. This delay variability results in violating the timing
   constraints, and correspondingly, causes a timing yield loss. In our
   previous work, new negative capacitance circuits are connected to the
   highly capacitive nodes to reduce the overall parasitic capacitance at
   these nodes. This capacitance reduction reduces the circuit mean delay
   which results in timing yield improvement, which is verified by using
   post-layout simulations. In this paper, test chip measurements are
   provided showing that the adoption of the negative capacitance circuit
   to a 64-input wide dynamic OR gate is capable of improving the timing
   yield to 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the preparation of nitrogen doped graphene (NG) by
   hydrothermal synthesis. The morphology, structure, and composition of
   the prepared NG were confirmed with SEM, XRD, XPS and Raman
   spectroscopy. The material was tested for supercapacitive behavior. Our
   emphasis here is focused on the method of synthesis as an energy saving
   process, compared to other methods utilizing high temperatures or plasma
   techniques. The results confirmed that 2.77\% nitrogen was chemically
   doped to graphene. Furthermore, it was found that doping with nitrogen
   increased the supercapacitance of graphene by 45\%, reaching 131 F/g. An
   equivalent two electrode cell fabricated from NG material could provide
   energy density as high as 4.55 Wh/kg and a stable average power density
   of 2.46 kW/kg.}},

Abstract = {{Ti anodic films were potentiostatically grown in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous
   solutions, in a potential range in which the voltammetric
   characterization showed an anodic shoulder related to the oxidation of
   TixOy (with y/x < 2) oxides. A variation in the density of donors and
   the flat band potential obtained by EIS measurements was related to
   changes in Ti suboxides proportion, confirmed by AR-XPS measurements. A
   modified Point Defect Model (PDM) was fitted to EIS experimental data in
   order to estimate the kinetic parameters describing the passivity of the
   Ti films. The model accounts for the formation and diffusion of oxygen
   and hydroxyl vacancies during film growth. The kinetic parameters
   related to film dehydration (e. g. hydroxyl vacancies) decrease as the
   formation potential becomes more positive, suggesting that the film
   hydration is crucial in the structure of the oxide grown during Ti
   anodization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of maintaining persistence in
   coordinated tasks performed by a team of autonomous robots. We introduce
   a dedicated team of charging robots to service a team of primary working
   robots. Given that the trajectories of the working robots are known
   within a planning interval, the objective is to plan routes for the
   charging robots such that they rendezvous with and recharge all working
   robots to guarantee their continuous operation. To this end, the working
   robot trajectories are discretized to form a finite set of recharging
   points at which rendezvous can occur. The problem is formulated as a
   directed acyclic graph with vertex partitions containing sets of
   charging points for each working robot. Solutions consist of paths
   through the graph for each of the charging robots. The problem is shown
   to be NP-hard and a mixed integer linear program formulation is
   presented and solved for small problem instances. Finally, it is shown
   that while the optimal solution is not computationally feasible for
   large problem sizes, it is possible to graphically transform the single
   charging robot problem to a Traveling Salesman Problem, for which
   existing heuristic and approximation algorithms can be applied.
   Simulation results are presented for both single and multiple charging
   robot scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion of wind generation capacity requires a close examination of
   the location and quality of wind resources and a detailed understanding

   enhancements for three specific years under study- 2010, 2015 and 2025.
   The zonal supply mix of generation resources included are, nuclear,
   wind, hydro, gas- and coal-fired generation. An optimal power flow (OPF)
   model is developed considering future demand and generation scenarios,
   and used in a deterministic case study. Subsequently, Monte Carlo
   simulations are carried out considering the variability and uncertainty
   of wind generation. Both case studies examine the effect of different
   wind generation penetration levels on the Ontario electrical grid and
   analyze long-term wind generation impacts. The impact on operating
   reserves for different levels of wind penetration is also examined.}},

Abstract = {{We report progress in the development of a new technique that has the
   potential to enable the vacuum deposition of OLEDs with feature sizes <=
   20um, and hence high resolution OLED displays. An OLED device with 16um
   by 130um sub-pixel size has been successfully demonstrated utilizing the
   novel idea of the in-situ shadow mask patterning method showing the
   capability to achieve high resolution OLED patterning. In the approach
   proposed here, two sheets of polyimide film are mounted on the bottom
   electrode of an OLED. The top sheet of the two stacked sheets is
   patterned in-situ by laser ablation to create apertures to function as a
   deposition shadow mask. The lower sheet, which serve as a protective
   layer to the electrode during the laser ablation step is then removed,
   and OLED materials are deposited through the now patterned top sheet.
   Since mask alignment is not required in this approach, the technique
   circumvents the resolution limitations imposed by the difficulty of
   aligning shadow masks in the conventional techniques, and allows
   achieving high resolution pixel patterning. Furthermore, shadow effects,
   another factor that limits resolution in conventional techniques, can be
   reduced due to the use of very thin polyimide film (similar to 7.5um)
   that is directly held on the substrate by electrostatic force. In
   principle, by applying this technique to the standard three color
   side-by-side sub-pixel matrix scheme, a resolution and aperture ratio of
   338ppi and 60\%, respectively, can be expected, which is estimated based
   on the fact that the width of the deposited material is 25um for the
   16um wide electrode.}},

   recombination zone, electroluminescence spectra of devices with various
   architectures at different current densities are studied. Results show
   that high efficiency at low current density mostly originates from the
   interfacial emission at the EML/ETL interface due to the formation of
   host excitons followed by the subsequent energy transfer to the guests.
   Furthermore, increase in the current density shifts the recombination
   zone from the EML/ETL interface towards the HTL/EML interface where the
   device emission is the result of direct charge trapping on the guest
   sites. The results suggest that the shift in recombination zone and
   subsequent change in emission mechanism play a main role on the

Abstract = {{We study exciton-induced degradation of various organic/metal interfaces
   in organic optoelectronic devices. The results show that organic/metal
   interfaces are susceptible to irradiation in general, resulting in a
   deterioration in charge transport across the interfaces. We find that
   organic/metal interfaces containing the same organic material but
   different metals degrade quite differently, where interfaces with metals
   of high work function are more susceptible to exciton-induced
   degradation than those with metals of low work function. The results
   suggest a clear correlation between exciton-induced degradation of
   organic/metal interfaces and energy barrier for electron injection at
   organic/metal interfaces. Furthermore, the fact that the use of
   interfacial layers, which usually contain alkali metals of extremely low
   work function, can greatly improve organic/metal interfacial
   photo-stability is also, to a large extent, consistent with such
   correlation. The reason behind such correlation may stem from the
   difference in the strength of organic-metal bonds in organometallic
   compounds formed at different organic/metal interfaces and/or the
   difference in band bending of organic materials in the vicinity of
   organic/metal interfaces due to the use of metals of different work

Abstract = {{The almost-sure stochastic stability of fractional viscoelastic systems,
   characterized by parametric excitation of bounded noises, is
   investigated. The viscoelastic material is modelled using a fractional
   Kelvin-Voigt constitutive relation, which results in a stochastic
   fractional equation of motion. The method of stochastic averaging,
   together with the Fokker-Plank equation of the averaged Ito stochastic
   differential equation, is used to determine asymptotically the top
   Lyapunov exponent of the system for small damping and weak excitation.
   It is found that the parametric noise excitation can have a stabilizing
   effect in the resonant region. The effects of various parameters on the
   stochastic stability of the system are discussed. The approximate
   analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Systems thinking approaches are employed to construct a formal decision
   making methodology for equitably allocating water among competing users
   in a river basin when taking into account both the societal and physical
   systems aspects of the allocation problem. In particular, within the
   societal component of the decision problem, multiple participants, their
   multiple objectives, equity principles, and economic factors are
   considered, while the physical systems part reflects relevant hydrologic
   and environmental factors. The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM)
   incorporates these societal and physical systems concerns within the
   framework of a largescale optimization program which is divided into two
   main steps. Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing
   legal water rights regimes or agreements. Secondly, water and associated
   benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide
   welfare. CWAM is applied to the South Saskatchewan River Basin located
   in the Canadian province of Alberta to demonstrate how it can be
   conveniently applied to a water allocation system of systems problem.}},

Abstract = {{Current wireless systems are one-way (similar to walkie-talkies),
   meaning that disjoint time or frequency segments are used to transmit
   and to receive. Realization of two-way wireless has challenged the
   research community for many years. This article(1) establishes the
   theory and presents practical realization of two-way (true full-duplex)
   wireless. In contrast to the widely accepted beliefs, it is shown that
   two-way wireless is not only feasible, but is fairly simple, with
   virtually no degradation in signal-to-noise-ratio(2). The innovation is
   in the antenna design and multiple levels for cancelling
   self-interference. Methods are developed to support Multiple-Input
   Multiple-Output (MIMO) two-way transmission, and asynchronous two-way
   links (useful in networking applications). The developed hardware uses
   off-the-shelf components, antennas have a simple structure, are
   omnidirectional (can be directional, if needed), do not suffer from
   bandwidth limitations, have a small size/spacing, and the increase in
   overall complexity is minimal. It is shown that two-way wireless can do
   more than doubling the rate. In particular:
   1) Facilitates wireless networking. In particular, the ability to handle
   asynchronous users enables superimposing a half-duplex, low bit rate,
   low power, easy to detect network for control signaling superimposed
   (physical overlay, rather than logical) on top of the network of primary
   full-duplex data links. The superimposed links are separated from the
   primary full-duplex data links in the code domain, and use time
   multiplexing plus Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) among themselves.
   However, the conventional problems of CSMA are avoided as control links
   operate in parallel with primary full-duplex data links. The physical
   layer of control links is designed such that full-duplex data links can
   detect and cancel the interference caused by the superimposed control
   links.
   2) Enhances security through desirable jamming.
   3) Provides the ground to realize unconditional security (beyond
   computational or information theoretical security), using a simple
   method introduced in this article.
   4) Facilitates multi-node distributed \& collaborative signaling,
   including realization of Network Information Theoretic setups, and
   cognitive wireless.
   5) Exploiting feedback, it improves point-to-point throughput, and
   enables ultra low power transmission.
   6) Doubles the point-to-point throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Decode-and-forward (D-F) and compress-and-forward (C-F) are two
   fundamentally different relay strategies proposed by (Cover and El
   Gamal, 1979). Individually, either of them has been successfully
   generalized to multi-relay channels. In this paper, to allow each relay
   node the freedom of choosing either of the two strategies, we propose a
   unified framework, where both the D-F and C-F strategies can be employed
   simultaneously in the network. It turns out that, to fully incorporate
   the advantages of both the best known D-F and C-F strategies into a
   unified framework, the major challenge arises as follows: For the D-F
   relay nodes to fully utilize the help of the C-F relay nodes, decoding
   at the D-F relay nodes should not be conducted until all the blocks have
   been finished; However, in the multi-level D-F strategy, the upstream
   nodes have to decode prior to the downstream nodes in order to help,
   which makes simultaneous decoding at all the D-F relay nodes after all
   the blocks have been finished inapplicable. To tackle this problem,
   nested blocks combined with backward decoding are used in our framework,
   so that the D-F relay nodes at different levels can perform backward
   decoding at different frequencies. As such, the upstream D-F relay nodes
   can decode before the downstream D-F relay nodes, and the use of
   backward decoding at each D-F relay node ensures the full exploitation
   of the help of both the other D-F relay nodes and the C-F relay nodes.
   The achievable rates under our unified relay framework are found to
   combine both the best known D-F and C-F achievable rates and include
   them as special cases.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a popular
   modulation scheme used in a variety of applications. One significant
   problem associated with OFDM is the possibility of large side-lobes in
   its spectrum. In this paper, we consider the so-called N-continuous
   method for reducing the side-lobes. We first consider one implementation
   approach, whereby certain sub-carriers are reserved for the purpose of
   adjusting the spectrum of an OFDM symbol. We find that significant
   side-lobe reduction is possible, although at the cost of injecting very
   large power in the reserved sub-carriers that results in unacceptable
   spectrum overshoot. In order to achieve reasonable power levels, at
   least 2 0 \% of all sub-carriers must be reserved for weighting. As a
   solution to the problem of spectrum overshoot, we propose an alternative
   approach whereby the power of the reserved sub-carriers is constrained.
   Numerical results show that reasonable power levels are achieved at the
   cost of significant performance loss in the N-continuous OFDM technique
   for side-lobe reduction. We thus find that the performance cost of
   eliminating the spectrum overshoot reduces the side-lobes reduction to
   less than 5 dB in cases of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Passive Optical Network (PON) with cascaded optical amplifier (OA) and
   splitter has been reported as a promising strategy to support low-cost
   deployment of long-reach Passive Optical Networks (LRPONs), which is one
   of the keys to enable a fiber to the premises (FTTP) service
   provisioning scenario. This paper investigates a challenging network
   planning and dimensioning (NPD) task, where proper optical link budget
   planning and correlated optimal splitters/OAs placement are jointly
   considered under cascaded OAs and splitters. Different with previous
   PON-related research which mostly focus only on the splitter placement
   in PON, we investigate the power-aware LRPON layout planning and
   dimensioning in order to maintain PON cost-effective competitiveness and
   to effectively mitigate the impacts of various LRPON optical link
   degradation factors (including fiber attenuation, optical losses in
   Network Elements (NEs) amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in OAs,
   etc.) on network performance. To accomplish this goal, we propose an
   integer linear programming (ILP) model by concerning multiple design
   parameters into a single optimization framework, including the cascaded
   LRPON topology, NEs specification, NEs placement, fiber cabling
   connections, etc. Numerical experiments validate and demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our proposed power-aware optimization model. Moreover,
   results show the benefits in terms of reduced cost per user for large
   scale LRPON, which further illustrates the cost-effectiveness of LRPON
   infrastructure deployment to support the rapid growth of future FTTP
   service.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology
   helps an optical transmission system to break the limitation of
   wavelength grids by Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), in which a
   flexible and elastic transmission paradigm is created, so as to achieve
   better spectrum efficiency and flexibility of the fiber resources. This
   paper investigates a novel adaptive transmission strategy in OFDM based
   optical transmission systems, aiming to minimize the transmission cost
   for a bulk data transfer request in terms of energy consumption and
   bandwidth usage without violating the constraints on the transmission
   delay and bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. By considering nonlinear
   effects of Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and amplified spontaneous
   emission (ASE) noise from optical amplifier, a novel analytical model
   for the BER expression is provided and the corresponding optimization
   problem is formulated. In particular, the proposed formulation is the
   first in the literature that considers the effect of Peak-to-Average
   Power Ratio (PAPR) on both electrical and optical domain signals. By
   adaptively choosing the number of subcarriers, modulation level, and
   coupled laser power, the transmission cost for a given request can be
   minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Grid, as one kind of promising sustainable power systems, can rely
   on two-way communications and emerging smart meters to intelligently
   control the residential electricity usage. However, due to the inherent
   open communication media as well as the limited communication,
   computation and storage capabilities of smart meters, security concerns
   raise and hinder the further flourish of smart grid. In this paper, we
   propose a privacy-preserving aggregation (PARK) scheme with adaptive key
   management and revocation, to prevent user's data from being disclosed
   to untrusted entities in smart grid. Specifically, we first investigate
   a lightweight aggregation scheme with efficient aggregate
   authentication, which protects the individual user's data from
   disclosure to the untrusted aggregator. Furthermore, we propose an
   adaptive key management mechanism with effective revocation, where users
   can automatically update their encryption keys if no user joins or
   departs from the system. The expiry time of the key is determined by
   user's reputation for the adaptive key management. Finally, the security
   analysis demonstrates that the PARK can achieve privacy preservation,
   forward and backward secrecy at the same time, while the performance
   evaluation shows that the PARK consumes reasonable costs.}},

Abstract = {{With a wide range of potential applications, machine-type communication
   (MTC) or machine to machine (M2M) communications is gaining a tremendous
   interest among mobile network operators and research groups. MTC is
   standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which has
   been regarded as the promising solution facilitating M2M communications.
   One of research challenges in MTC is security, if the security is not
   well addressed, all applications involving MTC cannot be put into
   market. In the latest standard, the 3GPP proposes a novel scenario for
   MTC, where MTC server is located outside of the operator domain.
   However, the connection between 3GPP core network and MTC server in this
   scenario is insecure, as a result, there are distrustful relationships
   among MTC device, core network and MTC server. To resolve this problem,
   we propose an end-to-end security scheme for MTC based on the
   proxy-signature technique in this paper. Specifically, both the MTC
   device and the MTC server can establish a strong trustful relationship
   with each other through using the proxy signatures issued by the core
   network. Through security analysis, we conclude that the proposed scheme
   can achieve the security goals, and prevent the various security
   threats. In addition, performance evaluation also demonstrates its
   efficiency in terms of operational cost during authentication.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle to infrastructure communications can provide mobile users with a
   series of Internet services, such as video streaming, digital map
   downloading, database access, online gaming, and even safety services
   like accident alarm, traffic condition broadcast, etc., through fixed
   roadside units. However, the dynamics of communication environment and
   frequent changing topology critically challenge the design of an
   efficient transport layer protocol, which makes it difficult to
   guarantee diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements for various
   applications. In this paper, we present a novel transport scheme in
   infrastructure based vehicular networks, and aim to resolve some
   challenging issues such as source transfer rate adjustment, congestion
   avoidance, and fairness in end to end data communications. By precisely
   detecting packet losses and identifying various causes of these losses
   (for example, link disconnection, channel error, packet collision,
   buffer overflow), the proposed scheme adopts different reacting
   mechanisms to each of the losses. Moreover, it timely monitors the
   buffer size of the bottleneck RSU, and dynamically makes transfer rate
   feedbacks to the source nodes to avoids buffer overflow or vacancy.
   Finally, simulation results show that the scheme not only successfully
   reduces packet losses due to buffer overflow and link disconnection but
   also improves the utilization efficiency of channel resource.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cooperative cognitive radio networking framework, which
   enhances the security of communications for the primary users (PUs) and
   provides transmission opportunities to secondary users (SUs), is
   proposed. Particularly, a PU selects two cooperating SUs, a relay SU and
   a jammer SU, for improving communication secrecy and grants a fraction
   of the bandwidth resource as a reward to the SUs, in which the
   cooperating SUs transmit their own data simultaneously using quadrature
   signaling. The objective of the cooperation is to maximize the secrecy
   rate of the primary link while satisfy the transmission rate
   requirements of SUs. To this end, the PU selects the best cooperating
   SUs and allocates the bandwidth optimally, while the relay and jammer
   SUs determine the optimal transmit power. Numerical results demonstrate
   that, with the proposed cooperative framework, the PU can achieve the
   maximum secrecy rate through cooperation with the selected SUs.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetically levitated robots can move without lubrication, they
   generally have advantages to the use in the various special environments
   such as in a dust-free room, in a vacuum, in a flammable atmosphere, and
   in vivo. Meanwhile, they have a disadvantage of small working volume
   corresponding to the allowable air gap between the levitated object and
   the electromagnets. In some cases, to construct a combination of a
   magnetically levitated robot (which can generate a fine motion) and an
   industrial robot (which can generate a coarse motion and has a
   comparatively large working volume) seems an effective way to expand the
   whole working volume. On that premise, we are developing an experimental
   system and simulator for collaborative work between a magnetically
   levitated robot and an industrial robot. This paper presents the system
   concept and the configuration of the simulator, and the result of a
   preliminary simulation experiment which has been performed to evaluate
   mainly two elements: the numerical magnetically levitated robot model
   and the numerical industrial robot model.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel method for skin detection as a pre-processing
   step for (hand) gesture segmentation. First, the skin color and texture
   models are learnt from a training set of skin images, where a Gaussian
   Mixture Model (GMM) and texton dictionary is constructed. Then, a
   stochastic region merging strategy is used to segment the image texture
   regions, from which each segment is classified based on the skin color
   and skin texture models. Compared with other state-of-the-art skin
   segmentation techniques, our experimental results suggest that our
   approach can handle better color and illumination variations arising
   from skin tone and pose changes, while keeping its ability for
   discriminating skin from other highly textured background materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of spontaneous human affect has gained a lot of interest
   recently after a shift in research focus from the traditional six
   prototypical emotions. In this paper, a combined bi-modal
   feature-decision fusion approach is proposed to enhance the performance
   of estimating emotions from spontaneous speech conversations. First, a
   feature vector consisting of audio information extracted from the whole
   speech sentence is combined with video features of the individual key
   frames representing that sentence. Then, the final estimate is
   calculated by a decision level fusion of predictions from all
   corresponding frames. The performance is compared with two fusion
   approaches, the decision level fusion using weighted linear combination,
   and a simple feature level fusion. The experimental results show
   improvement in correlation between the emotion estimates and the audio
   references. In addition, we evaluated the performance of supervised PCA
   (SPCA) for dimensionality reduction on this audio and video emotion
   estimation application, which led to better results compared to
   traditional principle component analysis (PCA).}},

Abstract = {{As multi-core systems are becoming more popular in real-time embedded
   systems, strict timing requirements for accessing shared resources must
   be met. In particular, a detailed latency analysis for Double Data Rate
   Dynamic RAM (DDR DRAM) is highly desirable. Several researchers have
   proposed predictable memory controllers to provide guaranteed memory
   access latency. However, the performance of such controllers sharply
   decreases as DDR devices become faster and the width of memory buses is
   increased. In this paper, we present a novel, composable worst case
   analysis for DDR DRAM that provides improved latency bounds compared to
   existing works by explicitly modeling the DRAM state. In particular, our
   approach scales better with increasing number of requestors and memory
   speed. Benchmark evaluations show up to 62\% improvement in worst case
   task execution time compared to a competing predictable memory
   controller for a system with 8 requestors.}},

   Our first approach is based on sigma-modification method which

Abstract = {{Runtime verification is a formal technique used to check whether a
   program under inspection satisfies its specification by using a runtime
   monitor. Existing monitoring approaches use one of two ways for
   evaluating a set of logical properties: (1) event-triggered, where the
   program invokes the monitor when the state of the program changes, and
   (2) time-triggered, where the monitor periodically preempts the program
   and reads its state. Realizing the former is straightforward, but the
   runtime behaviour of event-triggered monitors are difficult to predict.
   Time-triggered monitoring (designed for real-time embedded systems), on
   the other hand, provides predictable monitoring behavior and overhead
   bounds at run time. Our previous work shows that time-triggered
   monitoring can potentially reduce the runtime overhead provided that the
   monitor samples the program state at a low frequency.
   In this paper, we propose a hybrid method that leverages the benefits of
   both event-and time-triggered methods to reduce the overall monitoring
   overhead. We formulate an optimization problem, whose solution is a set
   of instrumentation instructions that switches between event-triggered
   and time-triggered modes of monitoring at run time; the solution may
   indicate the use of exactly one mode or a combination of the two modes.
   We fully implemented this method to produce instrumentation schemes for
   C programs that run on an ARM Cortex-M3 processor, and experimental
   results validate the effectiveness of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Various regression models are used to predict the continuous emotional
   contents of social signals. The common trend to train those models is by
   minimizing a sense of prediction error or maximizing the likelihood of
   the training data. According to those optimization criteria, among two
   models, the one which results in a lower prediction error, or higher
   likelihood, should be favored. However, that might not be the case,
   since to compare the prediction quality of different models, the
   correlation coefficient of their prediction with the actual values is
   prevalently used. Hence, given the fact that a lower prediction error
   does not imply a higher correlation coefficient, we might need to
   reconsider the optimization criteria that we undertake in order to learn
   the regression coefficients, in order to synchronize it with the
   hypothesis testing criteria. Motivated by this reasoning, in this work
   we suggest to maximize a sense of correlation for learning regression
   coefficients. Two senses of correlation, namely Pearson's correlation
   coefficient and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, are seen for
   this purpose. We have chosen the continuous audio/visual emotion
   challenge 2012 as the framework of our experiments. The numerical
   results of this study show that compared to support vector regression,
   the suggested learning algorithms offer higher correlation coefficient
   and lower prediction error.}},

Abstract = {{The Laban Effort and Shape components provide a systematic tool for a
   compact and informative description of the dynamic qualities of
   movements. To enable the application of Laban notation in computational
   movement analysis, measurable physical correlates of Effort and Shape
   components need to be identified. Such physical correlates enable
   quantification of Effort and Shape components, which in turn facilitates
   computational analysis of affective movements. In this work, two
   existing approaches to quantification of Laban Effort components
   (Weight, Time, Space, and Flow) based on measurable movement features
   (position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk) are adapted for hand and
   arm movements, and a new approach for quantifying Shape Directional
   based on the average trajectory curvature is proposed. The results show
   a high correlation between Laban annotations provided by a certified
   movement analyst (CMA) and the quantified Effort Weight (81\%), Time
   (77\%) and Shape Directional (93\%) for an affective hand and arm
   movement dataset.}},

   an electromagnetic inverse scattering systems (EMISS) characterization
   based on 2D Green's function analysis. For this purpose, a number of
   Green's function matrices are constructed for various random

   have employed the numerical rank of the Green's function matrices as the
   degree-of-uniqueness of the EMISS. Plotting the degree-of-uniqueness vs.
   the number of source EMISS elements enables us to compare different
   EMISS settings and find the optimum one for an EMISS implementation. The
   extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the Green's
   function characterization curves.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time applications have deadline constraints. The system should
   provision sufficient resources for the application to meet the
   deadlines, and use supply and demand bound functions to analyze the
   schedulability of workloads. The concept of the demand bound function
   describes the upper bound on the resources required by the application,
   while the supply-bound function specifies the lower bound on the
   resources supplied to the tasks. If the system provides fewer resources
   than required, the application will experience an overload. Most work
   concentrates on designing systems that cannot experience short periods
   of overloads.
   This work explores resource provisioning for control applications that
   can tolerate overloads. It introduces analysis techniques for supply and
   demand bound functions that specifically consider overloads and delays
   in a periodic resource model. With this extended model, the work
   addresses three problems: (1) determine the worst-case delay for a given
   resource demand and supply under a periodic resource model, (2) find a
   periodic resource supply for a given workload and worst-case tolerable
   delay, and (3) for a control system with a given robustness criterion,
   identify a periodic resource supply with a worst-case delay.}},

   contaminants at a drinking water intake}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY}},

Abstract = {{An integrated approach for the identification and assessment of the most
   critical chemical contaminant(s) at a drinking water intake has been
   developed. It involves the determination of a threshold or critical raw
   water concentration (CRWC) for target contaminants using the observed
   overall removal efficiency of a specific water treatment plant (WTP) and
   regulated drinking water concentrations for the target contaminants. The
   exceedance probability relative to the CRWC based on historical raw
   water quality monitoring data is then calculated. Finally, the
   integration of the raw water quality data and the overall efficiency of
   a particular WTP sequence allows for identification of the most critical
   contaminant(s) as well as an advance indication of which contaminants
   are most likely to challenge a plant. The proactive nature of this
   approach gives a utility the impetus and time to assess current
   treatment processes and potential alternatives. In addition, it was
   found that three- or four-parameter theoretical distributions are more
   appropriate than two-parameter probability distributions for the fitting
   of raw water quality data. This study reveals that the reliance on raw
   and/or treated water contaminant concentrations in isolation or on
   theoretical removals through treatment processes can, in some
   circumstances, be misguided.}},

Abstract = {{The application of the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM)
   approach and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD)
   analysis for the characterization of hydraulically reversible and
   irreversible fouling species, extracted from hollow fiber
   ultrafiltration (UF) membranes used in drinking water treatment, was
   demonstrated. Hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling species
   were extracted from two pilot UF membrane systems operated in parallel
   with lake water as the feed. Two membrane cleaning protocols,
   hydraulic-and chemical-based (NaOCl and citric acid) cleaning, were
   considered. Colloidal/particulate matter together with protein-like and
   metal species in water appeared to contribute to the formation of a
   hydraulically removable fouling layer on the membranes. Hydraulically
   irreversible fouling, in contrast, was impacted considerably by humic
   substances (HS) and protein-like matter. The formation of an
   irreversible fouling layer was also likely influenced by interactions
   between the colloidal/particulate matter and metal species together with
   HS and protein-like matter. LC-OCD analysis revealed the presence of
   predominant levels of lower molecular weight HS-like matter - compared
   to the HS-like matter commonly present in lake water - in the citric
   acid extracted foulant fraction. The permeability loss due to
   hydraulically irreversible UF fouling was considerably greater than the
   permeability loss due to hydraulically reversible UF fouling. A
   permanent permeability loss (similar to 25-35\% of the initial
   permeability) was present even after the application of considerably
   strong chemical cleaning protocols on both pilot systems. This study
   indicated that the fluorescence EEM approach can be applied for
   monitoring and characterization of membrane cleaning procedures and as a
   potential diagnostic tool for assessing the effectiveness of
   hydraulic-and chemical-based cleaning protocols employed in UF drinking
   water treatment operations using rapid off-line measurements. On the
   other hand, since the LC-OCD analysis technique is a comparatively time
   consuming method, it may be used for verification of the fluorescence
   EEM-based results of the foulant fractions.}},

Abstract = {{Perception and generation of affective movements are essential for
   achieving the expressivity required for a fully engaging human-machine
   interaction. This paper develops a computational model for recognizing
   and generating affective hand movements for display on anthropomorphic
   and non-anthropomorphic structures. First, time-series features of these
   movements are aligned and converted to fixed-length vectors using
   piece-wise linear re-sampling. Next, a feature transformation best
   capable of discriminating between the affective movements is obtained
   using functional principal component analysis (FPCA). The resulting
   low-dimensional feature transformation is used for classification and
   regeneration. A dataset consisting of one movement type, closing and
   opening the hand, is considered for this study. Three different
   expressions, sadness, happiness and anger, were conveyed by a
   demonstrator through the same general movement. The performance of the
   developed model is evaluated objectively using leave-one-out cross
   validation and subjectively through a user study, where participants
   evaluated the regenerated affective movements as well as the original
   affective movements reproduced both on a human-like model and a
   non-anthropomorphic structure. The proposed approach achieves zero
   leave-one-out cross validation errors, on both the training and testing
   sets. No significant difference is observed between participants'
   evaluation of the regenerated movements as compared to the original
   movement, which confirms successful regeneration of the affective
   movement. Furthermore, a significant effect of structure on the
   perception of affective movements is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of the diffusion propagator from a sparse set of diffusion
   MRI (dMRI) measurements is a field of active research. Sparse
   reconstruction methods propose to reduce scan time and are particularly
   suitable for scanning un-coperative patients. Recent work on
   reconstructing the diffusion signal from very few measurements using
   compressed sensing based techniques has focussed on propagator (or
   signal) estimation at each voxel independently. However, the goal of
   many neuroscience studies is to use tractography to study the pathology
   in white matter fiber tracts. Thus, in this work, we propose a joint
   framework for robust estimation of the diffusion propagator from sparse
   measurements while simultaneously tracing the white matter tracts. We
   propose to use a novel multi-tensor model of diffusion which
   incorporates the bi-exponential radial decay of the signal. Our
   preliminary results on in-vivo data show that the proposed method
   produces consistent and reliable fiber tracts from very few gradient
   directions while simultaneously estimating the bi-exponential decay of
   the diffusion propagator.}},

Abstract = {{Inputs are provided for the decision-making process of transit
   improvements in developing countries. With an analysis of the
   willingness of private bus operators to participate in transit
   improvements, political feasibility can be assessed, and the likelihood
   of successful implementation can be increased. Data from 156 surveys
   conducted in cities in Mexico are used to develop probabilistic models
   that quantify the influence of private bus operators' characteristics,
   perceptions about business and operating efficiencies, and their
   relationship with government on their willingness to participate.
   Evidence shows that several elements can increase the willingness of
   private operators to participate in government-led proposals. These
   elements include the level of trust and communication between private
   bus operators and government authorities, the economic power of private
   bus operators, and the attachment to the status quo. Several features
   are shown to limit operators' willingness to participate, including the
   model of operation, likelihood of lost revenue through taxation, and
   concerns about the potential modifications of their legal rights to
   operate. An analysis of Mexico City, Mexico, and surrounding areas
   demonstrates the need to establish a well-defined strategy for engaging
   private bus operators in transit improvements; failure to do so has
   resulted in much less trust of government and led to more conflicts
   about future projects. The importance of analyzing private bus
   operators' participative profiles in the assessment of transit
   improvements is revealed. Selected areas for improvements might present
   challenges for engaging private bus operators in proposed improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Internet-scale storage systems often provide weak consistency in
   exchange for better performance and resilience. An important weak
   consistency property is k-atomicity, which bounds the staleness of
   values returned by read operations. The k-atomicity-verification problem
   (or k-AV for short) is the problem of deciding whether a given history
   of operations is k-atomic. The 1-AV problem is equivalent to verifying
   atomicity/linearizability, a well-known and solved problem. However, for
   k >= 2, no polynomial-time k-AV algorithm is known.
   This paper makes the following contributions towards solving the k-AV
   problem. First, we present a simple 2-AV algorithm called LBT, which is
   likely to be efficient (quasilinear) for histories that arise in
   practice, although it is less efficient (quadratic) in the worst case.
   Second, we present a more involved 2-AV algorithm called FZF, which runs
   efficiently (quasilinear) even in the worst case. To our knowledge,
   these are the first algorithms that solve the 2-AV problem fully. Third,
   we show that the weighted k-AV problem, a natural extension of the k-AV
   problem, is NP-complete.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile warning systems present a viable alternative when the visual and
   auditory modalities encounter information overload. We modified the
   Patterson four-step design approach for auditory warning design,
   adapting it to tactile warning design. Using these approaches for a
   tactile warning design, we identified key design parameters, which could
   influence the perceived urgency of tactile warnings, namely spatial
   location and the number of activated vibrotactors. Using a tactile grid
   we developed a set of tactile designs varying in activation type,
   layout, and activation level. The different vibrotactor designs were
   evaluated using the perceived urgency scale. The results showed that the
   number of activated vibrotactors was a key design parameter influencing
   the perception of urgency. This study showed that perceived urgency is a
   concept that can be applied to tactile warnings and that tactile
   warnings can be systematically designed to convey appropriate levels of
   perceived urgency.}},

Abstract = {{Aurora is a large-scale kinetic art installation that reacts to human
   presence directly, with sensors triggering outputs, and indirectly, by
   modifying output behaviour rules. This paper describes a novel method
   for estimating visitors' fields of interest, their attention to specific
   parts of the installation, with a future goal of using this measure as a
   fitness function for output behaviour modification based on genetic
   algorithms. Due to constraints in Aurora, distributed overhead distance
   sensors were used as the sensory inputs. A low resolution height graph
   of the space below the installation is created, and the active sensors
   are clustered into groups. The height graph and sensor groups are used
   to produce a probability map of possible visitor locations. Based on
   these, particle filters are created to estimate the visitors' state, and
   by extension their fields of interest. Using this overall strategy for
   tracking and interest prediction, an average prediction accuracy of 92\%
   is found when compared to a set of simulated people moving within a
   simulated space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an approach for the temporal segmentation of human
   body movements using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). The approach is
   based on online HMM-based segmentation of continuous time series data.
   In previous studies, the real-time segmentation of human body movement
   using joint angles acquired by optical motion capture has been realized,
   using stochastic motion modeling. The approach is now adapted for
   angular velocity data. The segmented motions are recognized via HMM
   models. The segmentation and recognition results of the proposed
   algorithm are demonstrated with experiments. Auto segmentation of each
   motion and recognition of motion patterns are verified using angular
   velocity data obtained by IMU sensors and the Wii remote. The success
   rate of auto segmentation using the data obtained by Wii remote was more
   than 80\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{The negotiations over reducing the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions among major emitters are studied using the Graph Model for
   Conflict Resolution to gain better insight and understanding into the
   current situation. After the Durban and Doha climate change conferences
   were signed, major emitters took different mitigation actions to lower
   the amount of GHG in the atmosphere. The possible equilibrium states
   were determined to ascertain if major GHG emitters would lower their
   emissions according to the agreements or not. The analytical results
   reveal a strong motivation from the European Union nations (EU 27) and
   other developed countries to lower the amount of GHG with high ambition
   levels, while both the United States (US) and emerging countries namely,
   China, India, Brazil and South Africa, are acting with low ambition
   levels to lower the amount of GHG. The analysis also indicates that both
   the EU 27 and other developed countries will lower their ambition levels
   if the US and emerging countries retain low ambition levels. Finally,
   the analysis also demonstrates that both the US and China are still not
   willing to cooperate with each other to mitigate negative impacts of
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Water diversion conflicts in China are studied using a hierarchical
   approach to obtain the strategic resolutions. To address the large
   population and uneven water distribution in China, the South-North Water
   Diversion Project (SNWDP) is being constructed to transfer water from
   the Yangtze River Basin to the North China Plain where there is a severe
   water shortage. As the eastern route of the project nears completion,
   conflicts have arisen along the central and western routes where the
   Chinese Central Government has to decide how to proceed. To obtain
   possible resolutions to these conflicts, a hierarchical approach is
   adopted by which conflicts along the two routes are analyzed separately
   using the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). The possible
   outcomes determined indicate that the central project can be fully
   initiated in spite of opposition, while the western route cannot be
   resumed without the agreement of the neighboring countries. These
   findings from the two separate conflicts are compared to those obtained
   when the two disputes are investigated as one larger conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Syria's Strategic location and presence of several parties with quite
   opposite interests have made the ongoing conflict over Syria a potential
   risk for sparking another World War. The Graph Model for Conflict
   Resolution is used to model and analyze the current conflict in Syria.
   This analysis considers five DMs containing Western Powers,
   Russia-China, Iran, Syrian regime, and internal oppositions with totally
   fourteen options. The decision support system GMCR II employs various
   solution concepts for stability definition to determine the most likely
   outcomes among all feasible states. It is concluded that the status quo
   is not stable and will not last for long run. To deter escalation of
   this conflict and reaching to more peaceful conditions, it is
   recommended that Russia-China and Iran cooperate with Western Powers.
   Coalition analysis also indicates that as long as Iran and Russia
   supports Syrian regime with armory, Syria escalates the war against
   internal oppositions.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of patient deterioration and triage (prioritization of care)
   are two critical tasks in the high risk environment and
   interdisciplinary care model of patients in an intensive care unit. To
   make decisions and plan treatments, clinicians need to observe,
   integrate, communicate, and understand a wide range of information from
   various devices located at the bedsides of multiple patients. However,
   several technological and physical limitations prevent them from
   optimally performing these tasks, which negatively impact the
   capabilities of healthcare teams. The Monitoring Messenger concept was
   developed to overcome some of these challenges by integrating
   information on a mobile device and supporting team decision-making and
   information exchange. Results from the initial phases of this project:
   requirements definition using Cognitive Work Analysis and rapid device
   prototyping are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Optical motion tracking has enhanced human movement analysis in
   medicine, biomechanics, and rehabilitation science by providing highly
   accurate joint angle measurements over time. However, analyzing the
   large amount of recorded data is challenging. The process is usually
   simplified by calculating descriptive measures, such as the minimum,
   mean, or maximum, from the time series data. We propose a novel
   technique for the analysis of human motion data, which considers the
   complete time series data and is based on the F-statistic traditionally
   used in medical and biomechanical studies. The time series data is
   modeled by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the F-statistic is
   reformulated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence for comparing HMMs.
   This provides a novel technique to enhance the analysis of human
   movement data and includes an automatic generation of group-specific
   trajectories to simplify visual data analysis. It is further suitable as
   time-series based, univariate feature selection technique in machine
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{On-board battery charger is an essential component of a plugin vehicle.
   Bidirectionality, even though not realized yet in charging systems of
   commercial plugin vehicles, is being seriously considered for future

   presents the structure of a high performance two-stage, level-2 on-board
   bidirectional battery charger, as the interface between the utility grid
   and the plugin vehicle's battery pack. Then, a comparative evaluation of
   three control schemes based on PI controller, synchronous DQ-frame model
   and PR controller, for grid-side AC-DC converter is performed.
   Simulation results are used to support the analytical expectations.}},

Abstract = {{For the indoor positioning issue in WLAN based on fingerprinting,
   reference points clustering methods such as K-means and affinity
   propagation are frequently used to reduce the region of search. However,
   the number of clusters needs to be predefined directly or indirectly,
   meanwhile an unsuitable clustering pattern would lead to poor estimation
   accuracy, which reduces the practicability of these methods. Based on
   the theory of the complex network, this paper presents a community
   detection based reference points clustering for indoor localization in
   WLAN. A novel clustering target function is proposed and a modified
   Clauset-Newman-Moore (CNM) algorithm is presented to solve this
   function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other
   clustering based localization methods, the proposed method can obtain
   more accurate estimation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a cloud based system involving extensive image data
   transmission and storage. For such systems, high-performance images
   transmission and storage methods are crucial, as the total cost of the
   system mainly depends on the data volume of storage and transmission. In
   this paper, we propose an encrypted image transmission and storage
   framework based on kernel regression. Kernel regression (KR) based
   methods can restore the image from its downsampled version with low
   computational cost, however, have low quality around edges. To overcome
   this issue, we propose a Laplace guided KR method (LKR), in which a
   novel weighted Laplace map is used to refine the smoothing kernel in KR,
   and the key insight of LKR is that KR based methods can better estimate
   edges when using smoothing kernels with edges information. We also
   discuss the encryption method and the Laplace image coding method in
   detail. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Runtime verification is a monitoring technique to gain assurance about
   well-being of a program at run time. Most existing approaches use
   sequential monitors; i.e., when the state of the program with respect to
   an event of interest changes, the monitor interrupts the program
   execution, evaluates a set of logical properties, and finally resumes
   the program execution. In this paper, we propose a GPU-based method for
   design and implementation of monitors that enjoy two levels of
   parallelism: the monitor (1) works along with the program in parallel,
   and (2) evaluates a set of properties in a parallel fashion as well. Our
   parallel monitoring algorithms effectively exploit the many-core
   platform available in the GPU. In addition to parallel processing, our
   approach benefits from a true separation of monitoring and functional
   concerns, as it isolates the monitor in the GPU. Our method is fully
   implemented and experimental results show significant reduction in
   monitoring overhead, monitoring interference, and power consumption due
   to leveraging the GPU technology.}},

   Bluetooth Detectors}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2395}},
Pages = {{111-122}},
Abstract = {{Travel time is viewed by travelers and road managers as one of the key
   indicators of quality of service. Bluetooth detectors have recently
   emerged as a viable technology for the acquisition of vehicle travel
   times. Several studies have described the application of the technology
   to freeways and compared the measured travel times with the travel times
   obtained through other technologies. This paper examines the application
   of Bluetooth detectors to the acquisition of arterial travel times. The
   arterial environment is substantially more challenging than the freeway
   environment because of the frequent interruptions in the traffic flow
   caused by traffic signals. This paper examines the magnitude of errors
   in detection time and travel time measurement. It is not feasible to use
   field data to examine the measurement error because the error is
   inherent within the observations and cannot be separated. Consequently,
   a simulation framework is proposed to synthesize measurement errors for
   a range of arterial traffic conditions. The results show that the mean
   travel time error is essentially zero for all traffic conditions.
   However, the variance of the error varies as a function of the traffic
   conditions. Through multiple regression, the standard deviation of the
   travel time measurement error is modeled, and it is shown that under
   some conditions, the 95\% confidence interval of this error may reach
   25\% of the true mean travel time. These results can be used to assess
   Bluetooth detector deployment plans and provide more insight into the
   reliability of arterial travel time measurements obtained from Bluetooth
   detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Ever increasing demand of higher data rates is pushing Multiple-Input
   Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems into the ongoing standardization of
   future wireless systems, where this added spatial dimension will be
   predominantly employed for spatially multiplexed transmission. In order
   to make these systems practically realizable, low complexity efficient
   detection algorithms are eagerly sought, both by the industry and the
   academia. In this paper, we propose a two-stage hybrid detector based on
   the classical performance-complexity trade off of the MIMO systems. This
   detector is characterized by the lower complexity of linear detection
   and superior performance of maximum likelihood (ML) detection. The first
   stage is a linear filter that adapts the system dimension in accordance
   with the processing capability of the second stage, which is a
   non-linear low complexity ML detector. We consider the pragmatic ranges
   of MIMO systems (2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5) and look at the effect of the
   distribution of streams amongst the two stages. Adaptability of the
   system in the form of stream allocation to the two stages allows having
   a trade off between the complexity and the performance of detection.
   This is dictated by the alteration in the diversity order of the system
   as we vary number of streams between the two stages. Performance of the
   proposed hybrid detector improves as the number of streams to be
   suppressed in the first stage decreases but it is coupled with the
   increase in the cost of complexity. The observations made through this
   analysis can facilitate the design of the future systems in accordance
   with the limitations imposed by the hardware constraints.}},

   multidimensional single-objective nonlinear optimization problem is

   corresponding estimates. By introducing variable slip dependency
   parameters in the optimization problem, the proposed method gives a
   single-cage motor model that is capable of simultaneously predicting the
   induction motor characteristics at high and low slips, both with high
   accuracy. The proposed method has been tested on a sample of eight
   induction motors of different sizes, rated voltages and manufacturers.
   The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing
   single-cage induction motor models that are capable of accurately

   voltage stability constraints and the small-signal stability
   constraints. A detailed microgrid model is adopted to reflect the
   special features and operational characteristics of droop-controlled
   islanded microgrid systems. The proposed problem formulation considers
   the system reactive power requirements and the different possible load
   characteristics. The optimization problem is subject to different system
   operational constraints including; the power flow constraints, voltage
   and frequency regulation constraints and unit capacity constraints.
   Different numerical case studies have been carried out to test the
   effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel probabilistic load modeling approach is
   presented. The proposed approach starts by grouping the 24 data points
   representing the hourly loading of each day in one data segment. The
   resulting 365 data segments representing the whole year loading profile
   are evaluated for similarities using principle component analysis; then
   segments with similar principal components are grouped together into one
   cluster using clustering algorithms. For each cluster a representative
   segment is selected and its probability of occurrence is computed.
   The results of the proposed algorithm can be used in different studies
   to model the long term behavior of electrical loads taking into account
   their temporal variations. This feature is possible as the selected
   representative segments cover the whole year. The designated
   representative segments are assigned probabilistic indices that
   correspond to their frequency of occurrence, thus preserving the
   stochastic nature of electrical loads.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, wind turbine generation does not participate in frequency
   regulation services in power systems. With increasing penetration of
   wind energy, system operators are demanding more and more participation
   of wind turbines in the ancillary services especially in frequency
   regulation provisions. Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), with
   their ability to deliver power with different mechanical speed, and the
   ability to instantly reduce speed, and release the stored mechanical
   energy is able to support conventional generators in regulating system
   frequency. This helps reduce the frequency dip efficiently when the DFIG
   controller is optimally tuned. This paper examines the role of DFIGs, in
   frequency regulation and control with different levels of wind
   penetration into the system. A dynamic model of the power system with
   conventional generator and DFIG-based wind turbines in single area
   frequency control is developed, and a parameter optimization method is
   used to tune the controllers of the DFIG so as to improve the dynamic
   response of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns were raised due to the recent demand increase for
   energy which resulted in higher CO2 emissions. Hence, it became
   essential to research a different energy source to meet the increasing
   demand. Since Photovoltaics (PV) were found to be a promising source,
   the governments started to support grid connected PV projects. However,
   grid connected PV systems cause many stability issues. Therefore,
   controlling methods must be implemented. Several control techniques have
   been proposed for grid connected applications in the last few decades.
   The controllers attempt to achieve stability, low harmonic content and
   fast dynamic response. However, tradeoffs are usually required. In order
   to understand the potential developments in this field, the paper will
   present three different current control strategies used in grid
   connected systems, compare them and recommend the usage of the most
   suitable. This was achieved by developing a MATLAB/Simulink model of a
   photovoltaic grid connected system in order to simulate case studies
   that tests Voltage Oriented Current Control (VOC), Direct Power Control
   (DPC), and PQ Synchronous Control (PQSC) topologies under different
   scenarios. The model configuration used ensures realistic simulation
   conditions in order to study the controllers thoroughly. Case studies
   are simulated in order to investigate the three controllers' stability
   and dynamic response under variable irradiance, Single Line to Ground
   (SLG) fault and three phase fault. Such case studies results can act as
   benchmarks that can be used by other researchers to compare their
   controller's performance against a standard system and check for
   improvements.}},

   The solar PV module is modeled as a constant PQ generation source and

   the PV module and examines feeder operation from the perspective of the
   Local Distribution Company (LDC). Objective functions such as
   minimization of total energy drawn from the substation and minimization
   of total losses are considered. A realistic feeder system of Hydro One
   Inc. is used for the studies for various penetration levels of PV

   the substation is reduced with increased penetration of solar PV

Abstract = {{Path following controllers make the output of a control system approach

   This paper implements a path following controller, based on transverse
   feedback linearization (TFL), which guarantees invariance of the path to
   be followed. The coordinate and feedback transformation employed allows
   one to easily design control laws to generate arbitrary desired motions
   on the path for the closed-loop system. The approach is applied to an
   uncertain and simplified model of a robot manipulator for which none of
   the dynamic parameters are measured. The controller is made robust to
   modelling uncertainties using Lyapunov redesign. The robustified
   controller is tested on a 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) manipulator with a
   combination of revolute and linear actuated links. The experimental
   results show a substantial improvement when using the robust controller
   for path following versus standard state feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Better than worst-case (BWC) design is an design emerging paradigm in
   which the conservative frequency guard-bands used in conventional
   designs are removed at the expense of introducing a a non-zero (but
   small) error probability. A fundamental challenge in the design of
   better-than-worst-case circuits is to devise scalable and accurate
   techniques for error-probability estimation - in this paper we present a
   new solution to address this challenge using the concept of tagged
   probabilistic simulations (TPS), which were first introduced in the
   context of dynamic power estimation. We show that TPS can, in comparison
   to the existing state-of-the-art, (a) provide consistent speed-up over
   error probability estimation using timing simulations; and (b)
   simultaneously provide estimates of both dynamic power dissipation and
   error probability. To illustrate the benefits of TPS based error
   probability estimation, we propose two power optimization techniques: a)
   a gate-level dual-VDD assignment tool b) a gate-sizing technique which
   optimize the cells used in a design for a certain error and power
   constraints}},

Abstract = {{Software engineering processes are often challenged by overlooked tasks
   and misguided decisions that are simple but yet essential for the
   success of the system to be developed. A list of guidelines and steps is
   required to help facilitate software development processes by
   efficiently guiding engineers and managers at different stages of
   software development. Moreover, the ensuring of the execution of
   required tasks is essential to reduce the likelihood of the system
   failure. In other critical areas such as medical surgery or aerospace
   control, the use of checklists has proven as a successful practice to
   ensure the effective and efficient execution of the tasks in a process.
   Although several of the current practices in software development
   include using some art of checklists to monitor the software development
   processes, there are no unified and integrated checklists from research
   and industry resulting in significant disparities. Such ambiguity could
   be even counter-productive instead of easing the software development
   processes. In order to fill this gap, we developed comprehensive and
   integrated software engineering checklists for the critical areas of
   requirements engineering and software project management. To create such
   comprehensive checklists and ensure their completeness, we applied the
   systematic literature review method. We analyzed 323 documents from
   academia and industry, and identified a total of 183 requirements
   engineering checklist items and 263 project management checklist items.}},

Abstract = {{In real-world visual communications, it is a common experience that
   end-users receive video with significantly time-varying quality due to
   the variations in video content/complexity, codec configuration, and
   network conditions. How human visual quality-of-experience (QoE) changes
   with such time-varying video quality is not yet well-understood. To
   investigate this issue, we conduct subjective experiments designed to
   examine the quality predictability between individual video segment of
   relatively constant quality and combined video consisting of multiple
   segments that have significantly different quality. Our data analysis
   suggests that simple models that pool segment-level quality, such as
   linear averaging and weighted-averaging, nonlinear min-and
   median-filtering, and distortion-weighted averaging, are limited in
   predicting the overall human quality assessment of the combined video.
   We thus propose a quality adaptation model that is asymmetrically tuned
   to increasing and decreasing quality. The proposed asymmetric adaptation
   (AA) model leads to improved performance of both subjective and
   objective quality assessment approaches when using segment-level quality
   scores to predict multi-segment time-varying video quality. The video
   database together with the subjective data will be made available to the
   public.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the influence of nanosilica on friction and sound
   absorption responses of concrete for application in rigid pavements. The
   paper also discusses the feasibility of applying nano-lotus leaf as a
   coating for concrete material. Previous research on friction and sound
   absorption characteristics of concrete pavement primarily emphasized
   creating different surface textures through macrotexture modifications.
   The microstructure can also have a significant effect on surface
   texture, friction, and sound absorption characteristics of concrete.
   This research studied the friction and sound absorption properties of
   concrete on the basis of microtexture modification that used
   nanomaterials such as nanosilica and nano-lotus leaf. Several laboratory
   concretes were produced by using different proportions of nanosilica,
   which partially replaced cement by weight. The fresh concretes were
   tested for workability, wet density, and air content. The hardened
   concretes were tested for compressive strength, friction, and sound
   absorption. The British pendulum test was used to determine the friction
   number. An impedance tube was used to determine the sound absorption
   coefficient. Preliminary results indicate that nanosilica can increase
   friction and sound absorption of concrete pavements. In addition, the
   results show that nano-lotus leaf can be applied as a coating on
   concrete material for rigid pavements to improve retention of their
   friction properties during the wet season.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to tackle theoretical modeling and dimension reduction,
   two fundamental issues in large scale image/video data processing,
   together, by proposing a transparent composite model (TCM) for
   transformed image/video data. Specifically, to handle the heavy tail
   phenomenon commonly seen in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients
   of image/video data, a TCM first separates the tail of a sequence of DCT
   coefficients from the main body of the sequence. Then, a parametric
   distribution is used to model the main body while a uniform distribution
   is used to model the tail. Efficient online algorithms for establishing
   a TCM are proposed and proved to converge exponentially fast, which
   suits large-scale image/video data processing. It is also demonstrated
   that a TCM has an inherent non-linear data reduction capability-DCT
   coefficients of an image in the heavy tail identified by a TCM reveal
   some unique global features of the image while being insignificant
   statistically. This, together with its fast convergence, makes the
   proposed model a desirable choice for modeling DCT coefficients in
   large-scale image/video applications, such as online quantization
   design, entropy coding design, and image/video analytics in Big Data.}},

   the effect of the local distribution company (LDC) savings on the
   battery size is examined, and second the optimal size of the battery is
   determined by solving a comprehensive optimization problem. The proposed
   model seeks to maximize the savings of the LDC accrued from BESS
   operation, i.e., maximize the difference of discharging and charging

   challenges and opportunities for the implementation and trading of
   unidirectional Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). Most literature suggests to
   directly apply the DR strategies required to manage the EV service, but
   there still is a need to clearly identify the aggregator and its
   position in DR and V2G trading. This paper presents a systemization of
   the EV aggregator (EVA) as the actual mediator between DSO and EV
   customer (EVC) within the DR process. New definitions allow building up
   a novel approach for the design of EV service processes and possible

Abstract = {{A novel CPW based phase shifter that relies on automatic collapse of
   capacitive switches is designed, fabricated and tested. The novel design
   of the phase shifter is due to a novel CPW topology and automatic
   collapse mechanical design that is designed to operate at several and
   gradual collapse voltages. The novelty of the CPW has been achieved
   through the corrugated grounds to create a slow wave transmission line.
   The resulted compact CPW will have an effective electrical length that
   is physically equivalent to a relatively longer conventional CPW. The
   automatic collapse of the designed capacitive switches comes through
   deferent lengths of the beams that are carrying those capacitive
   switches. The worst measured insertion loss and return loss are 1.7 dB
   and 13 dB, respectively, at 30 GHz with a phase shift of almost 106
   degrees. The phase shifter is built on alumina substrate of gold

Abstract = {{Radar absorbing surfaces with excellent 100\% bandwidth have been made
   possible lately with square loops of resistive strip. However, a setup
   with such absorbing surface may still need an extra antenna to maintain
   outside communication and this could be cumbersome. If such broadband
   absorbing surface is made of an array of actual antennas, and one or a
   few of them can be tapped for outside communication when needed, then
   the extra antenna is not needed. This paper shows that indeed an array
   of folded-dipoles, forming square loops, can be designed for such
   purpose and bandwidth through optimization. The optimization is actually
   quite simple, by manual manipulations of the impedance locus in Smith

Abstract = {{A novel CPW based phase shifter that relies on automatic collapse of
   capacitive switches is designed, fabricated and tested. The novel design
   of the phase shifter is due to a novel CPW topology and automatic
   collapse mechanical design that is designed to operate at several and
   gradual collapse voltages. The novelty of the CPW has been achieved
   through the corrugated grounds to create a slow wave transmission line.
   The resulted compact CPW will have an effective electrical length that
   is physically equivalent to a relatively longer conventional CPW. The
   automatic collapse of the designed capacitive switches comes through
   deferent lengths of the beams that are carrying those capacitive
   switches. The worst measured insertion loss and return loss are 1.7 dB
   and 13 dB, respectively, at 30 GHz with a phase shift of almost 106
   degrees. The phase shifter is built on alumina substrate of gold
   material using UWMEMS process.}},

Abstract = {{In the present investigation, the authors propose a variable fidelity
   optimisation framework for component sizing of a plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicle (PHEV) powertrain. The proposed computational framework can be
   divided into two different stages. At the first stage, finite element
   grids of different resolutions are used to capture initial information
   regarding the behaviour of physical system. To generate those grids,
   maximum power of electric motor (PEM-max) and maximum power of
   combustion engine (PCE-max) are fed to a specialised physical model.
   Based on a cumbersome computational procedure, the physical model yields
   fuel consumption (FC) required for a predefined drive cycle. Having such
   information available, the authors take the advantages of an efficient
   design of experiment (DoE) scheme to extract some samples from the
   generated grids. Thereafter, two surrogate techniques, i. e., respond
   surface method (RSM) and radial basis function (RBF), are used to
   approximate the general behaviour of both high fidelity and low fidelity
   models. At the second stage, the developed surrogate models are used for
   optimisation. To do so, a recent spotlighted memetic algorithm called
   scale factor local search differential evolution (SFLSDE) is used.
   Through a throughout comparative analysis, the authors prove the
   proposed model is really effective for PHEV optimisation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of heart sound (HS) extraction in
   different types of single-channel respiratory sound (RS) signals by
   proposing a multiscale mean shift localization approach. First, the
   incoming respiratory signal (RS) are identified into linear/nonlinear
   portions by using third-order cumulant. Second, the identified linear
   and nonlinear portions are processed separately to tackle the large
   variations in the signal characteristics of adventitious sounds. The
   time-varying mean-shifts of the weighted log likelihood ratios of
   wavelet features are then calculated to capture the signal dynamics of
   various noisy RS signals. The proposed approach provides promising
   results giving an overall false localization rate as low as (1.8 +/-
   1.8)\% for normal lung sound (LS) and (0.1 +/- 1.7)\% for adventitious
   sound signals. Therefore, the presented approach successfully attempts
   to solve the key clinical challenges faced by the existing localization
   methods in terms of respiratory ailments.}},

Abstract = {{A new multi-stage approach based on component extraction is proposed to
   more efficiently address the sparse representation problem. In each
   stage a pre-set number of coefficients are chosen for reconstructing
   each signal component. A global search is performed to extract a lower
   dimensional sub-dictionary consisting of a sorted set of candidate atoms
   to represent the signal component, corresponding to the stage. The best
   representing atoms are then selected from the sub dictionary using the
   Matching Pursuit (MP) method. Afterwards, the sparse coefficients are
   updated in the same manner in which the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
   (OMP) operates. The proposed method is more efficient that the
   conventional OMP methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method, it is compared to OMP and Stagewise OMP (StOMP), which are
   conceptually the most similar to the proposed approach. The results
   illustrate the proposed method is more time efficient than OMP and more
   robust and sparser than the StOMP.}},

Abstract = {{Tone mapping operators (TMOs) that convert high dynamic range (HDR)
   images to standard low dynamic range (LDR) images are highly desirable
   for the visualization of these images on standard displays. Although
   many existing TMOs produce visually appealing images, it is until
   recently validated objective measures that can assess their quality have
   been proposed. Without such objective measures, the design of
   traditional TMOs can only be based on intuitive ideas, lacking clear
   goals for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a substantially
   different tone mapping approach, where instead of explicitly designing a
   new computational structure for TMO, we search in the space of images to
   find better quality images in terms of a recent objective measure that
   can assess the structural fidelity between two images of different
   dynamic ranges. Specifically, starting from any initial image, the
   proposed algorithm moves the image along the gradient ascent direction
   and stops until it converges to a maximal point. Our experiments show
   that the proposed algorithm reliably produces better quality images upon
   a number of state-of-the-art TMOs.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity grids are transforming as renewables proliferate, yet
   operational concerns due to fluctuations in renewables sources could
   limit the ultimate potential for high penetrations of renewables. In
   this paper, we compare three electricity grids - California, Germany,
   and Ontario - studying the effects of relative cost of solar and wind
   generation on the selection of the renewables mix, and examine the
   resulting excess generation. We then observe the effects of the
   renewables mix and the use of baseload energy generation on the limits
   to renewables penetration, quantifying what proportion of delivered
   energy can be provided by renewables. Our study shows that the optimal
   renewables mix, from the perspective of minimizing total cost of
   generation, is highly dependent on the relative costs of technology, and
   that above a certain penetration rate, different for each grid, the
   optimal mix must contain both solar and wind generation.}},

Abstract = {{Todays users extensively download video files on their wireless handheld
   devices, namely, smartphones and tablet computers, which are inherently
   power constrained. The batteries on those devices barely last for 2-3
   hours while downloading and playing video files. Experiments have shown
   that video downloads account for a large portion of the total energy
   cost of downloading and playing video files. In this paper, we present a
   novel, energy-efficient, purely client-centric video downloading
   algorithm with three tunable parameters: buffer size, low water mark,
   and socket-reading size. By means of implementation of the algorithm on
   a smartphone and measurements of the actual energy cost of downloading
   video files, we show the impacts of the three parameters on the energy
   cost of video downloads. By tuning the buffer size, low water mark, and
   socket-reading, we observed energy savings of 60\%, 64\%, and 63\%,
   respectively. Armed with the insights into the process of video
   downloading, mobile app designers will be better positioned to fine tune
   their apps to reduce the energy cost of downloading large files in
   general.}},

Abstract = {{Femtocell networks are being deployed in homes and offices to extend the
   services of cellular networks in indoor network environment. In this
   paper we propose a cognitive radio based autonomous femtocell network
   architecture that shares the radio spectrum of a 4G macrocell network.
   The proposed femtocell architecture uses an overlay access mechanism
   under the presumption of a hierarchical access scenario where femtocell
   users are secondary users to the shared spectrum. A media access control
   protocol is proposed for this femtocell network architecture which
   exploits the time division duplex operation of the uplink and downlink
   transmissions in macrocell. The performance of the media access control
   protocol in terms of the available number of frames and the throughput
   performance of the femtocell network is presented to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed femtocell network architecture.}},

Title = {{Structural Behavior of Shear-Critical RC Slender Beams with Corroded
   Properly Anchored Longitudinal Steel Reinforcement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{12}},
Abstract = {{The effect of corrosion of properly anchored longitudinal reinforcement
   on the structural behavior of shear-critical RC slender beams was
   experimentally investigated. A total of 10 medium-scale reinforced
   concrete beams were constructed. The beams measured 150mm wide, 350mm
   deep, and 2,400mm in length. The test variables included corrosion
   levels (0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5\%), existence of stirrups, and
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) repair. Eight beams were subjected to
   artificial corrosion and two beams acted as control uncorroded beams.
   Following the corrosion phase, all beams were tested to failure in
   three-point bending. The test results revealed that corrosion of
   properly anchored longitudinal steel reinforcement does not have any
   adverse effect on the behavior of shear-critical RC slender beams.
   Corrosion changed the load transfer mechanism to a pure arch action and
   as a result the load-carrying capacity of the beam was improved. A
   simple analysis procedure was proposed to predict the failure load of
   such beams and the predicted results correlated very well with the
   experimental results. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of graphene, many efforts have been done to modify
   the graphene structure for integrating this novel material to
   nanoelectronics, fuel cells, energy storage devices and in many other
   applications. This leads to the production of different types of
   graphene-based materials, which possess properties different from those
   of pure graphene. Porous graphene is an example of this type of
   materials. It can be considered as a graphene sheet with some
   holes/pores within the atomic plane. Due to its spongy structure, porous
   graphene can have potential applications as membranes for molecular
   sieving, energy storage components and in nanoelectronics. In this
   review, we present the recent progress in the synthesis of porous
   graphene. The properties and the potential applications of this new

Abstract = {{This paper presents guidelines for using recycled-concrete aggregate
   (RCA) as a full or partial replacement for natural coarse aggregate in
   new concrete (RCA concrete). Several international standards and
   guidelines for the use of RCA in concrete are reviewed and contrasted to
   identify areas in which further development is required. The main
   results of an extensive experimental research program by the authors are
   summarized here to provide a basis for the development of a framework
   for using RCA in structural concrete. Several RCA performance classes
   are proposed, each with a specific set of requirements and suitable
   applications. The proposed performance classes define further
   requirements and guidance for the use of RCA beyond the requirements of
   Canadian Standards Association A23.1 and ASTM C33. The authors propose a
   detailed decision tree to allow engineers, concrete producers, aggregate
   suppliers, and contractors to assess whether a particular RCA source is
   suitable for use in reinforced concrete or plain concrete or as fill

Title = {{Evaluating the Performance of Algorithms for the Detection of Travel
   Time Outliers}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2338}},
Pages = {{67-77}},
Abstract = {{Several technologies including automatic license plate readers, cell
   phone probes, dedicated Global Positioning System probes, the automatic
   identification of vehicles equipped with transponders or toll tags, and
   Bluetooth detectors can acquire vehicle travel times. The travel times
   measured by all these technologies contain errors and biases. As a
   result, several filtering and outlier detection algorithms have been
   proposed to identify erroneous data and to exclude them from the
   analysis. However, it is difficult to assess the performance of an
   outlier detection algorithm in absolute terms or relative to any other
   algorithm through the use of field data because the true travel times
   are unknown. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify how well the
   algorithm can identify a given source of outliers. In this paper a
   framework is proposed for the evaluation of algorithms that detect
   travel time outliers. The framework can be customized to address the
   specific characteristics of any travel time sensor technology. However,
   in this paper the framework is demonstrated through its application to
   travel times acquired by Bluetooth detectors on arterial roadways. The
   framework is used to evaluate the performance characteristics of two
   outlier detection algorithms proposed by Dion and Rakha. The results
   show the performance characteristics of both algorithms for a wide range
   of operating conditions. One of the algorithms is shown to have an
   approximately 30\% likelihood of providing worse results than if no
   outlier detection algorithm is used. The other algorithm is shown to
   provide improvements under ahnost all conditions, with a relative
   improvement of up to 60\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on-going research progress towards the development of
   an innovative frequency modulation MEMS gyroscope. The microgyroscope
   design includes a cantilever beam with a proof mass at its free end
   coupled electrostatically with two fixed electrodes. The beam is
   designed with silicon nitride and a layer of electrode material (Au).
   The microgyroscope undergoes coupled flexural vibrations in two
   orthogonal directions when subjected to base rotation around the beam's
   longitudinal axis. The rotation rate is measured by detecting the shift
   in the frequencies of the two closely spaced global vibration modes. A
   modeling framework is presented here for the development of the
   microgyroscope's frequency equation. The governing equations are derived
   using the Extended Hamilton's Principle and solved numerically to
   incorporate the nonlinear behavior. Currently, the device is in the
   process of fabrication using Silicon on Insulator (SOI) wafer using a
   micromachining process, including Deep Reactive Ion Etching.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we study the growth mechanisms of InGaN in plasma-assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE). We investigate growth of InGaN layers on
   vicinal GaN (0001) substrates. Indium incorporation as a function of
   gallium and nitrogen fluxes was examined. We propose microscopic model
   of InGaN growth by PAMBE postulating different indium adatom
   incorporation mechanisms on two nonequivalent atomic step edges of
   wurtzite crystal. The different roles of gallium and nitrogen fluxes
   during the growth of InGaN layers is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present recent progress in the growth of nitride based laser diodes
   (LDs) made by Plasma Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE). In this
   work we demonstrate LDs grown by PAMBE operating in the range 450-460
   nm. The LDs were grown on c-plane bulk GaN substrates with threading
   dislocation density (TDD) ranging from 10(3) cm(-2) to 10(4) cm(-2.) The
   low TDD allowed us to fabricate cw LDs with the lifetime exceeding 2000
   h at 10 mW of optical output power. The maximum output power for 3 LDs
   array in cw mode was 280 mW and 1W in pulse mode. The low temperature
   growth mode in PAMBE allow for growth of AlGaN-free LDs with high In
   content InGaN waveguides. The key element to achieve lasing wavelengths
   above 450 nm was the substantial increase of the nitrogen flux available
   during the growth by PAMBE.}},
