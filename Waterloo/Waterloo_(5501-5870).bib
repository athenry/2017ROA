Abstract = {{Surface reconstruction from measurements of spatial gradient is an
   important computer vision problem with applications in photometric
   stereo and shape-from-shading. In the case of morphologically complex
   surfaces observed in the presence of shadowing and transparency
   artifacts, a relatively large number of gradient measurements may be
   required for accurate surface reconstruction. Consequently, due to
   hardware limitations of image acquisition devices, situations are
   possible in which the available sampling density might not be
   sufficiently high to allow for recovery of essential surface details. In
   this paper, the above problem is resolved by means of derivative
   compressed sensing (DCS). DCS can be viewed as a modification of the
   classical compressed sensing (CS), which is particularly suited for
   reconstructions involving image/surface gradients. We demonstrate that
   using DCS results in substantial data savings as compared to the
   standard (dense) sampling, while producing estimates of higher accuracy
   and smaller variability, as compared to CS-base estimates. The results
   of this study are further supported by a series of numerical
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{There has been an increasing number of image super-resolution (SR)
   algorithms proposed recently to create images with higher spatial
   resolution from low-resolution (LR) images. Nevertheless, how to
   evaluate the performance of such SR and interpolation algorithms remains
   an open problem. Subjective assessment methods are useful and reliable,
   but are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to be embedded into the
   design and optimization procedures of SR and interpolation algorithms.
   Here we make one of the first attempts to develop an objective quality
   assessment method of a given resolution-enhanced image using the
   available LR image as a reference. Our algorithm follows the philosophy
   behind the natural scene statistics (NSS) approach. Specifically, we
   build statistical models of frequency energy falloff and spatial
   continuity based on high quality natural images and use the departures
   from such models to quantify image quality degradations. Subjective
   experiments have been carried out that verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Two major challenges faced in active contours are poor capture range and
   high sensitivity towards noise. Recently, the concept of tensor vector
   convolution (TVF) was introduced and shown to be promising in handling
   these challenges. However, in the presence of high noise levels, TVF may
   have difficulty in converging to the desired object boundary,
   particularly if the distance is great between the initial contour and
   the object boundary. To tackle this challenge, the concept of a
   multi-scale tensor vector field (MTVF) active contour is introduced to
   further reduce noise sensitivity. Comparing the performance of MTVF with
   multi-scale gradient vector field and multi-scale vector field
   convolution demonstrates that MTVF is more resilient to high noise
   levels as well as significantly reducing computation time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the TCP's congestion control mechanism
   effectiveness for smart meters. We show that the classic congestion
   control causes a high loss rate for metered data and disrupts competing
   traffic flows in a shared network.
   The paper introduces the performance analysis of our proposed Split- and
   Aggregated-TCP (SA-TCP). SA-TCP complies with industrial bodies'
   directions (e.g., by Hydro One Networks Inc., Canada) in terms of the
   architecture, specifically the deployment of hardware devices called
   Regional Collectors (RC). We argue that RCs can function as transport
   layer aggregation devices rather than routing devices. This modification
   reduces packet loss rate and improves throughput for Smart Metering
   Infrastructure (SMI) traffic.
   Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the smart metering
   communication network running SA-TCP in terms of throughput, loss rate
   and latency. Our analysis is validated by extensive NS-2 simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports quantitative answers to two questions regarding the
   limit cycle behavior arising from the servo mechanisms with stiction
   under the positional PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. The
   first question is, how large the magnitude of the limit cycle is for a
   given value of stiction force. The second one is how we should modify
   the PID controller to avoid this limit cycle with minimal degradation in
   the serve performance. The main approach is based on understanding key
   algebraic properties of the state trajectory. As a result, a simple
   bisection algorithm has been devised to compute the exact magnitude of
   the periodic solution for a given value of stiction. A direct extension
   of this algorithm enables us to find the minimum value of the integrator
   leakage to avoid the limit cycle. A numerical example demonstrates the
   main results.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of prostate boundaries in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
   images plays a great role in early detection of prostate cancer. Due to
   the low signal to noise ratio and existence of the speckle noise in TRUS
   images, prostate image segmentation has proven to be an extremely
   difficult task. This paper introduces a new fully automatic model-based
   prostate boundary segmentation method based on normalized
   cross-correlation (NCC). Using lower and upper boundary representative
   patterns, a strip rotates around the center of the probe and emphasizes
   the prostate boundaries. Representative patterns are constructed from a
   dictionary learning method, referred to as iterative least squares
   dictionary learning algorithm (ILS-DLA). Affine transformation
   parameters transform the prostate model to a position that best fit on
   the emphasized boundaries. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is adopted
   to evaluate the accuracy of the automatic segmentation procedure.
   Successful experimental results and the average DSC value of 90.6\% and
   computational time of 3.08 seconds validate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A dataset with diverse training data is essence of the hand gesture
   recognition research. Most of the benchmarked datasets are limited in
   the number of signers and/or the number of each gesture try, which often
   result in over-fitting and poor generalization. Overcoming this
   challenge is often achieved by collecting a large number of exemplars
   for each hand gesture. This process is either expensive or impractical.
   Recently, synthetic data generation methods have been presented as a
   more reliable way to extend and enrich datasets. This paper proposes a
   comparative study of statistical and visual synthetic data generation.
   The visual synthetic data generation is executed by building synthetic
   3D animated models using human figure design software. The experiments
   illustrate how the recognition accuracy will be changed when both
   methods used in enlarging the training data. The results show that in
   both cases recognition accuracy is enhanced, and in most cases, the
   visual synthetic data enlargement provides better improvement in the
   quality and diversity of the training data.}},

Abstract = {{The nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are performed
   to calculation the cross drag over a nanotube located in a uniform
   liquid argon flow. As is known, the behavior of fluid flows in
   nano-scale sizes is very different from that in microscopic and
   macroscopic sizes. In this work, our concern is on the flow of argon
   molecules over a nanotube which occurs in nanoscale sizes. We calculate
   the cross drag enforced the nanotube at Re <= 1.0. In this regard, we
   use the molecular dynamics and simulate the flow of argon molecules over
   (6,0), (8,0) and (10,0) nanotubes. The simulations are performed at
   different velocities and the cross drag coefficient is computed at
   different Reynolds numbers. To improve the efficiency of simulations, we
   use USHER algorithm and examin the insertion of molecules at the end of
   the simulation box, the argon molecules are located out of box. Using
   the power trend line, we derived a formula, which approximates the cross
   drag of chosen nanotube. In all simulations, only the first two and the
   last two rings of the nanotube are frozen. All non-bonded interactions
   are calculated based on the Leonard-Jones potential. The results if
   molecular dynamics are compared with two empirical expressions provided
   by experiments performed on the flow over a macro-scale cylinder. The
   results show that the cross drag force on a single-walled nanotube
   calculated from MD simulations is larger than that provided by the
   empirical expressions in slow flows (Re<<1.0). As is expected the
   results of continuum flow calculations cannot be trusted to predict the
   drag of a nanotubes if Re<<1.0. The difference increases as the flow
   velocity decreases.}},

Abstract = {{Water molecules are one of the important molecules in nanofluidics. Its
   structure and its behavior can change with Temperature and cut-off
   distance parameters. In this study temperature and cut-off distance
   effects on the nano-scale water molecules behavior are investigated by
   molecular dynamics simulations. Many water molecular models have been
   developed in order to help discover the structure of water molecules. In
   this study, the flexible three centered (TIP3P-C) water potential is
   used to model the inter- and intramolecular interactions of the water
   molecules. In this simulation, we have been studied 512 water molecules
   with periodic boundary conditions and in a simulation box with 25
   angstrom dimensions, which gives water density about 0.99 g/cm3. To
   examine of accuracy of TIP3P-C model, Radial distribution function of
   remarkable water model has been compared with experimental data. In this
   paper, to study temperature effect on water behavior, mentioned system
   with 300, 450 and 600 K have been considered and compared. The results
   have showed that with decreasing temperature, the tetrahedrality of the
   distribution of the water molecules around the central water molecule is
   enhanced, and the hydrogen bonds become more linear. It is found that as
   the temperature rises, kinetic energy rises too, and it makes that the
   average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule decrease. In
   addition to temperature effects, cut-off radius parameter effects have
   been considered too, and four different cut-off radiuses 7.5, 9.0, 10.5,
   and 12.0 angstrom have been studied.}},

Abstract = {{Lab-on-a-chip devices are miniaturized bio-medical laboratories on a
   small glass/plastic plate. These lab chips can duplicate the specialized
   functions of their room-sized counterparts such as clinical diagnoses
   and tests. The key microfluidic functions required in various
   lab-on-a-chip devices include pumping and mixing liquids, controlling
   bio-reactions, dispensing samples and reagents, and separating molecules
   and cells/particles. Using electrolcinetic microfluidics to realize
   these functions can make the devices fully automatic, independent of
   external support (e.g., tubing, valves and pump), and truly portable.
   Understanding, modeling and controlling of various electrokinetic
   microfluidic phenomena and the electrokinetic microfluidic processes are
   essential to systematic design and operation control of the
   lab-on-a-chip systems. This presentation will explain the principles of
   these electrokinetic microfluidic processes and how they are used in

Abstract = {{A planar suspension system (PSS) has spring-damping struts in both the
   vertical and longitudinal directions so that the vibrations and shocks
   caused by road obstacles in any direction within the wheel plane can be
   effectively absorbed. Consequently, the ride comfort of a PSS vehicle
   can be improved considerably compared to a conventional vehicle. For a
   vehicle with such suspension systems, however, the wheels can move forth
   and back with respect to the chassis. The dynamic behaviors of a PSS
   vehicle under some special conditions, such as a split-mu turning
   combined with braking operation, may exhibit different characteristics.
   This paper presents the study of the transient response of a vehicle
   with PSS in such a case. The simulation results are also compared with
   those of a similar vehicle with conventional suspension under the same
   operational condition. The study demonstrates that the handling behavior
   of a PSS vehicle is generally comparable with, and in some conditions,
   even better than that of a conventional vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most commonly used microfluidic droplet generator designs is
   the T-junction as shown in Figure 1. In this design, the dispersed phase
   microchannel, usually containing an aqueous solution, perpendicularly
   intersects the main channel, which contains the continuous phase
   (oil).The T-junction design has been widely adopted because of its
   simplicity and the superior control it offers over droplet size. Two
   primary operational regimes have been identified where breakup is
   dominated by confinement of the emerging droplet within the
   microchannel, known as the squeezing regime (Ca<0.002), or by the
   balance of shear and surface tension forces known as the dripping regime
   (Ca>0.02). The operational mode of the Tjunction generator is primarily
   characterized by the Capillary number (Ca = mu U/gamma), which describes
   the competition between the aforementioned forces. In between the two
   regimes exists the transition regime where both confinement and shear
   forces are important.}},

   Learning System (SILS) has been developed for in-class activities in
   this course. The SILS system has two components: students' mobile
   devices and a front-end website in which the instructor has control to
   upload the demonstrations and quizzes and receive students' responses.
   The students are connected to the website through the WiFi connection.
   Findings of an initial survey, which was conducted at the start of the
   semester, revealed that majority of the students find the conventional

Abstract = {{The competing effects of physical aging and moisture absorption on the
   relaxation behaviour of a polycarbonate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene
   (PC/ABS) polymer blend have been investigated. Physical aging was
   simulated by thermal aging the blend at temperatures up to 80 degrees C
   which is below the glass transition temperature of ABS, i.e., the lower
   of the two components. Another set of samples was exposed to six
   different relative humidity and temperature combinations. Progressively
   aged samples in dry and hygrothermal aging conditions were then
   subjected to stress relaxation tests. Momentary master curves were
   developed by applying time/aging-time and time/moisture superposition
   principles for dry and hygrothermally aged specimens, respectively. The
   experimental data were also fitted with the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts
   (KWW) model to determine the initial modulus, relaxation time constant
   and shape parameter. Comparisons of the first two parameters between
   thermally aged and hygrothermally aged conditions suggest that physical
   aging processes dominate absorbed moisture effects in terms of
   influencing viscoleastic behaviour, especially when the aging
   temperature approaches 80 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{In the current literature on cognitive radio, it is commonly assumed
   that fixed time durations are assigned for spectrum sensing and data
   transmission. It is however possible to improve the performance by
   finding the best tradeoff between sensing time and network throughput.
   In this paper, we formulate the sensing-throughput problem to
   dynamically assign a number of SUs for cooperatively sensing each
   channel and calculate the optimal sensing time such as to maximize the
   total average throughput of SUs in the presence of interference with
   PUs. We propose a two-step optimization algorithm to optimize sensing
   time and the number of assigned SUs to each channel. Simulation results
   demonstrate that significant improvement in the throughput of SUs is
   achieved when the sensing time and the number of assigned SUs is jointly
   optimized.}},

   3D time-dependent numerical model is used to simulate the cladding

   the formed microstructures and temperature distributions across the

   conducted through the deposition of Fe-TiC on the substrate of AISI 1030

Abstract = {{Vibration control has always been of great interest for many researchers
   in different fields, especially mechanical and civil engineering. One of
   the key elements in control of vibration is damper. One way of optimally
   suppressing unwanted vibrations is to find the best locations of the
   dampers in the structure, such that the highest dampening effect is
   achieved.
   This paper proposes a new approach that turns the conventional discrete
   optimization problem of optimal damper placement to a continuous
   topology optimization. In fact, instead of considering a few dampers and
   run the discrete optimization problem to find their best locations, the
   whole structure is considered to be connected to infinite numbers of
   dampers and level set topology optimization will be performed to
   determine the optimal damping set, while certain number of dampers are
   used, and the minimum energy for the system is achieved. This method has
   a few major advantages over the conventional methods, and can handle
   damper placement problem for complicated structures (systems) more
   accurately. The results, obtained in this research are very promising
   and show the capability of this method in finding the best damper
   location is structures.}},

Abstract = {{Gas phase reaction effects in the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen on
   platinum-coated minichannels and microchannels are investigated
   numerically in planar geometry. The main objective of this work is to
   identify the relative importance of the gas phase and surface reactions
   under different operating conditions. A collocated finite-volume method
   is used to solve the governing equations. Detailed gas phase and surface
   reaction mechanisms along with a multi-component diffusion model are
   used. As the channel size is reduced, heat and radical losses to the
   walls can significantly alter the combustion behavior. While catalytic
   walls help in sustaining the gas phase reactions at very small length
   scales by reducing the heat losses to the walls owing to heat release
   associated with the surface reactions, they may inhibit homogeneous
   reactions by extracting radicals due to typically high absorption rates
   of such species at the walls. Thus, the radical chain mechanisms can be
   significantly altered by the presence of wall reactions, and the
   build-up of radical pools in the gas phase, which lead to homogeneous
   ignition, can be suppressed as a consequence. In the present study, the
   effects of two key parameters, i.e. channel height and the inlet mass
   flux on the interaction of gas phase and surface reactions will be
   explored. In each case, the limiting values beyond which the gas-phase
   reactions become relatively negligible compared to surface reactions
   will be identified for hydrogen/air mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the recent advances in microfabrication techniques, it is
   possible to produce microchannels with positive, negative, or even
   neutral surface charges. According to several numerical and experimental
   investigations, such a combination of charge patterns on the
   microchannel walls results in complex flow fields with circulation zones
   that are highly desirable for fluid mixing requirements as in
   lab-on-a-chip devices. In this paper, the mixing efficiency associated
   with electro-osmotic flows in heterogeneous microchannels is
   investigated. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved for the flow field
   along with species transport equations to obtain the concentration
   field. The effects of the Electric Double Layer (EDL) on the flow field
   are considered using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski model in which the EDL
   effects on the fluid adjacent to the walls are replaced by velocity slip
   at walls. Different configurations and profiles for the wall charges can
   be applied to the microchannel walls. In the present study,
   heterogeneous patterns consisting of different patches with constant
   zeta-potentials are considered. The flow pattern of a single patch
   consists of a single vortex attached to the channel wall, which
   significantly increases the mixing performance. It is expected that a
   combination of several patches would increase the mixing performance
   considerably. Therefore, the effects of the size, number, and locations
   of multiple patches on the mixing performance are investigated in
   detail. The results for a single patch indicate that the mixing
   efficiency increases with the size of the patch and its proximity to the
   microcharmel inlet. It is expected that with a suitable combination of
   patches, an optimized configuration can be found in which the mixing
   efficiency is maximized and the length of the mixing section is
   minimized The results can be applied to the design of micro-mixers to
   minimize their size while achieving the desired mixing requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Gaseous flow in circular and noncircular microchannels has been examined
   and a simple analytical model with second-order slip boundary conditions
   for normalized Poiseuille number is proposed. The model is applicable to
   arbitrary length scale. It extends previous studies to the transition
   regime by employing the second-order slip boundary conditions. The
   effects of the second-order slip boundary conditions are analyzed. As in
   slip and transition regimes, no solutions or graphical and tabulated
   data exist for most geometries, the developed simple model can be used
   to predict friction factor, mass flow rate, tangential momentum
   accommodation coefficient, pressure distribution of gaseous flow in
   noncircular microchannels by the research community for the practical
   engineering design of microchannels such as rectangular, trapezoidal,
   double-trapezoidal, triangular, rhombic, hexagonal, octagonal,
   elliptical, semielliptical, parabolic, circular sector, circular
   segment, annular sector, rectangular duct with unilateral elliptical or
   circular end, annular, and even comparatively complex doubly-connected
   microducts. The developed second-order models are preferable since the
   difficulty and ``investment{''} is negligible compared with the cost of
   alternative methods such as molecular simulations or solutions of
   Boltzmann equation. Navier-Stokes equations with second-order slip
   models can be used to predict quantities of engineering interest such as
   Poiseuille number, tangential momentum accommodation coefficient, mass
   flow rate, pressure distribution, and pressure drop beyond its typically
   acknowledged limit of application. The appropriate or effective
   second-order slip coefficients include the contribution of the Knudsen
   layers in order to capture the complete solution of the Boltzmann
   equation for the Poiseuille number, mass flow rate, and pressure
   distribution. It could be reasonable that various researchers proposed
   different second-order slip coefficients because the values are
   naturally different in different Knudsen number regimes. The transition
   regime is a varying mixture of different transport mechanisms and the
   mixed degree relies on the magnitude of the Knudsen number. It is
   analytically shown that the Knudsen's minimum can be predicted with the
   secondorder model and the Knudsen value of the occurrence of Knudsen's
   minimum depends on inlet and outlet pressure ratio. The compressibility
   and rarefaction effects on mass flow rate and the curvature of the
   pressure distribution by employing first-order and second-order slip
   flow models are analyzed and compared. The condition of linear pressure
   distribution is given. This paper demonstrates that with some relatively
   simple ideas from knowledge, observation, and intuition, one can predict
   some fairly complex flows.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{118-126}},
Abstract = {{Observational models based on reported crash history are the most common
   measures for identifying unsafe sites for priority intervention.
   Observational models are good for predicting higher-severity crashes but
   ignore higher-risk vehicle interactions (e.g., near misses) that failed
   to result in crashes that are reported in historical data. Proponents of
   microscopic simulation models argue that failure to recognize these
   higher-risk interactions can significantly understate the safety problem
   at a given site and lead to misallocation of scarce treatment funds.
   This paper takes the position that a complete understanding of the
   safety problem at a given site can emerge only if both crash potential
   and traffic conflicts are taken into account. A priority-ranking model
   that integrates estimates from observational crash prediction models
   into an analysis of traffic conflicts is presented. Traffic conflicts
   were based on simulated vehicle interactions and deceleration
   requirements for different traffic scenarios. The suitability of the
   approach for priority ranking of sites was assessed with six ranking
   approaches: crash frequency, empirical Bayes, potential for safety
   improvement, conflict frequency, conflict rate (sum and cross product of
   traffic volume), and integrated model. Priority ranking was evaluated
   with five test criteria: site consistency, method consistency, rank
   difference, total rank score, and sensitivity and specificity. These
   models were applied to a sample of 58 signalized intersections from
   Toronto, Ontario, Canada, for the period from 1999 to 2006. The
   integrated model was found to yield better results for the five
   evaluation criteria; this result suggests that the proposed approach has
   promise.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the leakage current signature in the DC inclined plane
   test is examined for statistical indicators of the incipient erosion of
   silicone rubber. The mean, skewness and kurtosis are examined as useful
   indicators of the dry-band arcing current causing erosion. The moving
   window method is employed during the test to obtain an enhanced
   resolution in time. Simultaneous thermogravimetric-differential scanning
   calorimetry analysis is used to predetermine the temperature at which
   erosion begins, and temperature measurements taken during the inclined
   plane test are correlated to the leakage current leading to erosion.
   During erosion, more stable discharges as well as a recognizable change
   in the statistical distribution of the dry-band arcing current is
   recognizable through the analysis employed.}},

   of highly filled nano and micro sized composites. The results of eroded
   mass in the laser ablation tests, and tracking voltage and tracking time
   in the inclined plane test clearly shows improvements of the electrospun

Abstract = {{This paper presents simulations of pollution and their effects on the
   electrical performance of cap-and-pin glass suspension insulators. The
   pollution is modeled by using a partially conductive epoxy resin with
   graphite powder. The effects of the pollution levels as well as their
   locations on the insulator surfaces are investigated for both simulation
   and experimental studies. The studies are conducted both for one
   suspension unit and a string of five insulators. The results show that
   at power frequency voltage, the reduction in the flashover voltage is
   about the same whether the upper surface or the bottom surface of the
   insulator is polluted. Moreover, the percentage reduction of a single
   unit is about the same as for a five unit string. At lightning impulse
   voltage, the insulator performance depends on the location of the
   pollution. Positive polarity impulse voltage is more critical than the
   negative polarity for the upper surface polluted case for one and the
   five unit string. For the bottom polluted case, negative polarity
   impulse voltage is more critical.}},

Abstract = {{Economic modeling of distributed generation (DG) systems has become an
   important area of research with the modern push towards greener and more
   sustainable electricity generation practices as any proposal without a
   solid business case is bound to flounder with the state of the global
   economy. This paper assessed the state-of-the-art in DG economic
   modeling and based on this developed a model to determine the economic
   suitability of DG projects in Ontario, Canada. This model was applied to
   the energy profile of the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario and it
   was found that using 2x 5MW biomass combined heat and power (CHP) DGs
   and selling electricity to the grid will save them \$2.56 million
   annually on energy costs. This paper recommends that further research is
   done in optimizing between local distribution companies (LDCs) and DG
   operator economic benefits of DGs, applying risk and uncertainty to
   economic modeling, analyzing the cost of biomass pellets in Ontario, and
   doing hour-by-hour modeling of the University of Guelph's energy usage

Abstract = {{In this paper, we will study the output-error-constrained tracking
   control problem of an electrostatic torsional micromirror beyond the

   a robust output regulation problem and it further boils down to a robust
   regulation problem with output-constrained by adaptive internal model
   design, :be solution of which would in turn lead to the solution of the
   original problem. Then we design a regulation controller for such a
   regulation problem by using the barrier Lyapunov function technique. Our
   adaptive control law ensures the electrostatic torsional micromirror
   with a enhanced tracking performance in the sense that the moveable
   micromirror can achieve the sinusoidal wave scanning of any frequency up
   to a full gap operation without contacts of the fixed bottom electrode,
   and furthermore, the estimated sinusoidal wave frequency converges to
   its real value.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing the pipeline depth of bit-parallel message-passing
   low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders can be done by increasing the
   number of simultaneously decoded frames, or by decreasing the amount of
   parallelism in the decoder. In digit-serial decoders, the pipeline depth
   can also be increased by increasing message precision.
   Digit-online decoders are a class of digit-serial decoders that use
   redundant notation to allow for most-significant-digit-first processing
   of LLR messages. This paper examines the effect of changing the
   precision of LLRs on the throughput, area and energy efficiency of
   digit-online decoders for the irregular WiMAX rate 3/4A length 1056
   block code. Both single-frame and frame-interlaced decoding are
   considered. Digit-online decoders have a throughput that is largely
   independent of message precision. Frame-interlaced decoding has a higher
   throughput than single-frame, but has an increased energy/bit cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an FPGA implementation of parallel-node
   low-density-parity-check convolutional-code encoder and decoder. A 2.4
   Gb/s rate-1/2 (3, 6) LDPC convolutional-code encoder and decoder were
   implemented on an Altera development and education board (DE4). Detailed
   power measurements of the FPGA board for various configurations of the
   design have been conducted to characterize the power consumption of the
   decoder module. For a E-b/N-o of 5 dB, the decoder with 9 processor
   cores (pipelined decoder iteration stages) has a bit-error-rate
   performance of 10(-10), and achieves an energy-per-coded-bit of 1.683
   nJ. The increase in E-b/N-o can effectively reduce the decoder power and
   energy-per-coded-bit for configurations with 5 or more processor cores
   for E-b/N-o < 5 dB. The incremental decoder power cost and incremental
   energy-per-coded-bit also hold a linearly decreasing trend for each
   additional processor core.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring trails (m-trails) have been extensively studied as an
   alternative to the conventional link-based monitoring approach by using
   multi-hop supervisory lightpaths in all-optical networks. However, none
   of the previous studies have investigated the effect of length
   constraints upon the m-trail formation, which nonetheless correspond to
   the failure localization time. This paper addresses the above issue and
   formulates a new m-trail allocation problem, where the relationship
   between the number of m-trails versus the maximum hop count is explored.
   First, the paper investigates the theoretical bounds of allocating
   m-trails with at most k hops via an optimal group testing construction.
   Secondly, a novel meta-heuristic approach based on bacterial
   evolutionary algorithm for solving the length-constrained m-trail
   allocation problem is introduced. Through extensive simulations the
   performance gap of the proposed algorithm to the lower bound is
   presented on a wide diversity of topologies.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in graphics processing unit (GPU) technology has
   invigorated an interest in using GPUs for accelerating the simulation of
   SystemC models. SystemC is extensively used for design space
   exploration, and early performance analysis of hardware systems.
   SystemC's reference implementation of the simulation kernel supports a
   single-threaded simulation kernel. However, modern computing platforms
   offer substantially more compute power by means of multiple central
   processing units, and multiple co-processors such as GPUs. This has
   peaked an interest in parallelizing SystemC simulations. Of these,
   several efforts focus on utilizing the massive parallelism offered by
   GPUs as an alternate computing platform. In this paper, we present a
   summary of these recent research efforts that propose using GPUs for
   accelerating SystemC simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The Qezelozan-Sefidrood Watershed is a transboundary watershed in Iran,
   shared by eight provinces. Recent development plans in the upstream
   provinces include several dams that are either under construction or at
   the study stage. Implementation of these plans will negatively impact
   the downstream provinces, which historically have had access to the
   river. The situation can be exacerbated by the expected climate change
   impacts on the basin. This study evaluates the possible impacts of
   upstream development plans and climate change on the natural flow of the
   Qezelozan-Sefidrood River and designs a reasonable mechanism for fair
   allocation of streamflow to the riparian parties. First, a watershed
   model is developed using the Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP)
   software. This model is run for current water allocation and various
   development and climate change scenarios. The results indicate that the
   downstream provinces have a high vulnerability to the expected climate
   and development changes in the basin. To reduce the potential tension,
   the study treats the problem as a ``bankruptcy problem{''} and applies
   the Adjusted Proportional rule to fairly allocate the available resource
   (water) to the creditors (conflict parties).}},

Abstract = {{A water diversion conflict in the Danjiangkou area, China, is
   systematically studied in order to obtain an understanding of its
   strategic impacts. To address the large population and uneven
   distribution of water storage in China, the South-North Water
   Distribution Project (SNWDP) is being constructed to transfer water from
   the Yangtze River Basin to the North China Plain where there is a severe
   water shortage. The implementation of this project may not only affect
   water usage in the Danjiangkou area, which is the largest headwater
   region in the central route of SNWDP, but also have environmental
   impacts, resulting in conflict between local communities and the
   government which initiated this project. To formally investigate this
   conflict, the methodology of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution
   (GMCR) is utilized. The equilibrium determined from a stability analysis
   indicates that the strategy used by the government benefits the
   residents, but neglects the environmental impacts. To understand these
   discrepancies, changes are made in the government's preferences to
   obtain an equilibrium which reflects the government's desire to achieve
   both economic equality and environmental sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{The negotiations between Brinco and Hydro-Quebec, which led to the
   exploitation of the hydropower potential of the Upper Churchill Falls,
   is analyzed within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution framework.
   Immediately after the agreement was signed, several rounds of conflicts
   arose between the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Province
   of Quebec. The equilibrium states of the negotiations are analyzed to
   understand the motivation and possible distinction for the evolved
   conflicts. The analysis shows strong motivation for the Province of
   Newfoundland and Labrador to renegotiate the terms of the contract to
   reach a better deal which may cause further conflicts. Analysis also
   suggests strategies and feasible circumstances in which the Province of
   Newfoundland and Labrador may be able to improve its situation.}},

Abstract = {{A new ranking approach based on Grey Systems Theory using PROMETHEE II
   (Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation II) is
   applied to a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. The
   objective is to rank alternative suggestions to decision makers for
   maintaining source water quantity and quality. The method uses grey sets
   to represent uncertain information in the PROMETHEE II method. An
   inherent advantage of this approach is its ability to comprehensively
   consider quantitative and qualitative factors, making reliable decisions
   in an environment of uncertainty and subjective information. In this
   case study, involving the evaluation of source water strategies in the
   Waterloo Region, located in Ontario, Canada, the linguistic values of
   alternatives are expressed as grey sets, which are used to aggregate the
   opinions of experts and stakeholders on the impacts of the strategies

Abstract = {{A methodology is developed to use the fuzzy truth values of preference
   statements for feasible states in an option prioritization technique in
   order to rank states within the framework of the Graph Model for
   Conflict Resolution. Option prioritization ranks states based on the
   truth values of preference statements, which are compositions of the
   decision makers' courses of actions joined by logical connectives,
   ordered lexicographically. Fuzzy truth values are represented as truth
   degrees; so they include binary truth values, ``true{''} and
   ``false{''}, as well as other possible truth intensities that are
   reasonable according to the specific circumstances. Consequently, the
   assumption of fuzzy truth values of preference statements provides more
   realistic preference ordering of feasible states. The methodology is
   applied to the Elmira groundwater contamination dispute, which took
   place in Elmira, Ontario, Canada, for eliciting the preferences of
   decision makers, to demonstrate the applicability of this technique.}},

Abstract = {{Digital signages are increasingly common for out-of-home advertising.
   Latest advancements in smartphones, wireless communication and displays
   make it possible to design smarter interactive signage systems for more
   effective advertising. Although existing research have started a trend
   of cyber-physical interactions, they are generally not scalable for
   multiple users and not intuitive to interact with. Smart Signage a
   ``draggable{''} cyber-physical broadcast/multicast (B/M) media system is
   therefore proposed here. With a novel cyber-physical B/M protocol that
   enables a display concurrently interacting with physical actions of
   multiple user smartphones, a large number of users can simultaneously
   acquire any running content on a display by simply using an intuitive
   ``dragging{''} hand gesture with their smartphones. Analytical
   formulations are derived to identify the key parameters and their
   dynamics in the system, which provide the condition for achieving the
   average response time of a user ``dragging{''} gesture within 1 second
   limit. Implementations are demonstrated for possible real-world
   deployments. Experiments with 30 primary students are conducted to prove
   the system offering scalable and intuitive interactions for the
   first-time users even when they are moving.}},

Abstract = {{Myopia is characterized by an increase in axial length of the eye, but
   the reasons for the axial elongation are still unknown. Higher
   intraocular pressure (IOP) has been associated with myopia and could be
   involved in eye enlargement. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the effect of intraocular pressure on the geometry of the
   chick eye and to investigate whether an increase in IOP could cause the
   elongation of the eye. The IOP of ten 7-day old chick eyes was raised by
   injecting fluid into the eyes and the resulting deformation of the eyes
   was measured using digital cameras. In-vitro pressure-volume curves were
   obtained. The axial and equatorial strains (deformation normalized to
   the original dimension) were calculated. Our results showed that IOP
   increased exponentially with increasing injected volume. About 25 D
   myopia could be induced by the axial elongation created with an increase
   in IOP by 100 mmHg. As pressure increased from 0 to 140 mmHg, the chick
   eye elongated in the axial direction and initially contracted in the
   equatorial direction. The natural tendency of chick eyes is to elongate
   as IOP increases and this suggests that from a mechanical perspective
   IOP could play a role in myopia onset and progression. The results also
   suggest that oblate eyes might have higher risk of developing myopia.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel path following controller for underactuated
   unmanned surface vessels (USVs) that is both provably stable and
   intuitive to tune. The approach consists of a navigation component that
   computes a desired heading angle to ensure the USV will arrive at the
   path, and a nonlinear controller to guarantee exponential tracking of
   surge velocity and heading. Additionally, ultimate boundedness of the
   unactuated sway velocity is proven. Simulation results are presented to
   show numerically that the controller works as expected in the ideal
   case. Outdoor experimental results are presented, using a GPS and
   compass as sensors, showing the practical feasibility of the approach in
   the presence of sensor noise, disturbances, and unmodeled dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, radio resource allocation for mobile terminals (MTs) in a

   existing solutions in literature, two types of services are considered
   in this paper, namely single-network and multi-homing services. In
   single-network services, an MT is assigned to the best available
   wireless network, while in multi-homing services an MT utilizes all
   available wireless access networks simultaneously. With the presence of
   both services in the heterogeneous wireless access medium, the radio
   resource allocation objective is of twofold: We aim to find the optimal
   assignment of MTs with single-network service to the available wireless
   access networks and to determine the corresponding optimal bandwidth
   allocation to the MTs with single-network and multi-homing services. The
   radio resource allocation problem is formulated to guarantee the service
   quality for both service types. Numerical results are presented to
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed radio resource allocation

   transformers' insulation condition. Other insulation diagnosis tests
   such as oil breakdown voltage (BDV), water content and

   test. In this paper, a prediction model is developed to correlate IR
   measurements of the power transformer with its oil quality parameters,
   the concentration of its total dissolved combustible gases (TDCG), and
   its carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide concentration (CO2/CO) ratio. Four
   models, based on feed-forward artificial neural networks with
   back-propagation, are trained on collected data of real measurements.
   Accuracy levels of 96\%, 84\%, 88\%, and 91\% are obtained for BDV,

Abstract = {{This paper studies the scheduling of power generation in a Microgrid
   (MG) that has a group of dispatchable and non-dispatchable generators.
   In order to maximize the benefits of the resources available in a MG, an
   optimal scheduling of the power generation is required. Renewable
   resources have an intermittent nature that causes uncertainties in the
   system. These added uncertainties must be taken into consideration when
   solving the generation scheduling problem in order to obtain reliable
   solutions. The operation of a MG in grid-connected mode and isolated
   mode is analyzed in this paper for different demand profiles. Two mixed
   integer linear programming (MILP) models for the day-ahead unit
   commitment problem in a MG are proposed. Each model corresponds to one
   mode of operation. Uncertainty handling techniques are integrated in
   both models. The models are solved using the General Algebraic Modeling
   System (GAMS). Two study cases are examined to study the operation of a
   MG, and to evaluate the effects of uncertainties on the day-ahead unit
   commitment problem.}},

Abstract = {{Around the world there are many rural areas need access to electricity,
   extend the transmission line is one option. However, the long distance
   between the nearest main grid and the rural system as well as the costs
   of transmission line expansion rapidly increasing makes grid extension
   difficult, costly and economically unviable. Therefore, using microgrid
   technology with renewable energy options to meet electricity demand in
   remote locations becomes more attractive. In this paper the break-even
   distance which makes electricity from microgrid cost effective over the
   one form main grid is calculated. Moreover, the Net Present Costs (NPC)
   of both providing electricity through the microgrid and the main grid
   are calculated and compared. Five different cases including a
   diesel-only, a fully renewable-based, a diesel-renewable mixed, a
   solar-only, and a wind-only microgrid configurations are designed, to
   compare and evaluate their economics with the main grid. The well known
   energy modeling software for hybrid renewable energy systems, HOMER is
   used in the studies reported in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{We present a compact wireless headset system for simultaneous multi-site
   neural recording and neurostimulation in the rodent brain. The system
   comprises flexible-shaft microelectrodes, neural amplifiers,
   neurostimulators, a digital time-division multiplexer (TDM), a
   micro-controller and a ZigBee wireless transceiver. The system is built
   by parallelizing up to four 0.35 mu m CMOS integrated circuits (each
   having 256 neural amplifiers and 64 neurostimulators) to provide a total
   maximum of 1024 neural amplifiers and 256 neurostimulators. Each bipolar
   neural amplifier features 54dB-72dB adjustable gain, 1Hz-5KHz adjustable
   bandwidth with an input-referred RMS noise of 7.99 mu V and dissipates
   12.9 mu W. Each current-mode bipolar neurostimulator generates arbitrary
   waveform programmable biphasic currents in the range of 20-250 mu A and
   dissipates 2.6 mu W in the stand-by mode. Reconfigurability is enabled
   by stacking a set of dedicated mini-PCBs that share a common signaling
   bus within as small as 22x30x15mm(3) volume. The system features
   flexible polyimide-based microelectrode array design that maximizes pad
   packing density. Electrodeposition pad nanotexturing reduces the
   electrode-tissue interface impedance from an average of 2M Omega to 30K
   Omega at 100Hz. The system has been validated in vivo in Sprague-Dawley
   rats.}},

Abstract = {{Downburst winds, which are a source of extreme wind loading and are
   referred to as high intensity wind (HIW) loads, have caused numerous
   transmission tower failures around the world. A previous investigation
   was conducted to study the performance of a transmission tower under
   downburst wind loading, where the behaviour of the tower was limited to
   a linear response. In the current study, a nonlinear frame element is
   used to assess the performance of the tower under downburst wind
   loading. The behaviour is studied using downburst wind field data
   obtained from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. In order to
   assess the geometric nonlinear behaviour of the tower, the results are
   compared to a previous linear analysis for a number of critical
   configurations of a downburst. The nonlinear analysis predicted that
   peak axial loads in certain members can be up to 34\% larger than those
   predicted by the linear analysis.}},

   Modifying the surface wettability of flow field channels in PEMFC can

   In the present work, an ex-situ investigation of the effects of channels
   with different surface wettability on the two phase-flow characteristics
   has been conducted. Horizontal graphite channel (slightly hydrophobic)
   and other four channels coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
   (hydrophobic), silica/Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (superhydrophobic),
   silica/PDMS at the bottom wall but with the side walls being raw
   graphite (combined surface wettability channel), and silica coated
   channel (superhydrophilic), are tested and visualized at room
   temperature and atmospheric pressure. Pressure drop measurements and
   two-phase flow visualization using high speed camera have been
   performed. Superhydrophobic channel has shown desirable positive effect
   on the two-phase flow and on the PEMFC's performance compared with the

Abstract = {{The dynamic performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is
   critically important, especially for automotive applications. In this
   study, the dynamic behavior of the local current density distribution
   inside PEMFC has been investigated experimentally by using the segmented
   flow field plate and printed circuit board (PCB) method. The effect of
   different values of air stoichiometry ratios on the dynamic
   characteristics of local current density has been tested. It has been
   found that the fluctuation of the local current density increases as the
   cell voltage is reduced, corresponding to the increase in the average
   cell current density or cell loading. Increasing the stoichiometry ratio
   of the cathode supply gas significantly reduces the fluctuations of the
   current density. The fluctuation is also lower near the flow inlet than
   near the flow exit. The phenomena observed are closely related to the
   water and reactant distributions and transports in the cell structure.}},

Abstract = {{The times and frequencies of inspection, maintenance and replacement in

   computer models are helpful but are inefficient because its complexity
   and the uncertainties in system characteristics and degradation rates.
   Probability distributions that are traditionally calculated through
   Monte Carlo Methods require thousands and thousands of time consuming
   lifetime simulations, rendering the creation of the cumulative
   distribution of time to failure onerous. The paper presents a novel
   methodology that 1) replaces the implicit mechanistic model with a
   simple explicit model, 2) transforms the dynamic, probabilistic, problem
   into a time invariant probability problem over each cycle-time, and 3),
   builds the cumulative distribution function (Cdf) as the summation of
   the incremental service-time failure probabilities over the planned
   service time. Error analysis suggests ways to predict and minimize
   errors. A Case Study of a servo-control mechanism shows how the new
   methodology builds a Cdf and yet provides controllable accuracy and a
   substantial time reduction when compared to Monte Carlo sampling with

Abstract = {{To enable a portable composite bridge, a shear connection between steel
   plate girders and precast concrete deck panels, which would allow these
   two components to be fastened and unfastened, proposed. In the system,
   points of shear connection would be spaced at 3 m on center along the
   length of the girder. Finite element analysis was employed to compare
   the performance of the proposed composite system to a conventional
   composite girder with ductile shear studs. A nonlinear analysis was
   performed, and the proposed composite system was seen to demonstrate a
   response comparable to that of a composite girder with conventional
   shear studs. The model was verified for its capability to capture the
   possible effects of flange buckling, web buckling, and lateral torsional
   buckling of the steel plate girder. It was then confirmed that these
   failure modes did not influence the performance of the proposed portable
   composite bridge system for the investigated bridge configuration. A
   parametric study also was performed: the effects of shear connection
   stiffness and spacing on the behavior of the composite girder were
   investigated. In general, the investigated variations of these
   parameters had a significant influence on the girder stiffness but only
   a limited impact on the ultimate strength.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability of road construction is one of the key factors affecting
   the global environment, economy, and future social development. Several
   research projects are currently under way to study different
   construction approaches, materials, and designs that can improve the
   sustainability of roads. Although perpetual pavement is characterized by
   higher construction costs compared with conventional flexible pavement
   designs, it requires less maintenance and less frequent rehabilitation
   if designed and constructed properly. Pavement design can conserve
   materials and energy used for maintenance over the pavement life cycle
   and reduce the noise and emissions that accompany maintenance
   activities. Highways are typically subjected to heavy truck loads, which
   results in rapid structural deterioration. Because of the importance of
   highway conditions, the structural capacity of highway pavements should
   be maintained to the highest standards to ensure safety and a high level
   of service. Perpetual pavement designs are capable of achieving high
   structural capacity and can resist deterioration with minimum surface
   treatment. The case study presented examines how perpetual pavement
   design is a feasible solution for sustainable roads. The construction of
   a test section on Highway 401 in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, is
   explained and analyzed. Three sections, representing conventional
   pavement design, perpetual design without rich bottom mix, and perpetual
   design with rich bottom mix, were constructed next to each other for a
   comparison of their performance with different sensors. Recycled asphalt
   pavement was used in all pavement layers in this project. The use of
   recycled materials enhanced the pavement mechanical characteristics and
   maximized the efficient use of resources.}},

Abstract = {{The significant role dust aerosols play in the earth's climate system
   and microbial nutrition cycles have lead to increased efforts of
   employing remote sensing to monitor their genesis, transport and
   deposition. This contribution extends earlier approaches of using
   Bayesian hierarchical models to extract dust activity from multispectral
   MSG-SEVIRI measurements by focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio with
   respect to post hoc motion analysis via optical flow. While interpreting
   also the latter in a completely Bayesian fashion, we show that our novel
   dust indication scheme reduces background noise and thereby renders the
   optical flow more decisive in terms of detecting even faint dust plumes.
   As a side effect of the indicators stability in case of dust absence, we
   point out the potential usage of its temporal variance to characterize
   dust at an early stage of the genesis and thus close to the
   corresponding source region.}},

Abstract = {{Finite amplitude stability due to process damping is an intermediate
   state between fully stable and fully unstable vibrations in machining.
   In this state, the amplitude of vibration increases and stabilizes at a
   certain magnitude before the tool disengages from the cut. In the
   literature, this phenomenon has been studied experimentally and by
   conducting numerical simulations in turning, but to the best of our
   knowledge, it has not been reported in milling. In this paper, the
   existence of this phenomenon in milling is investigated experimentally
   and numerically. In addition, an amplitude-dependent formulation of
   process damping is integrated into the Semi Discretization Method of
   computing stability lobes to determine the borders of finite amplitude
   stability region in milling. Both the experimental evidence and
   numerical simulations showed the finite amplitude stability to also
   occur in milling. Moreover, the accuracy of the presented Semi
   Discretization Method in the prediction of finite amplitude stability
   region is verified by the experimental results and numerical
   simulations. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection

Abstract = {{Traditional near infrared (NIR) imaging is realized by a two dimensional
   InGaAs photodetector (PD) array integrated with a Si readout integrated
   circuit active matrix. The integration between the two different
   semiconductor arrays seriously restrains the device size-scalability and
   leads to high manufacture cost. One alternative approach is to
   up-convert infrared photons to a shorter wavelength (e.g., 1 mu m or
   below) that can be effectively detected by a conventional Si detector.
   Herein, we report a highly simplified single-mesa (pixel-less) hybrid
   organic/inorganic up-conversion imaging device through the integration
   of a large area inorganic PD with an organic light emitting diode, which
   can up-convert a NIR scene to a visiblelight image. By combining the
   fabricated device with a commercially available camera, we demonstrate
   the first time pixel-less up-conversion NIR imaging with a spatial
   resolution of better than 6 mu m. This device has great potential for
   making low-cost, large-area and high resolution NIR cameras. (C) 2012

Title = {{Probabilistic Models to Evaluate Effectiveness of Steel Bridge Weld
   Fatigue Retrofitting by Peening}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2285}},
Pages = {{27-35}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate, with two probabilistic
   analytical models, the effectiveness of several alternative fatigue
   management strategies for steel bridge welds. The investigated
   strategies employed, in various combinations, magnetic particle
   inspection, gouging and rewelding, and postweld treatment by peening.
   The analytical models included a probabilistic strain-based fracture
   mechanics model and a Markov chain model. For comparing the results
   obtained with the two models, the fatigue life was divided into a small,
   fixed number of condition states based on crack depth, similar to those
   often used by bridge management systems to model deterioration due to
   other processes, such as corrosion and road surface wear. The
   probabilistic strain-based fracture mechanics model was verified first
   by comparison with design S-N curves and test data for untreated welds.
   Next, the verified model was used to determine the probability that
   untreated and treated welds would be in each condition state in a given
   year; the probabilities were then used to calibrate transition
   probabilities for a much simpler Markov chain fatigue model. Then both
   models were used to simulate a number of fatigue management strategies.
   From the results of these simulations, the performance of the different
   strategies was compared, and the accuracy of the simpler Markov chain
   fatigue model was evaluated. In general, peening was more effective if
   preceded by inspection of the weld. The Markov chain fatigue model did a
   reasonable job of predicting the general trends and relative
   effectiveness of the different investigated strategies.}},

   closed packed polycrystals have been simulated using crystal plasticity
   theories. The simulations have been carried out using a rate-dependent
   elastic-viscoplastic crystal plasticity constitutive models. Two models
   are considered in the analyses; a model based on the classical Taylor
   assumptions and a model based on crystal plasticity finite element
   method. The plastic deformation mechanisms accounted for in the models
   are the slip systems in the matrix (parent grain), extension twinning
   systems, and the slip systems inside the extension twinned regions. The
   parameters of the constitutive model have been calibrated using the
   experimental data. The calibrated model has then been used to predict
   the deformation of AM30 magnesium alloy in uniaxial tension and
   compression as well as in bending. For the bending strain path, the
   effects of texture on the strain accommodated by the deformation
   mechanisms and bending moment have been investigated. (C) 2012 Published

Title = {{Analytical Method for Estimating Delays to Vehicles Traversing
   Single-Lane Roundabouts as a Function of Vehicle and Pedestrian Volumes}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2312}},
Pages = {{56-66}},
Abstract = {{Modern roundabouts that have unsignalized pedestrian crossings typically
   provide right-of-way to pedestrians, and therefore vehicles entering or
   exiting the roundabout must yield to pedestrians. The requirement that
   vehicles seek gaps in the pedestrian stream results in four distinct
   sources of delay to vehicles traversing the roundabout. Existing
   analytical methods for estimating delays to vehicles entering
   roundabouts typically consider only one of these four sources and ignore
   the other three. This paper presents an analytical model for estimating
   delays to vehicles traversing a single-lane roundabout. The model is
   based on gap acceptance and queuing models and explicitly estimates
   delays for each of the four sources for each origin destination movement
   in the roundabout. The proposed model is evaluated for a typical
   single-lane roundabout by comparing the model estimates with estimates
   obtained from the VISSIM simulation model and the Highway Capacity
   Manual (HCM) method for a range of traffic and pedestrian volumes. The
   results of this evaluation demonstrate that the proposed model is
   superior to the HCM method and provides delay estimates that are
   comparable with those obtained from microsimulation modeling. Further
   research is recommended to validate the model results by using field
   data.}},

Pages = {{103-116}},
Abstract = {{Low pressure membranes can be effective in treating various types of
   water, but are subject to fouling. In this work, chemical coagulation
   was studied as a pretreatment to ultrafiltration (UF), with the goal of
   mitigating fouling while maintaining high permeate water quality. Alum
   and ferric chloride were evaluated, as well as two polyaluminum chloride
   (PACl) products of different basicities and compositions. A bench-scale
   hollow fiber UF unit was developed to study the treatment of raw and
   pretreated water from two southern Ontario drinking water sources. The
   four coagulants were compared at optimal dosages, as well as at lower
   dosages. The roles of mixing and pH conditions were also evaluated.
   Membrane fouling was evaluated by observing changes in trans-membrane
   pressure (TMP) over 3-day experiments. Under optimal dose conditions,
   all four coagulants were able to reduce the rate at which the membrane
   fouled to varying degrees for each water source. Total organic carbon
   (TOC) removal by the membrane was also enhanced with coagulation
   pretreatment as would be expected. Experiments conducted with low
   coagulant dosages displayed under-dosing and a subsequent increase in
   membrane fouling. Experiments conducted with modified raw water pH
   improved both membrane performance and TOC removal, while experiments
   with modified mixing intensities proved ineffective.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds in the aquatic
   environment has become well established, and their presence is of
   potential concern because they are designed to produce biological
   response in the target receptor, may bear intrinsic toxicity (e.g.

   management purposes, it is important to identify the major sources of
   pharmaceuticals in the environment. Healthcare facilities may be major
   sources of the discharges of these compounds into municipal sewers. In
   this study, we investigated the contributions to the wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP) influents from two hospitals and two long-term
   care homes of nine compounds. Twenty-four hour composite samples were
   collected over 5 consecutive days from the effluents of these
   facilities. The WWTPs receiving sewage from these facilities were also
   sampled on the same days to facilitate mass balance calculations. The
   results showed that the healthcare facilities contributed a greater

Abstract = {{Model Transformation is considered an important enabling factor for
   Model Driven Development. Transformations can be applied not only for
   the generation of new models from existing ones, but also for the
   consistent co-evolution of software artifacts that pertain to various
   phases of software lifecycle such as requirement models, design
   documents and source code. Furthermore, it is often common in practical
   scenarios to apply such transformations repeatedly and frequently; an
   activity that can take a significant amount of time and resources,
   especially when the affected models are complex and highly
   interdependent. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach for deriving
   incremental model transformations by the partial evaluation of original
   model transformation programs. Partial evaluation involves pre-computing
   parts of the transformation program based on known model dependencies
   and the type of the applied model change. Such pre-evaluation allows for
   significant reduction of transformation time in large and complex model
   repositories. To evaluate the approach, we have implemented QvtMix, a
   prototype partial evaluator for the Query, View and Transformation
   Operational Mappings (QVT-OM) language. The experiments indicate that
   the proposed technique can be used for significantly improving the
   performance of repetitive applications of model transformations.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of large-scale land disturbance by wildfire on a wide range
   of water and related ecological services are increasingly being
   recognized worldwide. This study explores the long-term impact (6-7
   years) of the 2003 Lost Creek wildfire on,particulate phosphorus forms
   (NAIP, AP, OP) of suspended river sediment at a large regional scale
   (554 km(2)) in the Crowsnest River basin, Alberta, Canada. While total P
   concentrations were similar among burned and unburned river sediments,
   the mean bioavailable NAIP fraction remained approximately 70\% greater
   and the organic P over 2-fold higher in sediments from five burned
   tributary watersheds compared to the reference site in the Crowsnest
   River study catchment. Because of the key role of phosphorus in
   regulating aquatic productivity in oligotrophic mountain rivers, these
   findings highlight the risk of a large scale and long-term legacy of
   wildfire in some mountain river systems.}},

Abstract = {{A novel algorithm for correcting illumination variation in
   dermatological photographs via a multi-stage modeling of the underlying
   illumination is proposed for the purpose of skin lesion analysis. First,
   an initial illumination estimate is obtained via a non-parametric
   modeling strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling. Next, a subset of
   pixels from the non-parametric estimate is used to determine a
   parametric estimate of the illumination based on a quadratic surface
   model. Using the parametric illumination estimate, the reflectance map
   is obtained and used to correct the photograph. The photographs
   corrected using the proposed algorithm are compared to uncorrected
   photographs and to a state-of-the-art correction algorithm.
   Qualitatively, a visual comparison is performed, while quantitatively,
   the coefficient of variation of skin pixel intensities is calculated and
   the precision-recall curve for segmentation of skin lesions is graphed.
   Results show that the proposed algorithm has a lower coefficient of
   variation and an improved precision-recall curve.}},

Abstract = {{A promising approach to prostate cancer diagnosis is multi-parametric
   MRI. One of the key modalities used in multi-parametric MRI is diffusion
   weighted MRI. Using multiple diffusion weighted MR acquisitions taken
   with different magnetic gradient strengths, the apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) is calculated and can be used to identify tumors in
   the prostate. Current algorithms used to calculate ADC assume a
   parametric measurement model, but this assumption is not true due to the
   presence of additional phenomena during the acquisition process. A novel
   Non-parametric Estimated ADC (NEstA) algorithm is proposed which uses a
   Monte Carlo strategy to learn the inherent measurement distribution
   model based on the underlying statistical behavior of the DWI
   measurements to estimate the ADC values. The proposed algorithm is
   compared to the results of the commonly used least-squares (LS)
   estimation algorithm for computing ADC values. Nine test patient cases
   with visible tumors in the prostate gland were processed using both
   algorithms and compared visually. It was found that NEstA produced ADC
   data with reduced artifacts while preserving structure. Quantitatively,
   Fisher's criterion measuring the separability of the healthy prostate
   and tumor tissues was computed for the nine patient cases, comparing the
   NEstA and LS methods. It was found that Fisher's criterion increased
   with the NEstA method, meaning the separation of classes was more
   pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{High b-value diffusion-weighted imaging is a promising approach for
   diagnosing and localizing cancer in the prostate gland. However,
   ultra-high b-value imaging is difficult to achieve at a high
   signal-to-noise ratio due to hardware limitations. An alternative
   approach being recently discussed is computed diffusion-weighted
   imaging, which allows for estimation of ultra-high b-value images from a
   set of diffusion-weighted acquisitions with different magnetic gradient
   strengths. This paper presents a quantitative investigative analysis of
   the improvement in tumour separability in the prostate gland from using
   ultra-high b-value computed diffusion-weighted imaging. The analysis
   computes ultra-high b-value images for six patient cases and
   investigates the separability of the tumour from the normal prostate
   gland. Based on quantitative metrics such as expected probability of
   classification error and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), it
   was found that the use of ultra-high computed diffusion-weighted imaging
   may significantly improve tumour separability, with a b-value around
   3000 providing optimal separability.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of motor unit potentials (MUPs) and their times of
   occurrence provide information about the motor units (MUs) that created
   them. As such, electromyographic (EMG) data can be used to categorize
   muscles as normal or suffering from a neuromuscular disease. Using
   pattern discovery (PD) allows clinicians to understand the rationale
   underlying a certain muscle characterization; i.e. it is transparent.
   Discretization is required in PD, which leads to some loss in accuracy.
   In this work, characterization techniques that are based on estimating
   probability density functions (PDFs) for each muscle category are
   implemented. Characterization probabilities of each motor unit potential
   train (MUPT) are obtained from these PDFs and then Bayes rule is used to
   aggregate the MUPT characterization probabilities to calculate muscle
   level probabilities. Even though this technique is not as transparent as
   PD, its accuracy is higher than the discrete PD. Ultimately, the goal is
   to use a technique that is based on both PDFs and PD and make it as
   transparent and as efficient as possible, but first it was necessary to
   thoroughly assess how accurate a fully continuous approach can be. Using
   Gaussian PDF estimation achieved improvements in muscle categorization
   accuracy over PD and further improvements resulted from using feature
   value histograms to choose more representative PDFs; for instance, using
   log-normal distribution to represent skewed histograms.}},

   The proposed approach uses a two stage identification and recognition
   process, based on velocity and stochastic modeling of each motion to be
   identified. In the first stage, motion segment candidates are identified
   based on a unique sequence of velocity features such as velocity peaks
   and zero velocity crossings. In the second stage, Hidden Markov models
   are used to accurately identify segment locations from the identified
   candidates. The approach is capable of on-line segmentation and
   identification, enabling interactive feedback in rehabilitation
   applications. The approach is validated on a rehabilitation movement
   dataset, and achieves a segmentation accuracy of 89\%.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive abilities similar to other mental or physical abilities

   The focus of this paper is to study the change of real time egocentric
   spatial processing in humans by age. For this, an interactive computer
   game played with a 2DOF manipulandum was designed. The game consists of
   goal-oriented motor tasks, in which the player must move the robot arm
   toward a desired spatial cue in a virtual 2D environment in every trial
   for a total number of 72 trials. The spatial cues are four final
   destinations and a starting location, which change their position in
   every new trial of the game. 37 individuals with no cognitive impairment
   were split into 3 groups according to different age range (children,
   young, and elderly) and participated in this experiment. Their spatial
   processing ability was assessed and compared between the age groups. The
   results show the children (7-12 y) and elderly (65(+) y) performed very
   similar and significantly worse than the young adult participants.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring the spatial and temporal characteristics of hand movement is a
   challenging task due to the large number of degrees of freedom (DOF) in
   the hand. This paper presents a multi-constrained inverse kinematics
   (IK) approach for hand motion estimation from motion capture data. The
   IK approach satisfies a set of prioritized motion and postural
   constraints for each hand joint and link. The high-priority constraint
   is fully satisfied, while the fulfilment of the low-priority constraints
   is achieved as long as no conflict with the high-priority constraint
   exists. The proposed approach can aid marker-based motion capture
   technologies in accurately reconstructing discontinuities or erroneous
   marker trajectory segments resulting from occluded, missing, or flipped
   markers. The performance of the multi-constrained IK approach for the
   hand is tested for a full range of continuous hand motion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cooperative framework in cognitive radio networks,
   which addresses energy efficiency of the primary users (PUs) and
   trustworthiness of secondary users (SUs), is proposed. Specifically, the
   cooperation involves a PU selecting the most suitable SU as the
   cooperative relay and allocating the spectrum access intervals for
   relaying its message and rewarding the SU for its help in relaying the
   PU's message. Based on the PU's strategy, the selected SU determines its
   optimal transmission power. The above sequential decision procedure,
   with the PU as the leader and the SU as the follower, is formulated as a
   Stackelberg game. The outcomes of the proposed cooperative strategy,
   including partner selection, cooperation in an untrustworthy
   environment, and energy efficiency consideration, are analyzed.
   Numerical results demonstrate that, with the proposed relay selection
   scheme, the PU can achieve high energy saving through cooperation with
   the trustworthy SU.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative relaying is a promising technique for Long Term Evolution
   Advanced (LTE-A) networks to satisfy high throughput demand and support
   heterogeneous communication services with diverse quality-of-service
   (QoS) requirements. However, efficient relay selection as well as
   resource allocation are critical in such a network when multiple users
   and multiple relays are considered. In this paper, a resource allocation
   problem of maximizing the total achievable throughput for multi-user
   cooperative LTE-A uplink system considering heterogeneous services is
   investigated. An optimal joint relay selection, subcarrier assignment
   and power allocation scheme under total power constraint is proposed.
   The optimization problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem
   and solved by decomposing it into a hierarchy of subproblems with
   reduced computational complexity. The subgradient method is used to find
   the Lagrange multipliers, which helps to obtain the optimal solution.
   Numerical results show that our approach supports heterogeneous services
   while guaranteeing each user's QoS requirements with slight total system
   throughput degradation.}},

   to reduce the complexity of the conventional centralized strategy that
   also tries to divide the total consumed power equally among the relay
   nodes but requires a knowledge of the average signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNRs) of the relay path for all relay nodes, a central controller, and
   a numerical equation-solving method to find the corresponding weight
   coefficient for each relay node. We show that our distributed strategy
   can divide the power consumption fairly and approach the equal average
   power consumption when only the average SNRs of the relay path are known
   locally. Also we show that our proposed strategy still provides similar
   outage probability as that provided by the conventional one.}},

Abstract = {{Survivable routing serves as a key role in connection-oriented
   communication networks for achieving desired service availability for
   each connection. This is particularly critical for the success of
   all-optical mesh networks where each lightpath carries a huge amount of
   data. Currently, 1 + 1 dedicated path protection appears to be the most
   widely deployed network resilience mechanism because it offers
   instantaneous recovery from network failures. However, 1 + 1 protection
   consumes almost twice as much capacity as required, which imposes a
   stringent constraint on network resource utilization. In addition,
   finding an SRLG-disjoint path is essential for 1 + 1 protection, which
   is nonetheless subject to non-trivial computation complexity and may
   fail in some SRLG scenarios. To address these problems, we introduce a
   novel framework of 1 + 1 protection, called Generalized Dedicated
   Protection (GDP), for achieving instantaneous recovery from any SRLG
   failure event. It is demonstrated, that finding a non-bifurcated optimal
   solution for GDP is NP-complete. Thus, the paper presents a novel scheme
   applying Generalized Dedicated Protection and Network Coding (GDP-NC) to
   ensure both optimal resource utilization among dedicated protection
   approaches and instantaneous recovery for single unicast flows, which
   can be split into multiple parts in all-optical networks. We demonstrate
   that the proposed GDP-NC survivable routing problem is polynomial-time
   solvable, owing to the ability to bifurcate flows. This flexibility
   comes at the expense of additional hardware for linear combination
   operations for the optical flows.}},

Abstract = {{Outsourcing data to cloud servers, while increasing service availability
   and reducing users' burden of managing data, inevitably brings in new
   concerns such as data privacy, since the server may be
   honest-but-curious. To mediate the conflicts between data usability and
   data privacy in such a scenario, research of searchable encryption is of
   increasing interest.
   Motivated by the fact that a cloud server, besides its curiosity, may be
   selfish in order to save its computation and/or download bandwidth, in
   this paper, we investigate the searchable encryption problem in the
   presence of a semi-honest-but-curious server, which may execute only a
   fraction of search operations honestly and return a fraction of search
   outcome honestly. To fight against this strongest adversary ever, a
   verifiable SSE (VSSE) scheme is proposed to offer verifiable
   searchability in additional to the data privacy, both of which are
   further confirmed by our rigorous security analysis. Besides, we treat
   the practicality/efficiency as a central requirement of a searchable
   encryption scheme. To demonstrate the lightweightness of our scheme, we
   implemented and tested the proposed VSSE on a laptop (serving as the
   server) and a mobile phone running Android 2.3.4 (serving as the end
   user). The experimental results optimistically suggest that the proposed
   scheme satisfies all of our design goals.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as a promising solution to
   spectrum under-utilization and congestion. Supporting quality of service
   (QoS) aware services over CRNs is always challenging due to the
   randomness of the spectrum availability. In this paper, we consider a
   set of fully-connected cognitive radios (secondary users) operating over
   a time-slotted primary network, accessing the channel at the spectrum
   holes without interfering with primary users. As the capacity analysis
   is one of the basic steps to guarantee QoS, we analyze the on-off voice
   capacity of single-channel single-hop fully-connected CRNs under
   distributed channel access control. The voice capacity is represented in
   terms of the number of simultaneous independent voice calls that the
   secondary network can support, providing stochastic delay guarantee. Our
   analytical results have a close match with the simulation results. With
   proper medium access control, capacity analysis can help to develop a
   call admission control policy for QoS provisioning in
   non-fully-connected CRNs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for efficiently and securely
   preserving source nodes' location privacy. Our scheme uses efficient
   cryptographic operations to change the packets' appearance at each hop
   to prevent packet correlation. It also creates a cloud with irregular
   shape of fake traffic to enable the real source node to send its data
   anonymously to a fake source node to send to the sink and to camouflage
   the real source node in the nodes creating the cloud. To reduce the
   energy cost, clouds are active only during data transmission and the
   intersection of clouds creates a larger merged cloud to reduce the
   number of fake packets and boost privacy preservation. Simulation and
   analytical results demonstrate that our scheme can provide stronger
   privacy preservation than routing-based schemes and requires much less
   energy cost than global-adversary-based schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In habitat monitoring applications, when a sensor node detects an
   endangered animal, e.g., a panda, it reports the animal's presence and
   activities to the sink. However, the adversaries can eavesdrop on the
   network transmissions and make use of the traffic information to locate
   pandas to hunt them. In this paper, we first define hotspot phenomenon
   that causes an obvious inconsistency in the network traffic pattern due
   to the large volume of packets originated from a small spot. Second, we
   develop a realistic adversary model assuming that the adversary can
   monitor the network traffic in multiple areas rather than the entire
   network or only one area. We then introduce a novel attack called
   Hotspot-Locating where the adversary uses traffic analysis techniques to
   locate hotspots. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that
   Hotspot-Locating attack is a severe threat to the source nodes' location
   privacy and the existing routing-based privacy preserving schemes are
   vulnerable to this attack because they leak traffic analysis information
   that can be used to locate the source nodes. For stronger privacy
   preservation, the traffic analysis information such as packet
   correlation and the nodes' packet sending rates should be concealed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a concurrent transmission scheduling algorithm is
   proposed to enhance the resource utilization efficiency for multi-Gbps
   millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. Specifically, we exploit spatial-time
   division multiple access (STDMA) to improve the system throughput by
   allowing both non-interfering and interfering links to transmit
   concurrently, considering the high propagation loss at mmWave band and
   the utilization of directional antenna. Concurrent transmission
   scheduling in mmWave networks is formulated as an optimization model to
   maximize the number of flows scheduled in the network such that the
   quality of service (QoS) requirement of each flow is satisfied. We
   further decompose the optimization problem and propose a flip-based
   heuristic scheduling algorithm with low computational complexity to
   solve the problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm can significantly improve the network performance in terms of
   network throughput and the number of supported flows.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose EM(3)A, a novel scheme that guarantees the
   authenticity of a mobile node (MN) and a relay node (RN) in a
   multi-hop-enabled Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) network. EM(3)A works in
   conjunction with a proposed scheme for key establishment, based on
   symmetric polynomials, to generate a shared secret key between MN and
   RN. This scheme achieves lower revocation overhead than that achieved by
   existing symmetric polynomial-based schemes. For a PMIP domain with n
   points of attachment, EM(3)A achieves t x 2(n)-secrecy, whereas the
   existing authentication schemes achieve only t-secrecy. Computation and
   communication overhead analysis, as well as simulation results,
   demonstrate that EM(3)A achieves low authentication delay and is
   suitable for seamless multi-hop IP communications.}},

Abstract = {{In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), improving uploading efficiency is
   crucial to enabling the copious applications such as reporting sensed
   data for traffic management or environment monitoring. Depending on the
   applications, the contents to be uploaded can be of large volumes.
   Therefore, there exist the fundamental demands of the delivery with high
   throughput. In this paper, we derive the achievable throughput capacity
   scaling law for such applications in VANETs as Theta(1/log n), with the
   number of road-side units scaling as Theta(n/log n). Furthermore, by
   exploring the mobility diversity among vehicles, we propose a novel
   two-hop forwarding scheme to improve the throughput performance
   approaching the throughput capacity. Specifically, the source vehicle
   distributes the contents to multiple relay vehicles with the largest
   mobility diversity so that the number of concurrent transmissions can be
   increased. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed transmission scheme in terms of the increased throughput
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{We compare optical tracking with inertial tracking of a golf club for
   full golf swings. Previous work on tracking golf clubs with inertial
   measurement units (IMUs) was limited to putting applications {[}1].
   Using a Vicon optical motion capture system and a commercial
   micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS) IMU, we performed simultaneous
   optical and inertial measurements of golf swings by one of our varsity
   golf team members. The IMU and five optical tracking markers were
   attached to a club shaft just under the grip. The position and
   orientation data of the grip can be used with a dynamics simulation of
   the club shaft and head to yield information about the club face launch
   conditions at the moment of ball impact {[}2]. Vicon marker position
   data, and IMU accelerations and rotation rates, were converted into
   laboratory frame position and orientation data for the grip of the club
   and compared with one another. The results point to challenges with
   commercial-grade IMUs that use MEMS for tracking golf swings. Strapdown
   inertial navigation is very sensitive to errors in the rotation rate and
   acceleration sensors. Due to the large dynamic ranges involved in a golf
   swing, and the poor noise, stability, and dynamic range of the MEMS
   IMUs, high-fidelity tracking of the 6-degree-of-freedom grip motion
   could not be achieved. We suggest that a way to overcome these
   challenges could be by including magnetometer data with an extended
   Kalman filter to provide the necessary accuracy in orientation to
   reconstruct the position of the club accurately in three dimensions. (C)

Abstract = {{Large quantities of hydrogen (H-2) are released at ambient temperatures
   as a result of mechanical dehydrogenation during ball milling of complex
   hydride composites such as (LiAlH4+5 wt.\% nanometric Fe),
   (nLiAlH(4)+LiNH2; n=1, 3, 11.5, 30), (nLiAlH(4)+MnCl2; n=1, 3, 8, 13,
   30, 63) and (LiNH2+nMgH(2); n=0.5-2.0). For both the (nLiAlH(4)+LiNH2)
   and (LiAlH4+5 wt.\% nanometric Fe) composites the second constituent
   strongly destabilizes LiAlH4 during milling by different mechanisms. For
   (nLiAlH(4)+MnCl2) two concurrent mechanisms are observed: (i) a reaction
   between both constituents during ball milling leading to the formation
   of LiCl, amorphous Mn and H-2, and (ii) a catalytic-like induced
   decomposition of LiAlH4 into Li3AlH6, Al and H-2. For the
   (LiNH2+nMgH(2); n=0.5-2.0) composite system, the pathway of hydride
   reactions depends on the molar ratio n and total milling energy consumed
   during ball milling. Some composite systems slowly self-discharge H-2 at
   room temperature (RT), 40 and 80 degrees C, after ball milling with an
   additive. Technical parameters such as specific energy-usable are
   estimated for LiAlH4-based complex hydride composite systems and are
   compared with both US DOE hydrogen powered car targets and Li-ion

Abstract = {{With the advance of hardware technology, more features are incrementally
   added to already existing networked systems. Avionics has a stronger
   tendency to use preexisting applications due to its complexity and
   scale. As resource sharing becomes intense among the network and the
   computing modules, it has become a difficult task for the system
   designer to make confident architectural decisions even for incremental
   changes. Providing a tailored environment to model and analyze
   incremental changes requires a combination of software tools and
   hardware support. We have built a virtual integration tool called ASIIST
   which can provide a worst-case end-to-end latency of data that is sent
   through a network and the internal bus architecture of the end-systems.
   Also, we have devised a new real-time switching algorithm which
   guarantees the worst-case network delay of preexisting network traffic
   under feasible conditions. With the real-time switch support, ASIIST can
   provide an early modularized analysis of the end-to-end latency to make
   architectural design choices and incremental changes easier for the

Number = {{2290}},
Pages = {{105-114}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on characterizing several recycled concrete aggregate
   (RCA) sources, developing concrete mixture proportions that incorporate
   RCA as coarse aggregate, and investigating the effect of coarse
   aggregate properties on the main mixture proportion parameters {[}i.e.,
   cement content, water demand, and water-cement (w/c) ratio]. Four
   aggregate types were investigated: one control virgin aggregate source
   and three RCAs produced from the crushing of hardened concrete. Numerous
   aggregate tests, including density, absorption, abrasion resistance,
   adhered mortar content, and crushing value, were performed. Fourteen
   mixture proportions were developed with the use of three mixture
   proportion scenarios (control, direct replacement, and strength based)
   and two compressive strength levels (40 and 60 MPa). The effect of RCA
   on compressive strength and workability was evaluated by replacement of
   natural coarse aggregate with RCA. Contrary to numerous studies, one of
   the RCA concretes (RCA-1) had compressive strengths up to 12\% higher
   than the equivalent control mixture. Mixture proportions (water, cement,
   and w/c ratio) were later adjusted to ensure that the RCA concretes had
   compressive strength and slump values similar to the control concretes.
   Variations in water demand, cement content, and w/c ratio could then be
   directly attributed to the properties of the RCA source. RCA-1 concrete
   required less cement (and a higher w/c ratio) to achieve strengths and
   slumps similar to the control concrete. The findings and recommendations
   of this research will assist concrete producers, engineers, and field
   technicians involved in the selection of RCA sources in developing
   mixture proportions for structural-grade RCA concrete.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting is a promising technology for extending the lifetime
   of sensor networks with the restrictions of limited battery energy. One
   of the main challenging issues is to maximize the sampling rates of all
   sensor nodes. In this paper, we are concerned with how to adaptively
   decide the sampling rate for each rechargeable sensor node with a
   limited battery capacity to maximize overall network utility. To solve
   the problem, we firstly propose an adaptive energy allocation scheme for
   each node to manage its energy use in an efficient way. Then we develop
   a distributed sampling rate control (DSRC) algorithm to obtain the
   optimal sampling rate. Extensive simulations using real experimental
   data obtained from Baseline Measurement System (BMS) of Solar Radiation
   Research Laboratory are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of our
   algorithm.}},

   that originated from early attempts to simulate the behavior of birds
   looking for food. Estimation of distributions algorithms (EDAs) are a
   class of evolutionary algorithms that build and maintain a probabilistic
   model capturing the search space characteristics and continuously use
   this model to generate new individuals. In this work, we propose a new
   PSO and EDA hybrid algorithm that uses the particles' distribution in
   the search space in order to adjust the search space bounds, hence,
   restricting the particles movement as well as their allowable maximum
   velocity. The algorithms is augmented with a mechanism to overcome
   premature convergence and escape local minima. The algorithm is compared
   to the standard PSO algorithm using a suite of well-known benchmark
   optimization functions. Experimental results show that the proposed

Abstract = {{Computerized patient monitoring provides valuable information on
   clinical disorders in medical practice, and it triggers the need to
   simplify the extent of resources required to describe large set of
   complex biomedical signals. In this paper, we present a new signal
   quantification method based on block-wise similarity measurement between
   the neighboring regions in the optimized log-frequency spectrogram of
   audio signals. Low dimensional cepstral feature set for signal
   quantification is then formed from the reconstructed similarity matrix
   using 2D principal component analysis. The effectiveness of the method
   is verified with real respiratory sound (RS) signals for the purpose of
   abnormal RS detection towards RS monitoring. Unlike conventional
   pathological RS detection methods which extract features from
   well-segmented inspiratory/expiratory phase segments, the proposed
   scheme is able to perform fast detection of various types of abnormality
   for unsegmented signals.}},

   of providing the necessary information for powertrain control
   applications may be designed specifically to minimize cost and
   complexity. Finally, an evaluation and prototyping platform consisting
   of both hardware and software is described, which allows for evaluation
   and verification of the design tradeoffs. The same platform will also
   provide the future possibility of the powertrain control algorithm

Abstract = {{The volatile world economy has greatly affected fuel prices, while
   pollution and gas emissions are increasing to negatively impact global
   warming. Vehicular networks offer a promising approach that can be
   applied in transportation systems to reduce fuel consumption and
   emissions. One of the interesting applications involves a traffic light
   signal sending information to approaching vehicles. Based on that
   information, the vehicle receiving the message adapts its speed to a
   speed called the recommended speed (S-R), which is the speed that helps
   the vehicle to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. In this paper, we
   propose an optimization model with the objective of minimizing fuel
   consumption and emissions. The speed that can achieve this goal is the
   optimum S-R. We also propose an efficient heuristic expression to
   compute near-optimal values of the optimum S-R.}},

   assistance systems when the car is stationary. This paper focuses on
   such a system, and describes the design and realization of a collision
   avoidance system for a novel car door assistance system, the smart car
   door. An omnidirectional camera is attached to each side-view mirror of
   a car, and the fold-in fold-out movement of the mirror is used to
   generate 3D information about static obstacles next to the car based on
   a motion stereo approach. The car door controller uses the sensor data
   to compute collision-free door opening paths, and the two-hinge
   kinematic system of the smart car door enables to move the door around
   static obstacles. The latter increases the door entrance area in tight
   parking lots, which drastically improves the ingress/egress to/from a
   vehicle. These are enhancements to currently available systems that only
   indicate the presence of obstacles next to the car. Experiments on a
   fully realized prototype demonstrated a robust generation of 3D

Abstract = {{A majority of driver assistance systems focuses on assisting the driver
   when the car is in motion. There is relatively less, to almost no work
   on assistance systems when the car is stationary. The focus of this
   paper is on such a system and describes the design and realization of a
   novel, camera-based anti-trap protection system for smart car doors. Our
   system uses a single omnidirectional camera that is integrated in each
   inner door of a vehicle, and detects obstacles such as fingers, hands or
   legs at the A and B-pillar, door sill and car door without any contact.
   This is an enhancement to currently available systems that require an
   active contact between obstacles and sensors in the door area for the
   detection of trapping. The paper also proposes a scheme for
   re-calibrating the camera position that may change due to vibrations
   during the life-time of the car door. Experiments on a fully realized
   car door prototype show that the proposed schemes prevent trapping by
   robustly detecting obstacles such as small fingers or hands in critical
   door regions, and output results in real-time. The latter is important
   when door users slam the car door. A first study with 20 test users
   showed that our system strongly supports the door users to prevent

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the control of discrete-time linear multi-agent
   systems. We adopt and extend the ``targeting{''} approach, first
   introduced by Spieser and Shams for plant regulation, to the disturbance
   rejection problem. Specifically, we assume that there are one or more
   disturbance agents interacting with the plant agents in some known
   manner. The disturbance signals are assumed to be unmeasured and, for
   simplicity, constant. Control agents are then introduced to interact
   with the plant agents, and each control agent is assigned a target plant
   agent. We derive a necessary condition for successful disturbance
   rejection, namely that a control agent must be connected to the same
   plant agent to which a disturbance agent is connected. Based on the idea
   of integral control and the earlier regulation results of Spieser and
   Shams, we then propose for the control agents a set of control laws to
   achieve disturbance rejection.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of optimal transmission power for a
   continuous-time energy harvesting system where energy arrivals occur at
   random times in random amounts. We do not assume that the energy
   arrivals are known non-causally and consider the online setting. Here,
   there is a tradeoff between increasing instantaneous transmission power,
   which increases instantaneous transmission rate and can reduce battery
   overflow, and decreasing transmission power, which increases battery
   life and energy efficiency.
   We formulate the problem as that of maximizing the average transmission
   rate or throughput. We first find the non-linear relationship between
   the transmission power (which is a function of remaining battery energy)
   and the stationary distribution on the remaining battery energy. We then
   show that the resulting maximization problem is concave in the
   distribution of the remaining battery energy. This is non-trivial due to
   the non-linear relationship with the transmission power. We then use a
   calculus of variations approach to derive necessary conditions on the
   optimal transmission power. Specifically, we find that it must satisfy a
   first order non-linear autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE)
   that has two degree of freedom for optimization purposes, one of which
   is the initial condition of the ODE. Solving the ODE numerically we
   compute achieved throughputs as a function of the battery capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a new decoding rule called jar decoding was proposed, under
   which the decoder first forms a set of suitable size, called a jar,
   consisting of sequences from the channel input alphabet considered to be
   closely related to y(n), and then takes any codeword from the jar as the
   estimate of the transmitted codeword. In this paper, we show that under
   jar decoding, the analysis of low density parity check (LDPC) codes is
   much easier compared to maximum a posteriori (MAP) or maximum likelihood
   (ML) and Belief Propagation (BP) decoding, and new general LDPC coding
   theorems can be established. Specifically, it is proved that LDPC codes
   can approach the mutual information, with diminishing bit error
   probability, of any binary input memoryless channel with uniform input
   distribution when the average variable node degree is large. Moreover,
   simulation shows an interesting connection between jar decoding and BP
   decoding, i.e., BP decoding can be regarded as one of many ways to pick
   up a codeword from the jar for LDPC codes when it succeeds in outputting
   a codeword.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the (forward) key capacity of a Gaussian state-dependent
   wiretap channel (G-SWC) paralleled with a public channel having capacity
   C-p is an element of {[}0, infinity). This model consists of a sender, a
   main receiver, and a wiretapper. The channel state information (CSI) is
   an additive white Gaussian interference (AWGI) which is non-causally
   known at the sender. A lower bound (LB) on the key capacity is achieved
   by using a generalized version of the dirty paper coding (DPC) in which
   the transmitted signal is correlated with the interference. The
   correlation coefficient is to be determined by C-p. The achievable
   scheme is asymptotically optimum as C-p -> infinity. This optimum key
   capacity is also asymptotically achievable for any C-p >= 0 in high
   signal to interference ratio (SIR) regime. In this regime, the public
   channel has negligible contribution in key generation. Generally, the
   CSI enhances the key capacity such that it exceeds the main channel
   capacity of the G-SWC in low SIR regime.}},

Abstract = {{Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) have been increasingly widespread
   throughout the power network. As a result, several researches have been
   made to locate the PMUs for complete system observability. Many
   protection applications are based upon the PMUs locations. This paper
   introduces an important application in power system protection which is
   the detection of single line outage. In addition, a detection of the
   outaged line is achieved depending on the variations of phase angles
   measured at the system buses where the PMUs are located. Hence, a

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study for the network reconfiguration problem for
   loss reduction with distributed generation units (DGs) included in the
   network. Two heuristic algorithms inspired from natural phenomena are
   proposed to solve the problem, real ants'-behavior-inspired, Ant Colony
   Optimization (ACO) implemented in the Hyper Cube (HC) framework and
   musicians'-behavior-inspired, Harmony Search (HS) algorithm. A 32-bus
   and 69-bus distribution systems were selected for optimizing the
   configuration with and without DG units installed. The results of
   reconfiguration using the proposed algorithms show that both of them
   yield the optimum configuration with minimum power loss for each case
   study however, the HS required shorter simulation time but more practice
   of the iterative process than the HC-ACO. Implementing the ACO in the HC
   framework resulted in a more robust and easier handling of pheromone
   trails than the standard ACO. Insertion of DGs in the distribution
   networks contributed to loss reduction with reasonable percentage.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have uncertain penetration in electric
   grids due to uncertainties in charging and discharging patterns. This
   uncertainty together with various driving habits makes it difficult to
   accurately assess the effects on local distribution network. Extra
   electrical loads due uncoordinated charging of electric vehicles have
   different impacts on the local distribution grid.
   This paper proposes a method to evaluate the impacts of uncoordinated
   PEVs charging on the distribution grid during peak period. Two PEVs
   charging scenarios are studied, including normal and fast charging. The
   impact analysis is evaluated in terms of voltage violations, power
   losses and line loading, which is implemented on a real distribution
   system in Canada. The results of the analysis indicate that there are
   significant impacts on distribution networks due to PEVs charging, which
   limits the accommodation of desired penetration levels of PEVs.}},

Abstract = {{There are many technical aspects and challenges at DG that are still not
   properly understood and addressed. Since most of these studies have to
   be carried out based on simulations, adequate static and dynamic models
   for DG units are required. The objective of this paper is the dynamic
   and static modeling of various DG technologies for stability analysis.
   These models allow studying systems with DGs both in the long-and
   short-term; thus, differential and algebraic equations of various DGs
   are formulated and discussed based on models found in the literature in
   order to integrate these models into a system representation. The
   presented and discussed models are generally based on well-known dynamic
   models of different DGs for stability studies considering the dynamics
   of the primary governor, generators and their interfaces and controls.
   The results of applying these models for voltage and angle stability
   studies of a realistic distribution system are presented and compared,
   demonstrating the typical application of the presented units.}},

Abstract = {{Solar photovoltaic (PV) generation has become an economically feasible
   and clean energy supply option for large scale grid connected
   operations. From a power generation planning perspective, it is required
   to design a feasible incentive that will lure investors to participate

   Ontario, Canada, has come up with a Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) program to
   encourage investment in large scale solar PV projects. In this paper, an
   optimization model is presented to determine an optimal incentive rate
   that will facilitate investments in grid-connected solar PV projects.
   The model determines a range of feasible FIT values that will provide
   investors with a guaranteed internal rate of return (IRR). It also
   identifies the most preferred zones in the province for new PV
   installations, from a system planning perspective.}},

Abstract = {{The condition of having different irradiance levels among different
   photovoltaic modules in a photovoltaic array is called partial shading.
   Energy losses have been reported to occur due to partial shading. These
   losses could be reduced by reconnecting the modules of the array in such
   a way that the overall impact of partial shading on the array is
   reduced. This paper proposes a novel optimization model for the optimal
   total cross tied interconnection which significantly reduces partial
   shading losses. The improvement over ordinary total-cross-tied
   interconnection has been demonstrated by extensive simulation results.

Abstract = {{A fast and reliable technique for classifying overvoltage events across
   power transformers terminals is introduced in this paper. Currents at
   the secondary terminals of power transformer during various overvoltages
   are used to synthesis a modal current signal. A feature vector is
   extracted from the selected modal signal utilizing discrete wavelet
   transform. Finally the extracted feature vector is used to train an
   artificial neural network to differentiate between various overvoltage
   events occurring across the transformer premises.
   The results of this algorithm can be used to build an online model to
   help assessing the condition of power transformers, thus proper
   condition based maintenance can be scheduled. The proposed algorithm is
   also fast in the sense that it can differentiate between temporary and
   permanent overvoltages during the early transient stage, thus
   eliminating the need for any time delay in the overvoltage protection
   devices, and the overvoltage protection philosophy can be changed to
   become instantaneous rather than time-delayed protection. This technique
   is economical and simple; it doesn't require any special arrangements as
   it depends on the readily available measurements.
   Tests were conducted to validate the proposed algorithm and showed it to
   be robust and generic.}},

Abstract = {{Increase in energy demand is one of the major challenges that utilities
   are faced with, which results in increase in environmental pollution and
   global warming. The transport sector has a significant share in the
   energy demand as well as environmental pollution. In Canada, almost 35\%
   of the total energy demand is from the transport sector and it is the
   second largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The government
   of Ontario, Canada, has aimed to move toward a green energy economy,
   aimed towards increased penetration of renewable energy sources and
   Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) technology. In this paper, an
   optimal power flow (OPF) based optimization framework considering two
   different objectives, minimizing feeder losses and PHEV charging cost,
   are presented to understand the impact of PHEV charging on distribution
   networks. Three different charging periods are considered and the impact
   of the Ontario Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff on PHEV charging schedules is
   examined. The impact of PHEV charging on distribution systems in the

   improvement and energy losses reduction. The proposed approach takes
   into consideration customers' sectors, load variation, stochastic nature
   of renewable DG, and variable hourly cost of energy. The allocation
   planning problem is defined as mixed integer non-linear programming
   problem, where genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized. Using the proposed

   overall system load profile, bus load profiles, feeder currents,
   voltages, taps and capacitor switching. The proposed model can be used
   to maximize PEV charging over a 24 hour time-frame or the utilization of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple and efficient reconfiguration approach for
   balanced and unbalanced radial distribution networks with Distributed
   Generators. The proposed approach starts with meshed networks by closing
   all tie switches. A switching index is defined for reconfiguration using
   apparent power flow in lines. The radial configuration was restored by
   opening one switch in each loop subjected to system operational
   constraints. The switching index can be used for both loss reduction and
   service restoration during normal and emergency situations respectively.
   The time varying nature of loads through using daily load profiles was
   considered. The results concluded the effectiveness of: (i) fixed
   configuration compared to hourly reconfiguration in terms of energy
   losses and number of switching operations during normal operation; and
   (ii) building restoration plans with the consideration of load variation
   compared to plans based on pre-fault or peak load values. The proposed
   method has been tested on one balanced and one unbalanced systems.}},

Abstract = {{Supervised pixel-based texture classification is usually performed in
   the feature space. We propose to perform this task in (dis)similarity
   space by introducing a new compression-based (dis)similarity measure.
   The proposed measure utilizes two dimensional MPEG-1 encoder, which
   takes into consideration the spatial locality and connectivity of pixels
   in the images. The proposed formulation has been carefully designed
   based on MPEG encoder functionality. To this end, by design, it solely
   uses P-frame coding to find the (dis)similarity among patches/images. We
   show that the proposed measure works properly on both small and large
   patch sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
   significantly improves the performance of supervised pixel-based texture
   classification on Brodatz and outdoor images compared to other
   compression-based dissimilarity measures as well as approaches performed
   in feature space. It also improves the computation speed by about 40\%
   compared to its rivals.}},

Abstract = {{The HB-like entity authentication protocols for low-cost pervasive
   devices have attracted a great deal of attention because of their
   simplicity, computational efficiency and solid security foundation on a
   well-studied hard problem-learning parity with noise. By far, the most
   efficient protocol is HB\#, which is provably resistant to the GRS
   attack under the conjecture that it is secure in the DET-model. However,
   in order to achieve 80-bit security, a typical HB\# authentication key
   comprises over 1000 bits, which imposes considerable storage burdens on
   resource-constrained devices. In this study, the authors propose a new
   HB-like protocol: HBC. The protocol makes use of a special type of
   circulant matrix, in contrast to the Toeplitz matrix in HB\#, to
   significantly reduce storage consumption and overcome a subtle security
   proof inefficacy in HB\#. In addition, the authors introduce a masking
   technique that substantially increases noise level from an adversary's
   standpoint, and thus improves protocol performance. The authors
   demonstrate that 613-bit authentication key suffices for 80-bit security
   in the HBC protocol, which is quite competitive and more appealing for
   low-cost devices.}},

Abstract = {{To design a supervisory plan for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV),
   different methods are presented in the literature. In many of these
   controllers, there are a few parameters that must be tuned according to
   future driving conditions. To address this issue, a novel feedback
   controller is introduced in this paper that serves as the supervisory
   plan of a series HEV, and does not require the exact knowledge of the
   drive cycle. To find this controller, first a mathematical model of the
   hybrid drivetrain is developed, then Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is
   applied assuming that the drive cycle is known in advance. Based on the
   mechanism of the optimal control, a set of mathematical rules is
   extracted, and an optimal feedback controller is designed. It is also
   shown that a priori knowledge of the future drive cycle is not required;
   it is possible to tune the controller parameters, knowing only the
   cruise time and the available negative energy during braking.}},

Abstract = {{This paper takes a control engineering perspective on the use of rewards
   to modify the behavior of a person. We consider the particular scenario
   where a parent is trying to coerce her child to get more physical
   exercise. The goal is to determine a reward sequence that drives the
   child's behavior to some desired value. The main novelty of this paper
   is the introduction of social-norm effects (arising from social pressure
   due to, say, a teacher) and conformity effects (arising from
   interactions that the child has with a friend). The social-norm effect,
   being uni-directional, acts as a disturbance, while the conformity
   effect, which is bi-directional, creates an extra dynamic feedback loop.
   We model the psychological state of the child and friend using a
   combination of psychological theories (the ``theory of planned
   behavior,{''} ``cognitive dissonance theory,{''} and ``overjustification
   theory{''}), and we use classical control tools to design an
   output-feedback controller that achieves the setpoint tracking
   objective. Robustness issues are also considered.}},

Abstract = {{Communicating multi-process networks appear in many real-life
   applications. Parameterized discrete event systems provide a convenient
   way of modeling these networks. Unfortunately, some key problems such as
   checking solvability of the nonblocking synthesis problem and checking
   satisfaction of a temporal property in parameterized networks are
   undecidable. In this paper, we consider parameterized ring networks and
   introduce a new framework for blocking analysis of such networks. To
   render the blocking analysis tractable, we restrict the interactions
   between processes. The structural assumptions are formulated in terms of
   a new mathematical relation: invariant weak simulation of one process by
   another. Our assumptions serve to ensure that while both immediate
   neighbors may prevent a process from executing shared events, only one
   neighbor can permanently prevent an event from occurring; in that sense,
   control only flows around the ring in one direction. We prove that our
   assumptions have this desired result. The effectiveness of the proposed
   framework is demonstrated by analysis of a version of the dining
   philosophers problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a scheme to design a tracking controller for a class
   of uncertain nonlinear systems using a robust feedback linearization
   approach. The scheme is composed of two steps. In the first step, a
   linearized uncertainty model for the corresponding uncertain nonlinear
   system is developed using a robust feedback linearization approach. In
   this step, the standard feedback linearization approach is used to
   linearize the nominal nonlinear dynamics of the uncertain nonlinear
   system. The remaining nonlinear uncertainties are then linearized at an
   arbitrary point using the mean value theorem. This approach gives a
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear uncertain system model with a
   structured uncertainty representation. In the second step, a minimax
   linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller is designed for MIMO
   linearized uncertain system model. In order to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to a velocity and
   altitude tracking control problem for an air-breathing hypersonic flight
   vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Organic solar cell (OSC)-organic light emitting Diode (OLED) stacked
   structures are investigated for their use in imaging the morphology of
   the bulk heterojunction layer used in OSCs. In lieu of the top cathode,
   bilayer OLED devices can be deposited directly on top of the otherwise
   traditional OSC device. Design considerations and device optimization
   are detailed. Results show that the bulk heterojunction layer composed
   of a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid
   methyl ester (PCBM) is sufficiently hole-conductive to allow for
   reasonably strong emission, peaking at a brightness of 175 cd/m(2) at a
   driving voltage of 8.5V and a current density of 12.5mA/cm(2). Since the
   OLED is in intimate contact with the P3HT:PCBM layer, it provides
   enhanced images of the bulk heterojunction with information on
   macro-scale defects and morphological variations. By tuning the emission
   intensity, detailed images can be obtained without the need for overly
   sensitive or costly cameras. Further applications of this technique,
   such as its potential in testing new donor polymer formulations as well
   as its capacity to monitor degradation due to residual solvents, are
   briefly discussed.}},

   show that the emission mechanism changes with the emission layer (EML)
   thickness. In the case of devices with a thick EML, strong host triplet-
   triplet annihilation (TTA) is observed, suggesting the presence of
   significant energy transfer from host to the guest. For the case of
   devices with thin EML, on the other hand, host TTA is insignificant,
   suggesting that direct charge trapping on the guest is the main emission
   mechanism. The results also show that the thickness of the hole

   charge extraction (i.e. from the organic layer to the metal). As a
   result, the photo-stability of these organic/metal contacts plays an
   important role in the stability of organic light-emitting devices
   (OLEDs), where the photo-degradation is caused by the irradiation of
   device own electroluminescence (EL), and organic photodetectors (OPDs),
   where exposure to light is obviously a more relevant issue. It is also
   found that interfacial layers such as cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) and

Abstract = {{Polyelectrolyte (PEL) mediated synthesis of functional inorganic
   nano-materials is attractive due to its versatility and compatibility
   inside aqueous media. Block copolymers are often employed to facilitate
   the formation of novel nanostructures. In this work, we report the
   synthesis of copper oxide (CuOx) crystals with an unexpected hollow
   nano-tubular morphology using only poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), i.e., a
   homopolymer. The quantification of the pH dependent binding limit of
   Cu2+ to PAA, which has often been given little emphasis previously, is
   found to be critical in understanding the formation mechanism of such
   nanotubes. Further quantification of the interdependent relationship of
   pH, alpha, and {[}Cu2+] : {[}COOH](0) using the pK(a)-alpha curves
   provided important insight. The formation of the CuOx nanotubes is
   believed to be due to an unusual copolymer-like self-assembly of PAA as
   a homopolymer in aqueous solution; caused by interactions between Cu2+
   and charged PAA chains. Such a unique copolymer-like self-assembly
   behaviour of the PAA-Cu2+ complex manifests within a specific window of
   {[}Cu2+] : {[}COOH](0) ratio around the binding limit. Discussion is
   also carried out on the possibilities and potential limitations of
   applying this new concept to other PELs and metal ions.}},

Abstract = {{Snail trails on photovoltaic modules are a source of enormous concern to
   the solar industry as no scientific reports on the mechanisms producing
   this global phenomenon were previously available. Here, for the first
   time, we clarify the origin of these snail trails as a product of the
   formation of silver carbonate nanoparticles which discolor the silver
   grid. Micropore arrays on the silicon substrate within the snail trail
   region could accelerate the discoloration by offering reactive compounds
   via penetration and release. The potential mechanisms of photovoltaic
   module discoloration are proposed, yielding clues as to how snail trail
   formation can be mitigated by technical solutions. Aging tests on the
   discolored modules suggest no significant power degradation or
   discolored area enlargement after accelerated aging.}},

Title = {{Feature ranking fusion for text classifier}},
Journal = {{INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{879-896}},
Abstract = {{Feature ranking is widely used in text classification. One problem with
   feature ranking methods is their non-robust behavior when applied to
   different data sets. In other words, the feature ranking methods behave
   differently from one data set to the other. The problem becomes more
   complex when we consider that the performance of feature ranking methods
   highly depends on the type of text classifier. In this paper, a new
   method based on combining feature rankings is proposed to find the best
   features among a set of feature rankings. The proposed method is applied
   to the text classification problem and evaluated on three well-known
   data sets using Support Vector Machine and Rocchio classifier. Several
   combining methods are employed to aggregate ranked list of the features.
   We show that combining methods can offer reliable results very close to
   the best solution without the need to use a classifier.}},

   complex product}},
Journal = {{KYBERNETES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{7-8}},
Pages = {{920-928}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to develop a Petri net model for analyzing the
   quality conflict and its resolution of a complex product. The result
   aims to assist decision makers (DMs) to properly select their activities
   when a quality conflict has happened.
   Design/methodology/approach - According to the features of Petri net and
   conflict analysis theory, a novel Petri net for conflict analysis (PNCA)
   is designed which contains transition and preference labels to describe
   DMs' decision activities and profit comparisons. Additionally, a
   generating approach is proposed, which can help DMs to construct a PNCA.
   Furthermore, based on players' bounded rationality, the equilibrium of
   PNCA is studied to provide scientific supports for DMs' decision-making.
   A case study on an aircraft production system is conducted to
   demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new model, which
   furnishes a fresh perspective on the supply chain quality management of
   a complex product.
   Findings - A new methodology is proposed for the domain of conflict
   analysis, which is easier to understand and improves the operation
   efficiency. What is more important, DMs can clearly be aware of their
   following choices according to the corresponding transition information.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to conflict analysis theory by
   designing a new model and develops a new graph model for managing the
   supply chain quality of a complex product.}},

   composites. The technique of electrospinning was used to enhance the
   dispersion of nanofillers by embedding the fillers in the polymer. The
   thermo-gravimetric analysis(TGA) of the composites has shown that the
   interfacial bonding between the fillers and the polymer matrix is strong
   in those samples prepared using the ES technique, which agrees with the
   uniform filler morphology observed in the SEM images. Further, it has
   been shown that heat resistance, tensile strength, and elongation at
   break for electrospun SiR samples are better than those for
   conventionally prepared samples. Similarly, for epoxy composites
   prepared using ES technique, a significant improvement In thermal
   properties have been obtained.}},

   conditions. The main objective of this field study was to measure and
   compare the amplitude of load- and thermal-induced strains over a 1-year
   monitoring period. Results indicated that the average monthly
   thermal-induced strains were higher than the load-induced strains by a
   49 kN wheel load moving at 25 km/h. Although the frequency of
   thermal-induced strains is lower than the traffic loads, damage from
   thermal-induced strains could be more than load-induced strains due to

Abstract = {{We study a problem of stochastic control in mathematical finance, for
   which the asset prices are modeled by Ito processes. The market
   parameters exhibit ``regime-switching{''} in the sense of being adapted
   to the joint filtration of the Brownian motion in the asset price models
   and a given finite-state Markov chain which models ``regimes{''} of the
   market. The goal is to minimize a general quadratic loss function of the
   wealth at close of trade subject to the constraint that the vector of
   dollar amounts in each stock remains within a given closed convex set.
   We apply a conjugate duality approach, the essence of which is to
   establish existence of a solution to an associated dual problem and then
   use optimality relations to construct an optimal portfolio in terms of
   this solution. The optimality relations are also used to compute
   explicit optimal portfolios for various convex cone constraints when the
   market parameters are adapted specifically to the Markov chain.}},

Title = {{Total dynamic response of a PSS vehicle negotiating asymmetric road
   excitations}},
Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{1835-1859}},
Abstract = {{A planar suspension system (PSS) is a novel automobile suspension system
   in which an individual spring-damper strut is implemented in both the
   vertical and longitudinal directions, respectively. The wheels in a
   vehicle with such a suspension system can move back and forth relative
   to the chassis. When a PSS vehicle experiences asymmetric road
   excitations, the relative longitudinal motion of wheels with respect to
   the chassis in two sides of the same axle are not identical, and thus
   the two wheels at one axle will not be aligned in the same axis. The
   total dynamic responses, including those of the bounce, pitch and the
   roll of the PSS vehicle, to the asymmetric road excitation may exhibit
   different characteristics from those of a conventional vehicle. This
   paper presents an investigation into the comprehensive dynamic behaviour
   of a vehicle with the PSS, in such a road condition, on both the
   straight and curved roads. The study was carried out using an 18 DOF
   full-car model incorporating a radial-spring tyre-ground contact model
   and a 2D tyre-ground dynamic friction model. Results demonstrate that
   the total dynamic behaviour of a PSS vehicle is generally comparable
   with that of the conventional vehicle, while PSS exhibits significant
   improvement in absorbing the impact forces along the longitudinal
   direction when compared to the conventional suspension system. The PSS
   vehicle is found to be more stable than the conventional vehicle in
   terms of the directional performance against the disturbance of the road
   potholes on a straight line manoeuvre, while exhibiting a very similar
   handling performance on a curved line.}},

Journal = {{FIBRES \& TEXTILES IN EASTERN EUROPE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6A}},
Pages = {{54-57}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates yarn abrasion behaviour based on the yarn
   structure, twist factor and fibre alignment at the rubbing contact
   points (twist direction at contact points). First yarns arranged at
   right angle (utilized with a high resolution camera) were introduced on
   a yarn abrasion tester and then the abrasion behaviour of the ring (R)
   and open-end rotor (O.E.) spun yarns were compared and analysed.
   Comparison of the yarns indicates that the abrasion resistance thereof
   is affected by the twist factor in a way that as the twist increases,
   the yarn on yarn abrasion cycles to failure follows the same trend as
   the effect of twist on the yarn strength (first an increase and then a
   decrease); that is, yarn on yarn abrasion resistance increases up to a
   certain degree (alpha=140 in ring spun yarn and alpha=156 in open-end
   rotor spun yarn), and then as the twist increases, the yarn on yarn
   abrasion resistance decreases. It also shows that the yarn abrasion
   cycle to failure is lower when the fibre alignments of the contact yarns
   are in the same direction. Close observation of the yarn rubbing also
   indicates that as the fibres are removed from the outer layers, the
   rotor spun yarn shows higher yarn on yarn abrasion resistance; that is,
   moving from the outer side to the interlayer of the rotor spun yarn, the
   relative yarn on yarn abrasion resistance (abrasion cycles to
   failure/yarn count) increases. This phenomenon indicates the fact that
   in open-end rotor spun yarn the compactness of the interlayer fibres are
   higher than the compactness of the outer layer fibres.}},

   Reliable routing framework (PSR) for emerging Wireless Body Area
   Networks (WBANs). It can be integrated with a specific routing protocol
   to improve the latter's reliability and prevent data injection attacks
   during data communication. In PSR, using past link quality measurements,
   each node predicts the quality of every incidental link, and thus any
   change in the neighbor set as well, for the immediate future. When there
   are multiple possible next hops for packet forwarding (according to the
   routing protocol used), PSR selects the one with the highest predicted
   link quality among them. Specially-tailored lightweight source and data
   authentication methods are employed by nodes to secure data
   communication. Further, each node adaptively enables or disables source
   authentication according to predicted neighbor set change and prediction
   accuracy so as to quickly filter false source authentication requests.
   We demonstrate that PSR significantly increases routing reliability and
   effectively resists data injection attacks through in-depth security

Abstract = {{Barrier coverage problem in emerging mobile sensor networks has been an
   interesting research issue. Existing solutions to this problem aim to
   decide one-time movement for individual sensors to construct as many
   barriers as possible, which may not work well when there are no
   sufficient sensors to form a single barrier. In this paper, we try to
   achieve barrier coverage in sensor scarcity case by dynamic sensor
   patrolling. In specific, we design a periodic monitoring scheduling
   (PMS) algorithm in which each point along the barrier line is monitored
   periodically by mobile sensors. Based on the insight from PMS, we then
   propose a coordinated sensor patrolling (CSP) algorithm to further
   improve the barrier coverage, where each sensor's current movement
   strategy is decided based on the past intruder arrival information. By
   jointly exploiting sensor mobility and intruder arrival information, CSP
   is able to significantly enhance barrier coverage. We prove that the
   total distance that the sensors move during each time slot in CSP is the
   minimum. Considering the decentralized nature of mobile sensor networks,
   we further introduce two distributed versions of CSP: S-DCSP and G-DCSP.
   Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CSP has a desired
   barrier coverage performance and S-DCSP and G-DCSP have similar
   performance as that of CSP.}},

Abstract = {{Without direct path, information delivery in sparse delay tolerant
   networks (DTNs) typically relies on intermittent relays, making the
   transmission not only unreliable but also time consuming. To make the
   matter even worse, the source nodes may transmit some encrypted
   ``junk{''} information, similar as the spam emails in current mail
   systems, to the destinations; without effective control, the delivery of
   encrypted junk information would significantly consume the precious
   resource of DTN and accordingly throttle the network efficiency. To
   address this challenging issue, we propose PRefilter, an efficient
   privacy-preserving relay filter scheme to prevent the relay of encrypted
   junk information early in DTNs. In PReFilter, each node maintains a
   specific filtering policy based on its interests, and distributes this
   policy to a group of ``friends{''} in the network in advance. By
   applying the filtering policy, the friends can filter the junk packets
   which are heading to the node during the relay. Note that the keywords
   in the filtering policy may disclose the node's interest/preference to
   some extent, harming the privacy of nodes, a privacy-preserving
   filtering policy distribution technique is introduced, which will keep
   the sensitive keywords secret in the filtering policy. Through detailed
   security analysis, we demonstrate that PReFilter can prevent stron
   privacy-curious adversaries from learning the filtering keywords, and
   discourage a weak privacy-curious friend to guess the filtering keywords
   from the filtering policy. In addition, with extensive simulations, we
   show that PReFiter is not only effective in the filtering of junk
   packets but also significantly improve the network performance with the
   dramtically reduced delivery cost due to the junk packets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the asymptotic capacity and delay performance of
   social-proximity urban vehicular networks with inhomogeneous vehicle
   density are analyzed. Specifically, we investigate the case of N
   vehicles in a grid-like street layout while the number of road segments
   increases linearly with the population of vehicles. Each vehicle moves
   in a localized mobility region centered at a fixed social spot and
   communicates to a destination vehicle in the same mobility region via a
   unicast flow. With a variant of the two-hop relay scheme applied, we
   show that social-proximity urban networks are scalable: a constant
   average per-vehicle throughput can be achieved with high probability.
   Furthermore, although the throughput and delay of a unicast flow may
   degrade in a high density area, almost constant per-vehicle throughput
   Omega(1/log (N)) and almost constant delay O(log(2) (N)) (except for the
   polylogarithmic factor) are still achievable with high probability. By
   identifying the key impact factors of performance mathematically, our
   results should provide insight on the design and deployment of future

Abstract = {{As an important component of smart grid, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
   system is recently introduced to enable bidirectional energy delivery
   between the power grid and plug-in electric vehicles. Communication
   technology is incorporated to facilitate the energy delivery by
   providing electricity pricing and energy demand information. However,
   different from the stationary energy storage systems, the energy
   store-carry-and-deliver mechanism for a V2G system poses new challenges
   for performance optimization, such as bi-directional energy flow and
   non-stationary energy demand. How to utilize the statistical information
   provided by the communication system to achieve efficient energy
   delivery is critical for a V2G system and is still an open issue. In
   this paper, we address a specific problem in this new research area,
   i.e., daily energy cost minimization of vehicle owners under time-of-use
   (TOU) electricity pricing. We investigate a plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicle (PHEV) with a realistic battery model, which is general for both
   battery electric cars and plug-in hybrids. A dynamic programming
   formulation is established by considering the bidirectional energy flow,
   non-stationary energy demand, battery characteristics, and TOU
   electricity price. We prove the optimality of a state-dependent
   double-threshold (or (S,S')) policy based on the stochastic inventory
   theory. A modified backward iteration algorithm is devised for practical
   applications, where an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
   algorithm is used to estimate the statistics of PHEV mobility and energy
   demand. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by
   simulations based on survey and real data collected from Canadian
   households. Numerical results indicate that our proposed scheme performs
   closely to a scheme with a priori knowledge of the PHEV mobility and
   energy demand information. Compared with the existing approaches, the
   proposed scheme can achieve energy cost reduction, which increases with
   the battery capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Femtocell refers to a new class of low-power, low-cost base stations
   (BSs) which can provide better coverage and improved voice/data Quality
   of Service (QoS). Hybrid access in two-tier macro-femto network is
   regarded as the most ideal access control mechanism to enhance overall
   network performance. But the implementation of hybrid access is hindered
   by a lack of market that can motivate ACcess Permission (ACP) trading
   between Wireless Service Providers (WSPs) and private femtocell owners.
   In this paper, we propose a reverse auction framework for fair and
   efficient ACP transaction. Unlike strict outcome (the demand of bidder
   must be fully satisfied) in most of the existing works on auction
   design, the proposed auction model allows range outcome, in which WSP
   accepts partial demand fulfillment and femtocell owners makes
   best-effort selling. We first propose a Vickery-Clarke-Grove (VCG) based
   mechanism to maximize social welfare. As the VCG mechanism is too
   time-consuming, we further propose an alternative truthful mechanism
   (referred to as suboptimal mechanism) with acceptable polynomial
   computational complexity. The simulation results have shown that the
   suboptimal mechanism generates almost the same social welfare and the
   cost for WSP as VCG mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Open source projects incorporate bug triagers to help with the task of
   bug report assignment to developers. One of the tasks of a triager is to
   identify whether an incoming bug report is a duplicate of a pre-existing
   report. In order to detect duplicate bug reports, a triager either
   relies on his memory and experience or on the search capabilities of the
   bug repository. Both these approaches can be time consuming for the
   triager and may also lead to the misidentification of duplicates.
   In the literature, several approaches to automate duplicate bug report
   detection have been proposed. However, there has not been an exhaustive
   comparison of the performance of different IR models, especially with
   topic-based ones such as LSI and LDA. In this paper, we compare the
   performance of the traditional vector space model (using different
   weighting schemes) with that of topic based models, leveraging
   heuristics that incorporate exception stack frames, surface features,
   summary and long description from the free-form text in the bug report.
   We perform experiments on subsets of bug reports from Eclipse and
   Firefox and achieve a recall rate of 60\% and 58\% respectively. We find
   that word-based models, in particular a Log-Entropy based weighting
   scheme, outperform topic based ones such as LSI, LDA and Random
   Projections. Our findings also suggests that for the problem of
   duplicate bug detection, it is important to consider a project's domain
   and characteristics to devise a set of heuristics to achieve optimal
   results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider femtocell networks and focus on interference
   mitigation in a novel framework referred to as FemtoWoC architecture
   (Wireless over Cable architecture for femtocells) {[}1]. This framework
   enables centralized processing (joint decoding) of multiple femto base
   stations at a central place termed as femto control station (FCS). The
   full blown up maximum likelihood centralized decoding at FCS will go
   beyond any acceptable limits. This paper proposes a novel dual-stage
   receiver architecture which achieves the tradeoff of centralized
   processing (joint decoding) and complexity. The basic idea is two folds,
   i.e. using some linear processing to reduce the dimension of the
   femtocell system followed by some nonlinear processing to exploit
   dominant interferences. The resultant multi-stage receiver is
   characterized by the performance closer to that of an optimal receiver
   but with much less complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The amalgamation of technology and service-based economy was the impetus
   of a new IT delivery model called ``Cloud Computing.{''} Unsurprisingly,
   the new model created a state of confusion; new concepts are mixed with
   old ones, and some old technologies are being reinvented. Today, many
   research areas and projects under the cloud umbrella need to be sorted
   and classified. Additionally, many gaps need to be categorized so that
   each research area can be tackled by its experts. It is important to
   learn from what already exists, and to be able to distinguish between
   what is new and what can be reused. Accordingly, this survey article
   presents a unified view of the Cloud Computing main concepts,
   characteristics, models, and architectures. Moreover, it presents a
   landscape of research in Cloud Computing by highlighting relevant
   disciplines and some diligent research projects. This helps identify the
   underlying research gaps and elaborates on the corresponding challenges.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an asynchronous scheduling algorithm for
   high-throughput stochastic low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders.
   Stochastic computation provides ultra-low-complexity hardware and can be
   implemented using binary or multiple-valued logic gates. Using
   asynchronous control, it also eliminates a global clock signal and
   therefore eases the worst-case timing restrictions. A timing model of
   asynchronous-computation behaviours under a 90nm CMOS technology is used
   to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm with an optimized computation
   delay properly decodes a regular (1024, 512) LDPC code without the
   ``lock-up{''} problem that potentially stops decoding before convergence
   and hence causes loss in coding gain. Based on our models, the proposed
   scheme achieves up to 7.37x improvement in decoding throughput with
   comparable BER performance in comparison with performance results of a
   conventional synchronous stochastic decoder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider service-oriented mobile social networks
   (S-MSNs) and propose a Secure and Efficient sErvice Review (SEER) system
   to enable user feedback. Each service provider independently maintains a
   SEER system for itself, which collects and stores user reviews about its
   services without requiring any central trusted authority. The service
   reviews can then be made available to interested users in making wise
   service selection decisions. We identify three unique service review
   attacks and then develop sophisticated security mechanisms for SEER to
   deal with these attacks. Specifically, SEER enables users to
   distributedly and cooperatively submit their reviews in an integrated
   chain form by using hierarchical and aggregate signature techniques. It
   discourages service providers to reject, modify or delete their reviews.
   The integrity of reviews is therefore improved. Through security
   analysis and performance evaluation, we show that SEER effectively
   resists the service review attacks and achieves significantly better
   performance in terms of submission rate and delay than a service review
   system that does not adopt user cooperation or the chain review
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The tracking voltage in the inclined plane test with AC is compared to
   the tracking voltage with DC, using the initial-tracking-voltage test
   method as per ASTM D2303 and a proposed coefficient of variation
   parameter. The severity of DC, as opposed to AC voltage, on RTV silicone
   rubber materials is confirmed using both strategies, where +DC is found
   to be the most severe voltage. The leakage current waveforms are found
   to consist of two components corresponding to wetting of the surface and
   to dry-band arcing. The mean value of the leakage current is a
   reflection of the wetting of the surface; whereas, the leakage current
   variation is a reflection of the dry-band arcing. Accordingly, a
   coefficient of variation parameter is proposed as an indicator of the
   relative severity of the dry band-arcing. Employing this coefficient of
   variation parameter, the ratios of the equivalent +DC and -DC to AC
   initial-tracking voltage are attained for 30 wt\% silica filled two-part
   RTV silicone rubber. The results obtained using the coefficient of
   variation parameter have been verified experimentally using the
   initial-tracking-voltage in ASTM D2303.}},

Abstract = {{Electroosmotic effect is usually utilized to generate the flow field in
   microfluidic systems. In many of these microdevices, an accurate control
   over the output flow rate of the microfluidic part is necessary for the
   successful operation of the whole system. In this study, a combined
   feedback/feedforward strategy is proposed to control the output flow
   rate in a micro-T-junction. First, finite element model of the
   electroosmotic flow in the T-junction is generated; second, using the
   adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, the finite element model forms a
   basis for generating training data for building an inverse model of the
   flow in the micro-T-junction. This inverse model serves as a controller
   in the feedforward part of the system. Then, in order to make the
   controller robust against disturbances and uncertainties such as
   dimensional tolerances, a Mamdani-type fuzzy logic controller is
   incorporated in the feedback part of the controller. Finally, simulation
   results are presented in order to proof the performance of the designed
   controller.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a self-timed overlapped search mechanism for
   high-throughput content-addressable memories (CAMs) with low search
   energy. Most mismatches can be found by searching the first few bits in
   a search word. Consequently, if a word circuit is divided into two
   sections that are sequentially searched, most match lines in the second
   section are unused. As searching the first section is faster than
   searching an entire word, we could potentially increase throughput by
   initiating a second-stage search on the unused match lines as soon as a
   first-stage search is complete. The overlapped search mechanism is
   realized using a self-timed word circuit that is independently
   controlled by a locally generated control signal, reducing the power
   dissipation of global clocking. A 256 x 144-bit CAM is designed under in
   90 nm CMOS that operates with 5.57x faster throughput than a synchronous
   CAM, with 38\% energy saving and 8\% area overhead.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Thiocarboxylate-functionalized silver nanoparticles (NPs) were
   synthesized and characterized in terms of their thermal and electrical
   properties. Thiocarboxylic acids with chain lengths of 3 and 11 carbons
   were used to functionalize silver NPs, leading to the formation of NPs
   smaller than 5 nm. We found that silver NPs, functionalized with a
   short-chain acid, were twice smaller than those with a long-chain acid.
   Electrical conductivity measurements showed that the short-chain
   functionalized NPs were electrically conductive while the long-chain
   functionalized ones were nonconductive. The short-chain functionalized
   NPs were incorporated into a conventional electrical conductive adhesive
   (ECA) composite, consisting of micron-sized silver particles and an
   epoxy matrix to form a hybrid-designed ECA. The electrical conductivity
   measurements and SEM images of the cross-section of the cured hybrid
   composite showed that lower contents of the NPs (<20 wt\% of the silver
   microparticles) increased the electrical conductivity due to the filling
   of NPs into the interstices of the micron-sized particles as well as
   their low sintering temperature, whereas higher NPs contents reduced the
   electrical conductivity because they clustered and increased the gaps
   between the microparticles. We attributed the positive effect of
   synthesized NPs on the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite to
   their small size (<5 nm) and the specific design of the covering layer
   over the surface of NPs. These research findings provide insights into
   the relationship between the overall properties of the nanocomposites
   and the nanoparticles' surface chemistry, size and weight fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this work is to develop a simple residual-based
   error indicator in the context of the finite-volume method that is as
   easy to use as conventional gradient-based error indicators and as
   robust as residual-based error indicators. The residual is defined as
   the cell imbalance error or rather the net flow error across the faces
   of each control-volume. To estimate the residual, the neglected Taylor
   series terms in the discretization of the face flows are used. Then a
   simplified residual-based error indicator suitable for isotropic
   triangular meshes is developed. A mesh adaptation scheme is used to
   minimize the global value of the error indicator through local
   refinement, coarsening, and vertex repositioning. The adaptation results
   for the lid-driven cavity flow at Re = 1,600 and the impinging slot jet
   flow at Re = 500 confirm that the proposed adaptation scheme can
   effectively decrease the discretization error by an order of magnitude

Abstract = {{We report a crack-free controlled wrinkling method based on a bilayer
   film system. A liquid UV-curable film is solidified on a uniaxially
   pre-stretched PDMS elastic sheet by UV-exposure. Subsequently, the sheet
   is released back to its initial non-stretched state, which results in
   spontaneous formation of grating wrinkles perpendicular to the
   stretching direction. An interface of gradient interpenetrating polymer
   networks (IPN) is considered to be formed between the stiff UV-cured
   film and the elastic support, which is practically beneficial for
   preventing crack formation and film delamination during the strain
   relaxation process. The periodicity of the gratings is tuned by
   controlling the thickness of the UV-cured polymer film and the amplitude
   of pre-strain of the elastic sheet. The imprinting results demonstrate
   that these self-formed wrinkles can serve as a mold to duplicate
   gratings by nanoimprint lithography. Furthermore, metal gratings are
   successfully fabricated from the wrinkling molds.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency (RF)-based energy transmission enables controllable and
   simultaneous power delivery to wireless sensors. In such applications,
   RF energy transmission is likely to be affected by highly conductive
   (metallic) environments. Understanding metal's influence on power

   the behavior of RF energy transmission in selected scenarios by
   measuring return loss and peak received power. Visualized energy flow is

   results are consistent with conclusions drawn from experimental results

Abstract = {{Long term mechanical behavior of polyethylene (PE) is of great
   importance especially in cases where structural integrity is required.
   In order to predict characteristics of the mechanical behavior of PE, it
   is necessary to fully understand the molecular structure of the employed
   resins. In this study, evaluation of several micromolecular properties
   of PE is conducted. These properties influence an important performance
   indicator of PE for structural applications, namely, the environmental
   stress cracking resistance (ESCR). ESCR in PE resins occurs through a
   slow crack growth mechanism under low applied stresses and long periods
   of time. This property is usually assessed by unreliable and time
   consuming testing methods such as the notch constant load test (NCLT) on
   notched PE specimens in the presence of an aggressive fluid at elevated
   temperatures. In the work presented herein, relationships between
   molecular structure and material response characteristics, mainly
   between molecular weight properties and short chain branching content in
   relation to strain hardening behavior of PE resins, were investigated
   based on results from tensile experiments. Inter-lamellar entanglements
   are believed to be the main feature controlling slow crack growth of PE.
   Extent of entanglements and entanglement efficiency has been
   investigated by monitoring the strain hardening behavior of PE resins in
   solid state through a uniaxial tensile test. The hardening stiffness
   (HS) test for prediction of ESCR was refined and improved to cover a
   broader range of PE resins, along with easier sample preparation, and
   faster testing. The improved test offers a more reliable and consistent
   ESCR picture without the drawbacks of the subjective notching process
   and ad-hoc presence of aggressive fluids.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{581-617}},
Abstract = {{In spite of the potential benefits of board IT governance and the costs
   of ineffective oversight, there has been little field-based research in
   this area and an inadequate application of theory. Drawing upon
   strategic choice and institutional theories, we propose a theoretical
   model that seeks to explain the antecedents of board IT governance and
   its consequences. Survey responses from 188 corporate directors across
   Canada indicate that both board attributes and organizational factors
   influence board involvement in IT governance. The results suggest that
   proportion of insiders, board size, IT competency, organizational age,
   and role of IT influence the board's level of involvement in IT
   governance. The responses also indicate that board IT governance has a
   positive impact on the contribution of IT to organizational performance.
   Overall, the results support the integration of strategic choice and
   institutional theories to explain the antecedents to board IT governance
   and its consequences, as together they provide a more holistic framework
   with which to view board IT governance.}},

Abstract = {{Space inflatable technology is a promising solution to placing large
   metrology systems in space. Lighter weight, higher packaging efficiency,
   and easier maintenance are among a few of their advantages over
   mechanically deployed structures. On the other hand, their large volume
   after deployment makes them susceptible to disturbances in space.
   Therefore, vibration control is one major issue for this technology. The
   present work is an extension of the previous work of the author on
   continuum modeling of these structures for their vibrations analysis.
   Kinetic and strain energy expressions of the fundamental lattice
   elements of a structure are expanded in terms of the nodal displacement
   components. Certain assumptions are made to reduce the order of strain
   components in a three-dimensional structure in order to find the
   equivalent continuum model. Additionally, this work includes the effects
   of strain rates on the kinetics of these structures. The frequency
   results for various structures are compared to those of a previous model
   which neglects such effects. It is shown that the frequency changes are
   noticeable when the strain rate components are included in the kinetic
   energy derivations.}},

   0.51\%C steel and a 0.50\%C powder forged (PF) steel were fatigue tested
   under fully reversed (R=-1) push-pull loading conditions. Following long
   life (107) cycling, shot-peening had little effect on the fatigue limit
   of the 0.39\%C and 0.72\%C steels whereas the fatigue limit of the PF
   steel increased 10.4\%. Conversely, the fatigue limit of the quenched
   and tempered steel decreased 12.0\% after shot-peening. The results
   showed that the beneficial effects of shot-peening, such as compressive
   residual stresses and work hardening, balanced the effects of surface
   roughness since crack initiation tended to occur below the surface.
   Microhardness profiles showed that the greatest amount of cyclic
   softening in the shot-peened regions occurred in the hot rolled steels.
   Softening was accompanied by a decrease in the depth of surface

Abstract = {{Maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) is usually used for estimating the
   probability density function under specified moment constraints. The
   density function is then integrated to obtain the cumulative
   distribution function, which needs to be inverted to obtain a quantile
   corresponding to some specified probability. In such analysis,
   consideration of higher order moments is important for accurate
   modelling of the distribution tail. There are three drawbacks for this
   conventional methodology: (1) Estimates of higher order (>2) moments
   from a small sample of data tend to be highly biased; (2) It can merely
   cope with problems with complete or non-censored samples; (3) Only
   probability weighted moments of integer orders have been utilized. These
   difficulties inevitably induce bias and inaccuracy of the resultant
   quantile estimates and therefore have been the main impediments to the
   application of the MaxEnt Principle in extreme quantile estimation.
   This paper attempts to overcome these problems and presents a
   distribution free method for estimating the quantile function of a
   non-negative random variable using the principle of maximum partial
   entropy subject to constraints of the partial probability weighted
   moments estimated from censored sample. The main contributions include:
   (1) New concepts, i.e., partial entropy, fractional partial probability
   weighted moments, and partial Kullback-Leibler measure are elegantly
   defined; (2) Maximum entropy principle is re-formulated to be
   constrained by fractional partial probability weighted moments; (3) New
   distribution free quantile functions are derived. Numerical analyses are
   performed to assess the accuracy of extreme value estimates computed
   from censored samples.}},

Title = {{Numerical implementation of a damage-coupled material law for
   semicrystalline polyethylene}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{295-320}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a computational
   procedure for a novel damage-coupled material law for semicrystalline
   polyethylene. Using a damage mechanics approach, the model seeks to gain
   insight into the mechanical behaviour of polyethylene considering the
   microstructure and degradation processes occurring under uniaxial
   tension.
   Design/methodology/approach - The material morphology is modelled as a
   collection of inclusions. Each inclusion consists of crystalline
   material lying in a thin lamella attached to an amorphous layer. The
   interface region interconnecting the two phases is the plane through
   which loads are carried and transferred by the tie molecules. It is
   assumed that the constitutive model contains complete information about
   the mechanical behaviour and degradation processes of each constituent.
   After modelling the two phases independently, the inclusion behaviour is
   found by applying some compatibility and equilibrium restrictions along
   the interface plane.
   Findings - The model provides a rational representation of the damage
   process of the intermolecular bonds holding crystals and of the
   tie-molecules connecting neighbouring crystallites. The model is also
   used to analyze the degree of relationship between some of the material
   properties and the mechanical responses.
   Practical implications - In practice, the numerical model clearly helps
   to understand the influence of the different microstructure properties
   on the tensile mechanical behaviour of semicrystalline polyethylene - an
   issue of particular interest in improving material processability and
   product performance.
   Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, a phenomenon such as
   microstructural degradation of polyethylene has not received much
   attention in the literature. The proposed model successfully captures
   aspects of the material behaviour considering crystal fragmentation and
   tie-molecule rupture.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (kLa) is one of the
   most important parameters for the evaluation of the performance of a
   gas-inducing agitated tank (GIAT). In this paper, two equations in terms
   of power input per unit liquid volume (P/VL) and relative gas dispersion
   parameter (NI/Ncd), respectively, are developed according to data in
   literature. They can correlate existing kLa values within +/-20\% of
   measured ones for bladed impellers with different impeller submergence
   to tank diameter ratios in the range of 0.5 -1.23. In order to validate
   these equations, the liquid phase mass transfer coefficients in a
   continuous GIAT equipped with a 4-blade straight impeller were measured
   by removal of oxygen from water. It was found that the equation in P/VL
   criterion could correlate kLa values within +/-12\% of the experimental
   data, and the equation in NI/Ncd criterion could correlate kLa values
   within +/-15.6\% with an exception of 26.8\% for NI = 16.7 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) is one of the most important pieces
   of data being used widely in planning, design, operation and management
   of roads and facilities. A reliable estimate of AADT has always been one
   of the main interests of transportation and highway agencies.
   Traditionally, AADTs are estimated for the majority of road segments of
   a network from short-term traffic counts (STTCs or coverage counts) by
   applying a set of expansion factors derived from permanent traffic
   counts (PTCs). Literature indicates that the FHWA (Federal Highway
   Administration) method may be most widely used. In this method, roads in
   the same functional class are assumed to have similar traffic patterns,
   and the factors derived from PTC data collected from the class is used
   to convert STTCs to AADT estimates. However, it should be noted that,
   because roads from a functional class do not necessarily have similar
   seasonal traffic variations, this method may sometimes produce large
   estimation errors. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel
   pattern-matching method, which constructs a seasonal traffic variation
   profile for a short-term counting site using all historical counts
   available and then use this profile to assign the site to a PTC or a PTC
   group. In addition, a Bayesian approach is developed to explicitly
   consider and show the ``risk or uncertainty{''} associated with
   assigning each short-term counting site to different PTC or PTC groups.
   Study results based on the simulated STTCs from a permanent counter on a
   winter recreational road in Alberta, Canada show that the new method
   proposed can limit the 95th percentile (P95) AADT estimation error to
   less than 13\%, in contrast to 21.7\% from the FHWA method. Moreover, it
   should be noted that the proposed method will not impose any additional
   monitoring cost, or make any change to existing traffic monitoring
   programs, and therefore it will be easy for highway agencies to
   incorporate the proposed method in their practice. (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Many impact studies require climate change information at a finer
   resolution than that provided by Global Circulation Models (GCMs). This
   paper investigates the impact of climate change on maximum and minimum
   temperatures (i.e., predictands) of 14 meteorological stations in the
   Upper Thames River Basin (UTRB), Ontario, Canada. The data used for
   evaluation were large-scale predictor variables, extracted from
   NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set and the simulations from third-generation
   Canadian Coupled Global Climate model (CGCM3). Data for four grid points
   covering the study region were used for developing the downscaling
   model. A downscaling method based on neural network was applied to
   project predictands generated from GCM using three scenarios (A1B, A2
   and B1). The potential of the downscaling models in simulating
   predictands was evaluated and downscaling results reveal that the
   proposed downscaling model can reproduce local daily predictands from
   large-scale weather variables. Trends of projected maximum and minimum
   temperatures were studied for historical as well as downscaled values
   using GCM and scenario uncertainty. There is most likely an increasing
   trend for Tmax and Tmin for A2 scenario whereas no trend has been
   observed for B1 scenarios during 2081-2100.}},

Title = {{Self-assembling peptide-based nanoparticles enhance anticancer effect of
   ellipticine in vitro and in vivo}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{3221-3233}},
Abstract = {{Background and methods: Applications of the anticancer agent,
   ellipticine, have been limited by its hydrophobicity and toxicity. An
   efficient delivery system is required to exploit the enormous potential
   of this compound. Recently, EAK16-II, an ionic-complementary,
   self-assembling peptide, has been found to stabilize ellipticine in
   aqueous solution. Here, the anticancer activity of ellipticine
   encapsulated in EAK16-II (EAK-EPT) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
   Results: Our cellular uptake, toxicity, and apoptosis results in an A549
   human lung carcinoma cell line indicate that EAK-EPT complexes are
   significantly more effective than treatment with EAK16-II or ellipticine
   alone. This is due to the ability of EAK16-II to stabilize ellipticine
   in a protonated state in well formed nanostructures approximately 200 nm
   in size. In vivo observations in an A549 nude mouse tumor model show
   higher antitumor activity and lower cytotoxicity of EAK-EPT complexes
   than in the control group treated with ellipticine alone. Tumor growth
   in animals was significantly inhibited after treatment with EAK-EPT
   complexes, and without any apparent side effects.
   Conclusion: The anticancer activity observed in this study coupled with
   minimal side effects encourages further development of peptide-mediated
   delivery of anticancer drugs, ellipticine in the present case, for
   clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptosporidium and Giardia were characterized in a watershed in
   southern Ontario, Canada, over a 2 1/2 year period. River samples were
   collected every two weeks, primarily near a municipal drinking water
   treatment plant intake. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were frequently
   detected with an overall occurrence rate of 88 and 97\%, respectively.
   Giardia concentrations were higher than Cryptosporidium, with median
   values of 80 cysts 100 L-1 and 12 oocysts 100 L-1, respectively.
   Although pathogens rarely show a significant relationship with fecal or
   water quality indicators, this study determined that Cryptosporidium,
   but not Giardia, was significantly correlated with Escherichia coli,
   turbidity and river flow. There was no correlation between the two types
   of protozoa, and only Giardia showed a seasonal trend with higher
   concentrations at cold water temperatures. Cryptosporidium genotyping of
   all samples found that farm animals and wildlife were an important
   contributor of oocysts in the watershed, and that Cryptosporidium
   strains/genotypes of medium to high risk for human infection (C.
   hominis, C. parvum and C. ubiquitum) were detected in 16\% of samples.
   This study was able to identify Cryptosporidium host sources and human
   health risk, and to identify differences between Cryptosporidium and
   Giardia occurrence in the watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient transmission and bit allocation schemes are
   investigated in multi-source single-sink Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs). For transmission over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
   channels with path loss, this work shows that the overall energy
   consumption can be minimised if each sensor transmits with the minimum
   power and cooperates with others in Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
   mode. From the efficient correlated source coding perspective, the
   Slepian-Wolf coding theorem is applied. Jointly considering the two
   aspects, we propose a closed form bit allocation scheme to minimise the
   overall energy consumption. The underlying idea is to assign more bits
   to nodes with better channel conditions. Additionally, based on the
   definition of network lifetime as the time before the first sensor
   fails, we further maximise the network lifetime by developing a
   heuristic algorithm to balance energy consumption among sensors. The
   superiority of the proposed scheme is validated by both analytical and
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral amorphous selenium (a-Se) detectors based on the
   metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) device structure have been studied for
   indirect detector medical imaging applications. These detectors have
   raised interest due to their simple structure, ease of fabrication,
   high-speed, low dark current, low capacitance per unit area and better
   light utilization. The lateral device structure has a benefit that the
   electrode spacing may be easily controlled to reduce the required bias
   for a given desired electric field. In indirect conversion x-ray
   imaging, the scintillator is coupled to the top of the a-Se MSM
   photodetector, which itself is integrated on top of the
   thin-film-transistor (TFT) array. The carriers generated at the top
   surface of the a-Se layer experience a field that is parallel to the
   surface, and does not initially sweep them away from the surface.
   Therefore these carriers may recombine or get trapped in surface states
   and change the field at the surface, which may degrade the performance
   of the photodetector. In addition, due to the finite width of the
   electrodes, the fill factor of the device is less than unity. In this
   study we examine the effect of lateral drift of carriers and the fill
   factor on the photodetector performance. The impact of field magnitude
   on the performance is also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous selenium photodetectors, in both lateral and vertical

   these devices. Typically these devices are deposited on a solid glass
   substrate and are read out using thin-film-transistors (TFTs). With the
   advent of flexible TFTs, flexible electronics have become a viable
   technology. This technology may be leveraged for flexible imaging,
   however the detection and conversion materials that serve to convert the

   finite time between image acquisition leads to motion artifacts in the
   combined image. Motion artifacts lead to greater noise in the combined
   image and affect image quality, however the relationship between them is
   not clear. In this study we examine motion artifacts in dual-energy CEM
   and their impact on anatomical noise in the combined image and tumor
   detectability. To study the impact of motion artifacts, a cascaded
   systems model is extended to include such motion artifacts. An ideal

Abstract = {{We study the effect of energy weighting in Swank noise and Detective
   Quantum Efficiency (DQE) at zero spatial frequency with a detailed Monte
   Carlo (MC) transport code that includes the three-dimensional spatial
   and temporal transport of electron-hole pairs in semiconductor x-ray
   detectors. The transport model takes into account recombination and
   trapping of carriers including effects of Coulomb forces and external
   applied electric field. We report pulse-height spectra (PHS) for
   mono-energetic x rays from 6 to 28 keV photon energy with 0.5 keV step
   size, and for clinical mammography spectra. A first-approximation
   electronic noise model is included in the simulations. The Swank
   calculations take into account the entire PHS distribution while the
   DQE(0) is calculated from the simulated Swank factor, and quantum
   efficiency values from the PENELOPE database of attenuation
   coefficients. The simulated DQE(0) is based on the entire clinical x-ray
   spectrum and takes into account the energy distribution following
   Tapiovaara and Wagner's (Phys. Med. Biol. 30, 1985) description for the
   weighting of carrier transport processes. Swank and DQE simulations for
   semiconductor detectors can provide insight into the fundamental
   limitations and possible optimization of breast imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{Stabilized amorphous selenium (a-Se) is widely used for Digital Imaging
   Systems for medical applications due to its ability to be manufactured
   over large areas and because of its capability of relatively high charge
   collection efficiency. In this work we have shown the behavior of a
   gated selenium detector. A three-terminal photodetector is presented
   where the photoconductive layer is deposited on two coplanar electrodes
   on a corning glass substrate. These two coplanar electrodes act as the
   source and the drain. A third electrode is deposited on top of the
   photoconductor layer, which functions as the gate terminal of the
   device. This work investigates the feasibility of controlling the charge
   collection of a selenium-based photo-detector by applying voltage at the
   gate terminal. Three different types of structures of the three-terminal
   device are presented. In order to investigate the charge collection
   behavior both the thickness of the bulk and the distance between two
   electrodes have been varied. 20, 70 and 200 - micron device thicknesses
   were chosen while the electrode spacing was varied from 6 to 10 micron.
   In order to compare between the different types of devices a fixed level
   of electric field at 2.5 V/micron was applied across the bulk of the
   device. Result shows that the gate voltage can control the
   current-voltage transfer characteristics and is dependent on the
   incident radiation.
   One of the two main advantages of the gated photodetectors is that they
   can be manufactured with a simple fabrication process. The other
   advantage is that the gate voltage can control charge collection, which
   has the potential for eliminating the thin film transistor (TFT)
   switches in large-area direct or indirect X-ray imaging.}},

   and surface adhesion. Polymeric microactuator is an ionic polymer metal
   composite. The time-variant response of the polymeric microactuator is
   modelled based on a set of coupled electromechanical equations and an
   electric equivalent bulk of polymeric gel. The model reference adaptive
   control was constituted for precise position control of the microrobot.
   For the uncertainty parameter, the simulation of the microrobot's

Abstract = {{Calf serum lubricants consisting of various polypeptide constituent
   fractions are routinely used in knee wear simulators as part of the
   standardized test protocol. Three calf sera (bovine, new-born and alpha)
   were diluted as per the recommendation of ISO 14243-3 and used in
   displacement-controlled knee wear simulators to investigate their
   effects on polyethylene wear. Biochemical analyses included measuring
   total polypeptide degradation, electrophoretic profiles and
   low-molecular weight polypeptide concentrations to elucidate their
   involvement in the wear process. The effects of the various calf sera
   constituent fractions on microbial growth were also explored. The
   polyethylene wear rates and the results from the biochemical analyses
   for the three calf serum lubricants were all found to be statistically
   significantly different from each other. The lubricant derived from the
   alpha-calf serum was closest in constituent fractions to human synovial
   fluid. It also showed the lowest polyethylene wear rate (14.38 +/- 0.85
   mm(3)/million cycles) and the lowest amount of polypeptide degradation
   (7.77 +/- 3.87\%). Furthermore, the alpha-calf serum lubricant was
   associated with the least amount of change in the electrophoretic
   profile, the least change in low-molecular weight polypeptide
   concentration, and the lowest microbial growth in the presence of sodium
   azide (a microbial inhibitor conventionally used in implant wear
   testing). Replacing sodium azide with a broad spectrum
   antibiotic-antimycotic eradicated the microbial growth. Some speculation
   was entertained regarding the effect of alpha-calf serum on
   colloid-mediated boundary lubrication. Based on the results, it was
   recommended that ISO 14243-3 be modified to include guidelines on calf
   serum constituent fractions that would favour using alpha-calf serum in
   order to improve the fidelity of the simulation in knee implant wear
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a microfluidic lab-on-chip device that can detect
   algae and analyze ship's ballast water treatment performance according
   to the standard set by the International Convention for the Control and
   Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments. A microfluidic
   differential resistive pulse sensor (RPS) was employed to detect, count,
   and size two algae of different sizes, a larger alga,
   Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and a smaller one, Chlorella vulgaris.
   The number rate of the algae flowing through the sensing gate per 2 min
   is a linear function of the sample concentration. A number
   rate-concentration correlation curve was experimentally obtained and
   verified, and can be used to determine the algae concentration simply by
   counting the number of peaks within several minutes. This lab-on-chip
   device described in this article is sensitive enough to detect the algae
   killing efficiency by electrolysis treatment to the ballast water. Also,
   this device can be easily operated by nonprofessionals and thus has
   great potentials in shipboard on-site testing for port state control.}},

Abstract = {{The use of operable shading devices impacts building loads
   significantly. The need exists for an explicit treatment of window
   shading devices in the design of energy-efficient buildings through
   simulation. A general framework for modelling complex fenestration
   systems, the Complex Fenestration Construction (CFC), has recently been
   implemented in ESP-r. The underlying models have been developed with
   emphasis on computational efficiency and straightforward input
   requirements. The capabilities are summarized, and an overview of the
   solar-optical and thermal models is given. Simulations were carried out
   comparing the CFC in ESP-r to slat-type blind models in EnergyPlus. The
   results show good agreement between the two simulation programs. Work is
   ongoing to expand the types of shade layers available with the CFC.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of the theory of compressed sensing (CS) has revolutionized
   multiple areas of applied sciences, a particularly important instance of
   which is medical imaging. In particular, the theory provides a solution
   to the problem of long acquisition times, which is intrinsic in
   diffusion MRI (dMRI). As a specific instance of dMRI, this work focuses
   on high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), which is known to
   excel in delineating multiple diffusion flows through a given voxel
   within the brain. Specifically, to reduce the acquisition time, CS
   allows undersampling the HARDI data by employing fewer
   diffusion-encoding gradients than it is required by the classical
   sampling theory. Subsequently, the undersampled data is used to recover
   the original signals by means of non-linear decoding. In earlier
   reconstruction methods, such decoding has been carried out under a
   Gaussian model for measurement noises, instead of the Rician model which
   is known to prevail in MRI. Accordingly, the main contribution of the
   present work is twofold. First, we introduce a way to substantially
   improve the stability of the CS-based reconstruction of HARDI signals
   under the assumption of Gaussian noises. Second, we extend this approach
   to the case of Rician noise statistics. In addition to providing formal
   developments of the reconstruction algorithm based on Rician statistics,
   we also detail a computationally efficient numerical scheme which can be
   used to implement the above reconstruction. Finally, the methods based
   on the Gaussian and the Rician noise models are compared using both
   simulated and in-vivo MRI data under various measurement conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Cascode loads are commonly assumed to be frequency independent

   into the amplifier's frequency response. Unfortunately, when designing
   high-gain high-speed amplifiers based on ``all NMOS signal path{''}
   concepts, the pole-zero pair introduced by the PMOS cascode is likely to
   be located near the amplifier's closed-loop bandwidth. Unlike pole-zero
   pairs located far from the amplifier's closed-loop bandwidth, the effect
   of pole-zero pairs located near the amplifier's closed-loop bandwidth is
   highly dependent on the exact configuration of the amplifier. While not
   always possible, minimizing the capacitance on the cascode node
   minimizes the effects of this undesirable pole-zero pair.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to furnish the research and design
   communities with a simple and convenient means of predicting pressure
   drop for subsonic gas flow in microducts. The pressure drop is utilized
   to overcome the friction against the walls and simultaneously accelerate
   the flow to compensate for the decrease in density. A general pressure
   drop model for approximately isothermal subsonic gas flow in
   microchannels is proposed. The momentum changes due to gas acceleration
   along the channel are taken into account. The model is also extended to
   the transition regime by employing the appropriate second-order slip
   boundary conditions. As for subsonic gas flow, no solutions or graphical
   and tabulated data exist for almost all geometries when the outlet Mach
   number is greater than 0.3. The developed simple model fills this void
   and can be used for the practical engineering design of microchannels
   and nanochannels by the research and design communities.}},

   optimisation procedure has been introduced and its powerful performance
   validated on various size networks. The paper provides a description of
   the proposed asset management system and discusses its implementation in
   a user-friendly prototype that suits a large school board in North

   organisations with large building assets improve the overall condition

Abstract = {{Palm oil fuel ash is considered as an agro-waste material in Malaysia.
   Various investigations have been conducted on the use of palm oil fuel
   ash as a supplementary cementing material for concrete. In the present
   study, palm oil fuel ash was used as a partial replacement of normal
   portland cement to produce high-strength self-consolidating concrete. In
   total, twenty (20) self-consolidating concrete mixes were prepared by
   varying water to binder ratio, palm oil fuel ash content, and high-range
   water reducer dosage. Palm oil fuel ash was used by replacing 0-30\% of
   normal portland cement by weight at the water to binder ratios ranging
   from 0.25 to 0.40. The compressive, splitting tensile and flexural
   strengths, modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and
   porosity of various self-consolidating concrete mixes were investigated.
   However, the correlations between the hardened properties of concrete
   were emphasized in this study. The experimental findings revealed that
   strong correlations exist between different hardened properties of
   high-strength self-consolidating concrete.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF FRACTURE PROPERTIES ON THE BEHAVIOR OF FREE-FALL AND

Abstract = {{Naturally fractured petroleum reservoirs (NFRs) contribute significantly
   to worldwide oil and gas production. The oil production from NFRs is
   strongly affected by the flow communication between fractures and the
   surrounding matrix. The flow communication makes the gravity drainage
   processes in porous media with a network of fractures more complex
   because the flux between the two elements must be stipulated in terms of
   easily measured parameters. This paper provides details on the effects
   of fracture properties such as aperture, length, spacing, orientation,
   and also fracture pattern on the production rate, recovery factor,
   matrix-to-fracture transfer rate, viscous fingering, and capillary
   continuity in fractured porous media for gravity drainage processes.
   Experimental and theoretical studies were conducted to investigate the
   performance of free-fall gravity drainage (FFGD) and controlled gravity
   drainage (CGD) processes in unconsolidated fractured media using
   different test fluids. A total of seven fracture configurations were
   fabricated in prototypes to study the drainage behavior. Numerical
   simulations were also performed using COMSOL software to mathematically
   describe the behavior of the gravity drainage process in fractured media
   using the experimental data to validate the simulations. A good
   agreement between simulation and experimental results was achieved for
   both FFGD and CGD modes. The flow communication between the fracture and
   the matrix blocks played the most significant role in the drainage of
   liquid from the fractured media. Upon moderate inclination angles,
   enhanced production performance was achieved in CGD processes as they
   allowed more rapid liquid withdrawal compared to the porous media with
   vertical fractures, and the liquid recovery factor at gas breakthrough
   was also higher as a result of enhanced horizontal and vertical
   permeabilities. It was also found that it is possible to develop an
   isolated liquid phase above a horizontal fracture when the fracture
   aperture is higher than the value required to sustain capillary
   continuity between blocks.}},

Abstract = {{In many engineering systems, such as compact heat exchangers and
   microcoolers used in electronics packaging, system performance depends
   on laminar flow development in microchannels. This study investigates
   effects of Reynolds number, hydraulic diameter, and channel aspect ratio
   on the entrance length in rectangular microchannels. Numerical
   investigations were performed for microchannels with hydraulic diameters
   between 100 and 500 mu m, Reynolds numbers between 0.5 and 200, and
   channel aspect ratios between 1 and 5. The results show good agreement
   with available experimental data and are used to formulate new
   correlations for estimating the entrance length in microchannels.
   Compared to other correlations, these new correlations are shown to
   provide more accurate estimates of entrance length over a wider range of
   Reynolds numbers representative of practical flows in microchannels.

Abstract = {{Localized surface plasmon resonance, a property characteristic of metal
   nanoparticles, is a promising technique for the development of low cost,
   rapid, and portable biosensors for a variety of medical diagnostic
   applications. In order to meet the demanding detection limits required
   for many such applications, performance improvements are required.
   Designing nanoparticle structures to maximize refractive index
   sensitivity and optimize the electromagnetic field decay length is one
   approach to achieving better performance. However, experimentally
   finding the optimal nanoparticle structure, as has been done in the
   past, is time consuming and costly, and needs to be done for each
   biomolecule of interest. Instead, simulations can be used to find the
   optimal nanoparticle design prior to fabrication. In this paper, we
   present a numerical modeling technique that allows the design of optimal
   nanoparticles for LSPR biosensors, and report on the effect of the size
   and shape of gold nanoparticles on the sensitivity and decay length. The
   results are used to determine the optimal nanoparticle geometry for an
   LSPR immunosensor for heat shock protein 70, an important protein with
   applications in medical and wildlife diagnostics. Our simulations show
   an improvement of 373\% in sensor response when using the optimal
   configuration, showcasing the significant advantages of proper
   nanoparticle design.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into the effects of dry plasma etching release process
   parameters, local wafer position and induced in-plane stress on the

   Yield is evaluated by observational measurements of the stiction of MEMS
   nanocantilevers fabricated alongside with bent beam strain sensors.
   Results show that lower yield is found for larger processing times as
   well as higher releasing temperatures. On the other hand, yield improves
   when thicker nanocantilevers are released using the same processing
   parameters. The distribution of process-induced in-plane stress of PECVD
   silicon nitride films is shown to change widely from compressive to
   tensile based on the local wafer position, whereas no clear correlation
   between stiction and stress distribution is found. Viability of
   determining MEMS yield at the wafer-level based on process-induced
   residual stress is discussed. Other possible root causes of yield in
   MEMS due to dry plasma release etching are also briefly touched.}},

Abstract = {{The gamma process is a stochastic cumulative process with gamma
   distributed increments. Professor van Noortwijk's research work played a
   key role in modelling uncertain and time-dependent degradation of
   structures as a gamma process, making it popular in the engineering

   maintenance decisions for berm breakwaters. Structural Safety, 18 (4),
   293-309). The maintenance optimisation models mostly use the renewal
   theorem to evaluate the asymptotic cost rate and use it to optimise the
   maintenance policy. However, many engineering structures have a
   relatively short and finite time horizon in which the application of the
   asymptotic formula becomes questionable. This article presents a finite
   time model for computing the expected cost of a condition-based
   maintenance program considering degradation as the gamma process. The
   article investigates the suitability of the asymptotic cost rate formula
   and provides a rich discussion about the qualitative nature of the

Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{19-41}},
Abstract = {{To absorb the vibrations and shocks caused by road obstacles effectively
   in any direction within the wheel rotation plane, a planar suspension
   system (PSS), in which there are spring-damper struts in both the
   vertical and longitudinal directions, is proposed to improve the ride
   quality of a vehicle with such novel suspension systems. The
   longitudinal spring-damper strut in a PSS is considerably soft compared
   with the longitudinal connection in a conventional suspension.
   Consequently, the wheels in a vehicle with PSS can move forth and back
   with respect to the body. The dynamic behaviours of a PSS vehicle under
   some special conditions, such as a differential braking in which the
   braking torque applied to the wheels at two sides of an axle are uneven,
   may exhibit special characteristics. The directional stability of the
   PSS vehicle in such a case may be one of the major concerns. The dynamic
   performance of the PSS vehicle in the differential braking condition is
   thus necessary to be investigated. This paper presents the investigation
   results of the transient response of a vehicle with the PSS in such a
   case. The simulation results are also compared with those of a similar
   vehicle with conventional suspensions. The study demonstrates that the
   PSS vehicle is directionally stable in differential braking conditions.
   The dynamic behaviour of the PSS vehicle is generally comparable with
   that of a conventional vehicle.}},

Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{395-413}},
Abstract = {{The longitudinal connection between a chassis and a wheel in a
   conventional vehicle suspension system is commonly very stiff compared
   with the vertical connection. Such a mechanism can efficiently isolate
   vibrations and absorb shocks in the vertical direction but cannot
   sufficiently attenuate the impact in the longitudinal direction. In
   order to overcome such a limitation, a planar suspension system (PSS)
   with spring-damper struts in both the longitudinal and vertical
   directions is proposed so that the vibration along any direction in the
   wheel rotation plane can be isolated. In this paper, the dynamic
   responses of a vehicle with PSS due to a single bump and random road
   unevenness are investigated. The ride quality of the vehicle with PSS is
   evaluated in accordance with ISO 2631. A comparison with that of a
   similar conventional vehicle is conducted to demonstrate the promising
   potentials of the PSS in improving the vehicle ride quality.}},

Abstract = {{Multiphase flow simulation in porous media requires understanding of the

   simulate time-dependent drainage in vertical porous physical models to
   investigate aspects of gravity drainage (free fall or controlled gravity
   drainage) on oil saturation distribution and oil production history. The
   effect of permeability heterogeneity in the form of fractures on the
   drainage process, as well as the evolution of relative permeability of
   the wetting and non-wetting phases, capillary pressure, and some other
   significant parameters, was mathematically investigated. The results

Journal = {{COMBUSTION THEORY AND MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{301-320}},
Abstract = {{Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is a closure model for
   turbulence-chemistry interactions. This model uses the first-order CMC
   hypothesis to close the chemical reaction source terms. The conditional
   scalar field is estimated by solving an integral equation using inverse
   methods. It was originally developed and has been used extensively in
   non-premixed combustion. This work is the first application of this
   combustion model for a premixed flame. CSE is coupled with a Trajectory
   Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) model for chemistry. The
   CSE-TGLDM combustion model is used in a RANS code to simulate a
   turbulent premixed Bunsen burner. Along with this combustion model, a
   similar model which relies on the flamelet assumption is also used for
   comparison. The results of these two approaches in the prediction of the
   velocity field, temperature and species mass fractions are compared
   together. Although the flamelet model is less computationally expensive,
   the CSE combustion model is more general and does not have the limiting
   assumption underlying the flamelet model.}},

   3,6-di(furan-2-yl) pyrrolo{[}3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DBF)
   building block. As DBF acts as an acceptor moiety, a series of
   donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymers can be generated when it is attached
   alternatively with phenylene, naphthalene or anthracene donor comonomer
   blocks. Optical and electrochemical characterization of thin films of
   these polymers reveals band gaps in the range of 1.55-1.64 eV. These
   polymers exhibit excellent hole mobility when used as the active layer
   in organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices. Among the series, the
   highest hole mobility of 0.11 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) is achieved in bottom gate
   and top-contact OTFT devices using PDPP-FNF. When these polymers are
   used as a donor and {[}70]PCBM as the acceptor in organic photovoltaic
   (OPV) devices, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 2.5 and 2.6\% are
   obtained for PDPP-FAF and PDPP-FNF polymers, respectively. Such mobility
   values in OTFTs and performance in OPV make furan-containing DBF a very
   promising block for designing new polymer semiconductors for a wide
   range of organic electronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry of anatomical specimens is very complex and accurate 3D
   reconstruction is important for morphological studies, finite element
   analysis (FEA) and rapid prototyping. Although magnetic resonance
   imaging, computed tomography and laser scanners can be used for
   reconstructing biological structures, the cost of the equipment is
   fairly high and specialised technicians are required to operate the
   equipment, making such approaches limiting in terms of accessibility. In
   this paper, a novel automatic system for 3D surface reconstruction of
   the chick eye from digital photographs of a serially sectioned specimen
   is presented as a potential cost-effective and practical alternative.
   The system is designed to allow for automatic detection of the external
   surface of the chick eye. Automatic alignment of the photographs is
   performed using a combination of coloured markers and an algorithm based
   on complex phase order likelihood that is robust to noise and
   illumination variations. Automatic segmentation of the external
   boundaries of the eye from the aligned photographs is performed using a
   novel level-set segmentation approach based on a complex phase order
   energy functional. The extracted boundaries are sampled to construct a
   3D point cloud, and a combination of Delaunay triangulation and
   subdivision surfaces is employed to construct the final triangular mesh.
   Experimental results using digital photographs of the chick eye show
   that the proposed system is capable of producing accurate 3D
   reconstructions of the external surface of the eye. The 3D model
   geometry is similar to a real chick eye and could be used for
   morphological studies and FEA.}},

Abstract = {{The composites of (NaBH4+2Mg(OH)(2)) and (LiBH4+2Mg(OH)(2)) without and
   with nanometric Ni (n-Ni) added as a potential catalyst were synthesized
   by high energy ball milling. The ball milled NaBH4-based composite
   desorbs hydrogen in one exothermic reaction in contrast to its
   LiBH4-based counterpart which dehydrogenates in two reactions: an
   exothermic and endothermic. The NaBH4-based composite starts desorbing
   hydrogen at 240 degrees C. Its ball milled LiBH4-based counterpart
   starts desorbing at 200 degrees C. The latter initially desorbs hydrogen
   rapidly but then the rate of desorption suddenly decelerates. The
   estimated apparent activation energy for the NaBH4-based composite
   without and with n-Ni is equal to 152 +/- 2.2 and 157 +/- 0.9 kJ/mol,
   respectively. In contrast, the apparent activation energy for the
   initial rapid dehydrogenation for the LiBH4-based composite is very low
   being equal to 47 +/- 2 and 38 9 kJ/mol for the composite without and
   with the n-Ni additive, respectively. XRD phase studies after volumetric
   isothermal dehydrogenation tests show the presence of NaBO2 and MgO for
   the NaBH4-based composite. For the LiBH4-based composite phases such as
   MgO, Li3BO3, MgB2, MgB6 are the products of the first exothermic
   reaction which has a theoretical H-2 capacity of 8.1 wt.\%. However, for
   reasons which are not quite clear, the first reaction never goes to full
   completion even at 300 degrees C desorbing 4.5 wt.\% H-2 at this
   temperature. The products of the second endothermic reaction for the
   LiBH4-based composite are MgO, MgB6, B and LiMgBO3 and the reaction has
   a theoretical H-2 capacity of 2.26 wt.\%. The effect of the addition of
   5 wt.\% nanometric Ni on the dehydrogenation behavior of both the NaBH4-
   and LiBH4-based composites is rather negligible. The n-Ni additive may
   not be the optimal catalyst for these hydride composite systems although
   more tests are required since only one n-Ni content was examined.

Abstract = {{Materials tracking and locating, which can be accomplished through
   various technologies and data sources, are key elements affecting
   construction productivity. The need for developing fundamental methods
   to take advantage of the relative strengths of each technology and data
   source while dealing with their limitations motivates the development in
   this paper of data fusion methods for improving materials location
   estimation. Particular attention is paid to situations in a construction
   environment in which radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are
   attached to each piece of material, and the materials may be repeatedly
   moved around the site. The construction dynamics, the high noise ratio,
   and the limitations of the utilized sensing systems result in imperfect
   data that is imprecise and uncertain. A key challenge is using this
   imperfect data to improve accuracy and precision while maintaining
   cost-effectiveness and scalability. To address this issue, a hybrid
   data-fusion method was developed to increase confidence, accuracy and
   precision, and add robustness to measurement estimates. This hybrid
   method leverages evidential belief reasoning and soft computing
   techniques. The experimental results show that the hybrid fusion method
   outperforms the traditional methods in data fusion for location
   estimation. This study has successfully addressed the challenges of
   fusing data from a range of simple to complex sensor sources within a
   very noisy and dynamic construction environment. The results presented
   in this paper indicate that the proposed method has the potential to
   improve location estimation and to be robust to measurement noise and
   future advances in technology. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000101.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{343-358}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibrations of a pivoted, rigid, circular cylinder were
   investigated experimentally. A cylinder with a mass ratio of 15.9 and a
   moment of inertia ratio of 66.8 was investigated at a constant Reynolds
   number of 2100 for a range of reduced velocities, 3.4 <= U{*} <= 11.3,
   and damping ratios, 0.4\% <= zeta <= 41.1\%. A novel experimental set-up
   was designed to reproduce the orbiting response observed in some
   engineering applications involving vortex induced vibrations of
   cylindrical structures. The results show that, in the synchronization
   region, the frequencies of transverse and streamwise vibrations lock
   onto the natural frequency of the structure, and the cylinder traces
   elliptic trajectories. A mathematical model is introduced to investigate
   the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of the elliptic
   trajectories or the figure-8 type trajectories observed in previous
   laboratory studies. The results show that the occurrence of either
   elliptic or figure-8 type trajectory is governed primarily by structural
   coupling between vibrations in streamwise and transverse directions.
   Based on the experimental results, four distinct types of orbiting
   motion are identified in the synchronization region. Each of these four
   types corresponds to a specific range of phase angles between the
   streamwise and transverse vibrations defining the orientation of the
   trajectory and the direction of orbiting. The results indicate that the
   identified four types of elliptic trajectories are associated with four
   distinct ranges of a dimensionless parameter used to quantify structural
   coupling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Selection of representative emerging micropollutants for drinking water
   treatment studies: A systematic approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{414}},
Pages = {{653-663}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Micropollutants remain of concern in drinking water, and there is a
   broad interest in the ability of different treatment processes to remove
   these compounds. To gain a better understanding of treatment
   effectiveness for structurally diverse compounds and to be cost
   effective, it is necessary to select a small set of representative
   micropollutants for experimental studies. Unlike other approaches
   to-date, in this research micropollutants were systematically selected
   based solely on their physico-chemical and structural properties that
   are important in individual water treatment processes. This was
   accomplished by linking underlying principles of treatment processes
   such as coagulation/flocculation, oxidation, activated carbon
   adsorption, and membrane filtration to compound characteristics and
   corresponding molecular descriptors. A systematic statistical approach
   not commonly used in water treatment was then applied to a compound pool
   of 182 micropollutants (identified from the literature) and their
   relevant calculated molecular descriptors. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) was used to summarize the information residing in this large
   dataset. D-optimal onion design was then applied to the PCA results to
   select structurally representative compounds that could be used in
   experimental treatment studies. To demonstrate the applicability and
   flexibility of this selection approach, two sets of 22 representative
   micropollutants are presented. Compounds in the first set are
   representative when studying a range of water treatment processes
   (coagulation/flocculation, oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, and
   membrane filtration), whereas the second set shows representative
   compounds for ozonation and advanced oxidation studies. Overall,
   selected micropollutants in both lists are structurally diverse, have
   wide-ranging physico-chemical properties and cover a large spectrum of
   applications. The systematic compound selection approach presented here
   can also be adjusted to fit individual research needs with respect to
   type of micropollutants, treatment processes and number of compounds
   selected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structural similarity index (SSIM) is a well-known metric in the
   field of image quality assessment (IQA). It is a full-reference metric
   that uses a sliding window to determine local quality/distortion
   measures between two images (based on a combination of luminance,
   contrast, and structural measurements from each image's window), and
   combines the results to obtain a single value indicating the quality of
   the distorted image relative to its perfect reference image. The metric
   uses a window of arbitrary size and shape to compute the localized
   measurements, but no work has been done to determine the effects of
   different window selections. This paper provides insight into these
   effects by testing various window modifications against six
   publicly-available image quality databases. Optimal window results are
   presented as well as a visual mapping of window parameters vs.
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their relatively lower efficiency, nonviral approaches are

   Delivery of nucleic acids to the target site is an important factor for
   effective gene expression (plasmid DNA) or knockdown (siRNA) with
   minimal side effects. Direct deposition at the target site by physical
   methods, including ultrasound, electroporation and gene gun, is one
   approach for local delivery. For less accessible sites, the development
   of carriers that can home into the target tissue is required. Cationic
   peptides, lipoplexes, polyplexes and nanoplexes have been used as
   carriers for delivery of nucleic acids. Targeting ligands, such as cell
   targeting peptides, have also been applied to decorate delivery vehicles
   in order to enhance their efficacy. This review focuses on delivery
   strategies and recent progress in non-viral carriers and their

Abstract = {{We consider a K user Gaussian multiple access system with impulse radio
   ultra-wideband signaling. The receiver is assumed to treat the
   Multi-Access Interference (MAI) as additive noise and does not enjoy
   multiuser detection. It is well known that for such a system the MAI is
   neither Gaussian nor white. Although, the non-Gaussianity of the MAI has
   been extensively studied, little attention has been directed to the
   non-whiteness of it. In this paper, we show that by employing a new
   front-end filter at the receiver, the non-whiteness of the MAI can be
   exploited to improve the performance of the single-user detector. We use
   the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a merit to
   evaluate the performance improvement brought to the system. The SINR
   improvement depends on the interference level as well as pulse waveform.
   The bit error rate of the system is also simulated and compared with
   that of conventional matched filter receiver.}},

Title = {{Pseudonym Changing at Social Spots: An Effective Strategy for Location
   Privacy in VANETs}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{As a prime target of the quality of privacy in vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs), location privacy is imperative for VANETs to fully flourish.
   Although frequent pseudonym changing provides a promising solution for
   location privacy in VANETs, if the pseudonyms are changed in an improper
   time or location, such a solution may become invalid. To cope with the
   issue, in this paper, we present an effective pseudonym changing at
   social spots (PCS) strategy to achieve the provable location privacy. In
   particular, we first introduce the social spots where several vehicles
   may gather, e. g., a road intersection when the traffic light turns red
   or a free parking lot near a shopping mall. By taking the anonymity set
   size as the location privacy metric, we then develop two anonymity set
   analytic models to quantitatively investigate the location privacy that
   is achieved by the PCS strategy. In addition, we use game-theoretic
   techniques to prove the feasibility of the PCS strategy in practice.
   Extensive performance evaluations are conducted to demonstrate that
   better location privacy can be achieved when a vehicle changes its
   pseudonyms at some highly social spots and that the proposed PCS
   strategy can assist vehicles to intelligently change their pseudonyms at
   the right moment and place.}},

   Following a reflux and pyrolysis procedure, these materials were found

   displayed considerable ORR activity in neutral conditions, with insight
   into the mechanistic pathway of oxygen reduction presented. This work

Abstract = {{With the growing demand of Internet services, network operators have put
   significant efforts to improve network error resilience and efficiency.
   Since there exist different wired/wireless technologies for Internet
   access such as digital subscriber line (DSL), Ethernet, and worldwide
   interoperability for microwave access (WiMax), a mobile host can use
   multiple access networks simultaneously with multipath transmission.
   Taking the advantage of heterogeneous environment, multipath
   transmission through the Internet can improve service reliability and
   network flexibility. Ensuring a reliable end-to-end connection-oriented
   communication with satisfactory quality of service (QoS) and maintaining
   congestion control and flow control are the main responsibilities of the
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the dominant transport layer
   protocol in the Internet. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art
   of multipath transmission techniques for QoS provisioning in wireless
   Internet access, focusing on the end-to-end transport layer protocols.
   The main challenges for the design of multipath TCP are reviewed, and
   the existing transport layer congestion control schemes are categorized.
   Multipath TCP and stream control transmission protocol (SCTP)-based
   transport layer protocols are discussed, and their limitations and/or

Abstract = {{Wet pavement skidding due to inadequate surface texture or friction
   contributes to 20\% to 35\% of all wet weather crashes. Many of the past
   studies of pavement surface texture and friction have deficiency in
   selecting the model forms or variables and interpreting the models and
   (or) the findings or have recommended further investigation. These pose
   a challenge for the highway agencies in selecting the appropriate
   surface layer and (or) measuring tools. This study was undertaken to
   re-examine some of the pavement surface texture and skid resistance
   related issues and aid the highway agencies in this area. Pavement
   surface texture and skid resistance aspects were carefully examined
   using the data collected from nine asphalt concrete (AC) surfaces.
   Pavement surface texture was measured using the sand patch method and a
   high speed texture laser. Skid resistance was measured using a British
   Pendulum and a skid trailer. The analysis has reinstated that aggregate
   quality is the predominant factor for AC surface skid resistance. Both
   texture depth and ribbed tire skid resistance was shown to increase with
   an increase in coarse aggregate (CA) content proving their
   interdependency. Neither the voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) or air
   voids (AV) contents showed a meaningful or statistically significant
   correlation with the surface texture or skid resistance. Fairly good
   correlations were found among the British Pendulum number (BPN), ribbed
   tire skid number (SN) and mean texture depth (MTD) rejecting the
   hypothesis that BPN is a measure of only surface micro-texture and
   ribbed tire skid number is insensitive to surface texture.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we focus on the cell-edge users whose performance is
   severely limited by the interfering signals of diverse rates and
   strengths. In contrast to the suboptimal single-user detection, we
   propose an interference suppression strategy based on a low complexity
   matched filter (MF) based receiver. This proposed receiver exploits the
   structure of dominant interference in the detection process, instead of
   assuming it to be Gaussian and merging it in noise. This receiver is
   also characterized by the reduction of one complex dimension in the
   detection process thereby making it low complexity receiver structure.
   For comparison purposes, we also include the analysis of MMSE receiver
   and show that while MMSE detection loses one diversity order in the
   presence of one interferer, the proposed receiver recuperates the lost
   order of diversity. We further show that MMSE detection suffers from a
   coding loss as the interference gets stronger while the proposed
   receiver exhibits a coding gain as either the interference gets stronger
   or its modulation order decreases. Based on these results, we further
   propose a novel fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme for cellular
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel automated monitoring and control tool that
   integrates a finite state machine and windowing wavelet-based technique
   for pulsed electric field food processing units. The proposed tool uses
   the wavelet-based technique to partition voltage waveforms captured
   across a test cell into a series of events. A pair of proposed finite
   state machines utilises these events to monitor both arcing activities
   in the processed liquid and variations in the medium temperature.
   Abnormal activities are detected and classified in a way that enables
   control of the applied pulses to prevent undesired flashover that could
   damage the processed food or drive its temperature into a pasteurisation
   temperature. The automation features of the proposed technique are
   extracted from real data of orange juice, apple juice and water in
   pulsed electric field food processing units.}},

Abstract = {{Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft is a popular choice for ACL
   reconstruction. These grafts are subjected to cyclic loading during the
   activities of daily living. Significant knee laxity is observed in
   reconstructed knee shortly after reconstruction. The source of this
   laxity is not clear. The change in the tensile properties of the graft
   due to cyclic loading can be one of the reasons for the change in knee
   laxity.
   Twenty patellar tendons from fresh frozen cadaver knees were cyclically
   loaded at a stress amplitude equivalent to 33\% of the failure strength
   of the contralateral patellar tendon for 5000 cycles at 1.4 Hz. They
   were then tested in tension to failure. Failure properties and the low
   load properties such as toe-region modulus were calculated. The results
   were compared with those of contralateral patellar tendons that were not
   subjected to cyclic loading before testing to failure.
   Fatigue loading did not alter the failure and low load properties with
   the exception of failure strain which decreased by about 10\% (P<.05).
   Cyclically loaded patellar tendons with higher tissue mass density
   possess higher strength, modulus of elasticity, toughness, and
   transition stress (P<.05). The results indicate that there is no
   significant change in graft properties because of cyclic loading with
   the above load magnitude. The change in knee laxity observed after
   reconstruction, hence, is not because of change in graft properties due
   to moderate cyclic loading. Other factors, such as plastic deformation
   (yielding) of the graft, might play a role in increased knee laxity
   after reconstruction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shading devices attached to windows can be used to control solar gain
   and hence reduce building peak load and annual energy consumption. The
   performance of a shading device in this regard is strongly dependent on

   measurement technique that was used to obtain off-normal solar optical
   properties of flat shading materials. The off-normal properties were
   needed in order to develop solar optical property models both for
   shading materials and shading devices. These models provide useful input
   to building peak load calculation and annual energy simulation tools.
   Special sample holders were designed and fabricated to facilitate
   measurements using a commercial spectrophotometer with integrating

   doxorubicin in high yield (4\%-5\% wt/wt). The nanoparticles also
   controlled the release of doxorubicin over 24 h with a release profile
   that followed a Fickian diffusion model. The biocompatibility of
   curdlan-g-PEG was confirmed by hemolysis assay. This is the first
   nanoparticle formulated using the hydrophobicity of curdlan for
   concealing the immunomodulatory potential of curdlan within the core.}},

Volume = {{297}},

Abstract = {{Reactions were carried out between a low molecular weight, highly
   functionalized maleic anhydride-grafted polyethylene and
   hexamethylenediamine in a melt blender at 150 degrees C for various
   stoichiometric ratios of functional groups. For all compositions, two
   peaks were observed in the mixing torque data. The appearance of the
   first peak, observed soon after the introduction of the reactive mixture
   to the melt blender, was independent of composition. The second peak was
   composition-dependent. Gel content and FTIR analyses suggest that the
   first peak is a result of melting functionalized polyethylene and a
   reaction of the anhydride and amine functionalities, while the second
   was mainly a result of crosslinking. The time between the first and
   second peak defines a processing window, in which the reaction mixture
   is thermoplastic. Higher temperature melt processing of the
   thermoplastic reaction products converted these materials to thermosets.
   During this conversion, the progress of the anhydrideamine reaction was
   studied using FTIR, as well as by measuring the generation of the
   insoluble crosslinked material. The FTIR results reveal that the
   reaction between anhydride and amine moieties results in the formation
   of an amide intermediate, which then converts to cyclic imide at higher
   temperatures. The analysis suggests that the use of the FTIR anhydride
   absorption to assess the degree of reaction is misleading in these
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search (PA-DDS) has been
   modified to solve combinatorial multi-objective optimization problems.
   This new PA-DDS algorithm uses discrete-DDS as a search engine and
   archives all non-dominated solutions during the search. PA-DDS is also
   hybridized by a general discrete local search strategy to improve its
   performance near the end of the search. PA-DDS inherits the simplicity
   and parsimonious characteristics of DDS, so it has only one algorithm
   parameter and adjusts the search strategy to the user-defined
   computational budget. Hybrid PA-DDS was applied to five benchmark water
   distribution network design problems and its performance was assessed in
   comparison with NSGAII and SPEA2. This comparison was based on a revised
   hypervolume metric introduced in this study. The revised metric measures
   the algorithm performance relative to the observed performance variation
   across all algorithms in the comparison. The revised metric is improved
   in terms of detecting clear differences between approximations of the
   Pareto optimal front. Despite its simplicity, Hybrid PA-DDS shows high
   potential for approximating the Pareto optimal front, especially with
   limited computational budget. Independent of the PA-DDS results, the new
   local search strategy is also shown to substantially improve the final
   NSGAII and SPEA2 Pareto fronts with minimal additional computational
   expense.}},

Abstract = {{Motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) extracted via electromyographic
   (EMG) signal decomposition can aid in the diagnosis of neuromuscular
   disorders and the study of the neural control of movement, but only if
   they are valid. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM)-based
   supervised classifiers are proposed to estimate the validity of
   extracted MUPTs. The classifiers use either the MU firing pattern or the
   MUP shape consistency of an MUPT, or both, to estimate its validity. The
   developed classifiers estimate the class label of an MUPT (i.e.,
   valid/invalid) and a degree of support for the decision being made. A
   single SVM that estimates the validity of a given MUPT using extracted
   MU firing pattern and MUP shape features was investigated. In addition,
   the effectiveness of multiclassifier techniques which estimate the
   overall validity of a train by fusing the MU firing pattern and MUP
   shape validity of a given MUPT, determined separately by two distinct
   SVMs, was also investigated. Training based only on simulated data
   showed robust classification performance of the several multiclassifier
   methods when tested using both simulated and real test data. Of the
   methods studied, the multiclassifier constructed using trainable
   logistic regression to aggregate base classifier outputs had the best
   performance. Assuming 12.7\% of extracted MUPTs are on average invalid,
   the estimated accuracy for this method in correctly categorizing MUPTs
   extracted during decomposition was 99.4\% and 98.8\% for simulated and
   real data, respectively.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Scholars have paid little attention to the potential of analyzing social
   networks to conceptualize coordination in project management. This study
   uses the cybernetics theory and its related concepts to formulate the
   social and technical components of projects as a network of task-related
   social interactions within an organizational context. Interaction was
   defined as the variety or possible states one node generates for another
   node, while degree of coordination was defined as the extent to which a
   recipient node can handle the variety that interrelated nodes generate.
   To ground this discussion, a case study from a multinational
   pharmaceutical company (hereafter referred to as MPC) in which the above
   theoretical framework was used is presented.
   After collecting and analyzing data, Interaction Effectiveness (IE) was
   calculated based on the ratio of ``helpful{''} to ``not so helpful{''}
   behaviors between interrelated nodes. MPC's average organizational IE
   ratio of 1.03 was used as a baseline to determine the relative
   effectiveness of other nodes' interactions. The IE ratio also revealed
   two structural network properties. First, a departmental-level analysis
   indicated that most network relationships were asymmetrical (76.5\%),
   reflecting a significant discrepancy in the perceptions between
   interrelated nodes. Second, the variability of IE ratios (standard
   deviation) ranged from 0.10 to 1.28, reflecting the degree of
   consistency among the relationships of each single node and its
   interrelated nodes. This study concludes that the overall effectiveness
   of task-related social interactions is a function how well variety and
   variety handling are aligned between any two interdependent nodes
   throughout the network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights

Abstract = {{Three projects involving point velocity probes (PVPs) illustrate the
   advantages of direct groundwater velocity measurements. In the first, a
   glacial till and outwash aquifer was characterized using conventional
   methods and multilevel PVPs for designing a bioremediation program. The
   PVPs revealed a highly conductive zone that dominated the transport of
   injected substances. These findings were later confirmed with a natural
   gradient tracer test. In the second, PVPs were used to map a groundwater
   velocity field around a dipole recirculation well. The PVPs showed
   higher than expected velocities near the well, assuming homogeneity in
   the aquifer, leading to improved representations of the aquifer
   heterogeneity in a 3D flow model, and an improved match between the
   modelled and experimental tracer breakthrough curves. In the third
   study, PVPs detected subtle changes in aquifer permeability downgradient
   of a biostimulation experiment. The changes were apparently reversible
   once the oxygen source was depleted, but in locations where the oxygen
   source lingered, velocities remained low. PVPs can be a useful addition
   to the hydrogeologist's toolbox, because they can be constructed
   inexpensively, they provide data in support of models, and they can
   provide information on flow in unprecedented detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fully developed turbulent flow in noncircular ducts is examined, and
   simple models are proposed to predict the friction, heat and mass

   length scale to use in defining the dimensionless parameters to ensure
   similarity between the circular and most noncircular ducts. By using the
   dimensionless parameters based on the square root of cross-sectional
   area, it is demonstrated that the circular tube relations may be applied
   to most noncircular ducts eliminating large errors in estimation. As
   turbulent transport phenomena are inherently complex and there,
   currently, is no extensive experimental data for turbulent heat and mass
   transfer in noncircular ducts, the simple models are valuable in spite

   detectors: Application to pulse-height spectroscopy in a-Se}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors describe a detailed Monte Carlo (MC) method for the
   coupled transport of ionizing particles and charge carriers in amorphous
   selenium (a-Se) semiconductor x-ray detectors, and model the effect of
   statistical variations on the detected signal.
   Methods: A detailed transport code was developed for modeling the signal
   formation process in semiconductor x-ray detectors. The charge transport
   routines include three-dimensional spatial and temporal models of
   electron-hole pair transport taking into account recombination and
   trapping. Many electron-hole pairs are created simultaneously in bursts
   from energy deposition events. Carrier transport processes include drift
   due to external field and Coulombic interactions, and diffusion due to
   Brownian motion.
   Results: Pulse-height spectra (PHS) have been simulated with different
   transport conditions for a range of monoenergetic incident x-ray
   energies and mammography radiation beam qualities. Two methods for
   calculating Swank factors from simulated PHS are shown, one using the
   entire PHS distribution, and the other using the photopeak. The latter
   ignores contributions from Compton scattering and K-fluorescence.
   Comparisons differ by approximately 2\% between experimental
   measurements and simulations.
   Conclusions: The a-Se x-ray detector PHS responses simulated in this
   work include three-dimensional spatial and temporal transport of
   electron-hole pairs. These PHS were used to calculate the Swank factor
   and compare it with experimental measurements. The Swank factor was
   shown to be a function of x-ray energy and applied electric field.
   Trapping and recombination models are all shown to affect the Swank
   factor. Swank factor. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles (NPs) formulated using self-assembly of block copolymers
   have attracted significant attention as nano-scaled drug delivery
   vehicles. Here we report the development of a biodegradable NP using
   self-assembly of a linear amphiphilic block copolymer, Dex-b-PLA,
   composed of poly(D,L-lactide), and dextran. The size of the NPs can be
   precisely tuned between 15 and 70 nm by altering the molecular weight (M
   (W)) of the two polymer chains. Using doxorubicin as a model drug, we
   demonstrated that the NPs can carry up to 21\% (w/w) of the drug
   payload. The release profile of doxorubicin from NPs showed sustained
   release for over 6 days. Using a rat model, we explored the
   pharmacokinetics profiles of Dex-b-PLA NPs, and showed proof-of-concept
   that long circulation lifetime of the NPs can be achieved by tuning the
   M (W) of Dex-b-PLA block copolymer. While the terminal half-life of
   Dex-b-PLA NPs (29.8 h) was similar to that observed in poly(ethylene
   glycol)-coated (PEG-coated) NPs (27.0 h), 90\% of the injected Dex-b-PLA
   NPs were retained in the blood circulation for 38.3 h after injection,
   almost eight times longer than the PEG-coated NPs. The area under curve
   (AUC) of Dex-b-PLA NPs was almost four times higher than PEG-based NPs.
   The biodistribution study showed lower accumulation of Dex-b-PLA NPs in
   the spleen with 19.5\% initial dose per gram tissue (IDGT) after 24 h
   compared to PEG-coated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs (29.8\%
   IDGT). These studies show that Dex-b-PLA block copolymer is a promising
   new biomaterial for making controlled nanoparticles as drug delivery
   vehicles.}},

   ligands at the interfacial layer and measuring the resulting solar cell
   performances. In addition, it was found that alkyl thiol capped Au-NPs

Abstract = {{Injecting false data attack is a well known serious threat to wireless
   sensor network, for which an adversary reports bogus information to sink
   causing error decision at upper level and energy waste in en-route
   nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel bandwidth-efficient cooperative
   authentication (BECAN) scheme for filtering injected false data. Based
   on the random graph characteristics of sensor node deployment and the
   cooperative bit-compressed authentication technique, the proposed BECAN
   scheme can save energy by early detecting and filtering the majority of
   injected false data with minor extra overheads at the en-route nodes. In
   addition, only a very small fraction of injected false data needs to be
   checked by the sink, which thus largely reduces the burden of the sink.
   Both theoretical and simulation results are given to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of high filtering
   probability and energy saving.}},

Abstract = {{Laser solid freeform fabrication is a flexible manufacturing technique
   that can be used to produce a near net shape component by consolidation
   of successive deposited layers of additive materials. This study
   investigates the effects of the main process parameters, the laser power
   and scanning speed, on the surface finish of AISI 303L thin walls
   through reducing the thickness of the deposited layers. To study the
   effects of the variations of the operating parameters, the process is
   simulated. The numerical results showed that by increasing the scanning
   speed the laser power must be adjusted in order to maintain the melt
   pool maximum temperature within a pre-defined value. In this way, the
   surface finish of the fabricated walls considerably improves due to the
   decreased thickness of each individual layer without significantly
   disturbing the melt pool and the main physical characteristics of the
   build-ups. This was also verified through experimentally fabrication of
   the walls and their microstructural examination. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{There are many different types of micro-mixers which have been designed
   to enhance mixing efficiency of fluid flow in micro-channels. The output
   of micro-channels integrated with micro-mixers in some cases may need to
   be in a certain range. In this article we design a new type of
   micro-mixer by utilizing conductive surfaces and walls with variable
   zeta potential. Interaction of the induced charged electro-kinetic
   (ICEK) phenomenon (due to existence of conductive surfaces) and
   producing diverse electro-osmotic boundary velocity (because of presence
   of walls with changeable zeta potential) together lead to increase
   mixing efficiency of the system significantly. Numerical simulation are
   performed to analyze the system and the results show that by using this
   micro-mixer with different zeta potential applied to walls, we can have
   a wide range of mixing efficiency between 30\% and 85\%. Moreover, we
   applied a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to the system to manage the
   percentage of mixing efficiency within this range. This controller based
   on desired mixing efficiency; determine the amount of zeta potential on
   each wall and thus we can reach the amount of required mixing
   efficiency.}},

   linearize the nominal nonlinear dynamics of the uncertain nonlinear
   system and linearizes the nonlinear time varying uncertainties at an
   arbitrary point using the mean value theorem. This approach transforms
   uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems into an equivalent MIMO linear
   uncertain system model with unstructured uncertainty. Finally, a robust
   minimax linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design is proposed for
   the linearized model. The scheme guarantees the internal stability of
   the closed loop system and provides robust performance. In order to
   illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, the proposed method is
   applied to a tracking control problem for an air-breathing hypersonic
   flight vehicle (AHFV).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the non-asymptotic counterpart of Shannon capacity is
   investigated for any discrete input memoryless channel with discrete or
   continuous output (DIMC). Given any block length n and word error
   probability epsilon, let R-n(epsilon) be the best channel coding rate
   achievable with the block length n subject to the error probability
   epsilon. Based on the non-asymptotic equipartition properties (NEP)
   established recently by Yang and Meng, a quantity delta(t,n)(epsilon) is
   first defined to measure the relative magnitude of error probability
   epsilon and block length n with respect to a given DIMC and an input
   distribution t. Then, by combining the non-asymptotic achievability and
   converse established recently by Yang and Meng via jar decoding, it is
   shown that, given n and epsilon < 1/ 2, R-n(epsilon) has a ``Taylor-type
   expansion{''} with respect to delta(t,n)(epsilon), with the first two
   terms of the expansion being max(t){[}I(t; P)-delta(t,n)(epsilon)] =
   I(t{*}; P)-delta(t{*},n)(epsilon) for some optimal distribution t{*},
   and the third order term being O(delta(2)(t{*},n)) + O(ln n/n). Finally,
   based on the Taylor-type expansion and the non-asymptotic converse, two
   easy to compute approximation formulas for R-n(epsilon) (dubbed ``SO{''}
   and ``NEP{''}) are provided. Numerical results show that both the SO and
   NEP approximation formulas provide reliable and accurate estimation, in
   contrast with the normal approximation which sometimes falls below
   achievable bounds and sometimes rises above converses. An important
   implication arising from the Taylor-type expansion of R-n(epsilon) is
   that in the practical non-asymptotic regime, the optimal marginal
   codeword symbol distribution is not necessarily a Shannon capacity
   achieving distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, Slepian-Wolf (SW) coding theorem relies on source
   sequences with length tending to infinity. However, in practice, the
   source sequences are of finite length. Towards closing this gap, we
   obtain non-asymptotic achievability and non-asymptotic converse for the
   fixed-rate SW coding by applying the NEP theorem. Furthermore, combining
   those converse and achievability, we show that the best SW coding rate
   has a Taylor-type expansion with respect to delta(n)(epsilon) which
   measures the relative magnitude of the error probability epsilon and
   block length n. In addition, based on the Taylor-type expansion, we
   develop some reliable approximations (dubbed SO and NEP) for
   R-n(epsilon). Numerical comparison with the converse and achievability
   further shows that while the normal approximation and redundancy
   approximation reported in the literature can be either below converse or
   above the achievability in some cases, the SO and NEP approximations are
   always reliable and can serve as the benchmark for practical SW code
   design.}},

   median algorithm to succeed under various fault models. We also provide
   a construction for excess robust graphs. We show that the sensitivity of
   this algorithm varies greatly under different fault models, and make

Abstract = {{We consider causal coding of three jointly Gaussian correlated sources,

   closed-form formula for its total rate distortion function subject to
   Mean Square Error (MSE) distortion constraints when all sources need a
   positive rate to be represented. It is first shown that the optimal
   reproduction random variables are jointly Gaussian with the sources. A
   novel causal coding scheme is then proposed to achieve the total rate
   distortion function, in which each source is first whitened with respect
   to all previous original sources and then encoded via encoding a proper
   linear combination of the residues of the previous sources with respect
   to all available encoded sources and the residue of the current source
   with respect to all previous original sources. The more-and-less coding
   theorem in causal coding of correlated sources-when sources do not form
   a Markov chain as X-1 -> X-2 -> X-3, under some conditions on sources
   and distortion, the more sources need to be encoded, the less total rate
   is required-is also investigated for Gaussian sources. For the
   underlying scenario in which all sources need a positive rate to be
   represented, it is proved that the more-and-less coding is always
   revealed for non-Markov chain Gaussian sources.}},

Abstract = {{Varsity athletics and university science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) programs are both extremely time intensive
   commitments. Each requires a considerable amount of discipline and
   self-motivation on the part of the student. Initially, it would seem
   that combining these two commitments would be a recipe for disaster,
   leading to an exhausted, time-crunched student and yield poor
   performances both in the classroom and on the field. Many students
   however, continue to prove that concurrent success is possible in both
   demanding disciplines. At the University of Waterloo, in Ontario,
   Canada, student-athletes make up approximately 2\% of the full-time
   student population, with approximately 40\% of these students enrolled
   in full-time STEM programs. In this work, 16 members of the university's
   track and field and cross country teams majoring in STEM programs have
   been interviewed to discuss their motivation, time management, and
   coping strategies for successfully navigating life as a STEM
   student-athlete. Their responses have been applied against Eccles'
   expectancy-value theory as a motivational framework for the students'
   continued success. Students discuss lessons they have learned, and how
   they have successfully been able to apply concepts from their studies to
   athletics, and vice-versa. These teams were chosen because they each
   contained the most recent (2010-2011) male and female recipients of the
   university's award for the varsity student-athlete with the highest
   academic average during a competitive season. Further, both of these
   students were majoring in STEM programs. Interviews were conducted with
   students ranging from freshman through senior undergraduate, and
   Master's and Ph.D. graduate programs as well. The interviews highlight a
   series of commonalities and differences across the students, including
   many of them prioritizing school and athletics above their other life
   commitments, and each of them possessing a variety of different time
   scheduling and study habits. From these personal accounts and
   interviews, a series of best practices for success as either a
   student-athlete or a regular student involved in other high time
   commitment co-curricular activities are developed. It also becomes clear
   that there are many paths leading to success as a student. This work can
   be used by educators to gain insight into the STEM student-athlete
   perspective, and by students and coaches alike as they each continue to
   strive for success.}},

   been implemented), can further improve the worst case voltage droop in
   the power supply by similar to 27\% at a minimal cost to area (similar
   to 3\%) and power (similar to 3\%). Reducing the worst case droop is
   shown to reduce the on-chip decoupling capacitance requirements by 3X
   for a given voltage dip. In addition, the overall voltage level at which
   the chip can be operated can be reduced since the smaller droop allows
   storage elements to remain stable at the lower supply voltage.}},

Abstract = {{We reconsider guarded evaluation as a means to reduce FPGA dynamic power
   consumption. We augment and evaluate guarded evaluation as proposed in
   {[}1] after different stages of the FPGA CAD flow. Guarding later in the
   flow provides more feedback to the algorithm and yields a more effective
   cost-benefit analysis of newly added signals. Numerical results show
   that guarding later in the flow yields slightly less power savings
   versus guarding after technology mapping. However, fewer guards are
   inserted which results in fewer netlist changes and less impact on
   routing resource usage.}},

Abstract = {{Loads on the electrical grid are multiplexed at distribution
   transformers in the same way that traffic from data sources is
   multiplexed at a router. This motivates the use of teletraffic theory to
   size power distribution networks just as it is used to size
   telecommunication access networks. Specifically, we prove the
   equivalence between a model of a distribution branch comprised of a
   transformer and storage that we want to size for a given underflow
   probability epsilon, and a queuing model that we want to size for a
   given overflow probability epsilon. Based on this equivalence, we show
   how existing teletraffic analysis can be applied to size transformers
   when there is no storage. We compute such sizings using load models
   obtained from our measurement testbed and load models derived from an
   electricity demand simulator. We show not only that teletraffic theory
   agrees well with numerical simulations but also that it closely matches
   with the heuristics used in current practice by electric utilities, thus
   validating the use of teletraffic theory.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike prior work on demand management, which typically requires
   industrial loads to be turned off during peak times, this paper studies
   the potential to carry out demand response by modifying the elastic load
   components of common household appliances. Such a component can decrease
   its instantaneous power draw at the expense of increasing its duration
   of operation with no impact on the appliance's lifetime. We identify the
   elastic components of ten common household appliances. Assuming separate
   control of an appliance's elastic component, we quantify the
   relationship between the potential reduction in aggregate peak and the
   duration required to complete the operation of appliances in four
   geographic regions: Ontario, Quebec, France and India. We find that even
   with a small extension to the operation duration of appliances, peak
   demand can be significantly reduced in all four regions both during
   winter and summer. For example, during winter in Quebec, a nearly 125 MW
   reduction in peak demand can be obtained with just a 10\% increase in
   appliance operation duration. We conclude that exploiting appliance
   elasticity to reduce peak power demand should be an important
   consideration for appliance manufacturers. From a policy perspective,
   our study gives regulators the ability to quantitatively assess the
   impact of requiring manufacturers to conform to ``smart appliance{''}
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the derivation of the probability distribution of
   maintenance cost of a repairable system that is modeled as a stochastic
   alternating renewal process. The key idea of the paper is to formulate a
   renewal equation for computing the characteristic function of the
   maintenance cost incurred in a fixed time interval. Then, the inverse
   Fourier transform of the characteristic function leads to the complete
   probability distribution of cost. This approach also enables the
   derivation of probability distributions of the down time and the number
   of failures in a given time period. The distribution of the cost can be
   used to evaluate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and other measures needed for
   the financial planning of a maintenance program.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with high dependability requirements are increasingly relying on
   complex on-line fault management systems. Such fault management systems
   involve a combination of multiple steps - monitoring, data analysis,
   planning, and execution - that are typically independently developed and
   optimized. We argue that it is inefficient and ineffective to improve
   any particular fault management step without taking into account its
   interactions and dependencies with the rest of the steps. Through six
   real-life examples, we demonstrate this inefficiency and how it results
   in systems that either under-perform or are over-budget. We propose a
   holistic approach to fault management that is aware of all relevant
   aspects, and explicitly considers the couplings between the different
   fault management steps. We believe it will produce systems that will
   better meet cost, performance, and dependability objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The visual system is sensitive to temporal changes in stimuli. The image
   appears to be continuous as the visual system integrates the responses
   with respect to time. A crucial factor is the CFF - critical flicker
   fusion frequency - and refers to the temporal frequency beyond which
   flicker is no longer perceived. CFF is a measure of the minimum temporal
   interval that can be resolved by the visual system. This chapter
   discusses the CFF and the effect of various parameters such as
   luminance, refresh rate of the monitor, wavelength, and retinal
   eccentricity on flicker perception.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid sensor and display pixel and its operating scheme are proposed.
   The circuit consists of two main parts: 1) the light sensor and 2) the
   integrated display onto the backplane. Hybrid a-Si:H/Nanocrystaffine
   silicon (nc-Si) TFTs were used as a hybrid phototransistor incorporating
   both sensing and switching on the same device. The display backplane
   design was implemented using a driving TFT and and an organic
   light-emitting diode. The grey scale of the pixel is generated by
   pulse-height and width voltage modulation created by the integrated
   a-Si:H sensor. The circuit has a wide operating range of 300pA to 2 mu A
   for TFTs having channel lengths of 10 mu m. A 7.5nA step for each grey
   scale is obtained when the circuit is implemented in a 256 RGB level
   imaging system within conventional pixel matrices. The refresh rate of
   the pixel can reach up to 200Hz.}},

Title = {{Effect of tumor shape and size on drug delivery to solid tumors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Tumor shape and size effect on drug delivery to solid tumors are
   studied, based on the application of the governing equations for fluid
   flow, i.e., the conservation laws for mass and momentum, to
   physiological systems containing solid tumors. The discretized form of
   the governing equations, with appropriate boundary conditions, is
   developed for predefined tumor geometries. The governing equations are
   solved using a numerical method, the element-based finite volume method.
   Interstitial fluid pressure and velocity are used to show the details of
   drug delivery in a solid tumor, under an assumption that drug particles
   flow with the interstitial fluid. Drug delivery problems have been most
   extensively researched in spherical tumors, which have been the simplest
   to examine with the analytical methods. With our numerical method,
   however, more complex shapes of the tumor can be studied. The numerical
   model of fluid flow in solid tumors previously introduced by our group
   is further developed to incorporate and investigate non-spherical tumors
   such as prolate and oblate ones. Also the effects of the surface area
   per unit volume of the tissue, vascular and interstitial hydraulic
   conductivity on drug delivery are investigated.}},

Abstract = {{A new physical sensor design for strain measurement of wind turbine
   blades is presented. While the proposed structure is highly sensitive,
   it is based on simple operating principle of displacement amplification.
   The proposed microdevice converts even small amount of applied strains
   to measurable changes in capacitance. The device performance is
   validated both by analytical solution and also by finite element methods
   (FEM). Moreover, to address the influence of the adhesive layer used for
   bonding the sensor to wind turbine blades on strain transmission, the
   ratio of strain transmission is investigated through FEM simulation and
   finally a technique is proposed that increases this ratio by up to 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{Medical images are used mainly in the diagnosing process and as an aid
   in determining correct treatment. Therefore, the process of segmenting
   different regions of interests (ROIs) within the medical images is
   considered a critical one. When provided with a segment with high
   segmentation accuracy, the physician can easily detect the problem and
   determine the best treatment. In this paper, a neural network retrained
   on-line is proposed to automatically segment medical images using a
   global threshold. The network is initially trained off-line using a set
   of features extracted from a set of randomly selected training images,
   along with their best thresholds, as targets for the neural network. The
   features are extracted using Seeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) technique
   from a rectangle around the ROI. This network continues training on-line
   as new images arrive, based on a feedback correction done by the
   clinician to the segmented image. This process is repeated multiple
   times to verify the generalization ability of the network.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of inexpensive CO2 laser systems has led to a wide range of
   demonstrations of microfabricated lab on chip systems built of acrylic.
   However, there has been little application of these systems to building
   microfluidics for DNA analysis. In this work we explore the use of CO2
   laser systems for building microfluidics for DNA analysis and relate the
   artifacts of the fabrication technology to the performance of the
   system. We show that surface roughness that leads to significant
   constrictions in the separation channel provides an upper limit of the
   size of DNA that can be analysed. Below that upper limit, the resolution
   of the chip is strongly affected by the degree to which the separation
   channel is exposed to redeposited by-products of the ablation process.
   We show that by controlling these effects we are reliably able to
   discern two types of PCR product as a test representative of a real
   application. By being able to do this is in microfluidic devices the
   size of a postage stamp we have shown that we can now use CO2 laser
   systems for the development of extremely inexpensive diagnostic systems
   using a rapid prototyping approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present coordination algorithms for an heterogeneous
   robotic group consisting of a mobile manipulator and a number of mobile
   sensing agents to cooperatively estimate a toxic field and trace its
   maximum point. In particular, we treat the mobile manipulator as a
   master machine and mobile sensing agents as slave machines such that, at
   the converged configuration, the end effector of the manipulator can
   reach the maximum point. The unknown field has been modeled by a network
   of radial basis functions and mobile robots are coordinated by flocking
   and gradient control algorithms based on their estimated fields. A
   simulation study demonstrates the validity of the proposed scheme in an
   industrial disaster or emergency scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of momentum can be useful in designing control laws for
   underactuated mechanical systems. However, the momentum is conserved
   only for unactuated variables with symmetry. If a symmetry-breaking
   force is applied to a system, the momentum is not conserved any longer
   in general. The main objective of this paper is to show that there exist
   forces linear in velocity such as the damping force that break the
   symmetry but induce a new conserved quantity in place of the original
   momentum map. This paper formalizes that such a new conserved quantity
   can be constructed by combining the time integral of a general damping
   force and the original momentum map associated with the symmetry.
   Especially, we show that the new conserved quantity can exist for
   multiple variables with symmetry. From the perspective of stability
   theories, the major implication of the new conserved quantity is that
   the corresponding variables possess the self recovery phenomenon, i.e.
   they will be globally attractive to the initial condition of the
   variables. What is fundamental in the damping-induced self recovery is
   not the positivity of the damping coefficient but certain properties of
   the time integral of the damping force. Self recovery effect and
   theoretical findings are demonstrated by simulation results using a
   two-link manipulator and a planar pendulum. The results in this paper
   will be useful in designing and controlling mechanical systems with
   underactuation.}},

Abstract = {{A cavitation model has been developed for the internal two-phase flow of
   diesel and biodiesel fuels in fuel injectors under high injection
   pressure conditions. The model is based on the conventional single-fluid
   mixture approach with modification in the phase change rate expressions
   and local mean effective pressure, considering the effects of viscous
   stresses and turbulent pressure fluctuations, and also takes into
   account the effects of turbulence, compressibility and wall roughness.
   The model is validated by comparing the model predictions of probable
   cavitation regions, velocity distribution, fuel mass flow rate and
   pressure with the experimental measurement available in literature. It
   is found that cavitation inception for biodiesel occurs at a higher
   injection pressure, compared to diesel, due to its lower saturation
   pressure. However, supercavitation occurs for both diesel and biodiesel
   at high injection pressures. RNG k - epsilon model for turbulence
   modeling is reliable by comparing its performance with realizable k -
   epsilon and SST k - omega models. The effect of liquid phase
   compressibility becomes considerable for very high injection pressures.
   Wall roughness is not an important factor for cavitation in fuel
   injectors.}},

Abstract = {{Although RFID systems offer many noteworthy characteristics, security
   and privacy issues associated with them are not easy to address. In this
   paper, we investigate how to solve the eavesdropping, modification and
   one particular type of relay attacks toward the tag-to-reader
   communication in passive RFID systems without requiring lightweight;
   ciphers or secret credentials shared by legitimate parties using a
   physical layer approach. To this end, we propose a novel physical layer
   scheme, called Backscatter modulation- and Uncoordinated frequency
   hopping-assisted Physical Layer Enhancement (BUPLE). The idea behind it
   is to use the amplitude of the carrier to transmit messages as normal,
   while to utilize its periodically varied frequency to hide the
   transmission from the eavesdropper/relayer and to exploit a random
   sequence modulated to the carrier's phase to defeat malicious
   modifications. We further improve its eavesdropping resistance through
   the coding in the physical layer as BUPLE ensures that the
   tag-to-eavesdropper channel is strictly noisier than the tag-to-reader
   channel. Three practical Wiretap Channel Codes (WCCs) for passive tags
   are then proposed: two of them are constructed from linear error
   correcting codes, and the other one is constructed, for the first time
   to the best of our knowledge, from resilient vector Boolean functions.
   The security and usability of BUPLE in conjunction with WCCs are further
   confirmed by our proof of concept implementation and testing on the
   software defined radio platform with a programmable WISP tag.}},

   paper, we investigate how to solve the eavesdropping, modification and
   one particular type of relay attacks toward the tag-to-reader
   communication in passive RFID systems without requiring lightweight
   ciphers or secret credentials shared by legitimate parties using a
   physical layer approach. To this end, we propose a novel physical layer
   scheme, called Backscatter modulation-and Uncoordinated frequency
   hopping-assisted Physical Layer Enhancement (BUPLE). The idea behind it
   is to use the amplitude of the carrier to transmit messages as normal,
   while to utilize its periodically varied frequency to hide the
   transmission from the eavesdropper/relayer and to exploit a random
   sequence modulated to the carrier's phase to defeat malicious
   modifications. We further improve its eavesdropping resistance through
   the coding in the physical layer as BUPLE ensures that the
   tag-to-eavesdropper channel is strictly noisier than the tag-to-reader
   channel. Three practical Wiretap Channel Codes (WCCs) for passive tags
   are then proposed: two of them are constructed from linear error
   correcting codes, and the other one is constructed, for the first time
   to the best of our knowledge, from resilient vector Boolean functions.
   The security and usability of BUPLE in conjunction with WCCs are further
   confirmed by our proof of concept implementation and testing on the
   software defined radio platform with a programmable WISP tag.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative data on the transport of wood in large rivers are needed to
   address management objectives and balance wood budgets. Streamside video
   cameras are suitable if image quality and wood visibility are
   sufficient. The objectives of this study are to verify a wood detection
   and measurement procedure and to quantify the relation between wood
   transport and discharge for a large piedmont river. Verification
   includes detection frequency, and pixel resolution tests. It was found
   that the camera location and resolution are sufficient for detecting
   floating wood. Wood transport is initiated at two thirds of the bankfull
   discharge. Wood transport increases above the threshold, but an
   inflexion point occurs near the bankfull discharge. Above the bankfull
   discharge, wood transport is insensitive to discharge and characterized
   by high variability. A three-stage model with hysteresis is proposed.
   Comparisons with other sources suggest that model estimates are high.
   Future work should address uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Heat flux data from a series of controlled experiments involving a 2 m
   diameter, wind-blown pool fire are examined to highlight the
   difficulties involved in conducting heat flux measurements in a
   realistic, large-scale, hydrocarbon-fueled fire. Data were taken at
   several locations along the ground near the fire. At each location,
   three different heat flux sensors were positioned together: a Gardon
   gage, a directional flame thermometer (DFT) and a Sandia heat flux gage
   (HFG). Methods were first developed to correct measured values of heat
   flux for the slight differences in gage location relative to the fire.
   The remaining discrepancies between the values of heat flux measured by
   the different gages were then used to highlight uncertainties in heat
   flux measurements due to differences in gage surface temperature, in
   gage thermal response to the inherent modes of heating involved in the
   large hydrocarbon fire environment, and in conduction losses from the
   gage sensor plates. The importance of these sources of discrepancy
   varied depending on the magnitude of the measured heat flux and on
   whether the gages were located in a radiation-dominated or mixed
   radiative-convective environment within the fire.}},

   underlying data using multiple cooperative swarms clustering. The
   proposed approach is assessed using different data sets and its
   performance is compared with that of k-means, k-harmonic means, fuzzy

Abstract = {{An inverse method was implemented in commercial CFD software to estimate
   the wall temperature of a simplified baking oven from the initial
   estimate of an inert baking product temperature located in the oven. The
   transport phenomena were modeled with the energy equation, the RANS
   equation (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes), the k-epsilon realizable
   turbulence model and the S2S radiation model. The optimisation approach
   was used, by formulating an objective function. The proposed method was
   sequential and the objective function was minimized at every given time
   step. The minimization iterative process was introduced within the CFD
   solver loop, therefore solving both field variables and the inverse
   problem at once. To address the noisy input data, two techniques were
   compared: 1-Tikhonov regularization 2- pre-filtering of data and
   evaluated for two different bakery products. Results showed that the
   pre-filtering method provided more accurate estimates and avoided the
   need for a realistic initial estimate of the wall temperature. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A turbulent burst model is used and evaluated for particle resuspension

Title = {{A methodology for predicting particle penetration factor through cracks

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{339-348}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Epidemiologic evidences have shown a strong relationship between
   exposure to outdoor particles and adverse impact on human health. A
   large amount of outdoor particles may penetrate into the indoor
   environments, where people spend about 90\% of their life time.
   Therefore, predicting particle penetration into buildings could help to
   quantify the indoor exposure to particles with an outdoor origin and
   thus to develop effective strategies to remediate the exposure. However,
   there are few methodologies of particle penetration prediction for
   actual engineering application. In this paper, we present a methodology
   for predicting the particle penetration factor for real buildings by
   estimating the geometries of the cracks in the building envelopes
   according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration,
   Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Handbook. In addition, the effect of
   inertial impaction was considered. Furthermore, the effect of
   gravitational settling was neglected for vertical leakages. Two field
   measurements showed that the proposed methodology was effective in
   predicting the particle penetration factor for the test rooms. For
   particles in the range of 0.5-6 mu m in diameter, the experimental data
   of penetration factors vary from 0.2 to 1, which match well with the
   predicted data. Generally speaking, this methodology can be used to aid
   the engineers or designers to calculate the particle penetration in
   actual engineering practices or designs. In addition, a sensitivity
   analysis was conducted to investigate the influencing factors. (C) 2011
