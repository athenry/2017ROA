Abstract = {{The offline Eulerian AURAMS (A Unified Regional Air quality Modelling
   System) chemical transport model was adapted to simulate airborne
   concentrations of seven PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons):
   phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz{[}a]anthracene,
   chrysene + triphenylene, and benzo{[}a]pyrene. The model was then run
   for the year 2002 with hourly output on a grid covering southern Canada
   and the continental USA with 42 km horizontal grid spacing. Model
   predictions were compared to similar to 5000 24 h-average PAH
   measurements from 45 sites, most of which were located in urban or
   industrial areas. Eight of the measurement sites also provided data on
   particle/gas partitioning which had been modelled using two alternative
   schemes. This is the first known regional modelling study for PAHs over
   a North American domain and the first modelling study at any scale to
   compare alternative particle/gas partitioning schemes against paired
   field measurements. The goal of the study was to provide output
   concentration maps of use to assessing human inhalation exposure to PAHs
   in ambient air. Annual average modelled total (gas + particle)
   concentrations were statistically indistinguishable from measured values
   for fluoranthene, pyrene and benz{[}a]anthracene whereas the model
   underestimated concentrations of phenanthrene, anthracene and chrysene +
   triphenylene. Significance for benzo{[}a]pyrene performance was close to
   the statistical threshold and depended on the particle/gas partitioning
   scheme employed. On a day-to-day basis, the model simulated total PAH
   concentrations to the correct order of magnitude the majority of the
   time. The model showed seasonal differences in prediction quality for
   volatile species which suggests that a missing emission source such as
   air-surface exchange should be included in future versions. Model
   performance differed substantially between measurement locations and the
   limited available evidence suggests that the model's spatial resolution
   was too coarse to capture the distribution of concentrations in densely
   populated areas. A more detailed analysis of the factors influencing
   modelled particle/gas partitioning is warranted based on the findings in
   this study.}},

Pages = {{193-219}},
Abstract = {{Skin lesion analysis using standard camera images has received limited
   attention from the scientific community due to its technical complexity
   and scarcity of data. The images are privy to lighting variations caused
   by uneven source lighting, and unconstrained differences in resolution,
   scale, and equipment. In this chapter, we propose a framework that
   performs illumination correction and feature extraction on photographs
   of skin lesions acquired using standard consumer-grade cameras. We apply
   a multi-stage illumination correction algorithm and define a set of
   high-level intuitive features (HLIF) that quantifies the level of
   asymmetry and border irregularity about a lesion. This
   lighting-corrected intuitive feature model framework can be used to
   classify skin lesion diagnoses with high accuracy. The framework
   accurately corrects the illumination variations and achieves high and
   precise sensitivity (95\% confidence interval (CI), 73.1-73.5\%) and
   specificity (95\% CI, 72.0-72.4\%) using a linear support vector machine
   classifier with cross-validation trials. It exhibits higher test-retest
   reliability than the much larger state-of-the-art low-level feature set
   (95\% CI, 78.1-79.7\% sensitivity, 75.3-76.3\% specificity). Combining
   our framework with these low-level features attains sensitivity (95\%
   CI, 83.3-84.8\%) and specificity (95\% CI, 79.7-80.1\%), which is more
   accurate and reliable than classification using the low-level feature
   set.}},

Abstract = {{Self-consolidating high-strength concretes, including palm oil fuel ash
   (POFA), were produced based on the water/binder (W/B) ratios of
   0.25-0.40. POFA was used in the concrete mixtures by replacing 0-30\% of
   normal Portland cement by weight. The freshly mixed concrete mixtures
   were tested to determine the key fresh properties such as filling
   ability, passing ability, and segregation resistance. Filling ability
   was measured with respect to slump flow, T50 slump flow time, inverted
   slump cone flow spread and time, and V-funnel flow time. Passing ability
   was determined from J-ring flow and L-box flow tests. In addition, sieve
   and column segregation tests were carried out to quantify segregation
   resistance. The concrete mixtures were also tested for compressive
   strength. The experimental results showed that W/B ratio and POFA
   content had significant effects on the filling ability, passing ability,
   and segregation resistance of concrete. The filling ability and passing
   ability of concrete increased with a lower W/B ratio and a higher POFA
   content. Moreover, the use of POFA greatly influenced the segregation
   resistance of concrete. The optimum POFA content for filling ability,
   passing ability, and segregation resistance was 20\%, which also
   produced the maximum compressive strength in concrete.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICS OF MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The moment and almost-sure stochastic stability of two-degree-of-freedom
   coupled viscoelastic systems, under parametric excitation of white
   noise, are investigated through moment Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov
   exponents, respectively. The system of stochastic differential equations
   of motion is first decoupled by using the method of stochastic averaging
   for dynamic systems with small damping and weak excitations. Then a new
   scheme for determining the moment Lyapunov exponents is proposed for a
   coupled viscoelastic system. The largest Lyapunov exponent is calculated
   through its relation with moment Lyapunov exponent. The moment and
   almost-sure stability boundaries and critical excitation are obtained
   analytically. These analytical results are confirmed by numerical
   simulation. As an application example, the stochastic stability of
   flexural-torsional viscoelastic beam is studied. It is found that, under
   white noise excitation, the parameters of damping beta and the
   viscoelastic intensity gamma have stabilizing effects on the moment and
   almost-sure stability. However, viscosity parameter eta plays a
   destabilizing role. The stability index decreases from positive to
   negative values with the increase of the amplitude of noise power
   spectrum, which suggests that the noise destabilize the system. These
   results are useful in engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve optimal video quality under bandwidth and power constraints,
   modern video coding techniques employ lossy coding schemes, which often
   create compression artifacts that may lead to degradation of perceptual
   video quality. Understanding and quantifying such perceptual artifacts
   play important roles in the development of effective video compression,
   streaming and quality enhancement systems. Moreover, the characteristics
   of compression artifacts evolve over time due to the continuous adoption
   of novel coding structures and strategies during the development of new
   video compression standards. In this paper, were examine the perceptual
   artifacts created by standard video compression, summarizing commonly
   observed spatial and temporal perceptual distortions in compressed
   video, with emphasis on the perceptual temporal artifacts that have not
   been well identified or accounted for in previous studies. Furthermore,
   a floating effect detection method is proposed that not only detects the
   existence of floating, but also segments the spatial regions where
   floating occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared (NIR) frequency-domain Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy (DOS)
   is an emerging technology with a growing number of potential clinical
   applications. In an effort to reduce DOS system complexity and improve
   portability, we recently demonstrated a direct digital sampling method
   that utilizes digital signal generation and detection as a replacement
   for more traditional analog methods. In our technique, a fast
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) samples the detected time-domain radio
   frequency (RF) waveforms at each modulation frequency in a
   broad-bandwidth sweep (50-300MHz). While we have shown this method
   provides comparable results to other DOS technologies, the process is
   data intensive as digital samples must be stored and processed for each
   modulation frequency and wavelength. We explore here the effect of
   reducing the modulation frequency bandwidth on the accuracy and
   precision of extracted optical properties. To accomplish this, the
   performance of the digital DOS (dDOS) system was compared to a gold
   standard network analyzer based DOS system. With a starting frequency of
   50MHz, the input signal of the dDOS system was swept to 100, 150, 250,
   or 300MHz in 4MHz increments and results were compared to full 50-300MHz
   network-analyzer DOS measurements. The average errors in extracted mu(a)
   and mu(s)' with dDOS were lowest for the full 50-300MHz sweep (less than
   3\%) and were within 3.8\% for frequency bandwidths as narrow as
   50-150MHz. The errors increased to as much as 9.0\% when a bandwidth of
   50-100MHz was tested. These results demonstrate the possibility for
   reduced data collection with dDOS without critical compensation of
   optical property extraction.}},

Abstract = {{A sequential digital image technique was employed to detect the onset of
   coalescence between pairs of holes in tensile specimens. The coalescence
   event was induced between cylindrical holes that were positioned with
   various spacing and ligament orientations. Using finite-element analysis
   as a framework, the coalescence predictions of a classic micromechanical
   model were compared with the experimental coalescence results. It was
   found that the predicted strains at coalescence could be significantly
   improved by accounting for local work-hardening in the ligament region
   between the two holes. Digital image correlation was used to extract
   strain values from the digital image record, for both the far-field and
   the intervoid ligament.}},

Abstract = {{In Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication networks, mobile users
   are able to access Internet services, such as video streaming, digital
   map downloading, database access, online gaming, and even safety
   services like accident alarm, traffic condition broadcast, etc., through
   fixed roadside units. However, the dynamics of communication environment
   and frequent changing topology critically challenge the design of an
   efficient transport layer protocol, which makes it difficult to
   guarantee diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various
   applications. In this paper, we present a novel transport layer scheme
   in infrastructure based vehicular networks, and aim to resolve some
   challenging issues such as source transfer rate adjustment, congestion
   avoidance, and fairness. By precisely detecting packet losses and
   identifying various causes of these losses (for example, link
   disconnection, channel error, packet collision, buffer overflow), the
   proposed scheme adopts different reacting mechanisms to deal with each
   of the losses. Moreover, it timely monitors the buffer size of the
   bottleneck Road-Side Unit (RSU), and dynamically makes transfer rate
   feedbacks to source nodes to avoid buffer overflow or vacancy. Finally,
   analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme not only
   successfully reduces packet losses because of buffer overflow and link
   disconnection but also improves the utilization efficiency of channel
   resource.}},

Abstract = {{A robust nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) based on a
   Volterra series is proposed. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) are used
   to represent the uncertainty in the Volterra series coefficients and
   this uncertainty is then propagated onto the output predictions. The key
   advantage of the PCE is that it provides an analytical expression to
   compute the L-2-norm of the output prediction error resulting in
   computational savings, compared to previously proposed techniques, which
   are essential for real time implementation. Terminal and input
   constraints based on Structured Singular Value based-norms are used to
   ensure convergence to a set-point and compliance with constraints in
   manipulated variables. The algorithm is applied to a multivariable pH
   neutralization system. A comparative study shows superior closed loop
   performance and computational efficiency of the proposed technique as
   compared to previously proposed algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer ( PDPA) technique is utilized for
   characterizing the droplet sizes and velocity profiles in an
   electrostatic spray flow which is atomized using the aerodynamic forces
   assisted with electrostatic forces. An electrostatically-assisted

   from a liquid jet through the nozzle by aerodynamic shear forces, and
   the breakup mechanism of such an electrostatically-assisted twin-fluid
   atomization is investigated using the Rayleigh instability conditions
   through studying the specific surface charges on these droplets measured
   by a Faraday canister. The discrepancies between experiment data and
   Rayleigh limit for specific charges of droplets are presented and
   discussed due to energy transforming from electrical energy to surface
   energy, energy loss, Taylor instability breakup and nonexcess charge
   polarization. The measured average velocity profiles and their RMS (root

Abstract = {{Tiled displays fill the increasingly important need to display very
   large images. As these displays become more common, the ability to
   objectively measure their visual quality becomes more important. One
   cost of the size flexibility offered by these displays is the grid-type
   distortion created by the gaps between each sub-display's active area.
   General purpose Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics are commonly used
   to measure the visual quality effect of image distortions such as blur
   and white noise, but no research has been performed to determine their
   suitability for tiling distortions. This paper addresses that research
   gap by creating a new image quality database specifically targeting
   tiled images. Common state-of-the-art IQA metrics are tested against
   this new database and their performances are compared between tiled
   distortions and `traditional' image distortions.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the side chain on the molecular organization and charge
   transport performance of diketopyrrolopyrrole-quaterthiophene copolymers
   (PDQTs) was studied. It was found that, by increasing the side chain
   length from 2-octyldodecyl (PDQT-20) to 2-decyltetradecyl (PDQT-24), the
   mobility increased from 2.10 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) up to 3.37 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)
   in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). The increase was found to be
   due to the improved surface morphology, rather than the changes in
   crystallinity and pi-pi stacking distance. A new side chain substituent,
   4-decylhexadecyl, was developed for studying the effects of the
   bifurcation point of the branched side chains in comparison with
   2-octyldodecyl and 2-decyltetradecyl. The 4-decylhexadecyl substituted
   PDQT (PDQT-26) showed a surge in mobility up to 6.90 cm(2) V-1 s(-1).
   The remarkably enhanced charge transport performance observed for
   PDQT-26 was believed to originate from its much shorter pi-pi distance
   (3.68 angstrom) than those of PDQT-20 (3.79 angstrom) and PDQT-24 (3.86
   angstrom). The improvement was the result of a farther distance of the
   bifurcation point of 4-decylhexadecyl from the polymer backbone, which
   could effectively minimize the steric interference of the bulky side
   chain branches with the backbone to facilitate the co-facial pi-pi
   stacking.}},

Abstract = {{The variable solid-state diffusivity (VSSD) and the resistive-reactant
   (RR) models that focus on different physical phenomena are used to
   investigate the solid-state transport (bulk effects) and electronic
   conductivity (surface effects) of LiFePO4 (LFP). For the first time, the
   models are effectively validated against experimental galvanostatic
   discharge data over a full range of applied currents. To achieve a
   reasonable degree of accuracy, particle-level parameters are estimated
   by fitting to experimental data obtained under low-rate discharge
   conditions, whereas electrode-level properties are derived based on
   high-rate conditions. Particle size distribution turns out to play a
   pivotal role in determining the rate capability of the electrode
   determined by the VSSD and a revised version of the RR model. Based on

Title = {{Branching and size of CTAB-coated gold nanostars control the
   colorimetric detection of bacteria}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{10660-10668}},
Abstract = {{Rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is challenging because
   conventional methods require long incubation times. Nanoparticles have
   the potential to detect pathogens before they can cause an infection.
   Gold nanostars have recently been used for colorimetric biosensors but
   they typically require surface modification with antibodies or aptamers
   for cellular detection. Here, CTAB-coated gold nanostars have been used
   to rapidly (<5 min) detect infective doses of a model Gram-positive
   pathogen Staphylococcus aureus by an instrument-free colorimetric
   method. Varying the amounts of gold nanoseed precursor and surfactant
   can tune the size and degree of branching of gold nanostars as studied
   here by transmission electron microscopy. The size and morphology of
   gold nanostars determine the degree and rate of color change in the
   presence of S. aureus. The optimal formulation achieved maximum color
   contrast in the presence of S. aureus and produced a selective response
   in comparison to polystyrene microparticles and liposomes. These gold
   nanostars were characterized using UV-Visible spectroscopy to monitor
   changes in their surface plasmon resonance peaks. The visual color
   change was also quantified over time by measuring the RGB components of
   the pixels in the digital images of gold nanostar solutions. CTAB-coated
   gold nanostars serve as a promising material for simple and rapid
   detection of pathogens.}},

Title = {{Framework for NFC-Based Intelligent Agents: A Context-Awareness Enabler
   for Social Internet of Things}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Context-aware applications are required to be aware of user context and
   ambient intelligent to support nonintrusive human-computer interaction.
   However, the uncertain real-world environments make it difficult for a
   system to perceive enough environmental contexts and achieve user's
   goal. Therefore, this study proposes a framework for developing an
   NFC-enabled intelligent agent, which combines the NFC technique with
   context-acquisition, ontology-knowledgebase, and semantic-adaptation
   modules to be aware of location, time, device, and activity contexts
   with respect to personal and social profiles. To cope with the uncertain
   environment, a credit-based incentive scheme is also proposed to
   encourage social cooperation and thereby enlarge the value of personal
   perceptions. By developing a complete ontology knowledgebase, the
   proposed framework can incorporate with social-cooperation schemes to
   recommend relevant services for supporting reactive action, proactive
   achievement, and social cooperation. The resultant social-advertising
   system shows that this framework can support a wide-range of different
   functionalities and is indispensable to an NFC-based intelligent agent
   for social Internet of things.}},

Title = {{Correlation of Polymerization Conditions with Thermal and Mechanical
   Properties of Polyethylenes Made with Ziegler-Natta Catalysts}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the synthesis of polyethylenes has been carried out with
   titanium-magnesium supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts in laboratory-scale
   reactors. A correlation of different polymerization conditions with
   thermal and mechanical properties of polyethylenes has been established.
   It is seen that there is lowering of molecular weight (Mw), polymer
   yield, and catalyst activity at high hydrogen pressure and high
   temperature. The Mw, polymer yield, and catalyst activity are improved
   with the increase in ethylene pressure. Dynamic mechanical analysis
   (DMA) results show that the increase in temperature and hydrogen
   pressure decreases storage modulus. The samples with higher Mw showed
   high activation energy. The melting point decreases with the increase in
   hydrogen pressure but increases slightly with the increase in ethylene
   pressure. It is seen that the increase in reaction temperature, ethylene
   pressure, and hydrogen pressure leads to an increase in crystallinity.
   The tensile modulus increases with the increase in hydrogen pressure and
   can be correlated with the crystallinity of polymer. The Mw has a major
   influence on the flow activation energy and tensile strength. But the
   other mechanical and thermal properties depend on Mw as well as other
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we combine the advantages of hard magnets,
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-molding and printed circuit board
   planar coils to propose an electromagnetically actuated bidirectional
   scanner with potential applications in bio-medical scanning. The
   proposed bidirectional scanner (4 mm x 4 mm x 250 mu m) is fabricated by
   micromolding an isotropic Nd-Fe-B micropowder (MQFP-12-5) doped in a
   PDMS matrix at 80\% weight percentage and magnetized using a standard
   dipole electromagnet. A reflective gold layer of 100 nm is evaporated
   onto the polymer composite structure. A maximum magnetic field of 20 mT
   is measured for the polymer magnetic mirror. Rectangular planar coils
   (trace width and spacing: 254 mu m; 10 turns) are employed to actuate
   the bidirectional scanner electromagnetically by Lorentz force.
   Actuation in both static and dynamic excitation modes is tested. Power
   consumption at a maximum rotational angle (15 degrees optical) is one
   watt at 40 Hz resonant frequency. Initial surface roughness of the
   mirror (165 nm) and radius of curvature (75 mm) has been addressed by
   depositing a thin layer of PDMS, resulting in 66.24 nm surface roughness
   and 321.37 mm overall radius of curvature after integration. Major
   advantages of the proposed bidirectional scanner include low fabrication
   cost, low input voltage and large actuator displacement compared to
   existing electrostatic scanners. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Porous graphene (PG) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are attracting
   attention due to their potential applications in photovoltaics,
   catalysis, and bio-related fields. We present a novel way for mass
   production of these promising materials. The femtosecond laser ablation
   of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is employed for their
   synthesis. Porous graphene (PG) layers were found to float at the
   water-air interface, while graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were dispersed
   in the solution. The sheets consist of one to six stacked layers of
   spongy graphene, which form an irregular 3D porous structure that
   displays pores with an average size of 15-20 nm. Several
   characterization techniques have confirmed the porous nature of the
   collected layers. The analyses of the aqueous solution confirmed the
   presence of GQDs with dimensions of about 2-5 nm. It is found that the
   formation of both PG and GQDs depends on the fs-laser ablation energy.
   At laser fluences less than 12 J cm(-2), no evidence of either PG or
   GQDs is detected. However, polyynes with six and eight carbon atoms per
   chain are found in the solution. For laser energies in the 20-30 J
   cm(-2) range, these polyynes disappeared, while PG and GQDs were found
   at the water-air interface and in the solution, respectively. The origin
   of these materials can be explained based on the mechanisms for water
   breakdown and coal gasification. The absence of PG and GQDs, after the
   laser ablation of HOPG in liquid nitrogen, confirms the proposed
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, homotopy analysis method (HAM) is employed to
   investigate non-linear large deformation of Euler-Bernoulli beams
   subjected to an arbitrary distributed load. Constitutive equations of
   the problem are obtained. It is assumed that the length of the beam
   remains constant after applying external loads. Different auxiliary
   parameters and functions of the HAM and the extra auxiliary parameter,
   which is applied to initial guess of the solution, are employed to
   procure better convergence rate of the solution. The results of the
   solution are obtained for two different examples including constant
   cross sectional beam subjected to constant distributed load and periodic
   distributed load. Special base functions, orthogonal polynomials e.g.
   Chebyshev expansion, are employed as a tool to improve the convergence
   of the solution. The general solution, presented in this paper, can be
   used to attain the solution of the beam under arbitrary distributed load
   and flexural stiffness. Ultimately, it is shown that small deformation
   theory overestimates different quantities such as bending moment, shear
   force, etc. for large deflection of the beams in comparison with large
   deformation theory. Finally, it is concluded that solution of small
   deformation theory is far from reality for large deflection of straight
   Euler-Bernoulli beams. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider in-network computation of MAX and the approximate histogram
   in an n-node structure-free random multihop wireless network. The key
   assumption that we make is that the nodes do not know their relative or

   MAC protocol, we first describe a protocol in which the MAX value
   becomes available at the origin in O(root n/ log n) slots (bit-periods)
   with high probability. This is within a constant factor of that required
   by the best coordinated protocol. A minimal structure (knowledge of
   hop-distance from the sink) is imposed on the network and with this
   structure, we describe a protocol for pipelined computation of MAX that
   achieves a rate of Omega(1/(log n)(2)). Finally, we show how the
   protocol for computation of MAX can be modified to achieve approximate
   computation of the histogram. The approximate histogram can be computed
   in O(n(7/2)(log n)(1/2)) bit-periods with high probability.}},

Title = {{A Unified Relay Framework With Both D-F and C-F Relay Nodes}},

Abstract = {{Decode-and-forward (D-F) and compress-and-forward (C-F) are two
   fundamentally different relay strategies proposed by Cover and El Gamal
   in 1979. Individually, either of them has been successfully generalized
   to multirelay channels. In this paper, to allow each relay node the
   freedom of choosing either of the two strategies, we propose a unified
   framework, where both the D-F and C-F strategies can be employed
   simultaneously in the network. It turns out that, to incorporate in full
   the advantages of both the best known D-F and C-F strategies into a
   unified framework, the major challenge arises as follows: For the D-F
   relay nodes to fully utilize the help of the C-F relay nodes, decoding
   at the D-F relay nodes should not be conducted until all the blocks have
   been finished; however, in the multilevel D-F strategy, the upstream
   nodes have to decode prior to the downstream nodes in order to help,
   which makes simultaneous decoding at all the D-F relay nodes after all
   the blocks have been finished inapplicable. To tackle this problem,
   nested blocks combined with backward decoding are used in our framework,
   so that the D-F relay nodes at different levels can perform backward
   decoding at different frequencies. As such, the upstream D-F relay nodes
   can decode before the downstream D-F relay nodes, and the use of
   backward decoding at each D-F relay node ensures the full exploitation
   of the help of both the other D-F relay nodes and the C-F relay nodes.
   The achievable rates under our unified relay framework are found to
   combine both the best known D-F and C-F achievable rates and include
   them as special cases. It is also demonstrated through a Gaussian
   network example that our achievable rates are generally better than the
   rates obtained with existing unified schemes and with D-F or C-F alone.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of dual-hop transmission from a source to a destination via
   two parallel full-duplex relays in block-Rayleigh fading environment is
   investigated. All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to
   their forward channel gains; however, they have perfect information
   about their backward channel gains. We also assume a stringent decoding
   delay constraint of one fading block that makes the definition of
   ergodic (Shannon) capacity meaningless. The focus of this paper is on
   simple, efficient, and practical relaying schemes to increase the
   expected-rate at the destination. For this purpose, various combinations
   of relaying protocols and the broadcast approach (multi-layer coding)
   are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF) relaying, the maximum
   finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on the
   continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the
   proposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are
   added coherently at the destination although each relay has no
   information about the number of layers being successfully decoded by the
   other relay. It is proved that the optimal coding scheme is transmitting
   uncorrelated signals via the relays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of
   ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF) relaying is analytically derived. For
   further performance improvement, a hybrid decode-amplify-forward (DAF)
   relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach at the source and
   relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and maximum finite-layer
   expected-rate are presented. Moreover, the maximum throughput and
   maximum expected-rate in the compress-forward (CF) relaying adopting the
   broadcast approach, using optimal quantizers and Wyner-Ziv compression
   at the relays, are fully derived. All theoretical results are
   illustrated by numerical simulations. As it turns out from the results,
   when the ratio of the relay power to the source power is high, the CF
   relaying outperforms DAF (and hence outperforms both DF and AF
   relaying); otherwise, DAF scheme is superior.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless sensor network (WSN) commonly requires lower level security
   for public information gathering, whilst a body sensor network (BSN)
   must be secured with strong authenticity to protect personal health
   information. In this paper, some practical problems with the message
   authentication codes (MACs), which were proposed in the popular security
   architectures for WSNs, are reconsidered. The analysis shows that the
   recommended MACs for WSNs, e.g., CBCMAC (TinySec), OCB-MAC (MiniSec),
   and XCBC-MAC (SenSec), might not be exactly suitable for BSNs.
   Particularly an existential forgery attack is elaborated on XCBC-MAC.
   Considering the hardware limitations of BSNs, we propose a new family of
   tunable lightweight MAC based on the PRESENT block cipher. The first
   scheme, which is named TuLP, is a new lightweight MAC with 64-bit output
   range. The second scheme, which is named TuLP-128, is a 128-bit variant
   which provides a higher resistance against internal collisions. Compared
   with the existing schemes, our lightweight MACs are both time and
   resource efficient on hardware-constrained devices.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The use of Unglazed Transpired Solar Collectors (UTSCs) is considered to
   be one of the most effective methods of reducing HVAC loads in
   buildings. The operation of the UTSC is relatively simple. A perforated
   absorber plate is installed in a location where it is exposed to solar
   radiation. Air is drawn through the perforations, and into the fresh air
   intake of an HVAC system. This pre-warmed air could make a significant
   contribution towards decreasing the energy used for heating.
   Unfortunately, commercially available UTSC products are no longer
   geometrically similar to the products used to produce correlations used
   by designers for estimating heat loss and effectiveness. The intent of
   the current investigation, therefore, is to numerically investigate
   modern UTSC system performance. Numerical development was successful,
   and the model was validated by comparison to existing experiments and
   correlations. An experimental investigation, however, is still required
   to provide formal validation. Correlations for heat loss and
   effectiveness have been developed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the opportunistic spectrum access for

   of the channel availability is first derived through a finite-state

   of primary transmitters. Utilizing the channel availability statistics,
   we propose a game-theoretic spectrum access scheme for vehicles to
   opportunistically access licensed channels in a distributed manner. In
   particular, the spectrum access process is modeled as a noncooperative
   congestion game. The existence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) is proved,
   and its efficiency is analyzed when employing the uniform medium access
   control protocol and slotted ALOHA, respectively. Furthermore, a
   spectrum access algorithm is devised to achieve a pure NE with high
   efficiency and fairness. Simulation results validate our analysis and
   demonstrate that the proposed spectrum access scheme can achieve higher

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic bandgap structures are considered a viable solution for
   the problem of switching noise in printed circuit boards and packages.
   Less attention, however, has been given to whether or not the
   introduction of EBGs affects the EMI potential of the circuit to couple
   unwanted energy to neighboring layers or interconnects. In this paper,
   we show that the bandgap of EBG structures, as generated using the
   Brillouin diagram, does not necessarily correspond to the suppression
   bandwidth typically generated using S-parameters. We show that the
   reactive near fields radiating from openings within the EBG layers can
   be substantial and are present in the entire frequency band including
   propagating and nonpropagating mode regions. These fields decay fast
   with distance; however, they can couple significant energy to adjacent
   layers and to signal lines. The findings are validated using full-wave
   three-dimensional numerical simulation. Based on this work, design
   guidelines for EBG structures can be drawn to insure not only
   suppression of switching noise but also minimization of EMI and insuring

Abstract = {{Effective removal and transport of water in the flow channel of a proton
   exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell (PEMFC) is significantly important to
   the critical water management in PEMFCs. In this study, the process of
   water removal and transport is investigated numerically by using the
   volume-of-fluid method for a flow channel having a hydrophilic plate in
   the middle of the channel. The results show that the liquid water
   droplet on the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) surface can be removed
   effectively, and the removal process is facilitated significantly by the
   hydrophilic plate which should have a surface contact angle larger than
   the bottom channel surface but less than the MEA surface. Once the
   liquid water contacts the plate, it is detached from the MEA surface,
   and transported to the channel surface along the plate surface; whereas
   without the plate the water droplet is transported along the MEA surface
   under the same flow condition. The pressure drop associated with the
   flow in the channel can be reduced substantially by the presence of the
   plate due to a characteristic change in the water removal and transport
   process, when compared to the pressure drop in a conventional flow
   channel or a channel with a needle shown in literature. The wettability,
   the length and the height of the plate all can have an impact on the
   water transport and dynamics as well as the associated pressure drop in
   the flow channel. A parametric study is carried out to determine the
   optimal values for the surface contact angle, the length and height of
   the plate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to determine the effects of the land's meteorological
   conditions on the dispersion of an accidental release of H2S using the
   CALPro software. The three Canadian cities or towns of Edmonton,
   Yarmouth and Whitehorse, which are all of different meteorological
   conditions, were chosen as the domains of study. Hourly geophysical,
   surface and upper air meteorological data were used with CALMET to model
   the wind field of the three domains for the modeling period of March 11,
   2012 from 00h00 to 23h00 LST. Individual 5-h modeling periods where the
   wind field showed the most significant variations were chosen for each
   region of study. CALPUFF was used to model the dispersion effects of an
   accidental release of H2S from a single point source due to an
   accidental vessel puncture using time-varying emission data modified to
   suit each region's modeling period. Despite the wind reversal
   encountered in Edmonton, its relatively flat terrain allowed H2S to
   disperse outwards, causing concentrations to accumulate lower than the
   other two regions but still to sever levels and a much greater
   population. Differences between the effect of land and sea breeze on H2S
   dispersion in Yarmouth's coastal region caused concentrations to
   accumulate higher than the other two regions and to life threatening
   levels around the source. The mountainous terrain of Whitehorse shaped
   the plume trajectory, causing H2S concentrations to accumulate to levels
   that can cause irreversible health effects at various times and
   locations. Results show that each area's meteorological conditions will
   have different impacts on dispersion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A single-cycle tree-based 64-bit binary comparator with constant-delay
   (CD) logic realized in a 65-nm, 1-V CMOS process is presented in this
   paper. Unlike dynamic logic yet domino-compatible, CD logic
   predischarges the output to logic ``0{''} and conditionally makes a
   transition to logic ``1{''} through the critical-path CLK PMOS
   transistors for an NMOS transistor network. The constant delay
   (regardless of the fan-in) feature makes it up to faster than a dynamic
   logic gate during the D-Q mode for a complex logic such as a two-bit
   binary comparator. The proposed comparator's architecture is divided
   into two stages, where the first stage adapts a novel tree comparator
   structure specifically designed for static logic to achieve low-power
   consumption and the second stage utilizes CD logic to realize high
   performance without sacrificing the overall energy efficiency. At 1-V
   supply, the proposed comparator's measured delay is 167 ps, and has an
   average power and a leakage power of 2.34 mW and 0.06 mW, respectively.
   At 0.3-pJ iso-energy or 250-ps iso-delay budget, the proposed comparator
   with CD logic is 20\% faster or 17\% more energy-efficient compared to a
   comparator implemented with just the static logic.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a systematic approach to the synthesis of a novel
   dual-band matching network is proposed and applied to design a dual-band
   power amplifier (PA) capable of maintaining high power efficiency at two
   arbitrary, widely spaced frequencies. The proposed network incorporates
   two different stages. The first one transforms the targeted complex
   impedances, at the two operating frequencies, to a real one. The second
   stage is a dual band filter that ensures the matching of the former real
   impedance to the termination impedance. An additional transmission line
   is incorporated between the two stages to adjust the impedances at the
   second and third harmonics without altering the impedances seen at the
   fundamental frequencies. The harmonic termination control is very
   effective in enhancing the efficiency of radio frequency transistors,
   especially when exploiting the Class J design space. The proposed
   dual-band matching network synthesis methodology was applied to design a
   dual band PA using a packaged 45 W Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistor. The
   PA prototype maintained a peak power efficiency of about 68\% at
   operating frequencies of 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz. In addition, a Volterra
   based digital pre-distortion technique was successfully applied to
   linearize the PA response around the two operating frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{To enable automated analysis of rehabilitation movements, an approach
   for accurately identifying and segmenting movement repetitions is
   required. This paper proposes an approach for online, automated
   segmentation and identification of movement segments from continuous
   time-series data of human movement, obtained from body-mounted inertial
   measurement units or from motion capture data. The proposed approach
   uses a two-stage identification and recognition process, based on
   velocity features and stochastic modeling of each motion to be
   identified. In the first stage, motion segment candidates are identified
   based on a characteristic sequence of velocity features such as velocity
   peaks and zero velocity crossings. In the second stage, hidden Markov
   models are used to accurately identify segment locations from the
   identified candidates. The proposed approach is capable of online
   segmentation and identification, enabling interactive feedback in
   rehabilitation applications. The approach is validated on 20 healthy
   subjects and four rehabilitation patients performing rehabilitation
   movements, achieving segmentation accuracy of 87\% with user specific
   templates and 79\%-83\% accuracy with user-independent templates.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a study of the formation of pseudo-periodic

   pulsed nanosecond ytterbium fibre laser. It investigates the effect of
   short 100 ns pulsed laser beam properties including laser power, laser
   frequency, beam polarization, angle of incidence, and scanning speed on
   the formation of pseudo-periodic microstructures. The associated process
   parameters are grouped into two representing quantities: laser intensity

   quantities on the surface topography (shape, periodicity, and
   roughness), heat affected zone (HAZ), chemical composition (oxidation
   and titanium phase transformation) and mechanical properties (hardness)
   of the modified surface. It is shown that the microstructures initiation
   is not possible until laser intensity reaches a certain value close to
   the damage threshold of the material. After the microstructures are
   initiated, the laser intensity may remain constant and the growth of
   structures is mainly controlled by the effective energy.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the nucleation of carbon atoms to form carbon clusters on
   transition metal substrates during chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   synthesis, the structure, energetics, and mobility of carbon
   intermediates up to 6 atoms on the Ni(111) surface were investigated
   using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Carbon clusters were found to be
   more thermodynamically stable than adsorbed atomic carbon, with linear
   carbon structures being more stable than branched and ring structures.
   Carbon chains were also found to have higher mobility than branched
   configurations. The interaction energy between carbon clusters and the
   Ni surface shows that branched carbon clusters have stronger interaction
   with the Ni substrate when compared with the carbon chains, supporting
   that carbon chains generally have higher mobility than branched
   clusters. The transition states and energy barriers for the formation of
   different carbon clusters were also studied. The results show that the
   formation of the branched configurations is kinetically favored as it
   presents lower energy barriers than those obtained for carbon chains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces our proposed Split- and Aggregated-TCP (SA-TCP)
   scheme's enhanced TCP performance in a smart metering infrastructure

   collects data packets from smart meters in a certain region over
   separate TCP connections, then reliably aggregates them in one TCP
   connection to the management server of the utility. Our proposed scheme
   responds better to data traffic dynamics of smart meters and makes TCP
   congestion control effective.
   A full mathematical model of SA-TCP is provided. Validated by extensive
   ns-2 simulations, the model accurately and flexibly predicts the SA-TCP
   scheme's throughput, packet loss rate and packet delay. Furthermore, we
   formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal number of SA-TCP

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of planning a path for a robot to
   monitor a known set of features of interest in an environment. We
   represent the environment as a graph with vertex weights and edge
   lengths. The vertices represent regions of interest, edge lengths give
   travel times between regions and the vertex weights give the importance
   of each region. As the robot repeatedly performs a closed walk on the
   graph, we define the weighted latency of a vertex to be the maximum time
   between visits to that vertex, weighted by the importance (vertex
   weight) of that vertex. Our goal is to find a closed walk that minimizes
   the maximum weighted latency of any vertex. We show that there does not
   exist a polynomial time algorithm for the problem. We then provide two
   approximation algorithms; an O(logn)-approximation algorithm and an
   O(log.G)-approximation algorithm, where.G is the ratio between the
   maximum and minimum vertex weights. We provide simulation results which
   demonstrate that our algorithms can be applied to problems consisting of
   thousands of vertices and a case study for patrolling a city for crime.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, economical flash heat treatment of the fabricated silicon based
   electrodes is introduced to boost the performance and cycle capability
   of Li-ion batteries. The treatment reveals a high mass fraction of Si,
   improved interfacial contact, synergistic SiO2/C coating, and a
   conductive cellular network for improved conductivity, as well as
   flexibility for stress compensation. The enhanced electrodes achieve a
   first cycle efficiency of similar to 84\% and a maximum charge capacity
   of 3525 mA h g(-1), almost 84\% of silicon's theoretical maximum.
   Further, a stable reversible charge capacity of 1150 mA h g(-1) at 1.2 A
   g(-1) can be achieved over 500 cycles. Thus, the flash heat treatment
   method introduces a promising avenue for the production of industrially
   viable, next-generation Li-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops and demonstrates a wastewater system dynamics model
   as a decision support tool that can assist utility managers to ensure
   financial sustainability while maintaining customer expectations for
   service performance. To achieve implementation of the model, a
   demonstration case study is developed using data from a medium-sized
   city in Ontario, Canada, having a large backlog of deteriorated
   wastewater pipes. Specific outcomes for this study include: (1)
   presentation of a methodology to parameterize the demonstration model
   using available utility data; (2) demonstration of the significance of
   interrelationships between system variables on a system's performance
   indicators such as total life-cycle costs, Internal Condition Grade of
   pipes, sewage fees; and (3) exploration of alternative financially
   sustainable management strategies for operating a wastewater network
   that involve the trade-offs between maintaining a strict `zero fund
   balance' with no borrowing, versus issuing debt to accelerate a capital
   works program.
   Results indicate that a financing strategy involving borrowing can
   minimize the total life-cycle cost while maximizing the service
   performance level of the network. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{Causal loop diagrams are developed for wastewater collection networks to
   identify complex interactions and feedback loops among physical,
   financial, and social sectors. Causal loop diagrams are then
   incorporated into a novel system dynamics based decision support tool
   that can be used for financially sustainable management of wastewater
   collection networks. Data requirements to develop the decision support
   tool are discussed along with how can the decision support tool be used
   to manage a utility.
   The presented causal loop diagram is the first known attempt to lay out
   the interrelationships among system components using a formal technique.
   The causal loop diagram establishes the existence of several interacting
   feedback loops and demonstrates that the management of wastewater
   collection networks constitutes a complex dynamic system for which
   traditional management tools are deemed inadequate. The use of causal
   loop diagrams can be useful to mitigate effects of the silo-based
   organizational culture prevalent in many water utilities.
   The system dynamics model is the first known decision support tool to
   quantitatively simulate the influence of interrelationships and feedback
   loops in wastewater collection network management. The model is a
   mathematical representation of the causal loop diagram to capture cost
   drivers and revenues sources in the system. It also includes a set of
   policy levers which allows formulation of various financing and
   rehabilitation strategies. The model can be used to develop short- and
   long-term management plans. The impact of financing and rehabilitation
   strategies on system performance can be simulated and evaluated in terms
   of financial and service level metrics. The decision support tool can
   also be used by utilities to ensure essential data is collected and
   flows within organizational units. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework to develop, implement and communicate a
   multi-perspective asset management plan, for wastewater collection
   networks. The framework takes into account four strategic perspectives -
   socio-political, financial, operational/technical, and regulatory - and
   devises four strategic themes for sustainable wastewater collection
   systems.
   The asset management strategic themes, perspectives, and strategic
   objectives were developed from the proceedings of collaborative working
   sessions held at the first Canadian National Asset Managers workshop in
   2007 in Hamilton, Ontario. The themes and strategic objectives are
   illustrated in a strategy map and detailed in the modified balanced
   scorecard model. A case study based on real data presents the use of
   business intelligence tools to implement, monitor, and report various
   components of the proposed framework.
   The proposed framework provides a unified gateway for efficient and
   effective management of wastewater collection systems. It can be adapted
   to devise and implement strategic asset management plans in comparable
   organizations, and to comply with the new legislative requirements that
   demand increasing accountability to meet stakeholders' expectations,
   protection of public health and environment, efficient allocation of
   funds, and greater disclosure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   fouling rates using advanced data analysis techniques}},

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale investigation of the performance of biofiltration as a
   pre-treatment to ultrafiltration for drinking water treatment was
   conducted between 2008 and 2010. The objective of this study was to
   further understand the fouling behaviour of ultrafiltration at pilot
   scale and assess the utility of different foulant monitoring tools.
   Various fractions of natural organic matter (NOM) and
   colloidal/particulate matter of raw water, biofilter effluents, and
   membrane permeate were characterized by employing two advanced NOM
   characterization techniques: liquid chromatography - organic carbon
   detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (FEEM)
   combined with principal component analysis (PCA). A framework of fouling
   rate quantification and classification was also developed and utilized
   in this study. In cases such as the present one where raw water quality
   and therefore fouling potential vary substantially, such classification
   can be considered essential for proper data interpretation. The
   individual and combined contributions of various NOM fractions and
   colloidal/particulate matter to hydraulically reversible and
   irreversible fouling were investigated using various multivariate
   statistical analysis techniques. Protein-like substances and biopolymers
   were identified as major contributors to both reversible and
   irreversible fouling, whereas colloidal/particulate matter can alleviate
   the extent of irreversible fouling. Humic-like substances contributed
   little to either reversible or irreversible fouling at low level fouling
   rates. The complementary nature of FEEM-PCA and LC-OCD for assessing the
   fouling potential of complex water matrices was also illustrated by this
   pilot-scale study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multi-year multi-objective planning algorithm for
   enabling distribution networks to accommodate high penetrations of
   plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in conjunction with renewable
   distributed generation (DG). The proposed algorithm includes
   consideration of uncertainties and will help local distribution
   companies (LDC) better assess the expected impacts of PEVs on their
   networks and on proposed renewable DG connections. The goal of the
   proposed algorithm is to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and system
   costs during the planning horizon. An approach based on a non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm (NDSGA) is utilized to solve the planning
   problem of determining the optimal level of PEV penetration as well as
   the location, size, and year of installation of renewable DG units. The
   planning problem is defined in terms of multi-objective mixed integer

Abstract = {{For planetary rover applications, a volumetric contact modelling
   approach is used to capture the dynamics of the rigid tyre/soil
   interface. The volumetric contact model allows for determining
   closed-form expressions for the tyre contact forces. These volumetric
   force representations contain information about the shape of the contact
   geometry so that the analytical expressions result in fast simulations.
   Three different volumetric rigid tyre models are developed and evaluated
   from a plasticity point of view. The performance of each tyre is tested
   and compared with respect to the resistance force caused by the ongoing
   compaction of the soil and the resultant plastic deformation. The
   quantity used to model the plastic deformation of the soil is
   represented by the soil rebound. Moreover, each tyre model is compared
   against experimental data to evaluate its validity.}},

Title = {{Effect of burst and recombination models for Monte Carlo transport of
   interacting carriers in a-Se x-ray detectors on Swank noise}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors describe the modification to a previously developed
   Monte Carlo model of semiconductor direct x-ray detector required for
   studying the effect of burst and recombination algorithms on detector
   performance. This work provides insight into the effect of different
   charge generation models for a-Se detectors on Swank noise and
   recombination fraction.
   Methods: The proposed burst and recombination models are implemented in
   the Monte Carlo simulation package, ARTEMIS, developed by Fang et al.
   {[}{''}Spatiotemporal Monte Carlo transport methods in x-ray
   semiconductor detectors: Application to pulse-height spectroscopy in
   a-Se,{''} Med. Phys. 39(1), 308-319 (2012)]. The burst model generates a
   cloud of electron-hole pairs based on electron velocity, energy
   deposition, and material parameters distributed within a spherical
   uniform volume (SUV) or on a spherical surface area (SSA). A simple
   first-hit (FH) and a more detailed but computationally expensive
   nearest-neighbor (NN) recombination algorithms are also described and
   compared.
   Results: Simulated recombination fractions for a single electron-hole
   pair show good agreement with Onsager model for a wide range of electric
   field, thermalization distance, and temperature. The recombination
   fraction and Swank noise exhibit a dependence on the burst model for
   generation of many electron-hole pairs from a single x ray. The Swank
   noise decreased for the SSA compared to the SUV model at 4 V/mu m, while
   the recombination fraction decreased for SSA compared to the SUV model
   at 30 V/mu m. The NN and FH recombination results were comparable.
   Conclusions: Results obtained with the ARTEMIS Monte Carlo transport
   model incorporating drift and diffusion are validated with the Onsager
   model for a single electron-hole pair as a function of electric field,
   thermalization distance, and temperature. For x-ray interactions, the
   authors demonstrate that the choice of burst model can affect the
   simulation results for the generation of many electron-hole pairs. The
   SSA model is more sensitive to the effect of electric field compared to
   the SUV model and that the NN and FH recombination algorithms did not
   significantly affect simulation results. (C) 2014 American Association

Abstract = {{The effect of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and ciprofloxacin on the
   catabolism of microbial communities was assessed. This was accomplished
   through an ex situ methodology designed to give a priori knowledge on
   the potential for nanoparticles, or other emerging contaminants, to
   affect the catabolic capabilities of microbial communities in the
   environment. Microbial communities from a variety of sources were
   incubated with 31 prespecified carbon sources and either National
   Institute of Standards and Technology reference material 10-nm AuNPs or
   ciprofloxacin on 96-well microtiter plates. From the ciprofloxacin
   study, dose-response curves were generated and exemplified how this
   method can be used to assess the effect of a toxicant on overall
   catabolic capabilities of microbial communities. With 10-nm AuNPs at
   concentrations ranging from 0.01 mu g/mL to 0.5 mu g/mL, rhizosphere
   communities from Typha roots were only slightly catabolically inhibited
   at a single concentration (0.05 mu g/mL); no effects were seen on
   wetland water communities, and a minor positive (i.e., enhanced
   catabolic capabilities) effect was observed for loamy soil communities.
   This positive effect might have been because of a thin layer of citrate
   found on these AuNPs that initiated cometabolism with some of the carbon
   sources studied. Under the conditions considered, the possible adverse
   effects of AuNPs on the catabolic capabilities of microbial communities
   appears to be minimal. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;33:44-51. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile composite has been studied as
   cathode material for lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries. Nonetheless,
   capacity fading has been a challenge for the commercialization of
   batteries. In this study, characterization techniques of scanning
   electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental
   analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   are used to investigate the change of cathode properties with
   charge-discharge cycles. Elemental analysis reveals that sulfur
   accumulates on the surface of the composite at the end of charge, and
   the sulfur formation decreases with cycle number. Scanning electron
   microscopy observations indicate that cathode surface morphology changes
   significantly after several cycles. By modeling the electrochemical
   impedance spectra of the cell in different discharge states, we suggest
   that capacity fading arises mainly from the formation and accumulation
   of irreversible Li2S (and Li2S2) on the cathode surface.}},

Abstract = {{Organic solar cells (OSCs) are studied for their photo-stability in
   inert atmosphere. Polymer solar cells with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ)
   of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
   ester (PCBM) are contrasted with small molecule solar cells with a BHJ
   of chloroindium phthalocyanine (ClInPc) and C-60-fullerene. A series of
   charge extraction layers at the hole and electron collecting contacts
   are examined for their role in OSC performance and stability. The
   inter-compatibilities of these extraction layers in vacuum-deposited
   small molecule OSCs (SM-OSCs) versus solution-coated polymer OSCs
   (P-OSCs) are explored. Through photo-stability studies, we show that
   interfacial extraction layers are necessary to avoid contact
   photo-degradation, which otherwise leads to strong reductions in OSC
   efficiencies. We also highlight certain extraction layer combinations
   that result in strong inter-electrode degradation, and we discuss
   incompatibilities in extraction layers among SM-OSCs versus P-OSCs. Our
   results suggest that the presence of excitons at the organic-electrode
   interface likely plays a critical role in contact photo-degradation. By
   minimizing contact photo-degradation, which dominates the majority of
   short-term OSC degradation, a new avenue for studying OSC stability
   behavior and opportunities to focus on other losses in OSCs become
   possible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Safety-critical distributed real-time applications operating with strict
   temporal constraints rely on deterministic networks with low latency and
   jitter. Traditional fieldbus systems deliver these guarantees, but they
   have limited compatibility with open infrastructures and limited support
   for high transmission rates. Ethernet technology rises as a low-cost,
   high-speed, and ubiquitous alternative to fieldbus systems; however,
   standard Ethernet requires special arbitration mechanisms to support
   real-time traffic because of the standard's inherent nondeterministic
   behavior. This work explores the associated tradeoffs for three
   different solutions for real-time communication over switched Ethernet.
   The paper presents and discusses three architectures that modify
   different network components, enhancing them with additional customized
   modules to support time-triggered communication based on Network Code.
   Using the NetFPGA platform as the unified prototyping technology for all
   the components, we developed an open-source framework to characterize
   each solution using experimental data for the latency, jitter,
   throughput, robustness, and cost in logical resources. The results
   provide insights to help future developers of real-time communication
   technology decide which components to modify according to the
   requirements of their applications.}},

Title = {{New Analysis Methodology for Dynamic Soil Characterization Using
   Free-Decay Response in Resonant-Column Testing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The resonant-column test is widely used for dynamic characterization of
   soils under different confinement and shear-strain conditions. The
   free-decay response of a soil specimen in resonant-column testing shows
   a nonlinear behavior when the strain levels exceed a threshold shear
   strain. However, the dynamic parameters are commonly determined assuming
   a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model. This paper presents a
   new analysis methodology based on the complex exponential method (CEM)
   for the nonlinear dynamic characterization of soil specimens using the
   free-decay response in torsional fixed-free resonant-column testing.
   This analysis methodology represents a solution to the chronic problem
   of evaluating the dynamic properties of soils while avoiding the
   negative effects of imposing many loading cycles at strain levels
   greater than the threshold shear strain, which, in turn, change the
   original dynamic properties of soil specimens. The effectiveness of the
   proposed analysis methodology is demonstrated on a dry-sand specimen
   tested under isotropic loading and unloading conditions, two confining
   pressures (40 and 100 kPa), and different shear-strain levels
   (1.34x10-51.52x10-3). The results from the CEM are compared with the
   results from traditional linear SDOF methods (transfer function and
   free-decay response). Damping ratios obtained from the CEM are also
   compared with values obtained using the
   empirical-mode-decomposition-Hilbert-transform (EMD-HT) method. The
   results show that the damping ratio can be underestimated up to 80\% at
   strain levels greater than the threshold shear strain when computed
   using linear SDOF models. In a nonlinear free-decay response in
   resonant-column testing analyzed using the CEM, it is possible to
   observe that the dry-sand specimen becomes denser (stiffer). Thus the
   shear-wave velocity (resonant frequency) increases at the low
   shear-strain levels imposed during the same test.}},

   different levels of pressure in gas dehydration systems}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OIL GAS AND COAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-94}},
Abstract = {{There are several processes and principles for obtaining high
   triethylene glycol (TEG) purity in gas dehydration process. All methods
   are based on the principle of reducing the effective partial pressure of
   water in the vapour space of the glycol reboiler, and hence obtaining a
   higher glycol concentration at the same temperature. One of the most
   common methods for enhancement of the glycol concentration has been by
   means of pressure reduction in the reboiler. In this article a simple
   method is developed to estimate TEG purity as a function of
   reconcentrator (reboiler) temperature and pressure. The results are
   found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in the literature
   with average absolute deviation being around 0.05\%. The tool developed
   in this study can be of immense practical value for engineers to have a
   quick check on TEG purity as a function of reconcentrator (reboiler)
   temperature and pressure at various conditions without opting for any
   experimental trials. In particular, engineers would find the approach to
   be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex
   expressions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we adapt two existing methods to perform semi-supervised
   temporal clustering: Aligned Cluster Analysis (ACA), a temporal
   clustering algorithm, and Constrained Spectral Clustering, a
   semi-supervised clustering algorithm. In the first method, we add side
   information in the form of pairwise constraints to its objective
   function, and in the second, we add a temporal search to its framework.
   We also extend both methods by propagating the constraints throughout
   the whole similarity matrix. In order to validate the advantage of the
   proposed semi-supervised methods to temporal clustering, we evaluate
   them in comparison to their original versions as well as another
   semi-supervised temporal cluster on three temporal datasets. The results
   show that the proposed methods are competitive and provide good
   improvement over the unsupervised approaches.}},

Abstract = {{With the popularity of intelligent mobile devices, enormous urban
   information has been generated and required by the public. In response,
   ShanghaiGrid (SG) aims to providing abundant information services to the
   public. With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing
   service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public
   using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to
   locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this
   service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation
   under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present
   an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses
   can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations
   in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast
   conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing
   path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic.
   Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message
   destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside
   adversaries. Both rigorous privacy analysis and extensive trace-driven
   simulations demonstrate the efficacy of BusCast scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A novel 8-mask fabrication process for the integration of Low
   Temperature Superconducting (LTS) niobium (Nb) RF circuits with
   gold-based RF MEMS switches is proposed. A fixed and a tunable 3-pole
   bandpass filter (BPF) are fabricated implementing the new Nb-based
   fabrication process. The tunable BPF includes nine dc-contact RF MEMS
   switches. The center frequency of the tunable BPF shifts from 10 GHz to
   9 GHz when the three switches that change the length of the resonators
   are in the `on' state and the other six are in the `off' state. The
   first version of the tunable BPF is all gold-based, which is measured at
   room temperature. The insertion loss of the all gold-based tunable BPF
   is close to 5.5 dB. The switches actuation voltage is around 32 V at
   room temperature. The fixed version of the BPF is fabricated using Nb as
   the lossless metal layer. Measurement of the fixed Nb-based BPF shows
   4.4 dB improvement in the insertion loss at 4 K. The tunable version of
   the superconducting BPF is also fabricated and measured at 4 K. There is
   1 GHz shift in the center frequency of the filter when the three RF MEMS
   switches are actuated. The actuation voltage of the gold-based RF MEMS
   switches at 4 K is about 48 V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the design of a single-pole multiple-throw (SP12T)
   switch with twelve output ports in waveguide technology. The cumbersome
   and bulky routing waveguide networks required to deal with large number
   of ports in waveguide switches are reduced to a very compact structure
   that uses ridge waveguide junctions. The switch concept is provided by
   short circuit elements inside the ridge waveguides that select the
   signal path inside the waveguide structure. This concept avoids the use
   of complex rotary systems to provide path switching, resulting in an
   extremely compact network. A SP12T waveguide switch is built and tested
   to validate the concept. The fabricated prototype integrates the
   transitions to SMA outputs and metallic posts for the short-circuit
   elements. The experimental results show that the proposed approach
   provides a very compact structure, with design parameters that can be
   optimized depending on the targeted application}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost and low-loss Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) integrated platform
   is proposed for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) applications. The proposed
   platform supports mm-wave components in the D-band using dielectric
   image guide structure. The SOI mm-wave integrated platform uses high
   resistivity Silicon wafers for very low-loss in the D-Band. All passive
   components can be fabricated on the same platform with high potential of
   integration of active devices. There is no need for post-fabrication
   assembly steps for complex systems, which will provide high accuracy of
   placement of different components on the same platform. The platform is
   theoretically and experimentally investigated. The fabrication process
   is a simple one-mask fabrication process composed of deep reactive ion
   etching of the device layer of the SOI wafer. Design of dielectric image
   guide in the D-Band is performed. The simulation results show
   attenuation better than 0.25 dB/cm. Fabrication and experimental
   measurements are performed at 60 and 100 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid advancements in mobile devices, users have become more
   attached to them than ever. This rapid growth, combined with millions of
   applications (apps), makse smartphones a favourite means of
   communication among users. In general, the available contents on
   smartphones, apps and the web, come in two versions: (i) free contents
   that are monetized via advertisements (ads); and (ii) paid contents that
   are monetized by user subscription fees. However, the resources, namely,
   energy, bandwidth, and processing power, on-board are limited, and the
   existence of ads in websites and free apps can significantly increase
   the usage of these resources. Therefore, in this paper, we describe an
   approach that enables the separation of web contents in a number of
   websites. Having done so, the energy cost due to downloading, rendering,
   and displaying web ads over Wi-Fi and 3G networks is evaluated. That is,
   how much energy web ads contribute to the total consumed energy when a
   user accesses the web. Furthermore, the bandwidth consumed by web ads in
   a number of well-known websites is also evaluated. The high cost of ads
   on smartphones must be considered by the designers and vendors of apps.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel technique called nested m-trail method in
   all-optical mesh networks for failure localization of any shared risk
   link group (SRLG) with up to d undirected links. The proposed method
   decomposes each network topology that is at least d-connected into
   virtual cycles and trails, in which sets of m-trails that traverse
   through a common monitoring node (MN) can be obtained. The nested
   m-trails are used in the monitoring burst (m-burst) framework, in which
   the MN can localize any SRLG failure by inspecting the optical bursts
   traversing through it. An integer linear program (ILP) and a heuristic
   are proposed for the network decomposition, which are further verified
   by numerical experiments. We show that the proposed method significantly
   reduces the required fault localization latency compared to the existing

Abstract = {{The first course in thermodynamics has traditionally been a challenge
   for students in engineering programs. The course typically introduces
   students to concepts of energy and continuum mechanics, both of which
   are novel to the students. Often, the theory relies upon still-new
   calculus concepts for the students. With such a dense topic, this course
   is most often delivered in a traditional lecture-based structure. In a
   program throughout 7 partner universities, this first course in
   thermodynamics has a reputation for being the ``weed-out{''} course for
   students.
   In the fall of 2013, the author took an established course having 6 lab
   experiments, a popular textbook, a well-evolved syllabus, and overturned
   the motivational structure to create a new delivery model for the
   course. The ``Thermo-Fluids 1{''} course became, to students, the
   7-mission ``Hunt for Energy and Power{''}. The same textbook was used in
   the new delivery model as had been used previously; the same laboratory
   experiments were undertaken by students, but students had a different
   approach to the workload.
   Throughout the course, students proceeded at their own pace, and
   completed 7 ``missions{''}, each with 5 levels of performance. The first
   3 levels were successively more complex analytical problems. The 4th
   level was a lab report based on a moderately challenging open-ended lab
   experiment, and the 5th level was an opportunity for the student to
   extend a concept based on the content of the earlier lab experiment. The
   concept of ``Design{''} was built into the course in a limited, but
   content-rich mode through having students each propose, conduct, and
   report on an improved development or experiment. In this paper, the
   author presents the results of this attempt at ``gamifying{''} a
   thermodynamics course, and illustrates this one model for bringing
   student-directed learning into a heavy content-based course.}},

Abstract = {{We report planar integration of tapered Terahertz (THz) quantum cascade
   lasers (QCLs) with spoof surface plasmon (SSP) structures. The SSP
   structure consists of one plasmonic coupler and periodically arranged
   scatters. The resulting surface-emitting THz beam is highly collimated
   with a beam divergence as narrow as 3.6 degrees x9.7 degrees. As the
   beam divergence is inverse proportional to the light emission area, this
   low divergence indicates a good waveguiding property of the SSP
   structure, while the low optical background of the beam implies a high
   coupling efficiency of the THz wave from the laser cavity to the SSPs.
   Since all the structures are in-plane, this scheme provides a promising
   platform where the well-established SP techniques can be employed to
   engineer the THz QCL beam with high flexibilities.}},

Abstract = {{Among the existing methods of diffusion MRI, high angular resolution
   diffusion imaging (HARDI) excels in its ability to resolve the complex
   orientations of crossing and branching neural fibre tracts in the brain.
   Unfortunately, a widespread integration of HARDI into clinical workflows
   is still hindered by a few practical obstacles, chief among which
   relates to prohibitively long scan times required by current
   implementations of this protocol. In addition, the dependency of HARDI
   on rapid acquisition schemes, such as single-shot echo planar imaging,
   imposes limitations on the maximal spatial resolution that one can
   attain at an acceptable level of signal-to-noise ratio. A possible
   solution to the problem of limited spatial resolution of HARDI could be
   to modify the pattern of k-space encoding so as to maximally utilize the
   bandwidth efficiency of frequency encoding at the expense of using a
   smaller number of phase encoding steps. At the same time, a substantial
   reduction in the total acquisition time could be achieved through a
   subcritical sampling in the q-space. Although both the above mechanisms
   are bound to yield highly incomplete data, a stable and reliable
   reconstruction of the associated HARDI signals is still possible to
   achieve within the framework of compressed sensing. To solve this
   problem, we introduce an efficient reconstruction procedure, whose
   effectiveness is demonstrated through both in silico and in vivo
   experiments.}},

   applications. Also, the long-term stability results show stable FE

Abstract = {{Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are powerful ensemble learning
   techniques that have been successfully applied to several
   low-dimensional applications. In GBMs, the learning algorithm
   sequentially fits new models to provide more accurate prediction of the
   response variable. Despite their high accuracy, GBMs suffer from major
   drawbacks such as high memory-consumption. In addition, given the fact
   that the learning algorithm is essentially sequential, it has problems
   with parallelization by design. Therefore, building optimized GBMs for
   high-dimensional applications requires powerful computations resources.
   In this paper, using real, high-dimensional (i.e. 1776 predictors)
   dataset, we demonstrate that by using different features
   selection/reduction techniques, the computations costs for building and
   tuning Tree-based GBMs can be substantially reduced at a slight drop in
   prediction accuracy. To cope with the data-intensive computations
   involved in building and tuning the ensembles, we utilize Amazon Elastic
   Compute Cloud (EC2) web service.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a robot patrolling problem in which events
   arrive randomly over time at the vertices of a graph. When an event
   arrives it remains active for a random amount of time. If that time
   active exceeds a certain threshold, then we say that the event is a true
   event; otherwise it is a false event. The robot(s) can traverse the
   graph to detect newly arrived events, and can revisit these events in
   order to classify them as true or false. The goal is to plan robot paths
   that maximize the number of events that are correctly classified, with
   the constraint that there are no false positives. We show that the
   offline version of this problem is NP-hard. We then consider a simple
   patrolling policy based on the traveling salesman tour, and characterize
   the probability of correctly classifying an event. We investigate the
   problem when multiple robots follow the same path, and we derive the
   optimal (and not necessarily uniform) spacing between robots on the
   path.}},

   connective stability, where the overall system is stable in the sense of
   Lyapunov despite uncertainties and time-variations in the coupling
   strengths between subsystems. The second is the standard notion of
   asymptotic (Schur) stability of the overall system, assuming all
   interconnections are fixed at their nominal levels. We make connections
   to spectral graph theory, and specifically the spectra of signed
   adjacency matrices, to provide graph theoretic characterizations of the
   two kinds of stability for the case of homogeneous scalar subsystems. In
   the process, we derive bounds on the largest eigenvalue of signed
   adjacency matrices that are of independent interest.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address a communication network design problem for
   distributed computation with privacy guarantees. More precisely, given a
   possible communication graph between different agents in a network, the
   objective is to design a protocol, by proper selection of the weights in
   the dynamics induced by the communication graph, such that 1) weighted
   average consensus of the initial states of all the agents will be
   reached; and 2) there are privacy guarantees, where each agent is not
   able to retrieve the initial states of non-neighbor agents, with the
   exception of a small subset of agents ( that will be precisely
   characterized). In this paper, we assume that the network is
   cooperative, i.e., each agent is passive in the sense that it executes
   the protocol correctly and does not provide incorrect information to its
   neighbors, but may try to retrieve the initial states of non-neighbor
   agents. Furthermore, we assume that each agent knows the communication
   protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Quality of service (QoS) aware resource allocation for the uplink of a
   decode-and-forward relay assisted Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
   Access (OFDMA) based cellular system is investigated. Incorporating
   relays in the system improves the cell-edge coverage and the system
   throughput. Resource (relay, subcarrier and power) allocation problem is
   formulated with the objective of maximizing the total system throughput
   subject to the satisfaction of user QoS requirements and individual
   total power constraints of the users and relays. The throughput of each
   end-to-end link is modeled considering both the direct and relay links.
   Due to non-convex nature of the original resource allocation problem,
   the optimal solution is obtained by solving a relaxed problem via two
   level dual decomposition. The performance of the proposed scheme is
   evaluated in the scenarios based on LTE-A network model. Numerical
   results reveal that the proposed scheme guarantees each user's QoS
   satisfaction at the expense of a slight degradation of the system
   throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are usually recorded in a clinical setting by
   medical professionals using twelve leads attached to the patient. Our
   industry partner has developed a single-lead ECG machine for use by
   patients at home. Patients can then send these readings to remote
   doctors. The goal of the machines is to make medical expertise more
   accessible, affordable, and convenient.
   The ECGs recorded by patients with a single-lead suffer greatly from
   baseline wandering and high frequency noises, as compared to ECGs
   recorded with twelve-leads in a clinical setting.
   Accurate R-peak detection is an important step in ECG analysis. A
   variety of methods have been proposed in the past against standard
   clinical twelve-lead ECG recordings. In this study, we propose a new
   R-peak detection algorithm for singlelead mobile ECG recordings. Our
   area-based approach is built on the understanding that QRS complexes are
   typically narrow and tall, resulting in large areas over the curve
   around these locations. Our algorithm is simple to implement,
   computationally efficient, and does not require any signal
   pre-processing. This conceptual simplicity is a quality that
   distinguishes our approach from existing solutions.
   We evaluated our algorithm against data collected by patients from
   single-lead portable devices, and yielded 99.4\% precision and 99.4\%
   recall. The MIT/BIT Arrhythmia Database of twelvelead clinical ECG
   recordings was also used to verify our algorithm. On this dataset we
   obtained a precision of 99.3\% and recall of 98.6\%.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the LCD monitor manufacturing costs per square inch dropping
   below \$2 this year, full-size, 14{''}x17{''} digital chest x-ray
   detector systems are still being sold commercially for tens of thousands
   of dollars, for two main reasons. First, the extra required p+ doped
   silicon layer cannot be deposited in the same fabrication facility as a
   standard thin-film transistor panel for LCD monitors. Secondly, low
   volume of sales of digital radiography panels result in large margins
   and high sales prices for detector manufacturers. In this report, we
   show the system design of a truly low-cost, digital x-ray detector. The
   primary cost-cutting technique is the replacement of conventional,
   vertical PIN photodetectors with lateral metal-semiconductor-metal
   photodetectors, which can be fabricated using existing TFT processes.
   This paper covers the design of the pixel architecture, pixel array, and
   readout electronics.}},

Abstract = {{As the easiest and cheapest way of authenticating an end user, password
   based authentication methods have been consistently chosen by almost
   every new cloud service. Unfortunately, the explosive growth of cloud
   services and web applications has made it impossible for users to manage
   dozens of passwords for accessing different cloud services. The
   situation is even worse considering the potential application of
   massively parallel computing devices such as GPU and ASIC for efficient
   password cracking. Hence, from a usability viewpoint, passwords may have
   reached the end of their useful life.
   Motivated by a number of recent industry initiatives for online
   authentication, we present Loxin, an innovative solution for
   password-less universal login. Loxin aims to improve on passwords with
   respect to both usability and security. Loxin takes advantages of push
   message services for mobile devices and enables users to access multiple
   cloud services by using pre-owned identities, such as email addresses,
   together with few taps on their mobile devices.
   In particular, the Loxin server cannot generate users' login
   credentials, thereby eliminating the potential risk of server
   compromises. Loxin is resistant to the most common attacks on cloud
   services such as replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. We also
   discuss possible extensions for protecting Loxin from vendor lock-in and
   single point of failure, in order to ensure Loxin to be an open and
   stable authentication system. The application of the proposed Loxin
   security framework to the recent MintChip Challenge demonstrates the
   power of Loxin for building a real-world password-less mobile payment
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Gassing problems and premature insulation failures of wind turbine
   transformers have been documented lately, indicating concerns with
   insulation reliability of power electronic converter-fed devices. This
   fact shows that the transformer insulation system degrades under high

   those operated under power frequency AC voltages of the same amplitude.
   To study such degradation processes, unlike the cases of AC or DC
   voltages, under high dV/dt voltages, interferences coming from the pulse
   generator and fast oscillatory input voltages pose substantial
   challenges. In this work, a method to evaluate the effect of voltage
   waveform characteristics such as rate of rise (ROR) on the extent of

Abstract = {{Wind energy has become a significant portion of power generation
   resources; consequently its variability and uncertainty introduces
   various challenges for both the operation and planning of power systems.
   One of the great challenges of integrating wind energy in power systems
   can be seen from the reliability assessment perspective. Indeed, there
   is an ongoing recognized need to study the contribution of wind
   generation to overall system reliability and to ensure the adequacy of
   generation capacity. With respect to the evaluation of the reliability
   of power systems incorporating wind energy, a variety of criteria and
   techniques have been developed over the years.
   This paper is dedicated to reviewing the literature pertaining to
   generating system adequacy assessment in general and with regard to wind
   energy in particular. This paper firstly reviews the concepts and
   related aspects of generating system adequacy assessment; it also
   includes detailed description of the involved elements and the available
   widely commonly-used techniques. Then, it discusses the main issues
   arising when implementing wind generation into the adequacy assessment
   of generating systems. Moreover, the paper surveys the previously
   reported works that have proposed to involve wind generation into
   adequacy assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Balancing the energy demand in isolated microgrids is a critical issue
   especially in presence of intermittent energy sources. Battery Energy
   Storage Systems (BESS) can be installed in such circumstances to supply
   the demand and support the reserve requirements of the isolated
   microgrid. However, due to the high installation costs of BESS, there is
   need for proper mechanisms to select such systems and size them
   optimally. Furthermore, since BESS are often installed to serve multiple
   applications, these should be properly modeled to coordinate their
   different functionalities. In this paper, a multi-year operational
   planning model is developed to optimally determine the BESS optimal
   power rating and energy capacity along with the year of installation
   taking into account its coordinated operation. The model includes unit
   commitment formulation with renewable energy (RE) and BESS constraints.
   Several scenarios and case studies are carried out to test the model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an analytical framework for offloading
   cellular traffic by outdoor WiFi network in the vehicular environment.
   Specifically, we consider a generic vehicular user with Poisson data
   service arrivals to download/upload data from/to the Internet through
   the cost-effective WiFi network (want-to) or the cellular network
   providing full service coverage (have-to). Under this scenario, the WiFi
   offloading performance, characterized by offloading effectiveness, is
   analyzed in terms of desired average service delay which is the average
   time the data services can be deferred for WiFi availability. We
   establish an explicit relation between offloading effectiveness and
   average service delay by an M/G/1/K queueing model, and the tradeoff
   between the two is examined. We validate our analytical framework
   through simulations based on a VANET simulation tool VANETMobisim and
   real map data sets. Our analytical framework should be valuable for
   providing offloading guidelines to both vehicular users and network

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are vulnerable to selective forwarding
   attacks that selectively drop a subset of the forwarding packets to
   degrade network performances. Due to unstable wireless channels, the
   packet loss rate between sensor nodes might be high, especially in
   hostile environments. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the
   malicious drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a
   Channelaware Reputation System (CRS) to identify selective forwarding
   misbehaviours from normal packet losses caused by poor channel quality
   or medium access collision. Specifically, CRS is based on normal packet
   loss estimation and neighbour monitoring. Each node maintains a
   reputation table to evaluate forwarding behaviours of its neighbours.
   Reputation value is determined by the deviation of the monitored packet
   loss rate and estimated normal loss rate. The nodes with reputation
   below a threshold are identified as misbehaving nodes and isolated from
   data forwarding paths. Furthermore, we develop weighted reputation
   propagation and integration functions to improve detection efficiency.
   Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate
   that CRS can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and
   significantly improve the network throughput.}},

Abstract = {{In smart grid, a huge amount of privacy data need to be transmitted
   securely and efficiently. Compressed sensing can be used to improve the
   transmission efficiency by exploiting the data sparsity, while this
   sparsity is usually destroyed by the encryption process, making
   compressed sensing inapplicable. A possible workaround is to perform
   compressed sensing first and then encrypt the compressed data. However,
   this two-step workaround lowers the efficiency. In this paper, we
   propose a novel data transmission scheme EncryCS. Compressed sensing in
   EncryCS provides security and simultaneously enhances the transmission
   efficiency in one step. The prerequisite of compressed sensing is to
   construct a measurement matrix satisfying the restricted isometry
   property that ensures the perfect recovery of the signal. To make the
   matrix secret and feasible, we generate it with a pseudorandom sequence
   generator. By using this matrix, EncryCS transforms a large amount of
   plaintext data into a small amount of ciphertext data. EncryCS is proven
   to possess a high security. Extensive simulations are performed based on
   the real-world data obtained from the PowerNet project at Stanford
   University. The results demonstrate that EncryCS can compress data by
   order of magnitude, and the transmitted data can be almost perfectly
   recovered.}},

Abstract = {{Security and privacy concerns are significant challenges in the smart
   grid, especially in regards to the privacy of the electricity customers,
   as customers' daily habits and personal information can be revealed from
   their consumption patterns. The current security and privacy-preserving
   schemes depend on periodic reports for customers' consumption; these
   reports increase the computation and communication overheads on the
   limited-resources smart meters. This paper proposes a security and
   privacy-preserving scheme in the building area network (BAN), which is a
   cluster of home area networks (HAN). The proposed scheme is based on
   forecasting the future electricity demand for the whole BAN; thus, the
   BAN connects to the electricity provider only if the total demand of the
   cluster is changed. The proposed scheme employs the lattice-based public
   key NTRU cryptosystem to guarantee the confidentiality and authenticity
   of the exchanged messages and to further reduce the computation and
   communication load. The security analysis shows that our proposed scheme
   can achieve the privacy and security requirements. In addition, it
   efficiently reduces the communication and computation overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-quality charging, which provides the electric vehicles (EVs) with
   multiple levels of charging services, including quality-guaranteed
   service (QGS) and best effort service (BES), can guarantee the charging
   service quality for the qualified EVs in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network.
   To perform the multi-quality charging, the evaluation on the EV's
   attributes is necessary to determine which level of charging service can
   be offered to this EV. However, the EV owner's privacy such as real
   identity, lifestyle, location, and sensitive information in the
   attributes may be disclosed during the evaluation and authentication. In
   this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multi-quality charging
   (PMQC) scheme in V2G network to evaluate the EV's attributes,
   authenticate its service eligibility and generate its bill without
   revealing the EV's private information. Specifically, we propose an
   evaluation mechanism on the EV's attributes to determine its charging
   service quality. With attribute based encryption, PMQC can prevent the
   EV's attributes from being disclosed to other entities during the
   evaluation. In addition, PMQC can authenticate the EV without revealing
   its real identity. Security analysis demonstrates that the EV's privacy
   mentioned above can be preserved by PMQC. Performance evaluation results
   show that PMQC can achieve higher efficiency in authentication compared
   with other schemes in terms of computation overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Green energy sources, such as solar and wind, provide an alternative
   solution for powering wireless networks. To maximize the utilization of
   green energy charged from different sources, it is desirable to allow
   energy trade among neighbor cells. In this paper, the local energy trade
   issues in a wireless mesh network powered by green energy are studied
   such that energy can be purchased either from neighbor cells or from
   electricity grid, based on the energy charging and discharging
   characteristics in each cell. Our objective is to determine the optimal
   price and quantity of energy purchase and sale for each cell such that
   the profits of all cells can be maximized and their energy demands can
   be fulfilled. To this end, the energy trading problem is formulated as a
   Stackelberg game. Based on the utility function, the closed-form
   expressions of the optimal energy quantity and price for trading are
   derived. Finally, an optimal scheme, namely, Optimal Profits Energy
   Trading ( OPET), is proposed to maximize the profits of all cells. The
   proposed OPET can achieve the optimal solution with polynomial time

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study channel-based authentication, where the receiver
   can identify and authenticate the senders through channel vectors
   estimated from their frames. The authentication process is formulated as
   a sequence of hypothesis test problems. In order to improve the
   detection probability and reduce the false alarm probability, two
   schemes are proposed based on different classification algorithms in
   machine learning. Specifically, support vector machine (SVM) based
   authentication schemes and the linear Fisher discriminant analysis
   (LFDA) based authentication scheme are proposed by exploiting three
   channel features, including the time-of-arrivals, received signal
   strengths, and cyclic-features of the channels. In SVM based schemes,
   the linear and nonlinear SVMs are used to generate classifiers to solve
   the hypothesis test problems. In LFDA based scheme, a linear combination
   of these three channel features is used as the test statistic, which is
   compared with a threshold to perform authentication. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the proposed schemes perform better in terms of the
   misdetection probability and the false alarm probability than several
   existing typical channel-based authentication schemes. Moreover, the
   time complexity and space complexity of the proposed schemes are
   analyzed, and the LFDA based scheme performs the best.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the cooperative transmission scheme and the
   achievable rate for uplink communications in an LTE-Advanced cellular
   network with Type II in-band decodeand- forward relay stations. The
   physical layer uplink transmission is based on single carrier frequency
   division multiple access (SC-FDMA) with frequency-domain equalization
   (FDE). Unlike orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
   where the users achievable rate is the summation of the rates on all
   allocated subcarriers, achievable rate of SC-FDMA system has a more
   complex expression because the subcarriers are transmitted sequentially
   rather than in parallel. With the joint superposition coding for
   cooperative relaying, we derive the expressions of the achievable rate
   for both zero-forcing (ZF) equalization and minimum mean square error
   (MMSE) equalization. Numerical results are given to verify the derived

Abstract = {{A vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) (dis) charging strategy can provide charging
   plans for gridable electric vehicles (GEVs), aiming to offload the heavy
   power loads from the electric power system. However, designing an
   efficient online V2V (dis) charging strategy to achieve optimal energy
   utilization is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a
   semi-distributed online V2V (dis) charging strategy at a swapping
   station based on price control. Specifically, based on the electricity
   price control strategy, GEVs are motivated to contribute to a V2V energy
   transaction due to expected high revenue for discharging GEVs and low
   cost for charging GEVs. The Oligopoly game and Lagrange duality
   optimization techniques are exploited to address the associated optimal
   V2V (dis) charging strategies. Simulation results are presented to
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed V2V (dis) charging strategy.}},

   purchasing a set of edges between these nodes. We assume that players
   have a limited budget with which to bid on each edge and the utility of
   a given set of edges to a player is a function of the resulting network
   layer. We characterize the ranges of player budgets for which the game
   admits pure Nash equilibria for utility functions that depend on the

Abstract = {{Understanding binding cores is of fundamental importance in deciphering
   Protein-DNA (TF-TFBS) binding and gene regulation. Variations (or
   mutations) in binding cores are ubiquitous and have different levels of
   effects on the binding specificity. To alleviate expensive experiments,
   we have developed a new method to discover directly from sequence data
   binding cores and study the effect due to variations. Although existing
   computational methods have produced satisfactory TF-TFBS binding cores,
   they are only one-to-one mappings with no site-specific information on
   residue/nucleotide variations; and also are largely overlapped. In this
   study, we propose a new representation for modeling TF-TFBS binding with
   variants known as TF-TFBS Co-Supportive Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs),
   which are more compact, with more details for site-specific variants,
   and biologically more intuitive for analysis. To achieve this task, we
   have also developed an algorithm to discover TF-TFBS Co-Supportive APCs
   to capture binding cores at a higher precision with much faster runtime
   (>= 1600X) comparing to other methods. The variants in TF-TFBS
   Co-Supportive APCs are also statistically analyzed and demonstrated that
   they can assist homology modeling to synthesize new biological
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{With extensive promising applications, machine to machine (M2M)
   communications or machine-type communication (MTC) have attached a
   tremendous interest among mobile network operators and research groups.
   Supporting multiple MTC devices has been considered as an essential
   requirement in M2M communications. How to achieve a secure and efficient
   access authentication for a group of MTC devices during roaming is a
   challenging issue. In this paper, in order to simultaneously resolve the
   access security and efficiency in MTC, we propose a secure and efficient
   group roaming scheme for MTC between 3GPP and WiMAX networks, named
   SEGR, which is characterized by authenticating all MTC devices in a
   group simultaneously and speeding up the process of authentication
   through adopting a novel certificateless aggregate signature technique.
   Through security analysis, the proposed SEGR can provide robust
   security, especially overcome the drawback of key escrow in
   identity-based (ID-based) aggregate signature schemes. In addition,
   performance evaluations in terms of communication overhead and
   computation complexity demonstrate that SEGR is more efficient than
   those traditional schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, cooperative sensing for multi-channel cognitive radio
   networks (CRNs) is studied, whereby the secondary users (SUs) cooperate
   with each other to sense the multiple channels owned by the primary
   users (PUs). The objective is to better protect the primary system while
   satisfying the SUs' requirement on the expected access time. A general
   scenario is considered, where the channels present different usage
   characteristics and the detection performance of individual SUs varies
   due to the channel conditions between the PUs and SUs. With the dynamics
   in the channel usage characteristics and the detection capacities, each
   SU chooses one channel for sensing to minimize the interference to the
   PUs. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming
   problem which is NP-complete in general. To find the solution
   efficiently, the original problem is transformed into a variant of
   convex bipartite matching problem by constructing a complete bipartite
   graph and defining proper weight vectors. Based on the problem
   transformation, a channel assignment algorithm is proposed for computing
   in polynomial time the solution in terms of the number of SUs, the
   number of channels, and the maximum value of weights. Simulation results
   are presented to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) has been gaining the attention from the
   academic and industry communities due to the promising applications in
   road safety, traffic management and passenger comfort. However, the
   short vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) communication range and the nature of
   vehicle mobility impose many challenges in packet routing and,
   accordingly, infrastructure-based applications, e.g., Internet access.
   For more reliable communication, automobile manufacturers have started
   the investigation to deploy cellular networks, such as LTE, to support
   in-car Internet access. In addition to the high communication cost to
   the end-user, using centric cellular networks for vehicular
   communication applications causes data explosion and network overload. A
   feasible solution is using VANETs for mobile data offloading when
   connectivity to infrastructure is guaranteed, which requires an
   efficient routing protocol with global connectivity awareness. In this
   paper, we propose a novel infrastructure-based, dynamic, and
   connectivity-aware routing protocol, iCARII, to enable infotainment
   applications and Internet access in an urban environment. iCARII aims to
   improve VANETs routing performance by enabling selecting roads with
   guaranteed connectivity and reduced delivery delay. Detailed analysis
   and simulation-based evaluations of iCARII demonstrate the significant
   improvement of VANET performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and
   end-to-end delay with a negligible cost of routing overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation is considered as a key revolution in Long Term
   Evolution-Advanced systems to meet the explosively increasing aspiration
   for high data rates. Unlike extensive simulative evaluations on CA in
   literature, current theoretical analysis on CA is not convincing due to
   lack of effective interference modeling. In this paper, we exploit the
   theory of stochastic geometry to provide tractable statistical
   interference modeling for downlink CA in LTE-A systems. Our objective is
   to demonstrate the benefits of CA by comparing the user performance
   between the legacy LTE users and LTE-A users. Specffically, we first
   model the distributions of base stations and users into Poisson Point
   Processes. Then, the user service probability and subchaimel usage in
   each carrier are calculated for LTE and LTE-A users, respectively. The
   obtained probabilities are applied to derive the user SINR distribution
   and ergodic rates. To better clarify the impact of system/user
   parameters on the investigated performance, a special case is presented
   where the network is interference-limited and the channel fast fading is
   considered as Rayleigh fading. Finally, simulation results validate our
   analytical model and demonstrate that LTE-A users can achieve
   significantly better SINR and ergodic-rate performance than LTE users
   when the cell is not heavily loaded.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-atlas label fusion is a widely used approach in medical image
   analysis that has improved the accuracy of segmentation. Majority
   voting, as the most common combination strategy, weighs each candidate
   in the atlas database equally. More sophisticated methods rely on the
   intensity similarity of each atlas to the target volume. However, these
   methods cannot handle those cases in which the atlases and the target
   image are in different modalities.
   A new method for label fusion is proposed, based on a structural
   similarity measure, relying on the structural relationships of features
   extracted from an un-decimated wavelet transform instead of explicit
   image intensities. The new label fusion method has been tested on
   simulated and real MR images; segmentation results are promising, and
   open the door to a wider range of multi-modal approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Tiled displays provide an effective means of displaying very large
   images but these displays suffer from unique grid/type distortions.
   These are caused by the gaps between each sub-display's active area and
   have been largely ignored in the image quality assessment (IQA)
   literature. Recent work has suggested that current IQA metrics perform
   poorly when evaluating the effects of grid distortions and demonstrated
   the need for a new metric. This paper introduces this new IQA metric and
   tests it against a significantly expanded IQA database for
   grid-distorted images. We describe this new metric in detail and show
   how it provides a clear improvement over existing IQA quality metrics in
   evaluation of tiled image quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple, novel, yet highly effective approach for
   robust face recognition. Given LBP-like descriptors based on local
   accumulated pixel differences, Angular Differences (AD) and Radial
   Differences (RD), the local differences are decomposed into
   complementary components of signs and magnitudes. The proposed
   descriptors have desirable features: (1) robustness to lighting, pose,
   and expression; (2) computation efficiency; (3) encoding of both
   microstructures and macrostructures; (4) consistent in form with
   traditional LBP, thus inheriting the merits of LBP; and (5) no required
   training, improving generalizability.
   From a given face image, we obtain six histogram features, each of which
   is obtained by concatenating spatial histograms extracted from
   nonoverlapping subregions. The Whitened PCA technique is used for
   dimensionality reduction, followed by Nearest Neighbor classification.
   We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method on the
   Extended Yale B and CAS-PEAL-R1 databases. The proposed method
   impressively outperforms other well known systems, including what we
   believe to be the best reported performance for the the CAS-PEAL-R1
   lighting probe set with a recognition rate of 72.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{A limitation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image segmentation is
   the poor signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging process, particularly
   because images are sampled quickly, at high resolutions, and in-vivo.
   Furthermore, speckle noise is generated by the reflections of the OCT
   LASER. Because OCT is widely used in imaging the cornea, retina, and
   skin, OCT layer segmentation is of key interest in all applications.
   In this paper, a multi-resolution parametric active contour is used for
   OCT segmentation. The proposed method uses an undecimated wavelet
   transform to obtain scale-dependent noise reduction, while the active
   contour is initialized with a generalized Hough transform. Experimental
   results show that the proposed method outperforms classical as well as
   state-of-the-art methods and segments OCT images with high level of
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with H.264/AVC, the newest video standard called High
   Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) further improves video coding
   performance, but at the price of significant increase in its encoding
   complexity, especially in intra mode decision due to the adoption of
   complex block partition scheme and more intra prediction modes. To
   reduce the intra mode decision complexity in HEVC while maintaining its
   coding efficiency, in this paper, we first formulate the mode decision
   as a Bayesian decision problem based on the newly proposed Transparent
   Composite Model (TCM) and then present an outlier based fast intra mode
   decision method. Experiments show that for the All-Intra Main test
   configuration of HEVC, our method reduces, on average, the encoding time
   by 48\% with an insignificant loss in coding efficiency (0.7\% BD-Rate
   increase).}},

Abstract = {{Conditional random fields (CRFs) are one of the most powerful frameworks
   in image modeling. However practical CRFs typically have edges only
   between nearby nodes; using more interactions and expressive relations
   among nodes make these methods impractical for large-scale applications,
   due to the high computational complexity.
   Recent work has shown that fully connected CRFs can be tractable by
   defining specific potential functions. In this paper, we present a novel
   framework to tackle the computational complexity of a fully connected
   graph without requiring specific potential functions. Instead, inspired
   by random graph theory and sampling methods, we propose a new clique
   structure called stochastic cliques. The stochastically fully connected
   CRF (SFCRF) is a marriage between random graphs and random fields,
   benefiting from the advantages of fully connected graphs while
   maintaining computational tractability.
   The effectiveness of SFCRF was examined by binary image labeling of
   highly noisy images. The results show that the proposed framework
   outperforms an adjacency CRF and a CRF with a large neighborhood size.}},

Abstract = {{Active steering control is an efficient approach used to improve the
   vehicle's dynamics. This paper introduces a novel technique called
   Pulsed Active Rear Steering (PARS) for vehicle yaw control. With the
   concept of pulsed active steering, the optimum frequency and amplitude
   of a pulse and the effect of individual actuation of each rear wheel on
   the vehicle yaw dynamics and control is investigated. Using the
   co-simulation of Adams/Car and Matlab/Simulink, results show that the

Abstract = {{Humanoid robots have many potential applications in man-made
   environments, including performing hazardous tasks, assisting the
   elderly, and as a replacement for our aging workforce. However,
   generating a reliable gait for biped robots is challenging, particularly
   for dynamic gait and in the presence of unknown external disturbances,
   such as a bump from someone walking by. In this work, a 3D formulation
   of the Foot Placement Estimator is used with a high-level control
   strategy to achieve a dynamic gait capable of handling external
   disturbances. A key benefit of this approach is that the robot is able
   to respond in real time to external disturbances regardless of whether
   it is at rest or in motion. This strategy is implemented in simulation
   to control a 14-DOF lower-body humanoid robot being subjected to unknown
   external forces, both when at rest and while walking, and shown to
   generate stabilizing stepping actions.}},

Abstract = {{Current state of the art scan registration algorithms which use only
   position information often fall victim to correspondence ambiguity and
   degeneracy in the optimization solutions. Other methods which use
   additional channels, such as color or intensity, often use only a small
   fraction of the available information and ignore the underlying
   structural information of the added channels. The proposed method
   incorporates the additional channels directly into the scan registration
   formulation to provide information within the plane of the surface. This
   is achieved by calculating the uncertainty both along and perpendicular
   to the local surface at each point and calculating nearest neighbour
   correspondences in the higher dimensional space. The proposed method
   reduces instances of degenerate transformation estimates and improves
   both registration accuracy and convergence rate. The method is tested on
   the Ford Vision and Lidar dataset using both color and intensity
   channels as well as on Microsoft Kinect data obtained from the
   University of Waterloo campus.}},

   planning problems for mobile robots can be specified and solved. Given
   an environment represented as a graph and a Boolean variable for each

   the problem of finding the shortest path (or tour) in the graph subject
   to a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) formula defined over the vertex
   variables. We call this problem SAT-TSP. We show the expressiveness of
   this language for specifying complex motion planning objectives in a
   discrete environment. We then present three solution techniques for this
   problem, including a novel reduction to the well known travelling
   salesman problem (TSP). We present extensive simulation results which
   compare the performance of the three solvers on standard benchmarks from
   TSP, SAT, and Generalized TSP (GTSP) literature.}},

Abstract = {{We focus on a region whose power system is controlled by an operator
   that relies on a regulation service to balance the total system supply
   to the total system load in quasi real-time. We consider the existing
   contractual framework in which a regulation unit declares its regulation
   parameters at the beginning of the contract, the operator guarantees
   that the regulation signals will be within the range of these
   parameters, and the regulation unit is rewarded proportionally to what
   it declares. Our purpose is twofold. We first want to obtain formulas
   for the regulation parameters that a unit with non-ideal storage should
   declare to the operator given its state of charge at the beginning of a
   contract. Second, we want to analytically quantify, ahead of time, the
   reward that such a unit could obtain in successive contracts by
   performing this regulation service. Since the state of charge at the
   beginning of a contract depends on what happened in the previous
   contract and, hence, is a random variable, we quantify this reward
   analytically using bounds and expectation. We then provide engineering
   insights by applying our results to three specific energy storage
   technologies that are often considered as candidates for regulation. In
   particular, we show the impact of the storage parameters and the length
   of one contract on the potential reward over a given period.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) will have a significant
   impact on the demand response (DR) in smart grids (SGs). How to
   encourage EV users to voluntarily join vehicle-to-grid (V2G) market has
   been one of the significant challenges to SGs engineers and scientists.
   On the other hand, dealing with the randomness of renewable distributed
   energy resources (DERs) output is critical for microgrids to maintain
   their efficiency and reliability. In this work, a distributed charging
   and discharging scheduling scheme (DCD) for EVs in microgrids is
   proposed to provide electric vehicle (EV) users with energy cost
   reduction while promoting the integration of renewable energy sources
   (RESs) by reducing the negative impact of highly intermittent
   characteristics of RESs. The comparison results based on the real
   measured renewable energy and load data show that the proposed scheme
   enables EVs to become promisingly important contributors to microgrids.}},

Abstract = {{A modular deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is introduced to
   facilitate the process of deploying various architectures of RNNs, and
   to automatically compute derivatives for gradient-based learning
   methods. The modularity leads to a set of new architectures, one of
   which includes feedforward inter-layer connections. By adding
   feedforward inter-layer connections in a multi-layer RNN, it is observed
   that the capability of the RNN to learn and model high-order dynamics
   and nonlinearities is significantly improved. The problem of
   vanishing/exploding gradient in space for a multilayer RNN is also
   alleviated using feedforward connections. These results are demonstrated
   using a quadrotor case study, for which a model of the altitude dynamics
   is learned with our particular network structure, while existing methods
   are unable to generalize as quickly or at all.}},

Abstract = {{The risk of a project portfolio is assessed using a new methodology that
   identifies the risk transfer in projects by using a Bayesian network
   structure learning algorithm to construct an interdependent network of
   risks. In particular, to overcome the drawback of a greedy search
   algorithm having a random starting structure, the mutual information
   between project risks is measured before executing the algorithm by
   computing the impact of technical interactions on project risks. It is
   demonstrated that the preprocessing can exclude the error and
   indistinctive connections, so as to reduce the search space effectively.
   Finally, the project portfolio risk of a practical case is assessed
   using this method, and the results show that the interdependent network
   of risks is an effective tool to reveal the risk transfer in projects
   and infer the value of project portfolio risk.}},

Abstract = {{Supply chain conflicts between Airbus and Boeing, along with potential
   suppliers are investigated using a hierarchical approach to obtain the
   strategic resolutions for all stakeholders. Two giant commercial
   aircraft makers, Airbus and Boeing, complete for better deals by
   selecting components for their newly designed aircraft, incurring
   conflicts due to their rivalry and the clash of interests with
   suppliers. To control the costs of their next generation aircraft and
   shorten the production period, both manufacturers demand better deals
   from potential suppliers with lower prices and more output. A conflict
   arises among the manufacturers and potential suppliers in the
   negotiation of the contract in each supply chain. To investigate these
   conflicts comprehensively, a hierarchical approach is adopted by
   constructing a Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) with a
   hierarchical structure. The stakeholders may obtain strategic
   resolutions according to possible outcomes indicated by stability
   results. These findings in the hierarchical graph model are further
   compared to those obtained when each conflict is investigated
   separately.}},

Abstract = {{The standard graph model for conflict resolution is enhanced to model
   misperception of options and preferences. In particular, misperception
   caused by unknown options by one or more decision makers (DMs) is
   formally defined in the modified graph model framework. Moreover, DMs'
   preferences are expressed in a relative fashion by pairwise comparisons
   among any pair of states. That is, the modified graph model can handle
   both transitive and intransitive preference structures. Furthermore,
   three sets of equilibria are defined within the modified graph model,
   namely, steady, unsteady, and stealthy equilibria. The aim of
   identifying equilibria sets is to ascertain the first level hypergame
   equilibria for the modified graph model. The 2011 conflict between North
   and South Sudan over South Sudanese oil exports is studied using the
   modified graph model to illustrate the applicability of the model and to
   gain better insight into and understanding of the dispute.}},

Abstract = {{a folded dipole is known as a classical wideband antenna and usually
   analyzed by decomposing into two coupling modes: dipole mode and
   twin-lead stub mode, which can be seen as an effective 2-pole filter. A
   wideband microwave absorber surface can be formed by an array of
   receiving folded dipoles backed by a ground at lambda/4, since the
   combination of the twin modes of folded dipole and the third coupling
   mode of lambda/4 ground can achieve a 3-pole filter. To further broaden
   the bandwidth of the folded dipole-based absorber, some improvements
   from two aspects are made on the structures, saying from the element
   itself and the arrangement of the elements, and then three kinds of
   folded dipole-based absorbers are proposed in this work. The numerical
   results show that, all the three kinds of folded dipolebased absorbers
   above can have a wide relative bandwidth over 100\%; especially the one
   with top-triangle loaded folded dipole absorber surface can even obtain
   a relative bandwidth of 120\%. Besides, by arranging the
   broadside-folded dipole elements with regular triangle-lattice cells,
   the bandwidth can be further enhanced and the sensitivity to the oblique
   incident waves is also decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Switched shunt capacitor banks are commonly used in distribution
   networks to reduce the system losses and support the voltage. In this
   paper, distributed processing units equipped with wireless communication
   transceivers are installed on different buses (nodes) of distribution
   system, and are used to control and coordinate multiple capacitor banks
   in order to maximize the distribution system loss reduction.
   Real-time information from the smart meters, e.g. measured active and
   reactive load powers, are utilized by the distributed processing units
   to perform real-time distributed load flow analysis. The resulting
   voltage profile and current flow in each branch are used to iteratively
   compute the switched capacitor banks states that maximize the system
   loss reduction.
   The Network Simulator NS-3 is used to co-simulate the proposed capacitor
   banks control scheme along with the wireless communication network. The
   distributed load flow analysis and the the proposed control scheme are
   implemented as C++ applications within the network simulator NS-3, and a
   WiMAX wireless communication network is used in the co-simulation.
   The percentile rank of the computed capacitor banks state, which is
   obtained from NS-3 co-simulation, is used to compare the performance of
   the proposed control and coordination algorithm to the optimal state
   which obtained from GNU-Octave exhaustive search.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop two filters, extended Kalman filter (EKF) and
   particle filter (PF), for autonomous docking of mobile robots and
   compare the performances of the two filers in terms of accuracy. Robots
   are equipped with IR emitters/receivers and encoders, and their data is
   used to estimate the distance and orientation of robots, which is needed
   for docking. The two state estimation methods are compared in
   simulations under different conditions. Simulation results demonstrate
   that the estimation accuracy of the EKF is higher than PF when the
   initial state is correctly estimated. However, when the initial state is
   not estimated correctly, the state estimation of EKF does not converge
   to the true value. On the other hand, PF state estimation successfully
   converges to the true value and the error is more consistent. The result
   of this work can help researchers and practitioners to design and use
   proper filters for docking applications.}},

   a general detection technique over fading channels to yield significant
   savings in complexity while achieving close to Maximum Likelihood (ML)
   performance. We specifically apply the decoder for two practical
   schemes, uncoded multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems and the Golden
   code. By employing the orthogonality defect factor as a universal
   measure to select a near-orthogonal channel submatrix for conditional
   decoding, we implement an almost optimal decoder with linear complexity
   over quasi-static channels for the Golden code and the four-by-four

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the broadcast of n-layered source codes over a
   single-relay network using a half-duplex non-orthogonal amplify-forward
   (HD-NAF) relaying protocol. Taking the distortion exponent, (i.e., the
   SNR exponent of the average end-to-end distortion) as the performance
   metric, we consider system operation in the high SNR regime. We first
   prove that the HD-NAF relay network with an n-layer code is subject to
   the successively refinable Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) curve,
   which is exercised to derive a closed-form expression for an achievable
   upper bound of the system distortion exponent. Rate allocation
   optimization is conducted to analyze and gain insight into system
   behavior. Numerical evaluations are performed based on derived
   analytical formulations, and the performance advantage of single-relay
   HD-NAF networks is justified in terms of the distortion exponent versus
   its conventional counterparts. Furthermore, it is observed that
   increases in the number of encoded layers increases system performance.}},

   analyzing them as a single macro cell embedded with small cells. In this
   paper, we take a global perspective and analyze the effect of deploying
   small cells on the performance of a network comprising several macro
   cells. We identify potential locations for low-power base-stations based
   on the coverage patterns of the macro cells and propose three schemes
   for placing the small cells. Using the model recommended by 3GPP, we
   show that by judiciously installing just two small cells for every macro
   base-station at these locations and allocating separate resources to all
   the small cells on a global level, we can increase the performance of
   the network significantly (similar to 45\%). An added benefit of our
   schemes is that we can switch off the macro base-stations at night (when
   the number of active users is low) and significantly reduce their
   operation cost.}},

   user scheduling in the context of a heterogeneous network comprising a
   macro base station overlaid with small-cells. Under a global
   proportional fairness (PF) criteria, we show that this limited capacity
   has a fundamental impact on user scheduling. When user association and
   channel allocation are given, like in the infinite-capacity backhaul
   case, the global PF user scheduling problem can be decomposed into a set
   of independent local PF user scheduling problems. However, unlike the
   case with infinite backhaul where the local PF scheme is equivalent to
   giving equal time to each user, a local PF scheme with finite backhaul
   can be of one of three types. We completely characterize these three
   types and the conditions under which to use them. The results show that
   a backhaul-aware scheduling scheme is simple to implement and necessary
   to obtain the best performance.}},

   check the accuracy of the AA-based method, the resulted intervals are
   compared against those obtained from Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS), in a
   13-bus microgrid test system. The obtained real power generation

Abstract = {{Android smartphones are becoming increasingly popular. The open nature
   of Android allows users to install miscellaneous applications, including
   the malicious ones, from third-party marketplaces without rigorous
   sanity checks. A large portion of existing malwares perform stealthy
   operations such as sending short messages, making phone calls and HTTP
   connections, and installing additional malicious components. In this
   paper, we propose a novel technique to detect such stealthy behavior. We
   model stealthy behavior as the program behavior that mismatches with
   user interface, which denotes the user's expectation of program
   behavior. We use static program analysis to attribute a top level
   function that is usually a user interaction function with the behavior
   it performs. Then we analyze the text extracted from the user interface
   component associated with the top level function. Semantic mismatch of
   the two indicates stealthy behavior. To evaluate AsDroid, we download a
   pool of 182 apps that are potentially problematic by looking at their
   permissions. Among the 182 apps, AsDroid reports stealthy behaviors in
   113 apps, with 28 false positives and 11 false negatives.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the design of an undergraduate compilers course that is
   explicitly intended to teach software engineering concepts and skills in
   addition to compiler concepts. This objective is accomplished by
   structuring the course around two parallel learning progressions rather
   than around the logical structure of a compiler.
   The nominal purpose of the project is to develop a simulator and
   synthesizer for simple circuits written in a subset of VHDL. This subset
   of VHDL is translated to a simple LL(1) boolean formula language. The
   circuit simulator reads and writes binary waveforms according to a
   regular grammar. The students start working with the simple waveform
   language and work their way up to the subset of VHDL. As the complexity
   of the input language and transformations increases, new software
   engineering concepts are introduced to help manage that complexity.
   At the end of the project the students can simulate and synthesize
   simple circuits such as a ripple-carry adder or a multiplexer.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the CO emission from an oil refinery gas
   incinerator both theoretically and experimentally. At the beginning of
   this research, our collected data from this incinerator showed that the
   CO contamination would be far exceeding the permissible environmental
   standards at the stack exhaust. Therefore, we decided to perform a
   combined theoretical-experimental study to find a reasonable solution to
   reduce the CO pollution suitably. Our theoretical study showed that a
   reliable solution would be to increase the incinerator operating
   temperature. However, we needed to collect some data from this
   incinerator to examine if our achieved analytical solution would work
   correctly. In data collection procedure, we were faced with one major
   difficulty due to the limits of automatic system of incinerator control,
   which did not let us increase the incinerator temperature readily in
   real work conditions. As a general remedy, our suggestion was to
   interfere in this automatic control system and to increase its maximum
   possible limit of temperature. Evidently, this needed a number of
   considerations, which could not be performed in a short length period.
   As a short length remedy, we designed a number of manual control
   procedures, which let us examine different temporary working conditions
   for the incinerator. Trying different operating condition, we eventually
   found a suitable one with minimum CO emission from the incinerator.
   Although this choice resulted in an increase in the incinerator
   temperature and a remedy to reduce the high CO emission, it was
   inversely increased the incinerator fuel consumption, which is rather a
   negative point. Our further data collection indicated that the excess
   air of primary incinerator was relatively high. Therefore, we designed
   an automatic system of inlet air damper to adjust the inlet air, which
   resulted in avoiding high excess air and consequently suitable saving in
   the fuel consumption. The details are provided in the rest of paper.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion emission is one of the most important issues in the design of
   industries. Todays' strict environmental standards have limited the
   productions of CO, NOx, SOx, and other hazardous pollutants from the
   related industries. In this work, we study a typical oil refinery
   incinerator, which is used to burn waste gases residue produced during
   bitumen production process. The waste gas mainly includes a mixture
   including N-2, H2O-vapor, and O-2 species. Additionally, there are
   significant amounts of CO species and CxHy droplets in the waste gas
   composition. The measurements show that the CO emission becomes so
   crucial in high flow rate of feeding waste gas to the incinerator. Here,
   we numerically simulate the combustion process in this incinerator by
   solving the full turbulent reacting flow equations. In this regard, we
   use the finite-volume method to solve the RANS equations. For turbulence
   modeling purposes, we use the two-equation k-epsilon model along with
   standard wall functions. The non-premixed combustion is simulated by
   `solving the mixture fraction equations for both fuel and waste gas
   streams. The interaction between turbulence and combustion is properly
   considered in the current modeling. We use the P-1 method to solve the
   radiation transfer equation in emitting and absorbing medium of
   combustion gasses. The WSGG model is used to consider the absorption
   coefficient variation. The set of governing equations are solved using a
   SIMPLE-based algorithm. The current solutions provide good knowledge
   about the mixing pattern of flue gas and air-fuel streams in the
   incinerator. The improper mixing in the incinerator suggests we present
   a new design to re-design the waste gas inlet to the incinerator. Our
   simulation shows that the new design would result in substantial
   improvement in mixing process of these two streams. We find that this
   new design would effectively reduce the CO ppm at the exit of
   incinerator's stack.}},

Abstract = {{Natural gas is an important source of energy. It is efficient, versatile
   and abundantly available. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) dehydrator is the
   most common non-regenerative adsorption system in natural gas industry.
   As the need for natural gas increases, calcium chloride dehydration can
   help to make some gas wells more profitable to operate gas from remote
   or offshore wellheads, gas of a low flow rate, or gas which is high in
   sulphur content may benefit from this dehydration.
   In this article two mathematical-based models are developed to estimate
   approximate water content of natural gas dried by calcium chloride
   dehydrator units for both freshly recharged and just prior to recharging
   conditions as a function of temperature and pressure. Firstly, a simple
   empirical correlation is presented to estimate water content of natural
   gas dried by solid calcium chloride dehydrator, Secondly, a multilayer
   perceptron (MLP) neural network is developed for the same calculations.
   The results of both presented models are found to be in excellent
   agreement with reported data in the literature. The tools developed in
   this study can be of immense practical value for engineers to have a
   quick check on water content of natural gas dried by calcium chloride
   dehydrator units as a function of dehydrator temperature and pressure at
   various conditions without opting for any experimental trials. In
   particular, engineers would find the approaches to be user-friendly with
   transparent calculations involving no complex expressions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, first a novel capacitor-switched active snubber for
   single-module bidirectional buck-boost converter is developed. The
   snubber concept is then extended to two-module interleaved bidirectional
   buck-boost converter. It is shown that the proposed snubber designs
   allow the main switches to operate at switching frequencies considerably
   higher than the limit for hard-switching operation, leading to
   smaller-size inductors and thus lower overall weight, without
   compromising efficiency. It is also shown that at a fixed switching
   frequency, the efficiency can be considerably improved by using the
   proposed snubber design. Analytical expectations have been verified by
   experimental results.}},

Title = {{A Localized Adaptive Strategy to Calculate the Backoff Interval in
   Contention-Based Vehicular Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-226}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic nature of vehicular networks with their fast changing
   topology poses several challenges to setup communication between
   vehicles. Packet collisions are considered to be the main source of data
   loss in contention-based vehicular networks. Retransmission of collided
   packets is done several times until an acknowledgment of successful
   reception is received or the maximum number of retries is reached. The
   retransmission delay is drawn randomly from an interval, called the
   backoff interval. A good choice of the backoff interval reduces the
   number of collisions and the waiting periods of data packets, which
   increases the throughput and decreases the energy consumption. An
   optimal backoff interval could be obtained if global network information
   spread in the network in a short time. However, this is practically not
   achievable which motivates the efficient utilization of local
   information to approach the optimal performance. In this paper, we
   propose a localized adaptive strategy that calculates the backoff
   interval for unicast applications in vehicular networks. The new
   strategy uses fuzzy logic to adapt the backoff interval to the fast
   changing vehicular environment using only local information. We present
   four schemes of that strategy that differ in their behavior and the
   number of inputs. We compare the proposed schemes with other known
   schemes, binary exponential backoff, backoff algorithm, and an optimal
   scheme, in terms of throughput, fairness, and energy consumption.
   Results show that by proper tuning of the fuzzy parameters and rules,
   one of the proposed schemes outperform the other schemes, and approach
   the optimal results.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid advancement of mobile devices, people have become more
   attached to them than ever. This rapid growth combined with millions of
   applications (apps) make smartphones a favorite means of communication
   among users. In general, the available contents on smartphones, apps,
   and web, come in two versions: 1) free content that is monetized via
   advertisements (ads) and 2) paid content that is monetized by user
   subscription fees. However, the resources, namely, energy, bandwidth,
   and processing power, on-board are limited, and the existence of ads in
   websites and free apps can significantly increase the usage of these
   resources. These issues necessitate a good understanding of the mobile
   advertising eco-system and how such limited resources can be efficiently
   used. In this paper, we present the results of a novel web browsing
   technique that adapts the webpages delivered to smartphone, based on the
   smartphone's current battery level and the network type. Webpages are
   adapted by controlling the amount of ads to be displayed. Validation
   tests confirm that the system can extend smartphone battery life by up
   to similar to 30\% and save wireless bandwidth up to similar to 44\%.}},

Abstract = {{The distributed nature of the CSMA/CA-based wireless protocols, for
   example, the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordinated function (DCF), allows
   malicious nodes to deliberately manipulate their backoff parameters and,
   thus, unfairly gain a large share of the network throughput. In this
   paper, we first design a real-time backoff misbehavior detector, termed
   as the fair share detector (FS detector), which exploits the
   nonparametric cumulative sum (CUSUM) test to quickly find a selfish
   malicious node without any a priori knowledge of the statistics of the
   selfish misbehavior. While most of the existing schemes for selfish
   misbehavior detection depend on heuristic parameter configuration and
   experimental performance evaluation, we develop a Markov chain-based
   analytical model to systematically study the performance of the FS
   detector in real-time backoff misbehavior detection. Based on the
   analytical model, we can quantitatively compute the system configuration
   parameters for guaranteed performance in terms of average false positive
   rate, average detection delay, and missed detection ratio under a
   detection delay constraint. We present thorough simulation results to
   confirm the accuracy of our theoretical analysis as well as demonstrate
   the performance of the developed FS detector.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a first principle model based methodology for
   simultaneous optimal tuning of a fault detection algorithm and a
   feedback controller. The key idea is to calculate the effect of
   stochastic input disturbances on the variability of the output variables
   by using a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion and a mechanic
   model of the process. A two-level optimization is proposed for
   simultaneously tuning the fault detection and controller algorithms. The
   goal of the outer level optimization is to find a trade-off between the
   efficiency for detecting faults and the closed loop performance, while
   the inner optimization is designed to optimally calibrate the fault
   detection algorithm. The proposed method is illustrated for a continuous
   stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The results show that the computational
   cost of the gPC-based method is significantly lower than a Monte Carlo
   (MC) simulationbased approach, thus demonstrating the potential of the
   gPC method for dealing with large problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel organic/inorganic hybrid material containing
   cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles was synthesized in situ by using an
   all pi-conjugated block copolymer as both a synergistic long-range
   ordered structure-directing template and an efficient exciton quencher
   for the nanohybrid. The conducting-conducting block copolymer of
   poly(2,5-dihexyloxy-para-phenylene)-b-poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (PPP-P3HT)
   was used as a linear nanoreactor for the quantum dot synthesis to yield
   nanohybrids with highly ordered donor/acceptor (D/A) nanowire morphology
   that exhibit enhanced optoelectronic properties. The synthesized
   PPP-P3HT/CdS-OH nanohybrid possessed a one-dimensional D/A coaxial
   nanowire structure of uniform width (similar to 10 nm), wherein the
   synthesized CdS quantum dots were embedded, resulting in a display of
   superior long-term stability in a solution medium. By a simple drop
   casting process, the hybrid materials with highly ordered
   organic/inorganic nanochannel arrays could also be preserved in a thin
   film state, as evidenced by TEM and X-ray measurements, for device
   applications. The PPP-P3HT block copolymer exhibited significantly
   better hole mobility than its P3HT homopolymer counterpart. In addition,
   the resulting PPP-P3HT/CdS-OH hybrid systems displayed a considerably
   enhanced PL quench effect and shorter exciton lifetime due to efficient
   charge transfer between the P3HT block and the confining CdS
   nanoparticles in the P3HT/CdS coaxial domain of the hybrid nanowire
   structure. Therefore, the PPP-P3HT/CdS-OH nanohybrids can be used as
   bicontinuous nanochannels for efficient charge separation and charge
   transport, which show potential for use in future optoelectronic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{At the forefront of medicine, gene therapy provides an effective way to
   treat a range of diseases by regulating defective genes at the root of
   the disease. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) hold great promise as
   therapeutic agents in this domain; however, intracellular delivery
   remains a major obstacle to clinical applications of therapeutic siRNAs.
   Here we report a peptide designed to mediate siRNA delivery. This
   peptide, C6M1, is rationally designed to promote the endosomal escape
   ability of an existing peptide sequence. Formed C6M1-siRNA nanoscale
   complexes are able to deliver siRNA into cells and induce specific gene
   knockdown with low toxicity. The increased membrane disruption ability
   under acidic conditions of the peptide with tryptophan residue
   substitution may contribute to the enhanced gene silence efficacy.
   Intratumoral injection of the complexes results in a marked reduction of
   tumor growth through downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in
   mice. In addition, the C6M1-siRNA complex was proven safe at
   transfection concentration by cytotoxicity assay. These results
   demonstrate that the C6M1-siRNA complex is a potent system for efficient
   gene delivery in vitro and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal powerplants report a reduction in their dry cooling tower
   performances due to surrounding wind drafts. Therefore, it is very
   important to consider the influence of wind velocity in cooling tower
   design; especially in geographical points with high wind conditions. In
   this regard, we use the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool and
   simulate a dry cooling tower in different wind velocities of 0, 5 and 10
   m/s. To extend our calculations; we also consider the temperature
   variation of circulating water through the tower heat exchanger or
   deltas one-by-one. We show that some heat exchangers around the tower
   cannot reduce the circulating water temperature sufficiently. This
   causes an increase in the mean temperature of those heat exchangers. The
   worst performances can be attributed to heat exchanger located on side
   wind places. We will discuss the detail performance of each delta and
   their assembly in draft wind conditions. This study suggests some
   effective ways to overcome thermal performance of cooling tower in wind
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the modeling and analysis of a novel audio
   subwoofer system for automotive applications using the automobile
   windshield glass. The use of a piezo-electric actuator coupled with a
   mechanical amplifier linked to a large glass panel provides a highly
   efficient method of producing sound. The proposed subwoofer system has
   the advantage over existing conventional systems of not only reducing
   the weight of the automobile, but also a significant power savings
   resulting in an increase of expected fuel economy. Among various design
   challenges, the glass-sealing design is of huge importance, as it
   affects the system dynamic response and so the output sound
   characteristics. The main goal in this manuscript is to evaluate
   different glass-sealing design configurations by providing a
   comprehensive Finite Element model of the system. To do so, a
   comprehensive, yet simplified FE model is developed, and experimental
   studies are performed in the component level to fine-tune and verify the
   model. Harmonic response of the system for each sealing configuration
   design is obtained in the frequency range of 0-200 Hz, and the results
   are compared and discussed. The finite element model is also beneficial
   in preliminary design of other components as well as the exciter
   placement, and predicting the performance of the overall system.}},

Abstract = {{We present a specialized multibody joint that constrains motion to a
   spatial path. The joint is used in the reduction of 1 degree-of-freedom
   systems with complex kinematics. Example applications of the joint are:
   the reduction of vehicle suspension systems, or the representation of
   biological joints. The new joint is implemented in the graph-theoretic
   symbolic multibody modeling environment of MapleSim and is formulated in
   such a way that a single ordinary differential equation is used to
   describe the resulting kinematic pair. A particle moving along a planar
   semi-circular path was chosen as the first example for successful
   validation of the new joint since a simple closed form solution in terms
   of the path length exists. To represent arbitrary curves, the path must
   first be parameterized in terms of its path length. Next, a
   differentiable mathematical definition of the curve must be generated.
   B-splines are, generated to define the path. For best performance we
   minimize the number of knots in the splines and find their optimal
   locations. Using the spline fitting approach,.a planar parabolic path is
   generated and used to fitrther analyze the performance of our
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an analog actuation circuit for a novel
   frequency-modulated MEMS gyroscope. The circuit provides an
   amplitude-modulated (AM) signal as the input into a RLC resonant drive
   circuit, which drives the gyroscope. The actuation system is composed an
   automatic gain control (AGC) loop, a low pass filter, an amplitude
   modulation component and a resonant drive circuit. The AM signal is
   composed of a modulating signal that excite a natural frequency of
   gyroscope drive mode and a carrier signal with a frequency corresponding
   to the electrical resonant frequency of the RLC circuit. Both
   feedforward and feedback AGC configurations are used to stabilize the
   envelope of the signal. However, the breadboard implementations of the
   feedforward and feedback circuits in their current configurations have
   similar signal to noise ratio to that of the function generator. To
   improve the actuation circuit performance, we plan to include the
   resonant drive circuit within the AGC feedback loop and implement the
   actuation circuit on PCB.}},

Abstract = {{As muscles fatigue, their passive and active mechanical properties
   change increasing the susceptibility of the human body to damage. The
   state-of-the-art technique for muscle fatigue detection, EMG signals, is
   cumbersome. This paper presents a technique to detect fatigue by
   tracking a kinematic parameter of the musculoskeletal system. The method
   uses the time-history of a single joint angle to detect fatigue in the
   lower limbs. A sensor is mounted to the knee joint to measure the knee
   flexion angle. Time delay embedding is used to track the orbit of knee
   joint motions in a reconstructed phase-space. The reconstructed
   phase-space allows us to obtain information about other body parts and
   joints of the lower limb in addition to the knee joint, since they are
   all connected in an open kinematic chain. Long-time drift in the orbit
   location and shape in phase-space is quantified and used as a measure of
   lower limb fatigue. The proposed technique presents a mobile, wireless,
   and cheap method to assess fatigue that can act as an early warning
   system for the lower limb.}},

   based on heuristics. The performance of the proposed control schemes was
   evaluated under different scenarios, e. g. changes in flue gas flow
   rates, set point tracking, and valve stiction. In this study, a control
   scheme obtained from the heuristic approach resulted in shorter
   closed-loop settling times than the RGA-based control scheme. (C) 2013

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{164-174}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a fairly efficient approximation for the computation
   of variance-based sensitivity measures associated with a general,
   n-dimensional function of random variables. The proposed approach is
   based on a multiplicative version of the dimensional reduction method
   (M-DRM), in which a given complex function is approximated by a product
   of low dimensional functions. Together with the Gaussian quadrature, the
   use of M-DRM significantly reduces the computation effort associated
   with global sensitivity analysis. An important and practical benefit of
   the M-DRM is the algebraic simplicity and closed-form nature of
   sensitivity coefficient formulas. Several examples are presented to show
   that the M-DRM method is as accurate as results obtained from
   simulations and other approximations reported in the literature. (C)

Title = {{Modeling the impact of observation conditions on localization systems}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION FUSION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{19-31}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In various applications, sensor fusion has demonstrated success as means
   to enhance a system performance in perceiving its environment. By
   combing observations of different sensors, the system is able to achieve
   improved sensing accuracy, and potentially, expanded sensing
   capabilities. However, the observation conditions in the surrounding of
   any multi-sensor system have a considerable impact on the performance of
   the system. This impact can be hard to mitigate if the observation
   conditions are stochastic in nature. Therefore, for any sensor fusion
   strategy to achieve reliable and robust performance it must possess a
   capability to assess the quality of the observation conditions in its
   surrounding, and ultimately, the quality of its decisions, as a function
   of these conditions. One typical application where the impact of the
   observation conditions can cause sever deterioration of the sensing
   performance is vehicle localization. It is typical in this application
   that location measurements obtained from multiple sensors (e.g., GPS,
   Vision, Inertial, etc.) are combined together to compute accurate
   vehicle location. However, such improved accuracy can only be attained
   under nominal observation conditions. Therefore, real-time awareness of
   the observation conditions around the vehicle position is pivotal for
   the multi-sensor system to achieve effective fusion performance.
   In this paper, a Markovian model is proposed to capture the impact of
   observation conditions on a sensor's localization performance and to
   consequently determine a reliability index with respect to the
   localization accuracy claimed by the sensor.
   The proposed model is implemented on two localization techniques:
   single-sensor localization and multi-sensor localization. A number of
   experiments are conducted to determine the different levels of
   localization accuracy that can be achieved by each technique under a
   wide range of observation conditions. The proposed reliability model is
   tested in a variety of real-life and simulated observation conditions
   scenarios. It is evident from the experimental results that the proposed
   model is able to estimate the reliability of location estimates produced
   by either one of the localization techniques. The paper discusses how
   such reliability model can benefit multi-sensor systems. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Development of lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries is limited by their low
   Coulombic efficiency and low cycle life, which are mainly due to active
   mass loss and polysulfide dissolution into the electrolyte solution.
   Here we report a new approach to overcome these drawbacks by employing a
   novel composite polymer electrolyte that not only facilitates rapid
   transport of lithium ions for electrochemical reactions with sulfur,
   resulting in improved capacity of the battery, but also prevents the
   generated polysulfides from shuttling between the electrodes during
   cycling of the battery. Improved performance of the battery was
   achieved: An initial discharge capacity of 1648 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) and
   reversible capacity of 1143 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) were obtained after 100
   cycles at 0.2 C (1 C = 1672 mA h g(-1)), which could be among the
   highest reversible capacities reported for Li/S batteries so far. (C)

   0.6 V followed by 3 s at 1.0 V was developed to test fuel cell membrane
   electrode assemblies (MEAs). The use of this Pt dissolution protocol at
   three different temperatures (40 degrees C, 60 degrees C and 80 degrees
   C) was investigated for the same membrane electrode assembly
   composition. Impedance analysis of the membrane electrode assemblies
   showed an increase in polarization resistance during the course of the
   accelerated stress testing. Polarization analysis and electrochemical
   active surface area (ECSA) loss measurements revealed evidence of
   increased cathode catalyst layer (CCL) degradation due to. Pt
   dissolution and deposition in the membrane as the cell temperature was
   raised. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed the
   formation of Pt bands in the membrane. A diagnostic expression was
   developed to estimate kinetic losses due to oxygen reduction using the
   effective platinum surface area (EPSA) estimated from cyclic
   voltammograms. The results indicated that performance degradation
   occurred mainly due to Pt loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The impacts of side exposed side strips (for high order modes
   suppression) and ridge width on terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser
   (QCL) performance are investigated through numerical modeling and

   THz QCLs with metal-metal waveguides leads to a substantial degradation
   of device performance due to higher optical loss resulting from the
   side-exposed strips in the highly-doped top contact layer. Nevertheless,
   the side-exposed strips facilitate single mode operation by strongly
   suppressing higher-order modes. An optimal width of the side exposed
   strips is obtained for achieving adequate higher-order mode suppression
   and maintaining sufficiently low fundamental mode loss. (C) 2013 Optical

   The structural changes of powder particles during mechanical alloying

   microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results
   show that for all three compositions the gradual interdiffusion of

   final structures for the Ni50Al50 and Ni25Cr25Al50 compositions are
   nanocrystalline NiAl and (Ni, Cr)Al intermetallic compounds,

   formation of a Ni3Al intermetallic compound as well as Cr which
   transformed to the (Ni, Cr)(3)Al intermetallic compound after subsequent
   heat treatment. The structural transition upon annealing was

Abstract = {{Systems that are operated near their resonance frequencies experience
   vibrations that can lead to impaired performance, overstressing, fatigue
   fracture and adverse human reactions. Frequency response (FR) analysis
   can be invoked to mitigate the effects. When components of a system are
   described by random variables, modal frequencies and modal shapes, or,
   amplitudes and phases, are also random variables and the frequency
   response (FR) design of the system becomes more complex since it
   requires the solution of a frequency-variant probability problem. This
   paper presents a methodology to provide the frequency response design of
   uncertain systems using a transfer function approach. The methodology is
   found to be robust, expandable and flexible and can be applied to
   multi-disciplinary systems with n-dof and multiple design constraints.
   The novelty of the approach is the creation of a frequency-invariant
   probability problem through: (a) the discretization of the frequency
   band of interest into multiple contiguous point frequencies, (b) the
   introduction of new performance indices that measure the probability of
   success over the entire frequency band, and (c) the introduction of
   explicit metamodels to provide sufficiently fast probability evaluations
   through Monte Carlo simulation. The key to the performance indices are
   limit-state functions formed at all discrete, contiguous, frequencies.
   Each limit-state function establishes a conformance region in terms of
   the random design variables. The probabilities of the conformance
   regions are correctly combined to provide a single series-system index
   to be maximized by adjusting distribution parameters. The simple
   explicit meta-model is based on Kriging and performance measures at
   arbitrary design sets are efficiently calculated. Error analysis
   suggests ways to predict and control the errors with regards to
   meta-model fitting and probability calculations and so the method
   appears sufficiently accurate for engineering applications. The proposed
   methodology has applications in numerous areas such as electrical
   filters and structural mechanics - all with n-dof and multiple
   responses. The Performance indices can be evaluated at any frequency
   over any number of frequency ranges. A case study of a vibration
   absorber mechanism shows how the new methodology provides an improved
   and timely design with controllable accuracy when compared with previous
   proposals that employed modal frequencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Instabilities of Teflon AF thin films in alumina nanochannels and
   adhesion of bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel replica-molding technique for fabrication of
   bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars, as an electrostatic-based dry adhesive,
   is reported. The technique reported herein relies on the concurrent
   heating and cooling of the Teflon AF melt which filled vertically
   aligned alumina nanochannels as the mold. Unlike conventional polymer
   infiltration methods which consist of filling the mold by only heating
   the polymer above its glass transition temperature, in the current
   method, the polymer melt was also simultaneously cooled down during the
   infiltration process. Concurrent cooling of the Teflon AF melt allowed
   control over the interfacial instabilities of the polymer thin film,
   which formed ahead of the polymer melt upon its infiltration into the
   alumina nanochannels. By doing so, the geometrical properties of the
   peculiar fluffy nanostructure which was subsequently developed-after
   removal of the mold-on top of the extremely high aspect-ratio Teflon AF
   nanopillars (200 nm in diameter, similar to 25 mu m tall) were modified.
   The height of the base nanopillars was measured and the structural
   properties (i.e., surface area fraction and roughness) of the fluffy
   nanostructure terminating the base nanopillars at the tip were
   quantified. Next, the effects of the topographical properties of the
   bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars on their adhesion, in both the normal and
   shear directions, were investigated. Tribological results were discussed
   in detail to clarify the contribution of the structural properties of
   the fabricated dry adhesive toward its remarkable adhesion and friction
   forces generated via contact electrification. It is worthwhile to
   mention that bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars with these specific
   structural properties have generated enhanced adhesion and friction
   strengths, up to similar to 2.1 and 13 N cm(-2), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency splitting between the dip and the peak of the resistively
   detected nuclear magnetic resonance dispersive line shape has been
   measured in the quantum Hall effect regime as a function of filling
   factor, carrier density, and nuclear isotope. The splitting increases as
   the filling factor tends to nu = 1 and is proportional to the hyperfine
   coupling, similar to the usual Knight shift versus. dependence. The peak
   frequency shifts linearly with magnetic field throughout the studied
   filling factor range and matches the unshifted substrate signal,
   detected by classical NMR. Thus, the evolution of the splitting is
   entirely due to the changing Knight shift of the dip feature. The
   nuclear spin relaxation time T-1 is extremely long (similar to hours) at
   precisely the peak frequency. These results are consistent with the
   local formation of a nu = 2 phase due to the existence of spin singlet
   D- complexes.}},

   analyzed through XPS, which showed a high content of a total N species
   (similar to 8 at. \%), indicative of the effective N-doping, present
   mostly in the form of pyridinic nitrogen groups. The oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) performance of the catalyst was evaluated by rotating
   disk electrode voltammetry in alkaline electrolyte and in a zinc-air
   battery cell. Fe-NG demonstrated high onset and half-wave potentials of
   -0.023 V, (vs SCE) and -0.110 V (vs SCE), respectively. This excellent
   ORR activity is translated into practical zinc-air battery performance
   capabilities approaching that of commercial platinum-based catalyst.}},

Title = {{Analysis of permeate pressure build-up effects on separation performance

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{849-856}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{The study rectifies some perceptions about pressure build-up in hollow
   fiber membranes. It is a general intuition that operating at higher
   pressures permeates more gases, and sometimes the membrane module is
   tested or characterized at lower pressures to reduce gas consumption. It
   is also perceived that higher pressure build-up occurs at higher feed
   pressures, and membrane performance deteriorates at higher feed
   pressures. In this study, the apparent and intrinsic permeances of H-2
   and N-2 in asymmetric cellulose acetate based hollow fiber membranes
   were evaluated from gas permeation experiments and numerical analysis.
   It was shown that though the permeate pressure build-up increases as the
   feed pressure increases, the effect of the permeate pressure build-up on
   the membrane performance is actually reduced at higher feed pressures.
   Membrane performs close to its intrinsic separation properties if it is
   operated at high feed pressures, under which conditions the effect of
   pressure build-up on the membrane performance is minimized. The pressure
   build-up effect was further investigated by evaluating the percentage
   loss in the driving force due to permeate pressure build-up, and it was
   found that percentage loss in driving force is less at higher feed
   pressures than that at lower feed pressures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for the optimal process and
   control design of dynamic systems under uncertainty. Robust feasibility
   and stability analyses are incorporated within the proposed methodology
   to ensure process dynamic operability and asymptotic stability. These
   analyses are formulated as convex mathematical problems; thus, the
   present approach is computationally attractive since it does not require
   the solution of an MINLP to evaluate dynamic feasibility and stability
   as it has been proposed by recent dynamic optimization based
   methodologies. A norm bounded metric based on Structured Singular Value
   (SSV) analysis is employed to estimate the worst case deviation in the
   process constraints in the presence of critical realizations in the
   disturbances. The robust stability Lest is based on Lyapunov theory and
   guarantees process asymptotic stability. Accordingly, the optimal
   process and control design alternative obtained by the method proposed
   here is dynamically feasible and asymptotically stable since it
   accommodates the most critical realizations in the disturbances. A
   ternary distillation system featuring a rigorous tray-by tray process
   model is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. 2013

Abstract = {{This paper develops causal loop diagrams and a system dynamics model for
   financially sustainable management of urban water distribution networks.
   The developed causal loop diagrams are a novel contribution in that it
   illustrates the unique characteristics and feedback loops for
   financially self-sustaining water distribution networks. The system
   dynamics model is a mathematical realization of the developed
   interactions among system variables over time and is comprised of three
   sectors namely watermains network, consumer, and finance. This is the
   first known development of a water distribution network system dynamics
   model. The watermains network sector accounts for the unique
   characteristics of watermain pipes such as service life, deterioration
   progression, pipe breaks, and water leakage. The finance sector allows
   for cash reserving by the utility in addition to the pay-as-you-go and
   borrowing strategies. The consumer sector includes controls to model
   water fee growth as a function of service performance and a household's
   financial burden due to water fees. A series of policy levers are
   provided that allow the impact of various financing strategies to be
   evaluated in terms of financial sustainability and household
   affordability. The model also allows for examination of the impact of
   different management strategies on the water fee in terms of consistency
   and stability over time.
   The paper concludes with a discussion on how the developed system
   dynamics water model can be used by water utilities to achieve a variety
   of utility short and long-term objectives and to establish realistic and
   defensible water utility policies. It also discusses how the model can
   be used by regulatory bodies, government agencies, the financial
   industry, and researchers. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{Calibration and validation of hydrological models is a challenge,
   particularly in remote regions that are minimally gauged. This paper
   develops a novel methodology for large-scale (>1000 km(2)) hydrological
   model calibration and validation using stable water isotopes founded on
   the rigorous constraints imposed by the need to conserve both water mass
   and stable isotopes simultaneously. The isoWATFLOOD model is applied to
   five basins within the Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories region of
   northern Canada to simulate stream discharge and oxygen-18 signals over
   a 3-year period. The isotopic variation of river discharge, runoff
   components, and evaporative fractionation are successfully simulated on
   both a seasonal and continual basis over the watershed domain to
   demonstrate the application of isotope tracers to regional hydrologic
   calibration. The intended application of this research is to remote,
   large-scale basins, showing promise for improving predictions in
   minimally gauged basins and climate change research where traditional,
   rigorous approaches to constraining parameter uncertainty may be
   impractical. This coupled isotope-hydrological (i.e. iso-hydrological)
   approach to modelling reduces the number of possible parameterizations,
   resulting in potentially more physically-based hydrological predictions.
   isoWATFLOOD provides a tool for water resource managers and utilities to
   use operationally for water use, allocation, and runoff generation
   estimations. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Low pressure membranes are a widely used drinking water treatment
   technology to reject particles and microbiological contaminants. A
   commercial UF membrane was used to investigate the removal of two virus
   surrogates (MS2 and phi X174 bacteriophage) of similar size but with
   different surface characteristics. MS2 was better removed than (phi X174
   regardless of its smaller size. phi X174 removal was found to decrease
   significantly as the feed solution pH increased from 6.5 to 9.4. Using
   mathematical modeling, size exclusion was confirmed to be the main
   removal mechanism for both bacteriophage. These values were then
   compared with experimental results and virus characteristics to evaluate
   the contribution of other removal mechanisms. The additional removal for
   MS2 above baseline size exclusion was likely a result of electrostatic
   repulsion. For phi X174, adsorption was shown to increase rejection at
   pH 6.5, but at pH 9.4 removal was due solely to size exclusion. The
   higher isolectric point of phi X174, along with its complex capsid
   structure, are believed to be responsible for the different removal
   patterns between the two phage types. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{SE-AKA: A secure and efficient group authentication and key agreement
   protocol for LTE networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3492-3510}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{To support Evolved Packet System (EPS) in the Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   networks, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed an
   authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol, named EPS-AKA, which
   has become an emerging standard for fourth-generation (4G) wireless
   communications. However, due to the requirement of backward
   compatibility, EPS-AKA inevitably inherits some defects of its
   predecessor UMTS-AKA protocol that cannot resist several frequent
   attacks, i.e., redirection attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and DoS
   attack. Meanwhile, there are additional security issues associated with
   the EPS-AKA protocol, i.e., the lack of privacy-preservation and key
   forward/backward secrecy (KFS/KBS). In addition, there are new
   challenges with the emergence of group-based communication scenarios in
   authentication. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient AKA
   protocol, called SE-AKA, which can fit in with all of the group
   authentication scenarios in the LTE networks. Specifically, SE-AKA uses
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to realize KFS/KBS, and it also
   adopts an asymmetric key cryptosystem to protect users' privacy. For
   group authentication, it simplifies the whole authentication procedure
   by computing a group temporary key (GTK). Compared with other
   authentication protocols, SE-AKA cannot only provide strong security
   including privacy-preservation and KFS/KBS, but also provide a group
   authentication mechanism which can effectively authenticate group
   devices. Extensive security analysis and formal verification by using
   proverif have shown that the proposed SE-AKA is secure against various
   malicious attacks. In addition, elaborate performance evaluations in
   terms of communication, computational and storage overhead also
   demonstrates that SE-AKA is more efficient than those existing
   protocols. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improved endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) removal is desirable in
   municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) although increased
   removal does not always translate into reduced biological activity.
   Suitable methods for determining reduction in biological activity of
   effluents are needed. In order to determine which MWWTPs are the most
   effective at removing EDC activities, we operated three configurations
   of pilot sized biological reactors (conventional activated sludge, CAS;
   nitrifying activated sludge, NAS; and biological nutrient removal, BNR)
   receiving the same influent under simulated winter and summer
   conditions. As frogs are model organisms for the study of thyroid
   hormone (TH) action, we used the North American species Rana catesbeiana
   in a cultured tadpole tailfin (C-fin) assay to compare the effluents.
   TH-responsive (thyroid hormone receptors alpha (thra) and beta (thrb))
   and stress-responsive (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and heat shock
   protein 30) mRNA transcript levels were examined. Effluents infrequently
   perturbed stress-responsive transcript abundance but thra/thrb levels
   were significantly altered. In winter conditions, CAS caused frequent TH
   perturbations while BNR caused none. In summer conditions, however, BNR
   caused substantial TH perturbations while CAS caused few. Our findings
   contrast other studies of seasonal variations of EDC removal and
   accentuate the importance of utilizing appropriate biological readouts
   for assessing EDC activities.}},

Abstract = {{This review presents the synergistic effect in the catalytic system of

   the catalytic system of metal-based ionic liquids, the catalytic system
   of hydrogen bond-promoted ionic liquids and supported ionic liquids.
   Metal and ionic liquids show a synergistic effect on the cycloaddition
   reactions of epoxides. The cations and anions of ionic liquids show a
   synergistic effect on the cycloaddition reactions. The functional groups
   in cations or supports combined with the anions have a synergistic
   effect on the cycloaddition reactions. Synergistic catalytic effects of
   ILs play an important role of promoting the cycloaddition reactions of
   epoxides. The design of catalytic system of ionic liquids will be
   possible if the synergistic effect on a molecular level is understood.}},

Abstract = {{architecture for practical and highly efficient software-defined radio
   transmitters. Signal encoding schemes for DMPAs have primarily focused
   either on amplitude or time domain encoding, neither of which can
   simultaneously provide high coding efficiency, high dynamic range and
   low design complexity. In this paper, we propose, analyze and evaluate a
   new hybrid amplitude/ time signal encoding scheme that significantly
   improves the coding efficiency and dynamic range of DMPAs without
   significantly increasing design complexity. The proposed hybrid
   amplitude/time encoding scheme combines both the amplitude domain and
   the time domain to optimally encode information. Evaluation results show
   that hybrid amplitude/time encoding yields a 35\% increase in the
   average coding efficiency with respect to conventional time encoding,
   and is only 6.7\% lower than peak efficiency when applied to a Wireless
   Local Area Network signal with a peak to average power ratio equal to
   9.9 dB. A new DMPA architecture, based on the proposed hybrid encoding,
   is also proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A short ionic-complementary peptide, EAR8-II, was employed to
   encapsulate the hydrophobic anticancer drug pirarubicin (THP). EAR8-II
   was designed to inherit advantages from two previously introduced
   peptides, AAP8 and EAK16-II, in their self/co-assembly. This peptide is
   short, simple, and inexpensive to synthesize, while possessing a low
   critical assembly concentration (CAC). The choice of alanine (A)
   residues in the peptide sequence provides moderate hydrophobic
   interactions, causing a minimal degree of aggregation, compared with
   other more hydrophobic residues. EAR8-II is an ionic-complementary
   peptide, similar to EAK16-II, can self/co-assemble with hydrophobic
   compounds such as THP, and forms a stable fibular nanostructure in
   aqueous solution. Physiochemical properties and cellular activities of
   the EAR8-II and THP complexes were evaluated and show dependency on the
   peptide-to-drug ratio. The complex at the peptide-to-drug mass ratio of
   5:1 provides a stable solution, uniform nanostructure, and highly
   effective anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines. This
   work forms the basis for detailed studies on EAR8-II and THP
   formulations in vitro and in vivo, for future development of
   peptide-based delivery systems for hydrophobic anticancer drugs.}},

Title = {{An efficient framework for hydrologic model calibration on long data
   periods}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Long periods of hydrologic data records have become available in many
   watersheds around the globe. Hydrologic model calibration on such long,
   full-length data periods is typically deemed the most robust approach
   for calibration but at larger computational costs. Determination of a
   representative short period as a surrogate of a long data period that
   sufficiently embeds its information content is not trivial and is a
   challenging research question. The representativeness of such a short
   period is not only a function of data characteristics but also model and
   calibration error function dependent. Unlike previous studies, this
   study goes beyond identifying the best surrogate data period to be used
   in model calibration and proposes an efficient framework that calibrates
   the hydrologic model to full-length data while running the model only on
   a short period for the majority of the candidate parameter sets. To this
   end, a mapping system is developed to approximate the model performance
   on the full-length data period based on the model performance for the
   short data period. The basic concepts and the promise of the framework
   are demonstrated through a computationally expensive hydrologic model
   case study. Three calibration approaches, namely calibration solely to a
   surrogate period, calibration to the full period, and calibration
   through the proposed framework, are evaluated and compared. Results show
   that within the same computational budget, the proposed framework leads
   to improved or equal calibration performance compared to the two
   conventional approaches. Results also indicate that model calibration
   solely to a short data period may lead to a range of performances from
   poor to very well depending on the representativeness of the short data
   period which is typically not known a priori.}},

Abstract = {{In light of unrestricted use of first-generation penicillins, these
   antibiotics are now superseded by their semisynthetic counterparts for
   augmented antibiosis. Traditional penicillin chemistry involves the use
   of hazardous chemicals and harsh reaction conditions for the production
   of semisynthetic derivatives and, therefore, is being displaced by the
   biosynthetic platform using enzymatic transformations. Penicillin G
   acylase (PGA) is one of the most relevant and widely used biocatalysts
   for the industrial production of beta-lactam semisynthetic antibiotics.
   Accordingly, considerable genetic and biochemical engineering strategies
   have been devoted towards PGA applications. This article provides a
   state-of-the-art review in recent biotechnological advances associated
   with PGA, particularly in the production technologies with an emphasis
   on using the Escherichia coli expression platform. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We focus on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that perform data collection
   with the objective of obtaining the whole dataset at the sink (as
   opposed to a function of the dataset). In this case, energy-efficient
   data collection requires the use of data aggregation. Whereas many data
   aggregation schemes have been investigated, they either compromise the
   fidelity of the recovered data or require complicated in-network
   compressions. In this paper, we propose a novel data aggregation scheme
   that exploits compressed sensing (CS) to achieve both recovery fidelity
   and energy efficiency in WSNs with arbitrary topology. We make use of
   diffusion wavelets to find a sparse basis that characterizes the spatial
   (and temporal) correlations well on arbitrary WSNs, which enables
   straightforward CS-based data aggregation as well as high-fidelity data
   recovery at the sink. Based on this scheme, we investigate the
   minimum-energy compressed data aggregation problem. We first prove its
   NP-completeness, and then propose a mixed integer programming
   formulation along with a greedy heuristic to solve it. We evaluate our
   scheme by extensive simulations on both real datasets and synthetic
   datasets. We demonstrate that our compressed data aggregation scheme is
   capable of delivering data to the sink with high fidelity while
   achieving significant energy saving.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to the node clone, and several
   distributed protocols have been proposed to detect this attack. However,
   they require too strong assumptions to be practical for large-scale,
   randomly deployed sensor networks. In this paper, we propose two novel
   node clone detection protocols with different tradeoffs on network
   conditions and performance. The first one is based on a distributed hash
   table (DHT), by which a fully decentralized, key-based caching and
   checking system is constructed to catch cloned nodes effectively. The
   protocol performance on efficient storage consumption and high security
   level is theoretically deducted through a probability model, and the
   resulting equations, with necessary adjustments for real application,
   are supported by the simulations. Although the DHT-based protocol incurs
   similar communication cost as previous approaches, it may be considered
   a little high for some scenarios. To address this concern, our second
   distributed detection protocol, named randomly directed exploration,
   presents good communication performance for dense sensor networks, by a
   probabilistic directed forwarding technique along with random initial
   direction and border determination. The simulation results uphold the
   protocol design and show its efficiency on communication overhead and
   satisfactory detection probability.}},

Abstract = {{Modification of natural rubber (NR) via grafting polymerization with
   maleic anhydride (MA) has received wide attention as it could improve
   the hydrophilicity of NR and extend its application to a wider
   application field. However, the grafting efficiency of MA onto NR in
   either the molten state or solution state is low and is accompanied with
   undesired high gel content in the grafts. In this work a novel technical
   route was developed in that a deproteinization operation was conducted
   before carrying out the grafting process and a differential
   microemulsion polymerization technique was applied for the grafting
   reaction. The effects of initiator and monomer concentration, reaction
   temperature, and reaction time on the grafting efficiency and gel
   fraction were investigated, and a comparison of the reaction performance
   was conducted for deproteinized NR (DPNR) and NR. The results indicated
   that the deproteinization operation could significantly improve the
   grafting efficiency and reduce the gel content, and a 29\% yield of MA
   grafted onto the rubber backbone could be achieved at a condition of a
   DPNR:MA:initiator ratio of 85:9:6 (wt\%) at 60 degrees C for 8 h. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of Device-to-Device (D2D)
   communications with dynamic interference. In specific, we analyze the
   performance of frequency reuse among D2D links with dynamic data arrival
   setting. We first consider the arrival and departure processes of
   packets in a non-saturated buffer, which result in varying interference
   on a link based on the change of its backlogged state. The packet-level
   system behavior is then represented by a coupled processor queuing
   model, where the service rate varies with time due to both the fast
   fading and the dynamic interference effects. In order to analyze the
   queuing model, we formulate it as a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC)
   and compute its steady-state distribution. Since the state space of the
   DTMC grows exponentially with the number of D2D links, we use the model
   decomposition and some iteration techniques in Stochastic Petri Nets
   (SPNs) to derive its approximate steady state solution, which is used to
   obtain the approximate performance metrics of the D2D communications in
   terms of average queue length, mean throughput, average packet delay and
   packet dropping probability of each link. Simulations are performed to
   verify the analytical results under different traffic loads and
   interference conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel dynamic survivable routing scheme in
   all-optical mesh networks, namely dynamic joint design heuristic (DJH),
   for achieving ultrafast and signaling-free failure restoration with low
   blocking probabilities. A unique feature of DJH is a joint design for
   the optical layer monitoring plane and survivable routing, where
   monitoring trails (m-trails) are launched and can possibly reuse the
   spare capacity reserved for protection lightpaths (P-LPs). We
   demonstrate how the proposed scheme determines the working lightpath and
   the corresponding P-LP(s), along with the configuration of the alarm
   code table at each node for each newly arrived connection request, where
   the targeted all-optical restoration can be fully ensured. Extensive
   simulation is conducted to examine the proposed DJH scheme in terms of
   blocking probabilities and compare it with a couple of previously
   reported counterparts, namely a p-cycle-based dynamic routing scheme and
   a failure dependent protection-based survivable routing scheme without
   considering all-optical monitoring. We verify the proposed scheme and
   disclose insights on its performance behaviors.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{318-326}},

Abstract = {{The influence of differing operational conditions of two-stage digesters
   on biokinetic characteristics and communities of methanogenic archaea
   was evaluated. Operating temperature of each phase influenced the
   archaeal communities significantly. Also, a strong correlation was
   observed between community composition and temperature and pH. The
   maximum specific substrate utilization rates (k(max)) of acetoclastic
   methanogens in the mesophilic and thermophilic 1st phases were 11.4 and
   22.0 mgCOD mgCOD(-1) d(-1), respectively, whereas significantly lower
   k(max) values were estimated for the mesophilic and thermophilic
   2nd-phase digesters which were 7.6 and 16.6 mgCOD mgCOD(-1) d(-1),
   respectively. It appeared that the biokinetic characteristics of the
   acetoclastic methanogen communities were reliant on digester loading
   rates. Also, higher temperature dependency coefficients (theta) were
   observed for the long retention time digesters when compared to the
   values computed for the 1st-phase digesters. Accordingly, the
   implementation of two sets of biokinetic parameters for acetoclastic
   methanogen will improve modeling of phased anaerobic digesters. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of
   using an RF antenna to detect and classify partial discharges on polymer
   insulation surfaces. The detected discharges are identified based on
   their originating sources, employing a cascade of feature extraction,
   feature selection and the standard artificial neural network classifier.
   Both statistical and spectral analyses have been used for feature
   extraction. Feature extraction is followed by a feature selection stage
   with a novel implementation of stepwise regression method in order to
   derive representative feature vectors, yet with minimum dimensionality.
   Suppression of redundant features is therefore achieved, thereby
   enhancing the classification reliability. Finally, classification is
   performed using a standard feed forward neural network with back
   propagation training algorithm. The proposed method is found to be
   successful in classifying different types of partial discharge with
   recognition accuracy exceeding 96\%. The proposed method can be an
   essential stage towards overhead line inspection to assess the status of
   outdoor polymer insulators, where partial discharges could be initiated
   from surface discharges due to pollution and/or from corona discharges
   from energized ends.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic separation has been recognized as an important property for the
   simple deployment of micro and sub-microparticles into solution in the
   field of water treatment. Many materials with desirable properties for
   water decontamination are hindered due to the difficulty inherent in
   removing them from solution post-treatment. By securing these materials
   to magnetic compounds, this important issue can be solved as removing
   active materials from wastewater requires only the application of a
   magnetic field. This review article presents and discusses many recent
   technologies, in the form of patents, which exploit the property of
   magnetic separation for advanced water treatment, including methods of
   adsorbing pollutants from wastewater and magnetically separating them,
   as well as methods of deploying active materials for the degradation of
   contaminants, then magnetically retrieving these catalysts. The
   requirement for advanced wastewater treatment methods becomes more
   essential as new, persistent contaminants arise as a result of
   pharmaceuticals, pesticides and industrial processes which cannot be
   addressed by traditional water treatment procedures. Magnetic separation
   promises to be a critical factor in these advanced methods, allowing the
   safe deployment of active materials which would otherwise be unusable,
   opening the gate to more efficient, economic and environmentally
   friendly water purification.}},

   removing noisy and/or redundant features. However, it is possible for
   feature selection to yield features that are only partially informative
   about the classes in the set. These features are beneficial for
   distinguishing between some classes but not others. In these cases, it
   is beneficial to divide the large classification problem into a set of
   smaller problems, where a more specific set of features can be used to
   classify different classes. Dividing a problem this way is also common
   when the base classifier is binary, and the problem needs to be
   reformulated as a set of two-class problems so it can be handled by the
   classifier. This paper presents a method for multiclass classification
   that simultaneously formulates a binary tree of simpler classification
   subproblems and performs feature selection for the individual
   classifiers. The feature selected hierarchical classifier (FSHC) is
   tested against several well-known techniques for multiclass division.
   Tests are run on nine different real data sets and one artificial data
   set using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results show
   that the accuracy obtained by the FSHC is comparable with other common
   multiclass SVM methods. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the
   algorithm creates solutions with fewer classifiers, fewer features, and
   a shorter testing time than the other SVM multiclass extensions.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology that enables
   opportunistic utilization of the temporarily vacant spectrum to mitigate
   the spectrum scarcity in wireless communications. Since secondary users
   (SUs) should vacate the channel in use immediately after detecting the
   reappearances of primary users (P Us) in cognitive radio networks
   (CRNs), the route reliability is a distinctive challenge for routing in
   CRNs. Furthermore, the throughput requirement of an SU session should be
   satisfied and it is always preferable to select a route with less
   negative influence on other current or latish sessions. To account for
   the route reliability challenge, we study the joint link and channel
   assignment routing problem for CRNs. It is formulated in a form of
   integer nonlinear programming (INLP), which is NP-hard, with the
   objective of minimizing the interference of a new route to other routes
   while providing route reliability and throughput guarantee. An on-demand
   route discovery algorithm is proposed to find reliable candidate paths,
   while a joint link and channel assignment routing algorithm with
   sequentially-connected-link coordination is proposed to choose the
   near-optimal route for improving the route reliability and minimizing
   negative influence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm achieves considerable improvement over existing schemes in
   both route reliability and throughput.}},

Abstract = {{A network mobility (NEMO)-based vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a
   new approach to integrate the NEMO protocol with VANETs. This
   integration supports communications between roadside units (RSUs) and
   vehicles and provides Internet access through public hotspots located
   inside public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and
   shuttles. Passengers inside these public transportation systems enjoy
   full Internet access by using different mobile network nodes (MNNs),
   such as cell phones and personal digital assistants. However, due to the
   open nature of wireless network environments, physical-layer attackers
   can easily localize the MNNs by measuring their received signal strength
   (RSS) through positioning schemes such as the triangulation scheme. In
   this paper, we modify obfuscation, i.e., concealment, and power
   variability ideas and propose a new physical-layer location privacy
   scheme, i.e., the fake point-cluster-based scheme, to prevent attackers
   from localizing users inside NEMO-based VANET hotspots. The proposed
   scheme involves fake-point-and cluster-based subschemes, and its goal is
   to confuse the attackers by increasing the estimation errors of their
   RSSs measurements and, hence, preserving MNNs' location privacy. Using
   correctness, accuracy, and certainty metrics, we show that the fake
   point-cluster-based scheme achieves higher MNN's location privacy when
   the number of network grid points in the hotspot decreases. In addition,
   our extensive simulations show that the fake point-cluster-based scheme
   achieves 23\% and 37\% decreases in the average sender's power and the
   MNN-AP route path length, respectively, compared with the fake-point
   subscheme.}},

   signals revealed power-added efficiencies of greater than 66\%, at input
   power level adjustments of 21 and 16 dBm, and more than 62\% when the
   average input power level setting was adjusted to 11 dBm. In addition,

Abstract = {{We present the design, fabrication and experimental validation of an
   integrated Scanning Microwave Microscopy (SMM)/Atomic Force Microscopy
   (AFM) system that does not require the use of a conventional laser-based
   AFM. Microfabricated SMM probes are collocated with piezoresistive
   strain-based sensing AFM probes in a CMOS-MEMS process, and are actuated
   by integrated electrothermal scanners. Integration of AFM enables dual
   mode imaging (topography and electrical properties) and more
   importantly, it enables control over tip-sample distance, which is
   crucial for accurate SMM imaging. This design is unique in the sense
   that the tip can be scanned over the sample in 3 degrees of freedom,
   over a 20 mu m x 10 mu m x 30 mu m scan range in the x, y, and z
   directions respectively. We fabricate our device by using a standard
   foundry CMOS process followed by in-house maskless MEMS post processing
   to release the devices. Single-chip SMM/AFM devices with integrated 1-D
   and 3-D actuation are thus obtained. These devices can be used to
   modulate the tip-sample separation to underlying samples with a periodic
   signal, improving immunity to long-term system drifts. We also
   investigate the effect of tip-sample separation on the resolution of the
   instrument. To increase measurement sensitivity, a single-stub matching
   network has been used to match the high tip-to-sample impedance to the
   50 ohm characteristic impedance of a performance network analyzer.
   Measurement results of the CMOS-MEMS SMM are presented to verify the
   proposed concept.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the optimal energy delivery problem from
   viewpoints of both the vehicle owner and aggregator, in load shaving
   services of a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. We formulate the
   optimization problem based on a general plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
   (PHEV) model, taking into account the randomness in vehicle mobility,
   time-of-use electricity pricing, and realistic battery modeling.
   Stochastic inventory theory is applied to analyze the problem. We
   mathematically prove that a state-dependent (S, S') policy is optimal
   for the daily energy cost minimization of each vehicle, and develop an
   estimation algorithm to calculate the parameters of the optimal policy
   for practical applications. Furthermore, we investigate the
   multi-vehicle aggregator design problem by considering the power system
   constraints. A policy adjustment scheme is proposed to adjust the values
   of S and S' with respect to the optimal policy adopted by each PHEV,
   such that the aggregated recharging and discharging power constraints of
   the power system can be satisfied, while minimizing the incremental cost
   (or revenue loss) of PHEV owners. Based on characteristics of the
   state-dependent (S, S') policy and our proposed policy adjustment
   scheme, the optimal aggregator operation problem is transformed into a
   convex optimization one which can be readily solved by existing
   algorithms. The performance of our proposed schemes is evaluated via
   simulations based on real data collected from Canadian utilities,
   households, and commuters.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Seismic risk analysis and mitigation of spatially extended structures
   require the synthesis of spatially varying ground motions in the
   response history analysis of these structures. These synthetic motions
   are usually desired to be spatially correlated, site reflected,
   nonstationary, and compatible with target design response spectra. In
   this paper, a method is presented for simulating spatially varying
   ground motions considering the nonstationarity, local site effects, and
   compatibility of response spectra. The scheme for generating spatially
   varying and response spectra compatible ground motions is first
   established for spatial locations on the ground surface with varying
   site conditions. The design response spectrum is introduced as the
   ``power{''} spectrum at the base rock. The site amplification approach
   is then derived based on the deterministic wave propagation theory, by
   assuming that the base rock motions consist of out-of-plane SH wave or
   in-plane combined P and SV waves propagating into the site with assumed
   incident angles, from which tri-directional spatial ground motions can
   be generated. The phase difference spectrum is employed to model ground
   motions exhibiting nonstationarity in both frequency and time domains
   with different site conditions. The proposed scheme is demonstrated with
   numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mechanisms for orienting toward and locating an odor source are sought
   in both biology and engineering. Chemical ecology studies have
   demonstrated that adult female sea lamprey show rheotaxis in response to
   a male pheromone with dichotomous outcomes: sexually mature females
   locate the source of the pheromone whereas immature females swim by the
   source and continue moving upstream. Here we introduce a simple
   switching mechanism modeled after odor-conditioned rheotaxis for the sea
   lamprey as they search for the source of a pheromone in a
   one-dimensional riverine environment. In this strategy, the females move
   upstream only if they detect that the pheromone concentration is higher
   than a threshold value and drifts down ( by turning off control action
   to save energy) otherwise. In addition, we propose various uncertainty
   models such as measurement noise, actuator disturbance, and a
   probabilistic model of a concentration field in turbulent flow. Based on
   the proposed model with uncertainties, a convergence analysis showed
   that with this simplistic switching mechanism, the lamprey converges to
   the source location on average in spite of all such uncertainties.
   Furthermore, a slightly modified model and its extensive simulation
   results explain the behaviors of immature female lamprey near the source

Abstract = {{To improve compression performance, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)
   employs a quad-tree based block representation, namely Coding Tree Unit
   (CTU), which can support larger partitions and more coding modes than a
   traditional macroblock. Despite its high compression efficiency, the
   number of combinations of coding modes increases dramatically, which
   results in high computational complexity at the encoder. Here we propose
   a flexible framework for HEVC coding mode selection, with a user-defined
   global complexity factor. Based on linear programming, a hierarchical
   complexity allocation scheme is developed to allocate computational
   complexities among frames and Coding Units (CUs) to maximize the overall
   Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. In each CU, with the allocated
   complexity factor, a mode mapping based approach is employed for coding
   mode selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with a series of
   global complexity factors, the proposed model can achieve good
   trade-offs between computational complexity and RD performance.}},

Abstract = {{We study simultaneous channel sharing of collocated primary and
   secondary networks at three different levels of coexistence: pure
   interference, asymmetric, and symmetric. At the pure interference level,
   both networks operate simultaneously in the same frequency band
   regardless of their interference to each other. At the asymmetric level,
   only the secondary network performs user scheduling based on various
   degrees of interference and channel gain knowledge while at the
   symmetric level both networks do so. Using a lemma on the asymptotic
   behavior of the largest order statistic and a proposition on the
   asymptotic sum of lower order statistics, we derive asymptotic primary
   and secondary sum-rates under simultaneous channel sharing at each
   coexistence level. As a baseline comparison, time-division (TD) channel
   sharing is considered. While maintaining the same asymptotic primary
   sum-rate, the asymptotic secondary sum-rate under TD is compared with
   that achievable by simultaneous channel sharing. The results indicate
   that simultaneous channel sharing at both asymmetric and symmetric
   co-existence levels can outperform TD. Furthermore, this enhancement is
   achievable asymptotically when user scheduling in uplink mode is based
   only on the interference gains to the opposite network and not on a
   network's own channel gains.}},

Abstract = {{Variability models represent the common and variable features of
   products in a product line. Since the introduction of FODA in 1990,
   several variability modeling languages have been proposed in academia
   and industry, followed by hundreds of research papers on variability
   models and modeling. However, little is known about the practical use of
   such languages. We study the constructs, semantics, usage, and
   associated tools of two variability modeling languages, Kconfig and CDL,
   which are independently developed outside academia and used in large and
   significant software projects. We analyze 128 variability models found
   in 12 open-source projects using these languages. Our study 1) supports
   variability modeling research with empirical data on the real-world use
   of its flagship concepts. However, we 2) also provide requirements for
   concepts and mechanisms that are not commonly considered in academic
   techniques, and 3) challenge assumptions about size and complexity of
   variability models made in academic papers. These results are of
   interest to researchers working on variability modeling and analysis
   techniques and to designers of tools, such as feature dependency

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel decentralized modal identification method is
   proposed utilizing the concepts of sparse blind source separation (BSS)
   and parallel factor decomposition. Unlike popular ambient modal
   identification methods which require large arrays of simultaneous
   vibration measurements, the decentralized algorithm presented here
   operates on partial measurements, utilizing a sub-set of sensors
   at-a-time. Mathematically, this leads to an underdetermined source
   separation problem, which is addressed using sparsifying wavelet
   transforms. The proposed method builds on a previously presented concept
   by the authors, which utilizes the stationary wavelet packet transform
   (SWPT) to generate an over-complete dictionary of sparse bases. However,
   the redundant SWPT can be computationally intensive depending on the
   bandwidth of the signals and the sampling frequency of the vibration
   measurements. This issue of computational burden is alleviated through a
   new method proposed here, which is based on a multi-linear algebra tool
   called PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) decomposition. At the core of this
   method, the wavelet packet decomposition coefficients are used to form a
   covariance tensor, followed by PARAFAC tensor decomposition to separate
   the modal responses. The underdetermined source identifiability of
   PARAFAC enables source separation in wavelet packet coefficients with
   considerable mode mixing, thereby relaxing the conditions to generate
   over-complete bases, thus reducing the computational burden. The
   proposed method is validated using a series of numerical simulations
   followed by an implementation on recorded ambient vibration measurements
   obtained from the UCLA factor building. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Inter-slice bidirectional registration-based segmentation of the
   prostate gland in MR and CT image sequences}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Accurate segmentation and volume estimation of the prostate
   gland in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images are
   necessary steps in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of prostate
   cancer. This paper presents an algorithm for the prostate gland volume
   estimation based on the semiautomated segmentation of individual slices
   in T2-weighted MR and CT image sequences.
   Methods: The proposed Inter-Slice Bidirectional Registration-based
   Segmentation (iBRS) algorithm relies on interslice image registration of
   volume data to segment the prostate gland without the use of an
   anatomical atlas. It requires the user to mark only three slices in a
   given volume dataset, i. e., the first, middle, and last slices. Next,
   the proposed algorithm uses a registration algorithm to autosegment the
   remaining slices. We conducted comprehensive experiments to measure the
   performance of the proposed algorithm using three registration methods
   (i.e., rigid, affine, and nonrigid techniques).
   Results: The results with the proposed technique were compared with
   manual marking using prostate MR and CT images from 117 patients. Manual
   marking was performed by an expert user for all 117 patients. The median
   accuracies for individual slices measured using the Dice similarity
   coefficient (DSC) were 92\% and 91\% for MR and CT images, respectively.
   The iBRS algorithm was also evaluated regarding user variability, which
   confirmed that the algorithm was robust to interuser variability when
   marking the prostate gland.
   Conclusions: The proposed algorithm exploits the interslice data
   redundancy of the images in a volume dataset of MR and CT images and
   eliminates the need for an atlas, minimizing the computational cost
   while producing highly accurate results which are robust to interuser
   variability. (c) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The damping-induced self-recovery phenomenon refers to the fundamental
   property of underactuated mechanical systems: if an unactuated cyclic
   variable is under a viscous damping-like force and the system starts
   from rest, then the cyclic variable will always move back to its initial
   condition as the actuated variables come to a stop. The regular momentum
   conservation phenomenon can be viewed as the limit of the
   damping-induced self-recovery phenomenon in the sense that the
   self-recovery phenomenon disappears as the damping goes to zero. This
   paper generalizes the past result on damping-induced self-recovery for
   the case of a single unactuated cyclic variable to the case of multiple
   unactuated cyclic variables. We characterize a class of external forces
   that induce new conserved quantities, which we call the damping-induced
   momenta. The damping-induced momenta yield first-order asymptotically
   stable dynamics for the unactuated cyclic variables under some
   conditions, thereby inducing the self-recovery phenomenon. It is also
   shown that the viscous damping-like forces impose bounds on the range of
   trajectories of the unactuated cyclic variables. Two examples are
   presented to demonstrate the analytical discoveries: the planar pendulum
   with gimbal actuators and the three-link planar manipulator on a
   horizontal plane.}},

   When the polymer is employed as a donor material in solution coated bulk

Abstract = {{This article presents the design and fabrication of a monolithic
   compliant microgripper. This research has mostly focused on the process
   of design, the finite element analysis, the fabrication method and use
   of a genetic algorithm method to solve the nonlinear kinematic equations
   and estimate the proper dimensions of the design. This new architecture
   of the microgripper enables it to apply a variable force to a wide range
   of micro-objects handled in microassembly, micromanipulation and also in
   biomedical applications such as artificial fertilization. The
   microgripper was designed to be normally open. Two shape memory alloy
   actuators close the jaws. To achieve the tasks, the most proper size has
   been considered to be 8x8mm, with thickness of 250 mu m. Polyethylene
   terephthalate has been used as the structural material. It is not
   brittle and is less sensitive to shock compared with silicon-based
   grippers; furthermore, its fabrication cost is less and it does not lose
   precision.}},

Abstract = {{In many design codes for roadway bridges, fatigue design involves
   passing a load model over an influence line for a critical location on
   the bridge and then determining the resulting nominal stress range. For
   fatigue design in the finite-life domain, this stress range is then
   multiplied by a damage equivalence factor to account for differences in
   the fatigue damage because of the load model and the expected real
   traffic. In general, the effects of simultaneous vehicle crossings are
   not considered in the calibration of the damage equivalence factor. In
   this paper, fatigue design procedures in the U.S., Canadian, European,
   and Swiss codes applicable for the design of steel or aluminum roadway
   bridges are first reviewed. A simulation-based study, conducted to
   investigate the effects of simultaneous vehicle crossings on the damage
   equivalence factors for North American roadway bridges, is then
   presented. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are made
   for amplifying the North American damage equivalence factors in cases

   proposed scheme has four important features: 1) it allows the owner to
   outsource sensitive data to a CSP, and perform full block-level dynamic
   operations on the outsourced data, i.e., block modification, insertion,
   deletion, and append, 2) it ensures that authorized users (i.e., those
   who have the right to access the owner's file) receive the latest
   version of the outsourced data, 3) it enables indirect mutual trust
   between the owner and the CSP, and 4) it allows the owner to grant or
   revoke access to the outsourced data. We discuss the security issues of
   the proposed scheme. Besides, we justify its performance through

Abstract = {{Delay tolerant networks (DTN) are characterized by a lack of continuous
   end-to-end connections due to node mobility, constrained power sources,
   and limited data storage space of some or all of its nodes. To overcome
   the frequent disconnections, DTN nodes are required to store data
   packets for long periods of time until they come near other nodes.
   Moreover, to increase the delivery probability, they spread multiple
   copies of the same packet on the network so that one of them reaches the
   destination. Given the limited storage and energy resources of many DTN
   nodes, there is a tradeoff between maximizing delivery and minimizing
   storage and energy consumption. In this paper, we study the routing
   problem in DTN with limited resources. We formulate a mathematical model
   for optimal routing, assuming the presence of a global observer that can
   collect information about all the nodes in the network. Next, we propose
   a new protocol based on social grouping among the nodes to maximize data
   delivery while minimizing network overhead by efficiently spreading the
   packet copies in the network. We compare the new protocol with the
   optimal results and the existing well-known routing protocols using real
   life simulations. Results show that the proposed protocol achieves
   higher delivery ratio and less average delay compared to other protocols
   with significant reduction in network overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-coated LiFePO4 (C-LiFePO4) nanocomposites particles have been
   scale-up synthesized by a direct and economic solid-state reaction
   process. A variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, HRTEM,
   and HAADF), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are applied to
   investigate particles morphologies and phase structures on the nanometer
   scale. Single crystal and an olivine structure of the rough spherical
   LiFePO4 are confirmed by XRD pattern, HRTEM images and SAED patterns.
   The details of the coating including carbon content, thickness, and
   structure are particularly studied by energy filtered EF-TEM imaging,
   electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The size distribution is
   estimated at 50-200 nm from XRD analysis and TEM images. An average
   4.2\% carbon content is measured and a homogenous 3 nm carbon thick
   layer on the particles surfaces is clearly revealed by HRTEM and EF-TEM
   imaging. An amorphous carbon structure was further confirmed by both
   EELS and XPS valence analysis. The characteristics of these
   nanostructures and the amorphous carbon-coating has been demonstrated to
   improve the electronic conductivity and cell performance by reducing the
   path of both electron transfer and lithium ions diffusion while the
   C-LiFePO4 cathode is used in the battery cell. Electrochemical
   performance has been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and
   galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, and AC impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). The C-LiFePO4 particles exhibited improved electric conductivity,
   good rate capability, capacity retention, and cycling performance and
   superior discharge capacity with delivery of almost 99\% of its
   theoretical discharge capacity of 168 mAh/g at a C/10 rate with a high
   coulomb efficiency. The CV profiles show that lithium ions and electrons
   are quite active during two-phase kinetic reaction, which could be
   attributed to the smaller particles and carbon-coating layer that
   facilitated extraction and insertion of lithium ions and electrons
   transfers, thereby is beneficial to the kinetic behavior and improving
   electrochemical performance during charge-discharge processes. This
   investigation showed that the low cost and direct solid-state
   manufacturing process can produce the active LiFePO4 cathode for the
   development of high-power Li-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{The development of non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs) that are
   practical for use at the cathode of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cells (PEMFCs) would provide immense economic advantages, perpetuating
   the looming widespread commercialisation of these devices. NPMC
   materials with excellent activity towards the oxygen reduction, coupled
   with PEMFC performance approaching that of state-of-the-art platinum
   catalysts brings this technology one step closer to practical
   application. Currently, the stability of these materials is still
   limited, and developing NPMC with excellent activity, performance and
   operational stability is the holy grail of PEMFC catalyst research.
   Fundamental knowledge available, along with recent progress made in this
   field of research will be the subject of this review paper.}},

Abstract = {{Sweat test based on chloride ion selective electrode is the common
   method for the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). In our previous study,
   the possibility of using chloride ion sensitive fluorescent dye to
   determine the chloride ion concentration with a small volume of sample
   has been explored. However, we found the conventional Stern-Volmer
   Equation is applicable only for large systems such as a fluorescent
   microscope with a large volume of sample and dye solution; and it is not
   valid for portable devices using a small photo detector and a small
   volume of sample and dye solution. Therefore, in this paper, extensive
   experiments were performed by using a miniature fluorescent detection
   system; the effects of the parameters including the concentration and
   the volume of fluorescent dye solution, the coefficient of Stern-Volmer
   plot, and the volume ratio of the fluorescent dye solution and the
   chloride solution were studied; and a modified Stern-Volmer Equation was
   obtained. Using the modified Stern-Volmer correlation, the miniature
   fluorescent detection device can detect the chloride ion concentration
   correctly and rapidly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search (PA-DDS) is a
   parsimonious multi-objective optimization algorithm with only one
   parameter to diminish the user's effort for fine-tuning algorithm
   parameters. This study demonstrates that hypervolume contribution (HVC)
   is a very effective selection metric for PA-DDS and Monte Carlo
   sampling-based HVC is very effective for higher dimensional problems
   (five objectives in this study). PA-DDS with HVC performs comparably to
   algorithms commonly applied to water resources problems (E-NSGAII and
   AMALGAM under recommended parameter values). Comparisons on the CEC09
   competition show that with sufficient computational budget, PA-DDS with
   HVC performs comparably to 13 benchmark algorithms and shows improved
   relative performance as the number of objectives increases. Lastly, it
   is empirically demonstrated that the total optimization runtime of
   PA-DDS with HVC is dominated (90\% or higher) by solution evaluation
   runtime whenever evaluation exceeds 10 seconds/solution. Therefore,
   optimization algorithm runtime associated with the unbounded archive of
   PA-DDS is negligible in solving computationally intensive problems.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction kinetics studies of C3H6 oxidation over Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2
   catalysts were characterized using temperature-programmed oxidation with
   different oxidants: O-2, NO2 and surface nitrates. Activation energies
   and conversion performance were compared in order to determine which
   hydrocarbon oxidation reaction pathway(s) is relevant in diesel exhaust
   gas aftertreatment applications. NO (x) adsorption did not occur on the
   SiO2 surface so the reaction between C3H6 and NO2 could be isolated,
   i.e. no nitrate effect would complicate the analysis and their
   significance could be decoupled. These results were then compared with
   Pt/Al2O3 where surface nitrates did form upon exposure to NO (x) . The
   onset of C3H6 oxidation was observed at a lower temperature with O-2
   than with NO2, but the activation energy was lower with NO2. This
   apparent discrepancy is related to the different oxidant concentrations
   used and the different adsorption pathways. The results indicate that
   hydrocarbons must be activated first for oxidation to begin, for either
   NO2 or O-2. In analyzing the reaction between C3H6 and nitrates, the
   reaction did not occur until NO (x) started to desorb from the catalyst
   at higher temperatures, i.e. when nitrates became unstable and
   decomposed, thus providing a readily available oxidant source. However,
   when O-2 was added to the nitrate/C3H6 system, the reaction began at
   even lower temperature than with just C3H6 and O-2. Nitrate consumption
   was also observed once oxidation began. The presence of the combination
   of nitrates and O-2 resulted in a lower C3H6 oxidation activation
   energy.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{95-104}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a long-term planning method to maximize the benefits
   of network reconfiguration and distributed generation (DG) allocation in
   distribution networks. The proposed method handles long-term yearly load
   increase and seeks to define the reinforcements (i.e., line upgrades,
   network reconfiguration, and DG integration) and when and where they are
   required to meet the load rise with minimal cost and acceptable quality
   standards. The objectives considered in this paper are: economic (costs
   of line upgrades, energy losses, switching operations, and DG capital,
   operation and maintenance costs) and environmental (emissions from grid
   and DG units). The proposed method takes into consideration the
   uncertainty related to renewable DG output power and the load
   variability. The long-term planning problem is defined as
   multi-objective nonlinear mixed integer programming. The outcomes of the
   planning problem are the Pareto front, which represents different
   optimum operating system points. Finally, the local distribution company
   (LDC) can choose the system operating point based on its preferences.

   surfactant mass fraction and temperature on the viscosity were studied.
   Experimental results showed that the magnetic fluid with low magnetic
   particle volume fraction behaved as a Newtonian fluid and the viscosity
   of the magnetic fluid increased with an increase of the suspended
   magnetic particles volume fraction. The experimental data was compared
   with the results of a theoretically derived equation. The viscosity of
   the magnetic fluid also increased with an increase in surfactant mass
   portion, while it decreased with increasing temperature. Moreover, the
   viscosity increased with increasing the magnetic field intensity.
   Increasing the temperature and the surfactant mass fraction weakened the
   influence of the magnetic field on the viscosity of the magnetic fluid.

Abstract = {{Formability of laser welded blanks (LWBs) was measured in the biaxial
   stretch forming mode using the limiting dome height (LDH) test. High
   strength low alloy steel and two dual-phase (DP600 and DP980) steels
   were used for fabricating LWBs. The failure location and the LDH values
   of the formed blanks were correlated to the hardness across the welds.
   The effects of weld line position and geometry on the formality was
   evaluated by investigating LWBs with three different weld line positions
   (0, 15 and 30 mm offsets from the blank center) for both linear and
   curvilinear geometry. The formability was found to be dependent on the
   weld line position and increased when the weld was located farther from
   the blank center due to more uniform strain developed during LDH tests.
   Interestingly, weld line geometry was observed to have a stronger
   influence on the formability DP600 steel. In addition to weld line
   position and geometry, heat affected zone softening was observed to be
   the dominant factor in controlling the formability of all the DP980 LWBs
   and the curvilinear welds of DP600 with failure consistently occurring
   in the region with more severe softening. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Despite the relevance of the software evolution phase, there are few
   characterization studies on recurrent evolution growth patterns and on
   their impact on software properties, such as coupling and cohesion. In
   this paper, we report a study designed to investigate whether the
   software evolution categories proposed by Lanza can be used to explain
   not only the growth of a system in terms of lines of code (LOC), but
   also in terms of metrics from the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK)
   object-oriented metrics suite. Our results show that high levels of
   recall (ranging on average from 52 to 72 \%) are achieved when using LOC
   to predict the evolution of coupling and size. For cohesion, we have
   achieved smaller recall rates (< 27 \% on average).}},

Abstract = {{Reliable and accurate photovoltaic (PV) models are essential for
   simulation of PV power systems. A solar cell is typically represented by
   a single diode equivalent circuit. The circuit parameters need to be
   estimated accurately to get an accurate model. However, one circuit
   parameter was assumed because of the limited information provided by
   commercial manufacturing datasheets, and thus the model accuracy is
   affected. This paper proposes a parameterization approach for PV models
   to improve modeling accuracy and reduce implementation complexity. It
   develops a method to accurately estimate circuit parameters, and thus
   improving the overall accuracy, relying only on the points provided by
   all commercial modules datasheet. The proposed modeling approach results
   in two simplified models demonstrating the advantage of fast simulation.
   The effectiveness of the modeling approach is thoroughly evaluated by
   comparing the simulation results with experimental data of solar modules
   made of mono-crystalline, multi-crystalline, and thin film.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of decentralized cohesive motion
   control of a formation of autonomous vehicles or robots moving in three
   dimensions, where the formation is required to move from its initial
   setting (defined by the positions of the agents in the formation) to a
   final desired setting and, during thismotion, maintain its formation
   geometry defined by the initial distances between the agent pairs. We
   propose a distributed control scheme to solve this problem utilizing the
   notions of graph rigidity and persistence as well as techniques of
   virtual target tracking and smooth switching. The distributed control
   scheme is developed by modeling the agent kinematics as single-velocity
   integrator; nevertheless, extension to the cases with practical
   kinematic and dynamic models of fixed-wing autonomous aerial vehicles
   and quadrotors is discussed. In this context, we examine the maintenance
   of geometric formation of a swarm of autonomous flight vehicles. The
   developed coordination and control schemes are verified via a number of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a practical formation motion control scheme for
   robotic swarms based on single-view distance estimation, which is
   performed using a single nonsophisticated camera on each robot agent,
   and the prior information about the heights of the robots and other
   objects in the environment. Here, a nonsophisticated camera means one
   that has limited field of view and limited resolution. First, the vision
   mechanism is analyzed, and a single-view distance estimation scheme is
   designed. Then, a set of decentralized control laws, to be incorporated
   with distance estimation scheme, is introduced to move the robotic swarm
   in formation from an arbitrary initial position to an arbitrary final
   position without deforming the formation shape. The robots do not have
   any global positioning sensors, and they do not communicate with each
   other. The stability and performance of the overall system are analyzed
   mathematically. Later, practical issues are discussed regarding the
   proposed scheme, and the effects of delay and quantization in distance
   estimation are formally analyzed. Finally, we present experimental
   results demonstrating the performance of the proposed control scheme in

Abstract = {{In this article we demonstrate the performance of a direct conversion
   amorphous selenium (a-Se) X-ray detector using biphenyldisnhydride/1,4
   phenylenediamine (BPDA/PPD) polyimide (PI) as a hole-blocking layer. The
   use of a PI layer with a-Se allows detector operation at high electric
   fields (>= 10 V/mu m) while maintaining low dark current, without
   deterioration of transient performance. The hole mobility of the PI/a-Se
   device is measured by the time-of-flight method at different electric
   fields to investigate the effect of the PI layer on detector
   performance. It was found that hole mobility as high as 0.75 cm(2)/Vs is
   achievable by increasing the electric field in the PI/a-Se device
   structure. Avalanche multiplication is also shown to be achievable when
   using PI as a blocking layer. Increasing the electric field within a-Se
   reduces the X-ray ionization energy, increases hole mobility, and
   improves the dynamic range and sensitivity of the detector.}},

Abstract = {{The compressibility factor (Z-factor) is considered as a very important
   parameter in the petroleum industry because of its broad applications in
   PVT characteristics. In this study, a meta-learning algorithm called
   Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) was developed to predict the
   compressibility factor. In addition, the proposed technique was examined
   with previous models, exhibiting an R-2 and an MSE of 0.999 and
   0.000014, respectively. A significant drawback in the conventional LSSVM
   is the determination of optimal parameters to attain desired output with
   a reasonable accuracy. To eliminate this problem, the current study
   introduced coupled simulated annealing (CSA) algorithm to develop a new
   model, known as CSA-LSSVM. The proposed algorithm included 4756 datasets
   to validate the effectiveness of the CSA-LSSVM model using statistical
   criteria. The new technique can be utilized in chemical and petroleum
   engineering software packages where the most accurate value of Z-factor
   is required to predict the behavior of real gas, significantly affecting
   design aspects of equipment involved in gas processing plants. (C) 2013

   diagnosis of human tissue disease such as early stage skin cancer. Two
   sets of non-invasive and in-package reflectometers operating at 42 and

   kinds of samples. The tests are performed for a number of liquids, and
   pure water at different temperatures. Also, the proposed WR-22 device is
   tested over skin at different locations. The clinical trial tests are
   performed on a number of volunteer patients who suffered from Basal cell
   carcinoma. The proposed devices are easy-to-fabricate, and provide a
   low-cost solution for fast and accurate skin cancer detection.

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{There are many reports of ZnSe nanowire synthesis, but photoluminescence
   measurements on these nanowires indicate weak band-edge and high
   sub-bandgap defect emission. The two main contributors to the
   non-optimal photoluminescence are nanowire growth at high temperatures
   and unpassivated surface states. In this paper, the synthesis of II-VI
   core-shell nanowires by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy is reported.
   We demonstrate that larger bandgap shells that passivate the nanowire
   surface states can be deposited around the nanowires by increasing the
   partial pressures of the shell reactants without a large increase in
   growth temperature, allowing high quality material to be obtained. The
   deposition of nearly lattice-matched ZnMgSSe shells on the ZnSe
   nanowires increases the band-edge luminescent intensity of the ZnSe
   nanowires by more than four orders of magnitude and improves the
   band-edge to defect photoluminescence intensity ratio to 12 000: 1. The
   corresponding full widths at half maximum of the band-edge exciton peaks
   of the core-shell nanowires can be as narrow as 2.8 nm. It is also shown
   that magnesium and chlorine can be incorporated into the ZnSe nanowire
   cores, which shortens the emission wavelength and is known to act as an
   n-type dopant, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The current research of induced-charge electroosmotic flow (ICEOF) is
   mostly confined to systems with ideally or fully polarizable surfaces
   (e.g., metal). However, most materials in nature have various degrees of
   polarizability, which directly affects the induced charges and
   subsequently the induced-charge electroosmotic flow. This paper studied
   the effect of the polarizability of the materials on the ICEOF. An
   analytical expression of the induced potential on the surface of a
   dielectric particle in a uniform electrical field was derived.
   Three-dimensional transient numerical simulations of the ICEOF and the
   motion of dielectric particles were performed to study the effect of the
   polarizability. Simulation results show that the transportation of the
   dielectric particle in a microchannel is not affected by the
   polarizability of the particle; however, the interaction of two
   dielectric particles is sensitive to the polarizability of the
   particles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ranking and compacting binding segments of protein families using
   aligned pattern clusters}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Discovering sequence patterns with variation can unveil
   functions of a protein family that are important for drug discovery.
   Exploring protein families using existing methods such as multiple
   sequence alignment is computationally expensive, thus pattern search,
   called motif finding in Bioinformatics, is used. However, at present,
   combinatorial algorithms result in large sets of solutions, and
   probabilistic models require a richer representation of the amino acid
   associations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present a method for
   ranking and compacting these solutions in a new representation referred
   to as Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs). To tackle the problem of a large
   solution set, our method reveals a reduced set of candidate solutions
   without losing any information. To address the problem of
   representation, our method captures the amino acid associations and
   conservations of the aligned patterns. Our algorithm renders a set of
   APCs in which a set of patterns is discovered, pruned, aligned, and
   synthesized from the input sequences of a protein family.
   Results: Our algorithm identifies the binding or other functional
   segments and their embedded residues which are important drug targets
   from the cytochrome c and the ubiquitin protein families taken from
   Unitprot. The results are independently confirmed by pFam's multiple
   sequence alignment. For cytochrome c protein the number of resulting
   patterns with variations are reduced by 76.62\% from the number of
   original patterns without variations. Furthermore, all of the top four
   candidate APCs correspond to the binding segments with one of each of
   their conserved amino acid as the binding residue. The discovered
   proximal APCs agree with pFam and PROSITE results. Surprisingly, the
   distal binding site discovered by our algorithm is not discovered by
   pFam nor PROSITE, but confirmed by the three-dimensional cytochrome c
   structure. When applied to the ubiquitin protein family, our results
   agree with pFam and reveals six of the seven Lysine binding residues as
   conserved aligned columns with entropy redundancy measure of 1.0.
   Conclusion: The discovery, ranking, reduction, and representation of a
   set of patterns is important to avert time-consuming and expensive
   simulations and experimentations during proteomic study and drug
   discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Cholesterol esterase (CE) induced surface erosion of poly(ethylene
   carbonate) (PEC) and drug release from PEC under mild physiological
   environment was investigated. The degradation process was monitored by
   changes of mass and molecular weight (MW) and surface morphology of
   polymer films. During the whole period of degradation, MW of PEC was
   unchanged. Water uptake of the polymer was only 2.8\% and 0.2\% for PEC
   with the MW of 200 kDa (PEC200) and PEC with the MW of 41 kDa (PEC41),
   respectively. Degradation of less hydrophilic PEC41 with higher density
   was slower than that of PEC200. By this mechanism, CE-responsive drug in
   vitro release from PEC in situ forming depots (ISFD) was conducted
   successfully. As expected, less bovine serum albumin (BSA) was released
   from PEC41 compared with that of PEC200. in the same time period. In
   conclusion, this work enabled the in vitro drug release evaluation of
   existing PEC devices and implied a new candidate for the development of
   enzyme-responsive systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In economic and safety hazards points of view, it is crucial to avoid
   the formation of clathrate hydrate of gases in oil and natural gas
   transportation/production systems. Injection of methanol as a
   thermodynamic inhibitor is a common approach in industry to shift the
   hydrate phase boundary to higher pressures/lower temperatures. Accurate
   computation of methanol loss to the vapor phase within hydrate
   inhibition is essential to calculate the right injection rate of
   methanol. In this study, two procedures have been proposed for fast and
   precise estimating the ratio of methanol content of vapor phase to
   methanol liquid composition (R-MeoH). In the first method, a new
   mathematical expression is presented. The obtained correlation is
   reliable for temperatures between 267.15 and 279.15 K and pressures
   between 1160 and 28000 kPa. The second method employs artificial neural
   network (ANN) approach for RMeoH prediction. Both developed models
   results are in good agreement with reported data in literature. The ANN
   based model, however, is more accurate than the new correlation. (C)

Abstract = {{This article presents a comparative study on the effects of using nano
   -alumina (Al2O3) on toughening mechanisms and structural behaviors of
   polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites. The role of using dispersant in
   nanocomposite preparation was also investigated. For nanocomposite
   preparation, mixing of the elements was performed using a Haake Poly
   Drive blending machine at 175 degrees C and the rotor speed of 50rpm.
   The notched Izod impact energy obtained for PP was about 27J/m and by
   the addition of nano -Al2O3 (4 wt\%) to PP, the notched Izod impact
   energy increases up to approximate to 43J/m. However, higher
   concentration of nano -Al2O3 in the nanocomposite resulted in the
   reduction of Izod impact property due to nano -Al2O3 agglomeration.
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of pure PP and
   PP/nano -Al2O3 composites demonstrated Al-O bond at 568 cm(-1) for
   nanocomposite spectrum that indicates the creation of nano -Al2O3
   particles. The x-ray diffraction patterns and FTIR spectra of PP/nano
   -Al2O3 composites showed that the intensity of the peaks when dispersant
   was used slightly increased and the arrangement of the peaks are
   normalized. This observation is attributed to homogeneous dispersion of
   nano -Al2O3 filler in the matrix when dispersant was used. Scanning
   electron micrograph of impact fractured surface showed that the fracture
   surface of PP/nano -Al2O3 composite becomes rougher with increasing the
   content of filler.}},

Title = {{Determination of water requirements of the Gavkhuni wetland, Iran: A
   hydrological approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{27-40}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study compared three hydrological methods - low flow frequency
   analysis, flow duration curve (FDC), and concentration-discharge (C-D)
   modeling - to determine the water requirement of the Gavkhuni wetland
   located in an arid region of Iran. Due to the effects of water
   impounding upstream on the hydrological regime of the Gavkhuni's inflow
   after construction of the Zayandehrud dam, none of the methods produced
   satisfactory results.
   Consequent modification of the hydrological regime of the wetland's
   inflow using a scaling process allowed all the methods except low flow
   frequency analysis to dependably estimate the base flow for the wetland.
   The results of the C-D method revealed that this method can provide a
   minimum health condition from the water quality point of view, while the
   results of the FDC demonstrated that not only the inflow estimated using
   this method can supply minimum conditions in terms of water quality
   parameters, but it also covers most areas of the wetland, based on the
   results of hydraulic modeling.
   The results reveal that the hydrological methods implemented in this
   study can dependably estimate environmental water allocation for
   wetlands in arid and semi-arid regions when there is no detailed
   knowledge about the biological requirements of the wetlands' biota. (C)

Abstract = {{Recently, metal nanoparticles have attracted attention as promising
   peroxygen activators for the rapid and effective remediation of organic
   contaminants. In this work, a one-dimensional physical model experiment
   was designed to investigate the mobility of the metal nanoparticles in
   porous media and the potential use of metal nanoparticles as peroxygen
   activators for in situ treatment of source zones. We found that our
   synthesized nano-Pd-Fe-0 particles were mobile in a non-geological
   porous medium and relatively immobile in a geological porous medium. In
   addition, we observed that iron-based bimetallic nanoparticles were able
   to remain in suspension in an ideal aqueous system much longer (>6
   weeks) than iron-based monometallic nanoparticles (<1 h). To overcome
   the nano-Pd-Fe-0 particle delivery issue in geological porous media, an
   activation zone approach was adopted. Nano-Pd-Fe-0 particles were
   injected in order to create a zone to activate persulfate for the
   treatment of a trichloroethylene source zone. Trichloroethylene mass
   destruction was only 9 \% higher in the nano-Pd-Fe-0 activated
   persulfate system compared to the non-activated persulfate system as
   revealed by a short-duration chloride concentration spike in the
   effluent. In addition, the nano-Pd-Fe-0 activation zone was rapidly
   deactivated after being exposed to persulfate as visually observed by a
   color change, indicating that the longevity of the activation zone is
   limited.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of catalytic distillation (CD) and the economic merits that
   it would bring into the biodiesel production process is studied. Process
   flow sheets depicting conventional and CD technology are modeled in
   Aspen Plus, and detailed operating conditions and equipment designs are
   provided for each process. The feedstock considered is soybean oil, and
   the transesterification reaction for the triglyceride is considered for
   biodiesel production. After optimal design of both process flow sheets
   to produce 10 million gallons of biodiesel per year, adhering to ASTM
   purity standards, a detailed cost analysis is carried out using the
   Aspen economic analyzer tool to predict capital, operating, and utility
   costs and to calculate the cost of production per gallon of biodiesel.
   Results depict CD to be a promising candidate to replicate the
   conversion and product purity of conventional biodiesel processes while
   having significant savings in capital (41.42\% cheaper than the
   conventional process) and utility (18.12\% less than the conventional
   process) costs, thereby making it a very competitive alternative. The
   total operating costs and price of production per gallon of biodiesel
   are only meagerly cheaper for a CD process because the most significant
   factor to the biodiesel production process is the raw material cost. For
   both processes, the price of production per gallon of biodiesel after
   accounting for revenue generated from glycerol product is predicted to
   be around 1.7 dollars/gallon. The Aspen model is flexible to accommodate
   higher flow rates for scale-up of operations, add or remove stages of
   operation into the biodiesel process, modify feedstock and stream
   prices, and predict associated capital and production costs.}},

Abstract = {{The study experimentally investigates the flexural behavior of concrete
   wall strips encased with PVC stay-in-place (SIP) concrete forming
   system. The system consists of interconnected Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
   elements; panels, connectors and bracings. Thirty PVC encased wall
   specimens were cast with dimensions: 457 mm wide by 200 mm or 250 mm
   deep by 3050 mm long. The variables studied were: the concrete core
   thickness (200 mm or 250 mm), the reinforcement ratio, and the connector
   type (middle and braced connector). The connectors used were middle
   connectors with flat panels or connectors with inclined bracing on the
   compression side and insulation (foam) on the tension side. All the
   specimens were tested under four point bending with a shear span of 1150
   mm. The test results showed that the PVC stay-in-place formwork system
   was effective in enhancing the flexural behavior of the encased walls.
   For a given reinforcement, the PVC encased specimens cracked and failed
   in the same mode, regardless of the connector type or the concrete
   core's thickness. The PVC encased walls exhibited higher yield and
   ultimate loads in comparison to control walls. The increase in load for
   the PVC encased walls decreased with higher reinforcement ratios. The
   contribution of the PVC stay-in-place system to the ultimate load
   increased as the concrete core thickness decreased and/or as the
   reinforcement ratio decreased. A model based on strain compatibility was
   developed to predict the flexural capacity of PVC stay-in-place encased
   walls. Predictions were in close agreement with measured results.}},

Abstract = {{In electron beam lithography (EBL), a large area pattern is divided into
   smaller writing fields, which are then stitched together by stage
   movement to generate the large area pattern. Precise stage movement is
   essential to minimize the stitching error, and this can be achieved by
   using laser interferometer-controlled stage. In addition, electron beam
   deflection must be adjusted to match the stage movement, which is
   referred to as ``writing field alignment.{''} To expose large area
   nanostructures, a large writing field must be used; otherwise, the stage
   movement time would be impractically long. However, writing field
   alignment accuracy decreases with a larger writing field owing to its
   low magnification. Here, the authors report that self-developing resist
   (for which the pattern shows up immediately after exposure, thus
   eliminating the need for ex-situ development) can provide in-situ
   feedback for writing field alignment accuracy, which in turn can be used
   to optimize the alignment. After several iterations using the exposed
   test pattern in nitrocellulose (self-developing) resist as feedback, the
   authors reproducibly achieved nearly perfect (<50nm stitching error)
   alignment with writing field of 1 mm(2) using a Raith EBL system. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for reading back electrical charges
   from nonvolatile memory (NVM)-based flash devices. These devices were
   programmed to store charges in the floating gates of the transistors.
   The primary goal is to identify and read back these static charges in
   the form of logic levels of ``1 bit (1b){''} and ``0 bit (0b){''}
   without destroying the data. Scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) with
   similar to 15nm spatial resolution was used to directly probe the data
   stored in the floating gate transistors. SCM measures the on-site
   programmed charges in flash memory devices as transistor charges of
   ON/OFF or 1b/0b. Qualitative variation of charge carriers has also been
   observed. Both the sample preparation and SCM probing methods are also

   without applying binder and conductive additives. Each nanowire is
   anchored to the current collector, leading to fast charge transfer. The

Title = {{Simulation of cogeneration within the concept of smart energy networks}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{75}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recently tremendous research effort has been made to cope with the
   challenges in providing a sustainable energy solution for achieving
   economic and environmental goals. The concept of smart energy networks
   (SEN) goes beyond the electricity-based smart grid (SG) environment. The
   availability of new technologies for utilizing renewables such as solar,
   wind, geothermal and biomass and possibility of integrating natural gas
   and heating/cooling pipelines into the electricity grid network have
   provided a base for reducing the carbon footprint of fossil fuels and to
   produce a better energy security in a SEN environment. Especially,
   cogeneration systems in SEN can provide a promising solution for
   effectively supplying energy from a variety of combine heat and power
   generators to district consumers in an urban environment. In this study,
   a community-scale energy network is modeled and simulated using TRNSYS
   (Transient System Simulation Software) to investigate the impacts of the
   selected cogeneration systems on real-time critical parameters of SEN.
   The simulation results show that, through analyzing the key factors, the
   cogeneration model can be technically and economically feasible in SEN
   environment. The model follows effectively the heat-to-power ratios of
   the individual components and meets the energy demand with less excess
   electricity supply. The model describes a high renewable contribution
   ratio of 23.5\% and gives a high overall efficiency which is about
   12.6\% higher than that of the separate heat and power generation
   system, resulting in a low emission level which is 34.2\% lower than
   that of the separate heat and power generation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Intracortical microelectrodes play a prominent role in the operation of
   neural interfacing systems. They provide an interface for recording
   neural activities and modulating their behavior through electric
   stimulation. The performance of such systems is thus directly meliorated
   by advances in electrode technology. We present a new architecture for
   intracortical electrodes designed to increase the number of
   recording/stimulation channels for a given set of shank dimensions. The
   architecture was implemented on silicon using microfabrication process
   and fabricated 3-mm-long electrode shanks with six relatively large (110
   mu m x 110 mu m pads in each shank for electrographic signal recording
   to detect important precursors with potential clinical relevance and
   electrical stimulation to correct neural behavior with low-power
   dissipation in an implantable device. Moreover, an electrode mechanical
   design was developed to increase its stiffness and reduce shank
   deflection to improve spatial accuracy during an electrode implantation.
   Furthermore, the pads were post-processed using pulsated low current
   electroplating and reduced their impedances by similar to 30 times
   compared to the traditionally fabricated pads. The paper also presents
   microfabrication process, electrodes characterization, comparison to the
   commercial equivalents, and in vitro and in vivo validations.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to modify the microstructure
   of sintered Al-SiC composites with particle concentrations ranging from
   4 to 16 vol\%. Two SiC particle sizes (490N and 800 grades) were
   examined. Following FSP, the hardness of the 4 and 8 vol\% of 490N grade
   SiC composites increased from 130 HV and 145 HV to 171 HV and 177 HV
   respectively. The increase was accounted for by the severe deformation
   occurring during FSP which uniformly distributed the SiC particles. The
   composites containing 16 vol\% SiC could not be fully consolidated using
   FSP, and contained residual pores and lack of consolidation which
   originated from the as-received sintered microstructure. The hardness
   correlated well with the mean inter-particle spacing for the SiC
   particles in the case of composites containing 4 and 8 vol\% SiC. (C)

Abstract = {{This work addresses the characterization of a UV-based micro-syringe
   deposition (mu SD) system utilized in the micro-dispensing of
   photopolymers on particulate ceramic substrates. This methodology is
   used in embedding functionally graded and interconnected micro-features
   within constructs produced by a novel combined powder-based additive
   manufacturing (AM) and UV-based micro-syringe deposition (mu SD)
   technique. The process is experimentally characterized using SEM and
   optical microscopy to study the effect of a wide range of process
   parameters on the geometrical quality of deposited tracks. Experimental
   data show that the system can produce features ranging from 200 to 575
   mu m in width and from 20 to 200 mu m in height on particulate ceramic
   surfaces. To gain insight into the proposed micro-deposition process, a
   two-tier model is also developed. The first framework describes an
   analytical model for predicting the flow rate of the dispensed
   photopolymer fluid based on the piston displacement. The second model is
   a stochastic framework for predicting the line width of the features
   deposited on the substrate using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation
   to compensate for uncertainty in the system input parameters. A
   comparison between experimental and modeling line width predictions
   shows that the modeling results are 14-38\% higher than the experimental
   results, depending on the system input variables. The proposed model is
   enhanced by introducing adjustment factors to compensate for UV exposure
   delay, fluid migration, and imbibition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) as pretreatment to microbial
   electrochemical cells (MECs) were first assessed for improving energy
   recovery. A dual-chamber MEC was operated at hydraulic retention time
   (HRT) ranging from 1 to 8 d, while operating conditions for an AnMBR
   were fixed. Current density was increased from 7.5 +/- 0 to 14 +/- 1
   A/m(2) membrane with increasing HRT. MEC tests with AnMBR permeate
   (mainly propionate and acetate) and propionate medium confirmed that
   propionate was fermented to acetate and hydrogen gas, and
   anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) utilized these fermentation products as
   substrate. Membrane separation in the AnMBR excluded fermenters and
   methanogens from the MEC, and thus no methane production was found in
   the MEC. The lack of fermenters, however, slowed down propionate
   fermentation rate, which limited current density in the MEC. To
   symphonize fermenters, H-2-consumers, and ARB in biofilm anode is
   essential for improving current density, and COD removal. (C) 2013

   often difficult to represent and even more difficult to encode

Abstract = {{We present a novel wafer-level fabrication method for 3D solenoidal
   microtransformers using an automatic wire bonder for chip-scale, very
   high frequency regime applications. Using standard
   microelectromechanical systems fabrication processes for the
   manufacturing of supporting structures, together with ultra-fast wire
   bonding for the fabrication of solenoids, enables the flexible and
   repeatable fabrication, at high throughput, of high performance air core
   microtransformers. The primary and secondary solenoids are wound one on
   top of the other in the lateral direction, using a 25 mu m thick
   insulated wire. Besides commonly available gold wire, we also introduce
   insulated copper wire to our coil winding process. The influence of
   copper on the transformer properties is explored and compared to gold. A
   simulation model based on the solenoids' wire bonding trajectories has
   been defined using the FastHenry software to accurately predict and
   optimize the transformer's inductive properties. The transformer chips
   are encapsulated in polydimethylsiloxane in order to protect the coils
   from environmental influences and mechanical damage. Meanwhile, the
   effect of the increase in the internal capacitance of the chips as a
   result of the encapsulation is analyzed. A fabricated transformer with
   20 windings in both the primary and the secondary coils, and a footprint
   of 1 mm(2), yields an inductance of 490 nH, a maximum efficiency of
   68\%, and a coupling factor of 94\%. The repeatability of the coil
   winding process was investigated by comparing the data of 25 identically
   processed devices. Finally, the microtransformers are benchmarked to
   underline the potential of the technology in rendering air core
   transformers competitive.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, anti-lock brake system control using sliding-mode
   controller is investigated. Different alternatives for the switching
   function and the sliding surface, involved in the structure of the
   sliding-mode controller, are explored. It was aimed to reach a better
   controller performance with less chattering and robustness to actuator
   imperfections. Regarding applicability, tire force response was modeled
   as a uniformly distributed uncertain parameter during controller
   designs. Controllers are simulated for both constant and varying
   coefficient of friction roads, with optimized design parameters. The
   effects of actuator first-order dynamics and transportation delay, which
   come up in practical implementations, were considered. The sliding-mode
   control structure which employs derivative switching function with
   integral sliding surface is originally proposed in this study. It is
   found to produce less chattering and provide more robustness, which
   could not be achieved side by side using former designs.}},

Abstract = {{The specialized application of prestressing the near-surface mounted

   reinforced concrete (RC) structures combines the benefits of the FRP
   reinforcement with the advantages associated with external prestressing.
   By applying a prestress to the NSM FRP the material is used more
   efficiently since a greater portion of its tensile capacity is employed.
   This paper presents a comprehensive review on the performance of RC
   members strengthened using prestressed NSM FRP reinforcement. Several
   techniques and anchorage systems developed to prestress the NSM FRP are
   presented. The static flexural and fatigue performance of RC beams
   strengthened using prestressed NSM FRP in comparison to non-prestressed
   NSM is presented. Research on the long-term performance under

Abstract = {{Kinetics of isothermal crystallization of hydrogenated castor oil in
   water emulsions exhibiting multiple crystal morphologies have been
   studied experimentally by DSC and polarized light microscopy. The
   induction time of nucleation increases with the increase of the
   isothermal temperature under which crystallization occurred. Crystal
   growth has been observed by microscopy showing that both crystal
   morphologies, fibers and rosettes, grow linearly at the initial stage of
   crystallization and then slow down to reach a plateau value. The Avrami
   model, which has been widely used in kinetics studies of triacylglycerol
   systems, was employed to fit experimental results at different
   isothermal temperatures. It was found that experimental trends could be
   captured by introducing the volume fraction of each type of morphology
   into three-dimensional and one-dimensional full Avrami models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, new constructions of the binary sequence families of
   period q - 1 with large family size and low correlation, derived from
   multiplicative characters of finite fields for odd prime powers, are
   proposed. For m >= 2, the maximum correlation magnitudes of new sequence
   families S-m are bounded by (2m - 2)root q + 2m + 2, and the family
   sizes of S-m are given by q - 1 for m = 2, 2(q - 1) - 1 for m = 3, (q(2)
   - 1)q(m-4/2) for m even, m > 2, and 2(q - 1)q(m-3/2) for m odd, m > 3.
   It is shown that the known binary Sidel'nikov-based sequence families
   are equivalent to the new constructions for the case m = 2.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with enhancement of spectrum utilization by using
   polarization enabled two-phase cooperation between primary users (PUs)
   and secondary users (SUs) in cooperative cognitive radio networking

   concurrent transmissions of multiple independent signals of PUs and SUs,
   and interference suppression via polarization zero-forcing and
   polarization filtering to obtain significant performance improvement. To
   maximize a weighted sum throughput of PUs and SUs under energy/power
   constraints, the problem is formulated and solved based on a
   multi-timescale Markov decision process, and two modified backward
   iteration algorithms are devised to attain the optimal policies.
   Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed CCRN
   framework, showing that the obtained policy outperforms both greedy and

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks, it is often impossible to have regular
   information exchange between PUs and SUs. This implies that SUs are
   unable to obtain up-to-date channel information at the PU side, and will
   face technical challenges in accurately controlling their interference
   to PUs through power control. In this paper, we assume that SUs can
   estimate the channel information in the reciprocal channel, and study
   the channel uncertainty due to estimation errors and its impact on SUs'
   performance and PUs' protection. Specifically, we model the uncertain
   channel gain to be a random variable following a state-dependent
   distribution function, and propose a power control mechanism that is
   robust against the channel uncertainty. We study the robust power
   control in two cases. In the first case, all SU transmitters (e. g.,
   secondary base stations) transmit with the same power, while in the
   second case each SU transmitter may choose distinct transmit power based
   on its own preference. In either case, we formulate the power control
   problem as a chance constrained robust optimization problem and design
   an iterative algorithm, respectively. Numerical results show that our
   robust power control mechanism can provide better protection for PUs
   than existing methods that overlook the uncertainty in channel
   measurement, and the second-case power control generally provides better
   Quality of Service (QoS) for SUs than that in the first case.}},

Title = {{Cooperative Spectrum Access Towards Secure Information Transfer for CRNs}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), secure information transfer is of
   paramount importance for primary users (PUs), while secondary users
   (SUs) mainly desire to ease the starvation for transmission
   opportunities. To meet such different requirements, cooperation between
   PUs and SUs can be leveraged and therefore create a win-win situation.
   In this paper, we investigate cooperative spectrum access for CRNs,
   which targets to improve the secure transmission of PUs via cooperating
   SUs that would be incented by certain transmission opportunities. Two
   types of cooperation schemes are proposed, whereby the PU either
   cooperates with two individual SUs or a cluster of SUs, which are
   referred to as relay-jammer (R-J) scheme and cluster-beamforming (C-B)
   scheme, respectively. In R-J scheme, two individual SUs act as a relay
   and a friendly jammer to improve the PU's secrecy; In return, the PU
   allocates a fraction of access time for the SUs' transmission. To
   achieve the maximum secrecy rate, joint time and power allocation is
   considered. Particularly, the cooperating relay and jammer determine the
   optimal transmission power, while the PU decides the optimal time
   allocation strategy. In C-B scheme, the PU cooperates with a cluster of
   SUs to enhance the secrecy of the primary link via collaborative
   beamforming, where three different approaches are proposed for the
   scenarios with one eavesdropper, with multiple eavesdroppers, and
   without eavesdroppers' information, respectively. To maximize the
   secrecy rate, the weight selection and time allocation are also studied.
   Simulation results are given to validate the proposed schemes and
   demonstrate that the PU can significantly enhance the secrecy through
   cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an efficient data-driven particle probability
   hypothesis density (PHD) filter for real-time multitarget tracking of
   nonlinear/non-Gaussian system in dense clutter environment. In specific,
   the input measurements are first classified into two sets, namely
   survival measurements and spontaneous birth measurements, after
   eliminating clutters by using existing historic state data of targets.
   Since most clutters do not participate in the complex weight computation
   of particle PHD filter, better real-time performance can be achieved.
   The tracking performance is also improved because the survival
   measurements are used for survival targets and the spontaneous birth
   measurements are used for spontaneous birth targets, resulting in less
   interference from each other and from clutters. Extensive simulations
   validate the improvement of both the real-time performance and tracking
   performance of the proposed data-driven particle PHD filter in
   comparison with the traditional particle PHD filter.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a hyperchaotic system is presented as the chaotic carrier
   to encrypt information in secure communication. The sensitivity to the
   system parameters and delay of the hyperchaotic system, i.e., its
   chaotic degree indicated by the number of positive Lyapunov exponents,
   increases with its system parameter and delay, guaranteeing a large
   enough key space when one selects its system parameter and delay as the
   secret key. Furthermore, we develop an intermittent impulsive
   synchronization scheme (IISS) to achieve chaos synchronization, a
   crucial process in chaos-based secure communication. In our scheme,
   impulsive control is only activated in the control windows, not during
   the whole time, which breaks through the limitation on the upper bound
   of the impulsive intervals in the general impulsive synchronization
   scheme (GISS). Specifically, IISS improves the security of the
   chaos-based secure communication scheme since the encrypted signal
   (cipher) is transmitted in the free windows, different from the
   synchronization signal in the control windows. Finally, a secure
   communication scheme employing our hyperchaotic system and IISS
   technique is proposed and numerical results are given to demonstrate the
   performance of this scheme.}},

   compiled ARMv4 binaries, constructs a timing-requirements-aware

   rewrites the binaries with the allocation. We evaluate our approach
   using a modified version of the Malardalen benchmarks to show the

Abstract = {{This paper studies how to select a path with the minimum expected
   end-to-end delay (EED) in a multiradio multichannel (MR-MC) wireless
   mesh network. While the existing studies mainly focus on the packet
   transmission delay due to medium access control (MAC), our new EED
   metric further takes into account the queuing delay at the MAC layer. In
   particular, in the MR-MC context, we develop a generic iterative
   approach to compute the multiradio achievable bandwidth (MRAB) for a
   path, taking the impact of inter-/intraflow interference and
   space/channel diversity into consideration. The MRAB is then combined
   with the EED to form the metric weighted end-to-end delay (WEED). As a
   byproduct of MRAB, a channel diversity coefficient is defined to
   quantitatively represent the channel diversity for a given path.
   Moreover, we design and implement a distributed WEED-based routing
   protocol for MR-MC wireless networks by extending the well-known AODV
   protocol. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   performance of EED/WEED-based routing, with comparison to some existing
   well-known routing metrics.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of physical and chemical properties on the performance of
   both positive and negative electrodes is studied for lithium-ion
   (Li-ion) batteries. These properties include the lithium diffusivity in
   the active electrode material, the electrical conductivity of the
   electrode, and the reaction rate constant at electrode active sites. The
   specific energy and power of the cells are determined at various
   discharge rates for electrodes with different properties. In addition,
   this study is conducted across various cell design cases. The results
   reveal that at moderate discharge rates, lithium diffusivity in the
   active negative-electrode material has the highest impact on cell
   performance. The specific energy and power of the cell are improved
   similar to 11\% by increasing the lithium diffusivity in the active
   negative-electrode material by one order of magnitude. Around 4\%
   improvement in the cell performance is achieved by increasing the
   reaction rate constant at the active sites of either electrodes by one

Title = {{Mitigation of Vortex-Induced Vibrations of a Pivoted Circular Cylinder
   Using an Adaptive Pendulum Tuned-Mass Damper}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A novel adaptive pendulum tuned-mass damper (TMD) was integrated with a
   two degree-of-freedom (DOF) cylindrical structure in order to control
   vortex-induced vibrations of the structure. The natural frequency of the
   TMD was adjusted autonomously in order to control the vortex-induced
   vibrations. The experiments were performed at a constant Reynolds number
   of 2100 and for four reduced velocities, 4.18, 5.44, 6.00, and 6.48. Two
   TMD damping ratios, 0 and 0.24, were investigated for a constant TMD
   mass ratio of 0.087. The results demonstrate that tuning the natural
   frequency of the TMD to the natural frequency of the structure decreases
   the amplitudes of transverse and streamwise vibrations of the structure
   significantly. Specifically, the transverse amplitudes of vibrations are
   decreased by a factor of ten and streamwise amplitudes of vibrations are
   decreased by a factor of three. Depending on the value of the TMD
   damping ratio, the frequency of transverse vibrations is either
   characterized by the natural frequency of the structure or by two other
   fundamental frequencies, one higher and the other lower than the natural
   frequency of the structure. The results demonstrate that, independent of
   the TMD damping and tuning frequency ratios, the frequency of streamwise
   vibrations matches that of the transverse vibrations in the
   synchronization region, and the cylinder traces elliptic trajectories. A
   mathematical model is proposed to gain insight into the frequency
   response of the structure and fluid-structure interactions. The model
   shows that, for low TMD damping ratios, the frequency response of the
   structure equipped with the TMD is characterized by two fundamental
   frequencies; whereas, for relatively high TMD damping ratios, the
   frequency response of the structure is characterized by a single
   frequency, i.e., the natural frequency. In both cases, the fluid forcing
   within the synchronization region is linked to the fundamental
   frequency/frequencies of the structure. Thus, the classical definition
   of synchronization applies to multiple DOF structures undergoing
   vortex-induced vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{Case studies of energy loss over bed forms in gravel-bed rivers are
   needed to determine local loss coefficients for modeling and design. In
   this study, an intense field campaign in two rivers is used to determine
   energy loss and calculate local energy loss coefficients (Ke) for
   riffle-pool units. Velocity head, water surface elevations, and energy
   coefficients () are determined at up to eight cross sections at each
   site over a range of discharges including, at one site, the bank-full
   discharge. The water surface and energy grade line are relatively flat
   as flow enters the pool and relatively steep as flow leaves the pool. In
   both watercourses and at all discharges, is higher in pools
   (i.e.,velocity is more heterogeneous) and lower in riffles (velocity is
   more homogeneous). In a short but deep pool forced by a large fallen
   tree (Moras Creek), Ke=1.7-2.0. This high value is explained by a pool
   obstruction that results in a series of gradual and sudden flow
   transitions. In a long and relatively shallow pool (Ditton River), Ke
   approximate to 0. This low value is explained by the uncertainty in
   resistance partitioning and the variability of models for skin friction.
   Future research should determine the range of local energy loss
   coefficients in natural and constructed bed forms in rivers.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{619-634}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A dense, solid particle flow is numerically studied at a mesoscale level
   for a cylindrical shock tube problem. The shock tube consists of a
   central high pressure gas driver section and an annular solid powder bed
   with air in void regions as a driven section with its far end adjacent
   to ambient air. Simulations are conducted to explore the fundamental
   phenomena, causing clustering of particles and formation of coherent
   particle jet structures in such a dense solid flow. The influence of a
   range of parameters is investigated, including driver pressure, particle
   morphology, particle distribution and powder bed configuration. The
   results indicate that the physical mechanism responsible for this
   phenomenon is twofold: the driver gas jet flow induced by the shock wave
   as it passes through the initial gaps between the particles in the
   innermost layer of the powder bed, and the chaining of solid particles
   by inelastic collision. The particle jet forming time is determined as
   the time when the motion of the outermost particle layer of the powder
   bed is first detected. The maximum number of particle jets is bounded by
   the total number of particles in the innermost layer of the powder bed.
   The number of particle jets is mainly a function of the number of
   particles in the innermost layer and the mass ratio of the powder bed to
   the gas in the driver section, or the ratio of powder bed mass (in
   dimensionless form) to the pressure ratio between the driver and driven
   sections.}},

Abstract = {{We study the degradation mechanisms of ultraviolet (UV) organic
   photodetectors (OPDs). Contrary to expectations, we determine that the
   bulk of the organic layers in UV OPDs is stable under prolonged UV
   irradiation, showing no detectable changes in photophysical
   characteristics such as photoluminescence yield and exciton lifetime and
   thus not contributing to the observed degradation behavior of UV OPDs.
   However, the results show that the organic/electrode interfaces in UV
   OPDs, including indium tin oxide (ITO)/organic and organic/metal ones,
   are susceptible to UV irradiation, leading to a deterioration in both
   charge injection and extraction across the interfaces. The degradation
   of the organic/electrode interfaces in UV OPDs is essentially induced by
   UV-generated excitons in their vicinity and may be responsible for
   nearly 100\% of the photo-current loss of UV OPDs. Approaches for
   improving the photo-stability of organic/electrode interfaces, and thus
   the lifetime of UV OPDs, are also investigated. We demonstrate that the
   use of thin (similar to 0.5 nm) interfacial layers such as lithium
   acetylacetonate at organic/metal interfaces can significantly reduce the
   interfacial degradation, and the use of appropriate hole transport
   materials such as N,N'-bis (naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl) benzidine
   at ITO/organic interfaces can greatly improve the interfacial
   photo-stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel multi-copy routing protocol, called
   predict and forward (PF), for delay tolerant networks, which aims to
   explore the possibility of using mobile nodes as message carriers for
   end-to-end delivery of the messages. With PF, the message forwarding
   decision is made by manipulating the probability distribution of future
   inter-contact and contact durations based on the network status,
   including wireless link condition and nodal buffer availability. In
   particular, PF is based on the observations that the node mobility
   behavior is semi-deterministic and could be predicted once there is
   sufficient mobility history information. We implemented the proposed
   protocol and compared it with a number of existing encounter-based
   routing approaches in terms of delivery delay, delivery ratio, and the
   number of transmissions required for message delivery. The simulation
   results show that PF outperforms all the counterpart multi-copy

Abstract = {{Online learning has become increasingly popular on handling massive

   centralized learner to store data and update parameters. In this paper,
   we consider online learning with distributed data sources. The
   autonomous learners update local parameters based on local data sources
   and periodically exchange information with a small subset of neighbors
   in a communication network. We derive the regret bound for strongly
   convex functions that generalizes the work by Ram et al. {[}1] for
   convex functions. More importantly, we show that our algorithm has
   intrinsic privacy-preserving properties, and we prove the sufficient and
   necessary conditions for privacy preservation in the network. These
   conditions imply that for networks with greater-than-one connectivity, a
   malicious learner cannot reconstruct the subgradients (and sensitive raw
   data) of other learners, which makes our algorithm appealing in
   privacy-sensitive applications.}},

Abstract = {{Human action recognition in video is important in many computer vision
   applications such as automated surveillance. Human actions can be
   compactly encoded using a sparse set of local spatio-temporal salient
   features at different scales. The existing bottom-up methods construct a
   single dictionary of action primitives from the joint features of all
   scales and hence, a single action representation. This representation
   cannot fully exploit the complementary characteristics of the motions
   across different scales. To address this problem, we introduce the
   concept of learning multiple dictionaries of action primitives at
   different resolutions and consequently, multiple scale-specific
   representations for a given video sample. Using a decoupled fusion of
   multiple representations, we improved the human classification accuracy
   of realistic benchmark databases by about 5\%, compared with the
   state-of-the art methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of statistical dimensionality reduction
   (DR) techniques for discriminative low dimensional embedding to enable
   affective movement recognition. Human movements are defined by a
   collection of sequential observations (time-series features)
   representing body joint angle or joint Cartesian trajectories. In this
   work, these sequential observations are modelled as temporal functions
   using B-spline basis function expansion, and dimensionality reduction
   techniques are adapted to enable application to the functional
   observations. The DR techniques adapted here are: Fischer discriminant
   analysis (FDA), supervised principal component analysis (PCA), and
   Isomap. These functional DR techniques along with functional PCA are
   applied on affective human movement datasets and their performance is
   evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation with a one-nearest
   neighbour classifier in the corresponding low-dimensional subspaces. The
   results show that functional supervised PCA outperforms the other DR
   techniques examined in terms of classification accuracy and time
   resource requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports a novel polysulfone (PSf) membrane blended with a
   ternary copolymer having capsaicin-mimic moieties as an anti-fouling and
   anti-bacterial agent. This copolymer, P(H-M-A), was synthesized from
   N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzyl) acrylamide (HMBA), methyl methacrylate
   (MMA) and acrylic acid (AAc) by free radical polymerization. The effects
   of the P(H-M-A) content in the membrane casting solution on the
   structure and ultrafiltration performance of the membrane were
   investigated. It was shown that incorporating a small quantity of
   P(H-M-A) into the membrane improved the permeate flux and rejection when
   tested with a model humic acid (HA) solution and actual raw seawater.
   The P(H-M-A)-containing membranes exhibited excellent anti-bacterial
   activity, which was attributed to the capsaicin-mimic moieties, and
   their anti-fouling characteristics were demonstrated with fouling and
   cleaning experiments. This work suggests that P(H-M-A) is a potential
   hydrophilic antifouling and anti-bacterial agent for use in membranes

Title = {{Binding mechanism of sulfur and dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile in
   sulfur/polymer composite cathode}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{61-69}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A composite consisting of sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile is one
   of the most promising cathode materials for use in rechargeable
   lithium-sulfur batteries. However, the reported sulfur contents have
   been low, less than 50 wt\%, which compromise the intrinsic high
   specific capacity and energy of elemental sulfur and hence decrease
   significantly the specific energy of the composite. To identify the
   potential to further increase the sulfur content, we elucidate the
   binding mechanism of sulfur and polyacrylonitrile in their composite.
   The heat treatment experiments at varying timespans with excess sulfur
   showed a constancy of sulfur content after a critical length of
   timespan, indicating the saturation of sulfur in the structure of
   dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile. Based on molecular structure and size
   consideration, it is proposed that the binding involves the formation of
   an 8 membered ring of sulfur embedded between 4 heterocyclic rings of
   dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile. From this model and experimental
   results, we show that there exists an upper limit of sulfur content in
   the sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile composite at 56 wt\%. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{A method for synthesizing nano-sulfur/polypyrrole/graphene nanosheet
   (nano-S/PPy/GNS) ternary composite with a dual-layered structure is
   described. By taking advantage of both capillary force driven
   self-assembly of polypyrrole on graphene nanosheets and adhesion ability
   of polypyrrole to sulfur, we develop a stable and ordered nano-S/PPy/GNS
   composite cathode for lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries. The high
   dispersion of nanoscopic sulfur on the surface of PPy/GNS composite and
   good electrical conductivity of GNS seems to benefit the sulfur
   utilization and the reactivity of the composite. Furthermore, PPy plays
   an important role in retarding diffusion of polysulfides out of the
   electrode. The resulting nano-S/PPy/GNS composite cathode delivers a
   high initial capacity of 1415.7 mAh g(-1), remaining a reversible
   capacity of 641.5 mAh g(-1) after 40 cycles at 0.1 C rate. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this study, an easy to fabricate and low-cost, resistive-type CO2 gas
   sensor made of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and branched
   polyethylenimine (BPEI) layers was fabricated on an interdigitated
   electrode. The PEDOT film was made by in situ polymerization and the
   BPEI layer was subsequently drop-coated on top of the PEDOT film. Upon
   exposure to 1000 ppm CO2 at 95\% relatively humidity (RH) of the
   BPEI-PEDOT composite sensor, the synergistic effect of BPEI on CO2
   sensing was subsequently investigated. The sensors showed no response
   (i.e. \% of conductivity increase) if the sensor film was only made of a
   PEDOT layer without any BPEI. However, the response increased
   significantly to a value of 3.25\% upon the addition of a layer of BPEI.
   The sensors also showed no obvious decay in the sensing response during
   repeated usages, providing the reusability of the technique for CO2
   detection. As for sensor's selectivity, the sensors showed higher
   response for CO2 than for O-2. Originally, the sensor showed a long
   recovery time of nearly 1 h. However, the long recovery time can be
   significantly shortened to approximately 10 min by heating the sensors
   at higher temperature for CO2 desorption. Thus, this easy and
   inexpensive fabrication process demonstrated that the sensor might have
   characteristics sufficient for real-world CO2 detection. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this study, flower-shaped NiO/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid structures were
   synthesized by a solvothermal process. The microstructure, surface
   morphology, and surface area of the synthesized materials were
   characterized by XRD, SEM, and BET. It was discovered that this unique
   hybrid structure exhibits outstanding capacitive performance in basic
   electrolyte. From galvanostatic charge-discharge test, the hybrid
   composite itself demonstrates a solid capacitance value of 707 F/g at 2
   A/g and 474 F/g at a high discharge rate of 10 A/g. In order to further
   improve the performance and the capacitance retention with enhanced
   current density, carbon nanomaterials were used as supports for the
   NiO/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid. These carbon nanomaterials are believed to
   form conductive network around NiO/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) flowers. The effects
   of 4 different carbon nanomaterial supports, including carbon black,
   carbon nanotubes, and graphene, were thoroughly investigated, and
   specifically the addition of single-walled carbon nanotubes to the
   composite significantly enhanced the performance to 810 F/g at a high
   current discharge of 10 A/g. Moreover, this carbon supported hybrid
   composite exhibits an impressive specific power density of 7200 W/kg and

   Cognitive radio functionality can be implemented in femtocell networks

Title = {{OUR: Optimal Update-based Replacement policy for cache in wireless data
   access networks with optimal effective hits and bandwidth requirements}},

Abstract = {{In mobile wireless data access networks, remote data access is expensive
   in terms of bandwidth consumption. An efficient caching scheme can
   reduce the amount of data transmission, hence, bandwidth consumption.
   However, an update event makes the associated cached data objects
   obsolete and useless for many applications. Data access frequency and
   update play a crucial role in deciding which data objects should be
   cached. Seemingly, frequently accessed but infrequently updated objects
   should have higher preference while preserving in the cache. Other
   objects should have lower preference or be evicted, or should not be
   cached at all, to accommodate higher-preference objects. In this paper,
   we proposed Optimal Update-based Replacement, a replacement or eviction
   scheme, for cache management in wireless data networks. To facilitate
   the replacement scheme, we also presented two enhanced cache access
   schemes, named Update-based Poll-Each-Read and Update-based Call-Back.
   The proposed cache management schemes were supported with strong
   theoretical analysis. Both analysis and extensive simulation results
   were given to demonstrate that the proposed schemes guarantee optimal
   amount of data transmission by increasing the number of effective hits
   and outperform the popular Least Frequently Used scheme in terms of both
   effective hits and communication cost. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The paper presents a constitutive model for simulating the high
   strain-rate behavior of sands. Based on the concepts of critical-state
   soil mechanics, the bounding surface plasticity theory and the
   overstress theory of viscoplasticity, the constitutive model simulates
   the high strain-rate behavior of sands under uniaxial, triaxial and
   multi-axial loading conditions. The model parameters are determined for
   Ottawa and Fontainebleau sands, and the performance of the model under
   extreme transient loading conditions is demonstrated through simulations
   of split Hopkinson pressure bar tests up to a strain rate of 2000/s. The
   constitutive model is implemented in a finite-element analysis software
   Abaqus to analyze underground tunnels in sandy soil subjected to
   internal blast loads. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the
   effect of relative density and type of sand and of the depth of tunnel
   on the variation of stresses and deformations in the soil adjacent to
   the tunnels. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The change of the quasiparticle density of states in a superconductor

   magnetoresistance (TMR) as large as 36\% is obtained, resulting from the
   conductance variation due to spin-split quasiparticle tunneling, and
   only occurs in the superconducting state. Our results show that in
   addition to the naturally existent spin imbalance in ferromagnets (upon
   which conventional TMR is obtained), we can manipulate tunnel
   conductance by tailoring spin dependent density of states with
   interfacial exchange fields, and even with a tunnel junction with both

Abstract = {{The hybrid use of generalized similarity analysis (GSA) with intelligent

   The GSA combines dimensional, inspectional, and order-of-magnitude
   methods to derive the complete set of a minimum number of high-level
   designable variables. Thus, the input variable space is reduced, and
   this in turn reduces the number of input vectors needed for model
   development. The generated concise fuzzy logic neural network leads to a
   shorter running time, and a greater accuracy. This approach is
   multidisciplinary and is demonstrated for three different applications:
   injectivity in an oil reservoir, oil reservoir characterization, and a
   driven distributed transmission line with its load. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel surface impedance model is developed to analyze plasmonic

   developed surface impedance boundary condition is incorporated in the
   mixed potential integral equation formulation of the problem, and the
   method of moments is employed to find the unknown surface current
   distributions on the strips carrying LR-SPP. In other words, in this
   method, the volumetric currents flowing inside the metal are substituted
   by a surface current model flowing on an infinitely thin strip
   characterized by the developed surface impedance model. This procedure
   reduces the number of unknowns significantly, in this way increasing the
   speed of simulation. Validity and accuracy of the proposed model are
   demonstrated by analyzing three popular LR-SPP circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon corrosion and Pt dissolution are the two major catalyst layer
   degradation modes in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).
   One of the challenges in employing accelerated stress tests (ASTs) in
   PEMFCs is to relate the performance loss under a given set of conditions
   to a specific life-limiting factor. No well-established method is
   available to de-convolute the contributions to performance loss arising
   from carbon corrosion and Pt dissolution. In this study, a method to
   overcome this deficiency is demonstrated for three membrane electrode
   assemblies (MEAs) with different cathode Pt loading levels between 0.25
   and 0.5 mg cm(-2) and structures through the use of various ASTs
   favoring carbon corrosion, Pt dissolution or mixed carbon corrosion-Pt
   dissolution modes. A diagnostic indicator or `fingerprint' for the
   performance loss due to carbon corrosion in the cathode layer (CCL) is
   first obtained for each MEA. This fingerprint is then applied to the
   performance loss measured during the mixed mode AST to deconvolute the
   contribution from Pt dissolution. Finally, this estimate of the
   contribution from Pt dissolution is compared to the performance loss
   measured directly during the AST in which Pt dissolution is dominant.
   The effectiveness of this approach is examined and its limitations are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional sub-wavelength silicon grating with enhanced Raman
   response is demonstrated. Furthermore, the polarization response of the
   Raman is investigated. This study shows that, contrary to intuitive
   expectation, the Raman intensity can be similar for both input
   polarizations: parallel and perpendicular to the ruling direction. This
   similarity is achieved due to inter-ridge coupling and polarization
   dependent characteristics of the grating. Through optimization of the
   ridge width and spacing, enhanced Raman intensity is realized in both
   polarizations, simultaneously. The results are further understood using
   a finite difference time domain model based on the light interaction

Abstract = {{Highly enhanced Raman scattering of graphene on a plasmonic
   nano-structure platform is demonstrated. The plasmonic platform consists
   of silver nano-structures in a periodic array on top of a gold mirror.
   The gold mirror is used to move the hot spot to the top surface of the
   silver nano-structures, where the graphene is located. Two different
   nano-structures, ring and crescent, are studied. The actual Raman
   intensity is enhanced by a factor of 890 for the G-peak of graphene on
   crescents as compared to graphene on a silicon dioxide surface. The
   highest enhancement is observed for the G-peak as compared to the
   2D-peak. The results are quantitatively well-matched with a theoretical
   model using an overlap integral of incident electric field intensities
   with the corresponding intensities of Raman signals at the G-and
   2D-peaks. The interaction of light with nano-structures is simulated
   using finite element method (FEM).}},

Abstract = {{Proton conduction is essential in biological systems. Oxidative
   phosphorylation in mitochondria, proton pumping in bacteriorhodopsin,
   and uncoupling membrane potentials by the antibiotic Gramicidin are
   examples. In these systems, H+ hop along chains of hydrogen bonds
   between water molecules and hydrophilic residues - proton wires. These
   wires also support the transport of OH- as proton holes. Discriminating
   between H+ and OH- transport has been elusive. Here, H+ and OH-
   transport is achieved in polysaccharide-based proton wires and devices.
   AH(+)-OH- junction with rectifying behaviour and H+-type and OH--type
   complementary field effect transistors are demonstrated. We describe
   these devices with a model that relates H+ and OH- to electron and hole
   transport in semiconductors. In turn, the model developed for these
   devices may provide additional insights into proton conduction in
   biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a probabilistic planning approach is proposed for
   optimally allocating different types of distributed generator (DG) (i.e.
   wind-based DG, solar DG and non-renewable DG) into a harmonic polluted
   distribution system so as to minimise the annual energy losses and
   reduce the harmonic distortions. The proposed planning methodology takes
   into consideration the intermittent nature of the renewable resources,
   load profile and the technical constraints of the system. The objective
   function is the total system annual power loss. The constraints include
   voltage limits at different buses (slack and load buses) of the system,
   feeder capacity, total harmonic distortion (THD) limits and maximum
   penetration limit of DG units. The optimisation process is achieved
   using the genetic algorithm optimisation method. This proposed approach
   has been applied to a typical rural distribution system with different
   scenarios including all possible combinations of distributed energy
   resources. The simulation results using Matlab programming environment
   show that significant reductions in the energy losses and THD are
   achieved for all the proposed scenarios. Also simulation results depict
   that the proposed method is robust and computationally efficient.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Many applications require the sink to compute a function of the data
   collected by the sensors. Instead of sending all the data to the sink,
   the intermediate nodes could process the data they receive to
   significantly reduce the volume of traffic transmitted: this is known as
   in-network computation. Instead of focusing on asymptotic results for
   large networks as is the current practice, we are interested in
   explicitly computing the maximum achievable throughput of a given
   network when the sink is interested in the first statistical moments of
   the collected data. Here, the kth statistical moment is defined as the
   expectation of the kth power of the data. Flow models have been
   routinely used in multihop wireless networks when there is no in-network
   computation, and they are typically tractable for relatively large
   networks. However, deriving such models is not obvious when in-network
   computation is allowed. We develop a discrete-time model for the
   real-time network operation and perform two transformations to obtain a
   flow model that keeps the essence of in-network computation. This gives
   an upper bound on the maximum achievable throughput. To show its
   tightness, we derive a numerical lower bound by computing a solution to
   the discrete-time model based on the solution to the flow model. This
   lower bound turns out to be close to the upper bound, proving that the
   flow model is an excellent approximation to the discrete-time model. We
   then provide several engineering insights on these networks.}},

Abstract = {{Diarrhea, the second leading cause of child morbidity and mortality, can
   have detrimental effects in the physical and cognitive development of
   children in developing countries. Health interventions (e.g., increased
   access to health services and safe water) designed to address this
   problem are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. In this
   paper, we present a tool for understanding the complex relationship
   between water and public health in rural areas of a developing country.
   A spatial and temporal agent-based model (ABM) was developed to simulate
   the current water, sanitation, and health status in two villages in
   Limpopo Province, South Africa. The model was calibrated using empirical
   data and published sources. It was used to simulate the effects of poor
   water quality on the frequency of diarrheal episodes in children, and
   consequently on child development. Preliminary simulation results show
   that at the current total coliform levels in the water sources of the
   studied villages, children are expected to experience stunting by as
   much as -1.0 standard deviations from the World Health Organization
   height norms. With minor modifications, the calibrated ABM can be used
   to design and evaluate intervention strategies for improving child
   health in these villages. The model can also be applied to other regions
   worldwide that face the same environmental challenges and conditions as
   the studied villages.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces radiation exposure but
   decreases signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and diagnostic capabilities. Noise
   compensation can improve SNR so low-dose CT can provide valuable
   information for diagnosis without risking patient radiation exposure. In
   this study, a novel noise-compensated CT reconstruction method that uses
   spatially adaptive Monte-Carlo sampling to produce noise-compensated
   reconstructions is investigated. By adapting to local noise statistics,
   a non-parametric estimation of the noise-free image is computed that
   successfully handles non-stationary noise found in low-dose CT images.
   Using phantom and real low-dose CT images, effective noise suppression
   is shown to be accomplished while maintaining structures and details.

Abstract = {{\textbackslash{} Highly mesoporous lithium titanate hierarchical
   microspheres (LTO-HS) consisting of nanosized octahedron-like crystals
   were innovatively designed as high performance and safe anode materials
   for lithium ion battery applications. This unique structural control
   allows us to capitalize on the exemplary surface areas (electrolyte
   contact) and short Li-ion diffusion path lengths of nanosized particles,
   while overcoming the challenge of low power tapping density by
   integrating them into microsized spheres. A thin carbon coating was
   applied on the surface of LTO-HS (C-LTO-HS) in order to overcome the
   inherently limited electronic conductivity of these oxide materials.
   Moreover, this coating technique was found to induce the formation of
   some anatase TiO2, resulting in uniquely structured anode materials with
   active multi-component duality. Notably, the C-LTO-HS composite
   electrode delivers a remarkable capacity of over 230 mA hg(-1) when
   discharged at 0.2 C, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity
   of pure Li4Ti5O12 (175 mA h g(-1)) and ascribed to the existence of
   anatase TiO2 (330 mA hg(-1)) in the C-LTO-HS structure. Furthermore,
   this electrode yielded excellent cycling and rate capabilities of about
   120 mA hg(-1) (compared to 90 mA hg(-1) for LTO-HS) at a current density
   of 10 C for up to 100 cycles. These unique mesoporous spheres with
   deliberately controlled nanostructure arrangements show significant
   promise as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, fabricated by a
   simplistic two step hydrothermal procedures, and capable of providing
   high volumetric energy density and long cycle life. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate spectrum trading via auction approach for
   exclusive usage spectrum access model in cognitive radio networks. We
   consider a realistic valuation function which depends on channel
   capacity, delay sensitive and delay-insensitive data traffics of
   secondary users (SUs), and propose an efficient concurrent
   Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism for non-identical channel
   allocation among r-minded bidders in two different cases. In the first
   case, the SUs are r-minded but they can submit bid only for single
   channels. In the second case, the SUs are r-minded and they can submit
   bid for bundles of channels. We show that the first case is solvable in
   polynomial time but in the other one, the problem of determining auction
   outcomes is NP-hard. We propose two sub-optimal methods for solving this
   problem, namely greedy algorithm and randomized rounding linear
   programming (LP) relaxation algorithm. Due to the sub-optimal nature of
   solutions in the second case, VCG mechanism is not truthful anymore and
   the SUs can lie to maximize their utilities. To address this, we propose
   an auction mechanism with limited truthfulness property based on an
   iterative greedy algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of horizontal oscillations of the freestream velocity
   superimposed on a pitch oscillating NACA0012 airfoil were investigated
   using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The SST k-omega model coupled
   with a low-Reynolds number correction was applied for Re approximate to
   10(5), when the airfoil was undergoing dynamic stall. The main parameter
   Phi, the phase difference between the freestream oscillation and the
   airfoil oscillation, was varied from 0 to pi. The Phi variation resulted
   in several times amplitude dynamic loads when Phi <= pi/2 to several
   times damping dynamic loads for Phi > pi/2 where some dynamic stall
   loads were damped even below static stall load values. It was found that
   Phi variation was divided into two main ranges based on the values of
   the unsteady freestream velocity at dynamic stall. The load variation
   also appeared with some differences including the shape of the trailing
   edge vortex sheet before stall, the circulation of the dynamic stall
   vortex pairs, the critical angles, vortex growth time and the secondary
   lift peak location that are discussed in detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{555-563}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recently, metal nanoparticles have been used to generate highly reactive
   free radicals from peroxygens to treat hazardous organic compounds. A
   novel method of treating trichloroethylene (TCE) was applied using
   bimetallic zero valent nanoparticles (BZVNs) and peroxygens. In the
   investigation of nine different BZVNs as activators, the highest TCE
   oxidation was achieved by nano-Pd-Fe-0 and nano-Zn-Fe-0 in the activated
   persulfate system, nano-Co-Fe-0 in the activated peroxymonosulfate
   system, and nano-Ag-Fe-0 in the activated hydrogen peroxide system. In
   all three systems, increasing the dosage of metal nanoparticles and
   peroxygens increased the oxidation of TCE. We also found that BZVNs are
   promising activators for hydrogen peroxide, persulfate, and
   peroxymonosulfate compared to monometallic zero valent nanoparticles.
   For example, the TCE reaction rate constant by nano-Ag-Fe-0 activated
   H2O2 is 9- to 18-fold higher than that for nano-Fe-0 activated H2O2. The
   activated H2O2 system showed a much lower TCE oxidation rate compared to
   either activated persulfate or activated peroxymonosulfate, suggesting
   that a bridged group complex is formed between the activators and H2O2,
   causing a lower TCE oxidation rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   comprises flexible-shaft microelectrodes, neural amplifiers,
   neurostimulators, a digital time-division multiplexer (TDM), a
   micro-controller and a ZigBee wireless transceiver. The system is built
   by parallelizing up to four 0.35 mu m CMOS integrated circuits (each
   having 256 neural amplifiers and 64 neurostimulators) to provide a total
   maximum of 1024 neural amplifiers and 256 neurostimulators. Each bipolar
   neural amplifier features 54 dB-72 dB adjustable gain, 1 Hz-5 kHz
   adjustable bandwidth with an input-referred noise of 7.99 mu V-rms and
   dissipates 12.9 mu W. Each current-mode bipolar neurostimulator
   generates programmable arbitrary-waveform biphasic current in the range
   of 20-250 mu A and dissipates 2.6 mu W in the stand-by mode.

   mm(3)volume. The system features flexible polyimide-based microelectrode
   array design that is not brittle and increases pad packing density. Pad
   nanotexturing by electrodeposition reduces the electrode-tissue
   interface impedance from an average of 2 M Omega to 30 k Omega at 100
   Hz. The rodent headset and the microelectrode array have been
   experimentally validated in vivo in freely moving rats for two months.

   neurostimulation in an acute epilepsy rat model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, Hermite polynomial representation is proposed as an
   alternative way to represent finite fields of characteristic two. We
   show that multiplication in Hermite polynomial representation can be
   achieved with subquadratic space complexity. This representation enables
   us to find binomial or trinomial irreducible polynomials which allows us
   faster modular reduction over binary fields when there is no desirable
   such low weight irreducible polynomial in other representations. We then
   show that the product of two elements in Hermite polynomial
   representation can be performed as Toeplitz matrix-vector product. This
   representation is very interesting for NIST recommended binary field
   GF(2(571)) since there is no ONB for the corresponding extension. This
   representation can be used to obtain more efficient finite field
   arithmetic.}},

Abstract = {{Stimuli-responsive polymer nanoparticles are playing an increasingly
   more important role in drug delivery applications. However, limited
   knowledge has been accumulated about processes which use
   stimuli-responsive polymer nanospheres (matrix nanoparticles whose
   entire mass is solid) to carry and deliver hydrophobic therapeutics in
   aqueous solution. In this research, pyrene was selected as a model
   hydrophobic drug and a pyrene-loaded core-shell structured nanosphere
   named poly(DEAEMA)-poly(PEGMA) was designed as a drug carrier where
   DEAEMA and PEGMA represent 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and
   poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate, respectively. The pyrene-loaded
   core-shell nanospheres were prepared via an in situ two-step semibatch
   emulsion polymerization method. The particle size of the core-shell
   nanosphere can be well controlled through adjusting the level of
   surfactant used in the polymerization where an average particle diameter
   of below 100 nm was readily achieved. The surfactant was removed via a
   dialysis operation after polymerization. Egg lecithin vesicles
   (liposome) were prepared to mimic the membrane of a cell and to receive
   the released pyrene from the nanosphere carriers. The in vitro release
   profiles of pyrene toward different pH liposome vesicles were recorded
   as a function of time at 37 degrees C. It was found that release of
   pyrene from the core-shell polymer matrix can be triggered by a change
   in the environmental pH. In particular the pyrene-loaded nanospheres are
   capable of responding to a narrow window of pH change from pH=5, 6, to 7
   and can achieve a significant pyrene release of above 80\% within 90 h.
   The rate of release increased with a decrease in pH. A first-order
   kinetic model was proposed to describe the rate of release with respect
   to the concentration of pyrene in the polymer matrix. The first-order
   rate constant of release k was thus determined as 0.049 h(-1) for pH=5;
   0.043 h(-1) for pH=6; and 0.035 h(-1) for pH=7 at 37 degrees C. The
   release of pyrene was considered to follow a diffusion-controlled
   mechanism. The synthesis and encapsulation process developed herein
   provides a new approach to prepare smart nanoparticles for efficient
   delivery of hydrophobic drugs. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Abstract = {{Since vehicular safety applications require periodic dissemination of
   status and emergency messages, contention-based medium-access-control
   (MAC) protocols such as IEEE 802.11p have problems in predictability,
   fairness, low throughput, latency, and high collision rate, particularly
   in high-density networks. Therefore, a distributed multichannel and
   mobility-aware cluster-based MAC (DMMAC) protocol is proposed. Through
   channel scheduling and an adaptive learning mechanism integrated within
   the fuzzy-logic inference system (FIS), vehicles organize themselves
   into more stable and nonoverlapped clusters. Each cluster will use a
   different subchannel from its neighbors in a distributed manner to
   eliminate the hidden terminal problem. Increasing the system's
   reliability, reducing the time delay for vehicular safety applications,
   and efficiently clustering vehicles in highly dynamic and dense networks
   in a distributed manner are the main contributions of the proposed MAC
   protocol. The reliability and connectivity of DMMAC are analyzed in
   terms of the average cluster size, the communication range within the
   cluster and between cluster heads (CHs), and the lifetime of a path.
   Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can support traffic
   safety and increase vehicular ad hoc networks' (VANETs) efficiency,
   reliability, and stability of the cluster topology by increasing the
   CH's lifetime and the dwell time of its members.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware call admission control
   (MA-CAC) algorithm with a handoff queue (HQ) in mobile hotspots, where
   different admission control policies are employed, depending on the
   vehicle mobility. Specifically, when a vehicle is static, a handoff
   priority scheme with guard channels is studied to protect vehicular
   handoff users because handoff users may get on the vehicle. In addition,
   an HQ is examined during stopping to further accept handoff users. On
   the other hand, for a moving vehicle, no guard channels for handoff
   users are allocated to maximize channel utilization. By means of Markov
   chains, we evaluate MA-CAC with an HQ in terms of new-call blocking
   probability (NCBP), handoff-call dropping probability (HCDP),
   handoff-call waiting time in the HQ, and channel utilization. Analytical
   and simulation results demonstrate that MA-CAC with an HQ can lower both
   the HCDP and the NCBP while maintaining high channel utilization.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, simulations are performed in order to study a
   turbulent premixed flame stabilised behind a bluff body burner.
   Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is the combustion model adopted
   for this purpose and it is coupled with a trajectory gene- rated
   low-dimensional manifold method for chemistry reduction:
   conditional-averaged chemical source terms are closed by
   conditional-averaged scalars, which are obtained by inverting an
   integral equation. Two regularisation methods are implemented. The
   optimal regularisation parameter is determined and a sensitivity
   analysis is performed related to the effect of the value of the
   regularisation parameter. In the present study, only small differences
   in the conditional and unconditional averages are noticed for values of
   the regularisation parameter located in the optimal range determined by
   the L-curve. Two-equation k-epsilon and Shear Stress Transport (SST)
   turbulence models are used to solve the flow field in either the
   reactive or non-reactive case. Different values of the C-epsilon 1
   constant in the standard k-epsilon model and of Y-2 in the SST k-omega
   model are tested. Mean axial velocity and progress variable profiles are
   compared with experimental data. It is found that SST k-omega gives
   better results for the velocity profile in both the reactive and
   non-reactive cases. A value of Y-2 equal to 0.65 provides best
   predictions in the reactive case. The progress variable prediction
   exhibits similar profiles in the case of CSE and the flamelet combustion
   model approach. Very good agreement is achieved between the CSE
   predictions and experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{A turbulent combustion model, Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE)
   is applied to a non-premixed turbulent jet methane flame. The
   conditional chemical source terms are determined on the basis of first
   order closure and the conditional averaged species concentrations are
   obtained by inverting an integral equation. The Tikhonov method is
   implemented for regularisation. Detailed chemistry is tabulated using
   the trajectory generated low-dimensional manifold method. Radiation due
   to the gaseous species is included. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes
   calculations are performed using two different turbulence models. The
   objectives of the paper are (i) assessment of the impact of the main
   numerical parameters in CSE and (ii) comparison of the CSE numerical
   predictions with available experimental data and results from previous
   simulations for the selected flame. The number of CSE domains and the
   number of points in each CSE domain are shown to have a significant
   impact on the results if not selected appropriately. The present CSE
   calculations always converge to unique and stable predictions. The
   corrected k-epsilon model yields mixture fraction profiles in good
   agreement with the experimental data values for axial locations in the
   first half of the flame. Farther downstream, the RNG k-epsilon model
   performs better. Overall, the current predictions for the mixture
   fraction are in good agreement with the experimental data. The predicted
   temperatures using CSE and the k-epsilon turbulence model with a
   modified value of C-epsilon 1 = 1.47 are found to be in very good
   agreement with the experimental data. Further, the current CSE results
   are of comparable quality with previous simulations using the flamelet
   model and conditional moment closure. Future work may include further
   investigation on optimal determination of the regularisation parameter
   and alternative regularisation techniques, soot modelling within the CSE
   formulation, and improved formulation of radiation.}},

Abstract = {{The flickermeter described in International Electrotechnical Commission
   (IEC) Standard 61000-4-15 is widely used to quantify the voltage flicker
   level in practical applications. The IEC flickermeter generally performs
   well for incandescent lamps. However, it fails to measure the flicker of
   non-incandescent lamps caused by some ranges of interharmonics. This
   paper suggests modifying the existing IEC flickermeter by adding a new
   block to it in order to enable accurate measurement of the flicker
   caused by high-frequency interharmonics. A digital implementation of the
   proposed modified flickermeter is tested, showing encouraging results.
   The error of the modified flickermeter is very low compared to the
   original one, even for the worst conditions. The changes implemented in
   the flickermeter do not affect its regular performance measuring
   incandescent lamp flicker due to amplitude modulation, making it a more
   generic flickermeter version. An arc furnace simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC is
   used to check the performance of this flickermeter.}},

Abstract = {{Derivative-based approaches have been widely used for
   current-transformer (CT) saturation detection. Previous approaches dealt
   with the magnitude of current derivatives. This paper, however, proposes
   a novel CT saturation detection algorithm that is subject to the
   waveshape properties of current derivatives. Two indices are introduced
   to extract certain key features of a current waveshape using its first
   two difference functions. Combining these two indices, CT saturation is
   rapidly and reliably detected. This method operates correctly
   irrespective of CT parameters, fault current characteristics, and power
   system conditions. Derivative-based techniques are suspected to be noise
   sensitive. Meanwhile, appropriate measures are taken, and the robustness
   of this method against noise is guaranteed. Extensive analysis of
   various real and simulated currents confirms that this algorithm can
   meet the rigorous speed and accuracy standards of industrial relays.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the electromechanical properties of silver-in-epoxy
   conductive adhesives with the polyaniline (PANI) micron particles as
   cofillers have been investigated. PANI is a conductive polymer and has a
   moderate conductivity in between those of silver and epoxy. It was found
   that PANI can be used to tailor both the adhesive's electrical contact
   resistance and its relaxation behavior; however, the effects of adding
   PANI were complex. The addition of small amount of PANI (2 wt \%)
   dramatically increased the contact resistance; it might block the
   electrical contacts among silver flakes and was not able to form a
   continuous path among themselves. The addition of more PANI showed a
   moderate increase in contact resistance, which increased with the weight
   fraction of PANI from 6 to 15 wt \%. Interdependent behavior of
   compressive strain and relaxation in electrical contact resistance is
   characterized to evaluate the origin of this relaxation. The addition of
   PANI made the relaxation in electrical contact resistance more sensitive
   to the compressive strain and the electromechanical coupling to deviate
   from the linear relationship. These research findings provide insights
   into the way to use PANI to tailor the electromechanical properties of
   the adhesive bonds or joints in the development of advanced functional
   devices. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was used to evaluate
   temperature-dependent mechanical performance of wheat straw/talc
   polypropylene composites intended for automotive components as well as
   thermal properties of the produced formulations. Dynamic mechanical
   thermal analysis results were also correlated with impact tests and
   static bending test results. Isotactic and impact-modified copolymer
   polypropylene composites with various amounts of wheat straw or talc
   were prepared using extrusion followed by injection molding. Different
   thermal transitions as well as mechanical performance of the composites
   were evaluated and the effects of fiber loading, matrix type, filler
   type and hybridization were studied. Results indicated different
   mechanical behaviors of the two fillers within and between the two
   matrices. Modulus retention term and relative storage modulus were used
   as parameters defining mechanical performance at various temperatures.
   It was found that wheat straw composites were generally comparable to
   talc composites with better performance at very low or very high
   temperature regions. The correlations between the dynamic mechanical
   loss factor values at room temperature and impact strength data revealed
   a good relationship only for the isotactic polypropylene composites

Abstract = {{Improving the spatial resolution of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
   images is important for the visualization and analysis of small
   morphological features in biological tissue such as blood vessels,
   membranes, cellular layers, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel
   reconstruction approach to obtaining super-resolved OCT tomograms from
   multiple lower resolution images. The proposed Multi-Penalty Conditional
   Random Field (MPCRF) method combines four different penalty factors
   (spatial proximity, first and second order intensity variations, as well
   as a spline-based smoothness of fit) into the prior model within a
   Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation framework. Test carried out in
   retinal OCT images illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPCRF
   reconstruction approach in terms of spatial resolution enhancement, as
   compared to previously published super resolved image reconstruction
   methods. Visual assessment of the MPCRF results demonstrate the
   potential of this method in better preservation of fine details and
   structures of the imaged sample, as well as retaining the sharpness of
   biological tissue boundaries while reducing the effects of speckle noise
   inherent to OCT. Quantitative evaluation using imaging metrics such as
   Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR), Equivalent
   Number of Looks (ENL), and Edge Preservation Parameter show significant
   visual quality improvement with the MPCRF approach. Therefore, the
   proposed MPCRF reconstruction approach is an effective tool for
   enhancing the spatial resolution of OCT images without the necessity for
   significant imaging hardware modifications. (c) 2013 Optical Society of

   and cold and warm air temperature factors using the factorial experiment
   method. A multiple-sensor WIM system was installed at the test site and
   included different types of sensors such as quartz, polymer, and ceramic
   piezoelectric sensors. The quartz sensors showed insensitivity to speeds
   higher than 30 km/h and air temperature; whereas, the effects of air
   temperature and speed on the ceramic sensors were significant. The
   polymer sensors demonstrated sensitivity to the speed (on
   auto-calibrated sensors specifically for lower than 30 km/h) and air
   temperature factors. Acquired knowledge about the effects of major

Abstract = {{Smart community leverages information and communications technology to
   improve the quality of life in terms of education, health care, and
   government services. In smart community, residents manage their home
   appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy
   saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an
   efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for
   smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth
   from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access
   at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a
   service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request
   with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to
   other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is
   limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer
   to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a
   proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity
   information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the
   EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple
   pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity
   privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the
   communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a novel rapid layered manufacturing approach based
   on a combined additive manufacturing (AM) process and a UV-based
   micro-syringe deposition (mu SD) technique to be used in the fabrication
   of bio-ceramic structures with controlled micro-sized channels for bone
   and osteochondral tissue regeneration. In the proposed rapid
   manufacturing method, micro-scale sacrificial photopolymer networks are
   integrated within the manufactured part by depositing the photopolymer
   on selected bio-ceramic powder layers using an injection system. This
   AM-mu SD method along with a post-processing protocol can potentially
   overcome current limitations of traditional powder-based AM approaches
   that are restricted in terms of complexity of internal architecture and
   feature size. For bone or osteochondral repair applications, the
   material system composed of the bio-ceramic and sacrificial
   photopolymer, along with the post-processing protocol, must ensure that
   the final implants are free from manufacturing residuals that could
   trigger an immune response post-implantation. In this study, calcium
   polyphosphate bio-ceramic was used as the substrate material based on
   prior art, polyvinyl alcohol solution was used as the powder binding
   agent, and ethoxylated (10 bisphenol A diacrylate) photopolymer solution
   was used as the sacrificial photopolymer element. Material
   characterization suggests that the proposed material system along with
   heat treatment protocol is suitable for the targeted applications where
   micro-scale channels within the implant are produced by AM-mu SD.}},

Abstract = {{The increased use of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) rods in
   prestressed concrete applications has been challenged by identifying a
   suitable anchor system. To overcome such a challenge, the design of a
   simplified anchor system composed of three wedges and a barrel, without
   a soft sleeve, is presented to duplicate the simplicity of the widely
   utilized anchor systems in steel strands. A numerical study and
   experimental verification of the simplified anchor system for a CFRP rod
   are presented. Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element modeling has been
   conducted on the anchor system consisting of isotropic steel wedges and
   barrel, in addition to an orthotropic CFRP rod. The wedges and barrel
   are modeled as elastoplastic materials of different hardness. The
   rod/wedge and wedge/barrel interfaces are simulated using surface-based
   contact models having different coefficients of friction. Two hardness
   levels {[}171 and 319 Vickers hardness numbers (VPN)] are considered for
   the wedges. When the softer wedges are utilized the ultimate tensile
   strength of the CFRP is attained. With the harder wedges the rod fails
   prematurely due to slippage followed by fracture. The performance of the
   anchor system using numerical modeling successfully describes the
   experimental results.}},

Title = {{A three-state model for the probability distribution of instantaneous
   solar radiation, with applications}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{103-112}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Based on a new set of data covering a 13-month period and a wide range
   of the average clearness indices, the probability distribution for
   instantaneous solar radiation is modeled. The data's probability density
   function is shown to be capably represented by a linear superposition of
   three (truncated) normal distributions. The variable of the distribution
   is the ``normalized clearness index{''}, kappa, which is the clearness
   index k(t) divided by its value under clear sky conditions a quantity
   now available for most locations on the globe. It is shown that using
   kappa as the variable makes the distribution independent of the air
   mass. The only other parameter in the distribution is the mean value,
   (kappa) over bar, of kappa. The latter quantity fixes the parameters and
   the respective weights of the normal distributions, through
   empirically-derived fits. A physical interpretation of these findings is
   presented, whereby each normal distribution is associated with one of
   the three possible states of the atmosphere: namely (a) clear sky
   conditions, (b) overcast conditions, and (c) all other conditions. This
   interpretation predicts that the mean of the clear-sky state normal
   curve will be unity, and this has been confirmed for the data in hand.
   Also lending support to the three-state interpretation, is its ability
   (demonstrated in this paper) to predict the fraction of time of bright
   sunshine. Based on this new three-state model, a preliminary
   first-principle model for the mean diffuse fraction is given, as well as
   expressions for mean radiation on inclined surfaces and the
   instantaneous utilizability. The instantaneous utilizability is found to
   be greater than that for hourly or daily time periods and to depend in a
   significant way on the clear sky value of k(t). (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Partial Integro-Differential
   Equations (PIDEs) arising in financial option problems are not
   necessarily unique. In order to ensure convergence of a numerical scheme
   to the viscosity solution, it is common to use a positive coefficient
   discretization for such PIDEs. However in finite precision arithmetic
   one often encounters difficulties in solving the discretized nonlinear
   algebraic equations. In this paper we focus on a specific HJB PIDE,
   arising from pricing American options under jump diffusion. We use two
   formulations of this problem, the first a penalty method and the second
   a direct control formulation. In each case we use a positive coefficient
   discretization which implies that a fixed point policy iteration will
   converge when used to solve the nonlinear discretized algebraic
   equations, under very mild restrictions on parameters. However, when
   using finite precision arithmetic, we observe that convergence may not
   occur for either formulation, even if the theoretical conditions are
   satisfied. We estimate bounds for the penalty parameter (penalty method)
   and the scaling parameter (direct control formulation) so that
   convergence of the fixed point policy iteration in inexact arithmetic
   can be expected. Numerical tests verify that these bounds are
   conservative. The lower bound is of more practical importance, and
   conveniently this has a very simple form. We remark that similar issues
   also arise in more complicated HJB PIDEs in finance, for example when
   pricing American options under regime switching or guaranteed minimum
   withdrawal benefits (GMWB) under jump diffusion. (C) 2013 IMACS.

Abstract = {{Primary drainage in a water-wet saturated medium in the absence of
   capillarity is typically a combination of shock (discontinuous) and
   rarefaction (continuous) waves. Using nonlinear relative permeability
   functions for the host fluid and the invading fluid leads to the
   existence of a shock wave front, and the degree of nonlinearity of the
   relative permeability functions has an inverse relationship with the
   size of the shock wave (i.e., difference of saturation between upstream
   and downstream of the shock wave), whereas for linear relative
   permeability functions, the shock wave size approaches 0. Injection of a
   lower-viscosity immiscible phase such as gas or solvent into a water-wet
   porous medium in the presence of large capillary pressure leads to
   development of an extended and growing saturation transition zone that
   follows the discontinuous shock wave front. In this article, a
   semianalytical solution for the position of equisaturation contours
   (isosats) in the transition zone in the presence of gravity is obtained
   for a set of linearized relative permeability functions. The capillary
   (diffusive) and buoyancy terms are neglected, and the generalized
   convective equation for mass conservation is obtained. The set of
   equations is then reduced to a one-dimensional steady-state differential
   equation through forcing the isosat formulation to obey mass
   conservation. This scheme allows the isosat distribution to be solved,
   and the case of injection into an axisymmetric geometry for a confined
   planar configuration is solved and presented. A finite element model was
   developed to demonstrate the reasonable agreement between analytical and
   numerical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In many system state forecasting applications, the prediction is
   performed based on multiple datasets, each corresponding to a distinct
   system condition. The traditional methods dealing with multiple datasets
   (e.g., vector autoregressive moving average models and neural networks)
   have some shortcomings, such as limited modeling capability and opaque
   reasoning operations. To tackle these problems, a novel fuzzy neural
   network (FNN) is proposed in this paper to effectively extract
   information from multiple datasets, so as to improve forecasting
   accuracy. The proposed predictor consists of both autoregressive (AR)
   nodes modeling and nonlinear nodes modeling; AR models/nodes are used to
   capture the linear correlation of the datasets, and the nonlinear
   correlation of the datasets are modeled with nonlinear neuron nodes. A
   novel particle swarm technique {[}i.e., Laplace particle swarm (LPS)
   method] is proposed to facilitate parameters estimation of the predictor
   and improve modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the developed FNN
   predictor and the associated LPS method is verified by a series of tests
   related to Mackey-Glass data forecast, exchange rate data prediction,
   and gear system prognosis. Test results show that the developed FNN
   predictor and the LPS method can capture the dynamics of multiple
   datasets effectively and track system characteristics accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Despite continuous improvements in optical flow in the last three
   decades, the ability for optical flow algorithms to handle illumination
   variation is still an unsolved challenge. To improve the ability to
   interpret apparent object motion in video containing illumination
   variation, an illumination-robust optical flow method is designed. This
   method decouples brightness into reflectance and illumination components
   using a stochastic technique; reflectance is given higher weight to
   ensure robustness against illumination, which is suppressed.
   Illumination experiments using the Middlebury and University of Oulu
   databases demonstrate the decoupled method's improvement when compared
   with state-of-the-art. In addition, a novel technique is implemented to
   visualize optical flow output, which is especially useful to compare
   different optical flow methods in the absence of the ground truth.}},

   arrival rates and does not require knowledge of the stationary joint
   statistics of queue lengths as has been the case in previous results. We

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional die-stacking architectures have been proposed as a
   promising solution to the increasing interconnect delay that is observed
   in scaled technologies. Although prior research has extensively
   evaluated the performance advantage of moving from a 2-D to a 3-D design
   style, the impact of process parameter variations on 3-D designs has not
   been studied in detail. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by
   proposing a variability-aware design framework for fully synchronous
   (FS) and multiple clock-domain (MCD) 3-D systems. To mitigate the impact
   of process variations on 3-D designs, we propose the variability-aware
   3-D integration strategy for MCD 3-D systems that maximizes the
   probability of the design meeting specified system performance
   constraints. The proposed optimization strategy is shown to
   significantly outperform the FS and MCD 3-D implementations that are
   conventionally assembled, for example, the MCD designs assembled with
   the proposed integration strategy provide, on average, 44\% and 16.33\%
   higher absolute yield than the FS and conventional MCD designs,
   respectively, at the 50\% yield point of the conventional MCD designs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the application of non-local means (NLM) filtering on MRI
   images is investigated. An essential component of any NLM-based
   algorithm is its similarity measure used to compare pixel intensities.
   Unfortunately, virtually all existing similarity measures used to
   denoise MRI images have been derived under the assumption of additive
   white Gaussian noise contamination. Since this assumption is known to
   fail at low values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), alternative
   formulations of these measures which take into account the correct
   (Rician) statistics of the noise are required. Accordingly, the main
   contribution of the present work is to introduce a new similarity
   measure for NLM filtering of MRI images, which is derived under bona
   fide statistical assumptions and proves to posses important theoretical
   advantages over alternative formulations. The utility and viability of
   the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of numerical
   experiments using both in silico and in vivo MRI data. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   chamber has been modified to include a grounded, perforated, separator
   plate below the high density plasma source. A low-temperature (150
   degrees C) ICP-CVD process for nanocrystalline Si (nc-Si) deposition has
   been developed using the modified plasma chamber. The separator plate
   causes an increase in hydrogen partial pressure from the species
   released from the deposit on itself and also minimizes the ion
   bombardment of the substrate placed on the grounded electrode below it.
   As a result, nc-Si deposition was achieved with high growth rates (>6
   angstrom s(-1)) and without having to dilute the SiH4 precursor gas with
   H-2. The films are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, x-ray
   diffraction, and photo-conductivity measurements. The developed process,

Abstract = {{A proper knowledge of the osmotic pressure and thermodynamic behaviour
   of protein solutions is vital for designing an efficient protein
   separation process. It is also of great importance to develop a rapid
   and inexpensive technique to accurately estimate the protein osmotic
   pressure. A connectionist model to estimate the osmotic pressure of
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) in terms of pH, ionic strength and BSA
   concentration is proposed in this paper. Osmotic pressure of BSA is also
   modelled through the application of a colloidal interaction approach.
   Molecular interaction forces such as electrostatic, London-van der Waals
   and hydration along with entropy pressure are considered in the
   colloidal model to predict the BSA osmotic pressure. The advantages and
   disadvantages of both modelling approaches are discussed, and a hybrid
   modelling scheme is proposed for further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose supervised dictionary learning (SDL) by
   incorporating information on class labels into the learning of the
   dictionary. To this end, we propose to learn the dictionary in a space
   where the dependency between the signals and their corresponding labels
   is maximized. To maximize this dependency, the recently introduced
   Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is used. One of the main
   advantages of this novel approach for SDL is that it can be easily
   kernelized by incorporating a kernel, particularly a data-dependent
   kernel such as normalized compression distance, into the formulation.
   The learned dictionary is compact and the proposed approach is fast. We
   show that it outperforms other unsupervised and supervised dictionary
   learning approaches in the literature, using real-world data.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue tests were conducted of steel non-load carrying filet welded

   element (FE) analyses were performed to obtain stress concentration
   factor (SCF) distributions for the measured weld toe geometries, and a
   fracture mechanics model was validated and used to investigate the
   effects of the local property variations on the fatigue life. UIT
   significantly improved the fatigue lives of the welded specimens in all
   cases. A strong correlation was seen between the measured indent depth
   and the local residual stresses and microhardness. The fracture
   mechanics analysis predicts the fatigue performance of the specimens and
   finds it to be most sensitive to variations in the residual stresses and

Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is sensitive to

   the complex plane. Then, we prove that estimating the CFO is equivalent
   to finding the eigenvalues of a two-dimensional ICI coefficient matrix.
   As a result, by transmitting the corresponding eigenvectors, an estimate
   of the CFO value can be found. In addition to its simplicity, the
   proposed estimator is proven to be a maximum likelihood estimator.
   Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the high accuracy of the

Abstract = {{The point of this paper is to demonstrate the use of a quick and cheap
   fabrication method to realize a laser-ablated microfluidic channel for
   single cell electroporation. Traditional lithography of microchannel
   with electrode in MEMS applications has always been complicated. Here,
   we introduce a new methodology of fabricating microchannel with
   electrical functionalities achieved through a fast and cheap process. In
   the presentmethodology, the microchannel pattern is cut out of
   polyimide, bonded to two ITO-coated substrates using Teflon as an
   adhesion layer. ITO as conductive material enables electric field in the
   channel and its optical transparency allows microscopy techniques to be
   utilized in characterizing the behavior of the microfluidic chip. The
   performance of the chip was tested on irreversible single-cell scale
   electroporation which requires relatively high voltages. CHO cells, as
   mammalian cells, were passed through the microchannel to experience
   electric field. Cells were loaded with a fluorogenic dye, Calcein AM,
   and the electroporation of each was individually recorded in real-time
   via fluorescent microscopy. The results show promising performance of
   the electric microchannel in electroporation. By customizing of ITO
   electrodes and the design of microchannel pattern, utilization and
   integration of the proposed electrical microchannel in variety of other
   MEMS-based devices are achievable.}},

Title = {{Role of the donor material and the donor-acceptor mixing ratio in
   increasing the efficiency of Schottky junction organic solar cells}},
Journal = {{ORGANIC ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Schottky junction organic solar cells (OSCs) employ a high work-function
   anode and an active layer comprised of fullerene and low concentrations
   of donor. In this study, the roles of the donor material and the
   donor-acceptor mixing ratio in Schottky junction OSCs are explored. The
   results show that the high short circuit current (J(sc)) seen in
   Schottky junction OSCs at low donor concentrations arises primarily from
   photocurrent contributions from charge-transfer intermolecular states in
   C-60 aggregates. These aggregates absorb light at 400-600 nm and are
   thus well matched to the solar spectrum. The presence of the donor
   molecules is shown to be necessary for the dissociation of the C-60
   aggregate excitons, which ultimately allows for enhanced photocurrents.
   The exciton dissociation process is governed primarily by the highest
   occupied molecular orbial (HOMO) energy level difference between the
   donor and C-60, and is only efficient when this difference is large
   enough for the energetically favorable transfer of holes from C-60 to
   the donor material. Increasing the donor concentration beyond a certain
   threshold hinders C-60 aggregate formation and thus removes its
   contribution to photocurrent completely. Furthermore, the V-oc is shown
   to be strongly influenced by the choice of donor material, indicating
   that it is not set by the Schottky junction barrier height as previously
   thought. In spite of this influence on V-oc, the choice of donor in the
   active layer does not appear to play a significant role in the
   extraction of holes from the Schottky junction organic solar cells.

Abstract = {{In this work we investigate the different efficiency behaviors of the
   devices with and without hole injection barrier, utilizing in our
   investigation the archetypical
   4,4'-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl:Tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III)
   host-guest PHOLEDs system. The results show that the recombination of
   electrons and holes on the host material generally leads to higher
   device efficiency in comparison to the case where recombination happens
   on the guest material. The results also show that in devices where a
   hole injection barrier between the HTL and the host material in the EML
   exists, the emission mechanism gradually changes from one based on host
   e-h recombination to one based on guest e-h recombination as the guest
   concentration is increased. When host e-h recombination is dominant,
   although it tends to produce higher device efficiency, host e-h
   recombination is generally also associated with significant efficiency
   roll-off; the latter arises from quenching of the host triplet excitons
   primarily due to host-host TTA. As the concentration of the guest
   molecules increases and the creation of host triplet excitons subsides
   (since most e-h recombination occurs on the guest) host-host TTA
   decreases, hence also the efficiency roll-off. In such case, quenching
   is mostly caused by polarons residing on guest sites. At optimum guest
   concentrations (similar to 8\% Vol.), a balance between host e-h
   recombination and guest e-h recombination is reached, and thus also
   minimal TTA and Triplet-Polaron Quenching. On the other hand, in devices
   where hole injection barrier between the HTL and the host in the EML is
   insignificant, emission mechanism is always based on host eh
   recombination irrespective of the guest concentration, and therefore
   have higher efficiency and the efficiency does not depend on guest
   concentration. The absence of the injection barrier in these devices
   results in a wider recombination zone, and hence a lower exciton
   concentration in general, which in turn reduces host-host TTA and thus
   lowers efficiency roll-off. In contrast, guest-guest TTA is not found to
   play a significant role in device efficiency behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the sum-rate maximization algorithms for
   downlink and uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access
   (OFDMA) systems under proportional-rate constraint (PRC) and
   minimum-rate constraint. We develop a low-complexity weighted channel
   signal-to-noise ratio (w-SNR)-based ranking scheme for user selection on
   each subchannel in OFDMA combined with waterfilling (WF) power
   allocation. Both offline and online optimization algorithms are
   developed to optimize the SNR weight vector to maximize the sum rate
   while satisfying several constraints, such as PRC. The offline weight
   optimization technique relies on the analytical throughput results
   developed in this paper, and the online weight adaptation method tracks
   the user rates and meets the PRC using a subgradient search.
   Furthermore, we introduce a novel SNR operating region test to enhance
   the multiuser diversity gain and the sum rate. The proposed schemes have
   a low complexity, which is linear to the numbers of users and
   subchannels. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the developed
   analytical rates and fairness formulas, and show that the proposed w-SNR
   schemes can achieve higher sum rates than several benchmark schemes that
   provide the PRC with either short-term or long-term fairness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is on the asymptotic behavior of the spectral density of

   when the covariances are known and when they are estimated. Under
   certain mild conditions on the spectral density and the covariance
   sequence, it is shown that the spectral densities of both approximations
   converge in L-2 as the order of approximation increases. It is also
   shown that the spectral density of AR approximations converges at the
   origin under the same conditions. Under additional regularity

Abstract = {{In this study, polyelectrolyte membranes were prepared by layer-by-layer
   self-assembly on top of an interfacially polymerized polyamide
   substrate, and these thin-film-composite membranes were studied for
   pervaporative dehydration of ethylene glycol, ethanol and isopropanol.
   The composite membranes based on polyethylenimine/poly(acrylic acid)
   (PEI/PAA) complexes worked well for dehydration of ethylene glycol, but
   unsatisfactory for the dehydration of ethanol and isopropanol at
   relatively high feed alcohol concentrations, which was found to be
   caused by the stability issues of PEI/PAA bilayers and the polyamide
   substrate in the solvents. To improve the performance of the composite
   membranes for dehydration of ethanol and isopropanol, the outmost
   surface layer was deposited with PEI, followed by crosslinking. A
   further improvement in the membrane selectivity was accomplished by
   substituting the PEI with partially protonated chitosan in the last few
   polyelectrolyte bilayers during membrane fabrication. It was
   demonstrated that using interfacially polymerized polyamide membrane as
   a substrate, polyelectrolyte membranes with less than 8 bilayers can be
   fabricated for the dehydration of alcohol and diol. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This article presents the results of pilot scale studies that examined
   the use of negative and neutral charged tubular and hollow fiber (HF)
   anaerobic membrane bio-reactors (AnMBR) for anaerobic digestion of waste

   retention time of 15 days, a sludge retention time (SRT) of 30 days, and
   a total solids loading of 1.2-1.3 kg m(-3) day(-1). The results indicate
   that both membrane digesters showed comparable total chemical oxygen
   demand and volatile solids removals of 47.6 and 49.1\% respectively
   while maintaining a throughput that was two times that of the completely
   stirred tank reactor (CSTR) type digesters. The performance of the
   AnMBRs was similar to that of CSTRs operating at 30 days SRT. The AnMBRs
   were operated for 160 days. During this period no significant fouling
   was observed and membrane cleaning was not required. The average fluxes
   for the neutral and negative tubular membranes were 32 and 39 LMH when
   operated at a trans-membrane pressure TMP of 30 kPa. The HF membranes
   were operated at a constant flux of 11 LMH and the average TMP was less
   than 10 kPa. The critical flux measured for the tubular and HF membranes
   were near to 30 and 18 LMH mark respectively indicating a better
   performance by the former. However both AnMBR configurations generated

Abstract = {{Scale deposition is one of the most important and serious problems that
   limits and sometimes blocks oil and gas production by plugging the oil
   producing formation matrix or fractures and perforated intervals. One of
   the most insoluble substances formed from formation water (brine) and
   one that is very difficult to remove once formed on equipment, formation
   matrix or fractures and perforated intervals is barium sulfate. It is so
   insoluble that quantitative analysis methods for both barium and sulfate
   are based on the precipitation of barium sulfate. In this work a
   simple-to-use predictive tool is developed to estimate potential barium
   sulfate (barite) precipitation in oilfield brines that are predominantly
   sodium chloride solutions as a function of sodium chloride concentration
   and temperature. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with
   reported data in the literature with average absolute deviation being
   <1.3\%. The tool developed in this study can be of immense practical
   value for experts and engineers to have a quick check of barium sulfate
   scale formation at various conditions without opting for any
   experimental trials. In particular, petroleum and process engineers
   would find the approach to be user-friendly with transparent
   calculations involving no complex expressions. (c) 2012 American

Abstract = {{5A02 aluminum alloy and pure copper were joined by friction stir welding
   (FSW). A defect-free joint was obtained when one of process parameters,
   i.e. the traverse speed was lowered from 40 mm/min to 20 mm/min. A good
   mixing of Al and Cu was observed in the weld nugget zone (WNZ). A large
   amount of fine Cu particles were dispersed in the upper part of the WNZ
   producing a composite-like structure. In the lower part, nano-scaled
   intercalations were observed and identified by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). These layered structures were subsequently confirmed
   as Al4Cu9 (gamma), Al2Cu3 (epsilon), Al2Cu (theta), respectively.
   Formation of these microstructures caused an inhomogeneous hardness
   profile. Particularly, a distinct rise in hardness was noticed at the
   Al/Cu interface. Excellent metallurgical bonding between Al and Cu gave
   rise to good behaviors in the tensile and bending strength. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluation the microstructure and fatigue
   properties of welded joints made with fiber laser welding (FLW) on a
   high strength low alloy (HSLA) and dual-phase (DP980, UTS >= 980 MPa)
   steel in similar and dissimilar material combinations. The fusion zone
   (FZ) consisted of martensite, and the heat affected zone (HAZ) contained
   some newly formed martensite and partially tempered martensite on the
   DP980 steel side. A characteristic asymmetric hardness profile across
   the dissimilar HSLA-DP980 welded joint was observed. While a soft zone
   occurred on the DP980 side, it was absent on the HSLA side. Inside the
   FZ two hardness sub-regions were observed due to the difference in the
   alloying elements between two steels along with the fast cooling during
   FLW. The presence of soft zone on the DP980 side had no effect on the
   tensile properties, since the lowest hardness value in the soft zone was
   still higher than that of the HSLA base metal (BM). A joint efficiency
   of 97-100\% was achieved with respect to the HSLA. The strain to failure
   of the dissimilar HSLA-DP980 welded joints was significantly (similar to
   threefold) higher than that of the similar DP980-DP980 welded joints.
   Although the fatigue strength of the dissimilar HSLA-DP980 welded joints
   was lower than that of DP980-DP980 welded joints, it was equivalent to
   that of HSLA-HSLA welded joints. Failure occurred in the BM on the HSLA
   side in the tensile tests and fatigue tests at high cyclic stress
   levels, where yielding occurred. At the intermediate and lower cyclic
   stress levels, fatigue failure occurred in the weld area due to the
   higher sensitivity to the weld concavity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Battery management system (BMS) requires an accurate prediction the
   remaining energy level or state of charge (SOC) of the cell or battery
   pack. However, in electric vehicles, batteries experience a dynamic
   operational environment whereby the simple algorithms employed in the
   portable devices to predict SOC, such as coulomb counting, are
   insufficient for this purpose. To address this problem, a Kalman
   filtering method is used to estimate the state of the charge of two
   different commercial lithium-ion batteries, with new physical insight
   being provided through an analysis of the Kalman filter covariance noise
   parameters. For example, the effect of geometry of the battery on value
   of these parameters is discussed. Different models are developed, tested
   and incorporated in the filter design. Subsequently, two types of Kalman
   filters including the extended Kalman filter and dual extended Kalman
   filter are implemented in order to predict the state of charge of the
   batteries. It is shown that the Kalman filtering can predict state of
   the charge of the battery with maximum 4\% error. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Effective water removal from the proton exchange membrane fuel cell
   (PEMFC) surface exposed to the flow channel is critical to the operation
   and water management in PEMFCs. In this study, the water removal process
   is investigated numerically for a novel flow channel formed by inserting
   a hydrophilic needle in the conventional PEMFC flow channel, and the
   effect of the surface wettability of the membrane electrode assembly
   (MEA) and the inserted needle on the water removal process is studied.
   The results show that the liquid water can be more effectively removed
   from the MEA surface for larger MEA surface contact angles and smaller
   needle surface contact angles. The pressure drop for the flow in the
   channel is also examined and it is seen to be indicative of the liquid
   water flow and transport in the flow channel, suggesting that pressure
   drop is a useful parameter for the investigation of water transport and
   dynamics in the flow channel. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Cell/stack assembly force can strongly affect the transport
   characteristics and performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell
   (PEMFC) through causing the structural deformation. In this study, a
   mathematical model has been developed to investigate the effect of the
   assembly force for different gas diffusion layers (GDL) and membranes.
   The results indicate that the predominant deformation of the cell
   structure occurs in the porous GDL due to its weak mechanical strength.
   Thicker GDLs result into lower water content in the GDL structure, and
   can sustain a larger assembly force without the risk of ``electrode
   flooding{''}; while thinner GDLs have higher water content, can maintain
   the hydration required for the membrane, and yield a better cell
   performance with less sensitivity to the variations in the assembly
   force. Thinner membranes yield better cell performance, but the cell
   performance is more sensitive to the changes in the assembly force. A
   combination of thin GDL and membrane is beneficial for better cell
   performance with reasonable sensitivity to the assembly force. For
   thinner GDLs, an optimal assembly force exists beyond which the cell
   performance is reduced; and practical cell assembly force will limit the
   GDL thickness. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Title = {{Manipulating the sleeping beauty mutase operon for the production of
   1-propanol in engineered Escherichia coli}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: While most resources in biofuels were directed towards
   implementing bioethanol programs, 1-propanol has recently received
   attention as a promising alternative biofuel. Nevertheless, no
   microorganism has been identified as a natural 1-propanol producer. In
   this study, we manipulated a novel metabolic pathway for the synthesis
   of 1-propanol in the genetically tractable bacterium Escherichia coli.
   Results: E. coli strains capable of producing heterologous 1-propanol
   were engineered by extending the dissimilation of succinate via
   propionyl-CoA. This was accomplished by expressing a selection of key
   genes, i.e. (1) three native genes in the sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm)
   operon, i.e. sbm-ygfD-ygfG from E. coli, (2) the genes encoding
   bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from several
   microbial sources, and (3) the sucCD gene encoding succinyl-CoA
   synthetase from E. coli. Using the developed whole-cell biocatalyst
   under anaerobic conditions, production titers up to 150 mg/L of
   1-propanol were obtained. In addition, several genetic and chemical
   effects on the production of 1-propanol were investigated, indicating
   that certain host-gene deletions could abolish 1-propanol production as
   well as that the expression of a putative protein kinase (encoded by
   ygfD/argK) was crucial for 1-propanol biosynthesis.
   Conclusions: The study has provided a novel route for 1-propanol
   production in E. coli, which is subjected to further improvement by
   identifying limiting conversion steps, shifting major carbon flux to the
   productive pathway, and optimizing gene expression and culture
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, persulfate has caught the attention of groundwater remediation
   practitioners as a promising oxidant for in situ chemical oxidation. In
   this study, a method was applied to treat a selection of hazardous
   organic compounds using nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) particles as
   activators for persulfate. The results show that degradation of these
   organic compounds using nZVI-activated persulfate is more effective than
   nZVI alone. For example, the degradation of naphthalene by
   nZVI-activated persulfate was >99\% compared to <10\% by nZVI alone.
   Despite the higher effectiveness, the nZVI particles were passivated
   quickly following exposure to persulfate, causing the reaction rate to
   reduce to a magnitude representative of an unactivated persulfate
   system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicated that an iron
   sulfate layer was formed on the nZVI particle surfaces following
   exposure to persulfate compared to the FeOOH layer that was present on
   the fresh nZVI surfaces. Although the nZVI particle surfaces are
   passivated, nZVI appears to be a promising persulfate activator compared
   to the conventional persulfate activators such as Fe2+ and granular ZVI.}},

Abstract = {{A polypyrrole-coated sulfur composite (PPy@S) was synthesized by in situ
   polymerization of pyrrole monomers on the surface of nano-sulfur
   particles. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy mapping showed the formation of a highly
   developed core-shell structure with uniform PPy coating on the surface
   of sulfur particles. The electrochemical properties of the resulting
   PPy@S composite cathode have been evaluated by cyclic voltammograms and
   galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling. The results show that the PPy@S
   composite exhibits a reversible capacity of 1,200 mAh g(-1) at the
   initial cycle, with 913 mAh g(-1) remaining after 50 cycles. Even up to
   2.5 C, a reversible capacity of 437 mAh g(-1) is obtained. The excellent
   electrochemical performance can be attributed to the conductive
   PPy-coating nanolayer, which provides both an effective electron
   conduction path and a strong physical and chemical confinement setting
   for elemental sulfur and resident polysulfides, minimizing the loss of

   of biomolecule solutions. In addition to determining concentrations, we
   found that the sample solution impedance is highly correlated with the
   length of the DNA fragments, indicating that the sizes of PCR products
   could be validated with an integrated chip-based, sample-friendly system
   within a few minutes. The system could be the basis of a rapid, low-cost
   platform for DNA characterization with broad applications in cancer and

Title = {{Effect of mold treatment by solvent on PDMS molding into nanoholes}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is the most popular and versatile material
   for soft lithography due to its flexibility and easy fabrication by
   molding process. However, for nanoscale patterns, it is challenging to
   fill uncured PDMS into the holes or trenches on the master mold that is
   coated with a silane anti-adhesion layer needed for clean demolding.
   PDMS filling was previously found to be facilitated by diluting it with
   toluene or hexane, which was attributed to the great reduction of
   viscosity for diluted PDMS. Here, we suggest that the reason behind the
   improved filling for diluted PDMS is that the diluent solvent increases
   in situ the surface energy of the silane-treated mold and thus the
   wetting of PDMS to the mold surface. We treated the master mold surface
   (that was already coated with a silane anti-adhesion monolayer) with
   toluene or hexane, and found that the filling by undiluted PMDS into the
   nanoscale holes on the master mold was improved despite the high
   viscosity of the undiluted PDMS. A simple estimation based on capillary
   filing into a channel also gives a filling time on the millisecond
   scale, which implies that the viscosity of PMDS should not be the
   limiting factor. We achieved a hole filling down to sub-200-nm diameter
   that is smaller than those of the previous studies using regular Sylgard
   PDMS (not hard PDMS, Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI, USA).
   However, we are not able to explain using a simple argument based on
   wetting property why smaller, e.g., sub-100-nm holes, cannot be filled,
   for which we suggested a few possible factors for its explanation.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents are a current and emerging
   global problem and the development of cost-effective methods to
   facilitate their removal is needed to mitigate this issue. Advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs), in particular UV/TiO2, have potential for
   wastewater treatment. In this study, TiO2 anatase phase nanobelts
   (30-100 nm in width and 10 mu m in length) have been synthesized using a
   high temperature hydrothermal method as a means to photocatalyze the
   oxidation of pharmaceutical contaminants. We have investigated a model
   dye (malachite green), three pharmaceuticals and personal care
   products-naproxen, carbamazepine, and theophylline-that are difficult to
   oxidize without AOP processes. TiO2 nanobelts were exposed to 365 nm UV
   illumination and the measured photocatalytic degradation rates and
   adsorption parameters of pharmaceuticals were explored using kinetic
   models. Furthermore we have determined the degree of pharmaceutical
   degradation as a function of solution pH, illumination time,
   temperature, and concentration of contaminant. In addition, the roles of
   active oxygen species-hydroxyl radial (OH center dot), positive holes
   (h(+)), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-involved were also investigated in
   the degradation process. These studies offer additional applications of
   hierarchical TiO2 nanobelt membranes, including those harnessing
   sunlight for water treatment.}},

   considering the variability of load and local renewable generation}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{698-707}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The interconnection of renewable energy sources with distribution
   systems is attracting increasing interest because these renewable
   sources are inexhaustible and nonpolluting. Wind and photovoltaic are
   among the most mature of these energy sources, and their penetration
   continues to increase. In this paper a method based on GA (genetic
   algorithm) is presented to investigate the distribution system
   reconfiguration problem taking into consideration the effect of load
   variation and the stochastic power generation of renewable DG
   (distributed generators units). The presented method determines the
   annual distribution network reconfiguration scheme considering switching
   operation costs in order to minimize annual energy losses by determining
   the optimal configuration for each season of the year. The uncertainties
   related to DG power and varying load are considered by the creation of a
   probabilistic generation-load model that combines all possible operating
   conditions of the renewable DG units with the probability of their
   occurrence, followed by the incorporation of this model into the
   reconfiguration problem. The constraints include the voltage limits, the
   line current limits, the radial topology, and feeding of all loads. In
   order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, both
   balanced and unbalanced distribution systems are used as case studies.

Abstract = {{The extent of carbon isotope fractionation during degradation of
   1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) by a base-catalyzed persulfate
   (S2O82-) treatment system was investigated. Significant destruction of
   1,1,1-TCA was observed at a pH of similar to 12. An increase in the

   parts per thousand, was obtained. This significant carbon isotope
   fractionation and the lack of dependence on changes in the NaOH:S2O82-

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impacts of high pressure thermal hydrolysis
   (HPTH) pretreatment on the distribution of chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   species in waste activated sludge (WAS). In the first phase of the
   project, WAS from a synthetically-fed biological reactor (BR) was fed to
   an aerobic digester (AD). In the second phase, WAS from the BR was
   pretreated by HPTH at 150 degrees C and 3 bars for 30 min prior to being
   fed to the AD. A range of physical, biochemical and biological
   properties were regularly measured in each process stream in both
   phases. The COD of the BR WAS consisted of storage products (X-STO),
   active heterotrophs (X-H) and endogenous decay products (X-E).
   Pretreatment did not increase the extent to which the BR WAS was
   aerobically digested and hence it was concluded that the unbiodegradable
   COD fraction, i.e. X-E, was unchanged by pretreatment. However,
   pretreatment did increase the rate of degradation as it converted 36\%
   of X-H to readily biodegradable COD (S-B) and the remaining X-H to
   slowly biodegradable COD (X-B). Furthermore, X-STO was fully converted
   to S-B by pretreatment. Although pretreatment did not change the VSS
   concentration in the downstream aerobic digester, it did decrease the
   ISS concentration by 46 +/- 11\%. This reduced the total mass of solids
   produced by the digester by 21 +/- 8\%. A COD-based HPTH pretreatment
   model was developed and calibrated. When this model was integrated into
   BioWin 3.1 (R), it was able to accurately simulate both the steady state
   performance of the overall system employed in this study as well as
   dynamic respirometry results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Improving biocompatibility by surface modification techniques on
   implantable bioelectronics}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{451-460}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{For implantable bioelectronic devices, the interface between the device
   and the biological environment requires significant attention as it
   dictates the device performance in vivo. Non-specific protein adsorption
   onto the device surface is the initial stage of many degradation
   mechanisms that will ultimately compromise the functionality of the
   device. In order to preserve the functionality of any implanted
   bioelectronics overtime, protein adsorption must be controlled. This
   review paper outlines two major approaches to minimize protein
   adsorption onto the surface of implantable electronics. The first
   approach is surface coating, which minimizes close proximity
   interactions between proteins and device surfaces by immobilizing
   electrically neutral hydrophilic polymers as surface coating. These
   coatings reduce protein fouling by steric repulsion and formation of a
   hydration layer which acts as both a physical and energetic barrier that
   minimize protein adsorption onto the device. Relevant performances of
   various conventional hydrophilic coatings are discussed. The second
   approach is surface patterning using arrays of hydrophobic
   nanostructures through photolithography techniques. By establishing a
   large slip length via super hydrophobic surfaces, the amount of proteins
   adsorbed to the surface of the device can be reduced. The last section
   discusses emerging surface coating techniques utilizing zwitterionic
   polymers where ultralow-biofouling surfaces have been demonstrated.
   These surface modification techniques may significantly improve the
   long-term functionality of implantable bioelectronics, thus allowing
   researchers to overcome challenges to diagnose and treat chronic
   neurological and cardiovascular diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We study the stability of common hole transport material/electron
   transport material (HTM/ETM) interfaces present in typical organic
   light-emitting devices (OLEDs) under various stress scenarios. We
   determined that these interfaces degrade rapidly, because of an
   interaction between HTM positive polarons and HTM singlet excitons. The
   phenomenon results in a deterioration in conduction across the
   interface, and contributes to the commonly observed increase in OLED
   driving voltage with electrical driving time. This interfacial
   degradation can be slowed if the exciton lifetime becomes shorter. The
   findings uncover a new degradation mechanism that is interfacial in
   nature, which affects organic/organic interfaces in OLEDs and
   contributes to their limited electroluminescence stability, and shed
   light on approaches for reducing it. Although this study has focused on
   OLED., we can expect the same degradation mechanism to affect
   organic/organic interfaces in other organic optoelectronic devices where
   both excitons and polarons are present in high concentrations, such as
   in organic solar cells or photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional array of gold nano-patches on a highly reflective
   mirror is proposed for refractive index sensing based on changes in the
   reflected colors. The grating on the mirror creates localized surface
   plasmon resonances resulting in a minimum in the visible reflectance
   spectra. The wavelength of the resonance can be tuned by changing the
   width of the nano-patches and is also dependent on the refractive index
   of the surrounding medium. The color variation due to change in the
   refractive index is measured and used to realize a simple low-cost
   sensor with a refractive index resolution better than 10(-5) just using
   image processing. The efficacy of the proposed sensor is also
   demonstrated for surface sensing by depositing thin layers of silicon
   dioxide. The color difference due to the addition of a 3 nm thick layer
   of silicon dioxide is detectable by the naked eye and deposition
   thickness of 2 angstrom can be resolved using image processing.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, drugs of abuse tests are performed on bulky and costly
   analytical instruments such as a spectrophotometer or chemistry
   analyzer, requiring large volumes of sample and reagents, normally more
   than 200 mu L. This article presents a simple, low-cost, sensitive, and
   miniaturized light absorption detection device to conduct a homogenous
   immunoassay assay for detecting drugs of abuse. The concentrations of
   the target drug in samples are determined quantitatively by measuring
   the relative light intensity transmission of the reaction mixture. In
   this method, the reaction mixture is contained in a micro-well in a
   (Polydimethylsiloxane)-glass chip and exposed to UV light. The relative
   light intensity transmission is measured by a photo-detector. The
   desired temperature for incubation is provided by a thin-film heater
   under the chip. The automatic control of the heater, light source, data
   acquisition, and processing are achieved by a self-coded program. To
   verify the feasibility and performance of this device, a commercial
   homogenous assay kit for a cocaine metabolite was used. The effects of
   multiple parameters on the system's sensitivity were studied. The
   results show that the detection can be completed within 5 minutes with a
   ten-time smaller volume (approximate to 22 mu L) of the reaction mixture
   (sample plus the reagents) than that of the conventional method. A
   detection limit of 50ng/mL was achieved, comparable to that by a
   standard lab method with the same assay kit. This portable detection
   device is promising for on-site testing of drugs of abuse.}},

Abstract = {{There exist several inherent uncertainties in the energy optimization
   modeling of Oil Sands operations. In this work, the deterministic model
   proposed by Betancourt-Torcat et al. in 2011 has been extended to
   account for parameter uncertainty in the natural gas price and
   steam-to-oil ratio (SOR). The new extended steady-state model considers
   freshwater withdrawal constraints and a new methodology to account for
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The problem was formulated as a
   single-period stochastic (MINLP). The application of the stochastic
   energy optimization model includes results reflecting all uncertain
   outcomes simultaneously and enabling optimal arrangement of the energy
   supply and oil producer infrastructures. The model's capabilities have
   been shown in the present work through two new case studies accounting
   for uncertainty while the deterministic case is presented as a
   reference. The case studies under uncertainty consider the forecasted
   oil production scenario for the year 2035 in an uncertain environment
   where the price of natural gas is volatile and the SOR unknown. The
   results of the stochastic model were compared with those of the
   deterministic model by studying the expected values of the stochastic
   approach and those of the deterministic solution. The results presented
   in this study were discussed regarding the characteristics of
   uncertainty of the varied fuel price and SOR parameter. The key findings
   of this study are that oil producers considering hydrocracking are
   favored over thermocracking-based schemes, and the GHG emission
   constraint cannot be met for SOR values higher than 2.48.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid advancement in the wireless communication technology
   and automotive industries, the paradigm of vehicular ad-hoc networks
   (VANETs) emerges as a promising approach to provide road safety, vehicle

   communication, on the other hand, can enhance the reliability of
   communication links in VANETs, thus mitigating wireless channel
   impairments due to the user mobility. In this paper, we present a
   cooperative scheme for medium access control (MAC) in VANETs, referred
   to as Cooperative ADHOC MAC (CAH-MAC). In CAH-MAC, neighboring nodes
   cooperate by utilizing unreserved time slots, for retransmission of a
   packet which failed to reach the target receiver due to a poor channel
   condition. Through mathematical analysis and simulation, we show that
   our scheme increases the probability of successful packet transmission
   and hence the network throughput in various networking scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study user profile matching with privacy-preservation
   in mobile social networks (MSNs) and introduce a family of novel profile
   matching protocols. We first propose an explicit Comparison-based
   Profile Matching protocol (eCPM) which runs between two parties, an
   initiator and a responder. The eCPM enables the initiator to obtain the
   comparison-based matching result about a specified attribute in their
   profiles, while preventing their attribute values from disclosure. We
   then propose an implicit Comparison-based Profile Matching protocol
   (iCPM) which allows the initiator to directly obtain some messages
   instead of the comparison result from the responder. The messages
   unrelated to user profile can be divided into multiple categories by the
   responder. The initiator implicitly chooses the interested category
   which is unknown to the responder. Two messages in each category are
   prepared by the responder, and only one message can be obtained by the
   initiator according to the comparison result on a single attribute. We
   further generalize the iCPM to an implicit Predicate-based Profile
   Matching protocol (iPPM) which allows complex comparison criteria
   spanning multiple attributes. The anonymity analysis shows all these
   protocols achieve the confidentiality of user profiles. In addition, the
   eCPM reveals the comparison result to the initiator and provides only
   conditional anonymity; the iCPM and the iPPM do not reveal the result at
   all and provide full anonymity. We analyze the communication overhead
   and the anonymity strength of the protocols. We then present an enhanced
   version of the eCPM, called eCPM+, by combining the eCPM with a novel
   prediction-based adaptive pseudonym change strategy. The performance of
   the eCPM and the eCPM+ are comparatively studied through extensive
   trace-based simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the eCPM+
   achieves significantly higher anonymity strength with slightly larger
   number of pseudonyms than the eCPM.}},

   faster interleaved Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm with
   simplified pre-computational phase for GF(p(n)), where p 2 is a prime
   number and n is a positive integer. The authors propose different sets
   of moduli that can be used in elliptic curve crytographic applications
   and pairing-based cryptography. Moreover, this method also leads to
   efficient implementations for the elliptic curve parameters given in
   standards. It is shown that one can obtain efficient Montgomery modular
   multiplication architecture in view of the number of AND gates and XOR
   gates by choosing proposed sets of moduli. The authors eliminate final
   substraction step with proposed sets of moduli. These methods are easy
   to implement for hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling relation between channel width and the spacing of macroscale
   bed forms has long interested earth scientists and engineers. The
   current paper conceptualizes flow over such macro bed forms using
   perturbation theory. The objectives are to characterize the response of
   flow to pressure gradients that occur in convectively accelerating flow
   and convectively decelerating flow (CDF), as occurs in pools and
   riffles, and to determine how the response is modified by the width of
   the channel. Flume experiments are described that use idealized
   two-dimensional bed forms and an inner movable wall to isolate the
   effect of channel width. Ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry profilers
   operating at 40 Hz are used to measure velocity. Results show that the
   recovery of the shear velocity (u({*})) and Coles wake parameter ()
   follows a simple relaxation response toward uniform flow conditions that
   is insensitive to channel width, while the lateral concentration of flow
   () and the principal Reynolds stress -(u'w') over bar occur as two-stage
   spreading and relaxation responses that follow a scaling relation on the
   order of 3-4 times the channel width, or approximately one half of the
   typical distance between pools. The -(u'w') over bar increases during
   CDF, precisely in the location where mean bed velocity is at a minimum.
   It thus appears that hydrodynamic recovery from perturbation helps to
   explain the sensitivity of the scale of macro bed forms in rivers to
   channel width. Mobile beds and 3-D geometries should be tested to verify
   how mean flow and turbulent scales evolve as linked aspects of a complex
   response to perturbation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper expounds a three-way Doherty power amplifier (3W-DPA) as a
   solution to the need for high-efficiency wideband power amplifiers when
   driven by multi-standard signals. The paper begins with a theoretical
   analysis of 3W-DPA architecture from which the governing equations are
   derived. This analysis enables the identification of circuit parameters
   for maximizing bandwidth. A comprehensive methodology was devised to
   address the practical design challenges resulting from the transistor
   nonidealities: nonlinear input capacitance, transistor package, and
   output capacitance. Based on this methodology, a fully analog 30-W
   3W-DPA was designed and implemented using GaN packaged transistors. The
   3W-DPA prototype maintained an average drain efficiency of 55\% at an
   output back-off of up to 9 dB, over the frequency range of 0.73-0.98
   GHz. The 3W-DPA was successfully linearized when driven with 20-MHz
   four-carrier wideband code division multiple access (WCMDA) signals.
   830-and 900-MHz power-added efficiencies of 47\% and 53\% was achieved
   at 32-and 35-dBm average output power, corresponding to a
   peak-to-average power ratio of 11.7 and 7.14 dB, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the relation between message delivery delay and
   reliability for the communication between a vehicle and a road side unit
   (RSU). We focus on sparse vehicular sensor networks (VSNs), where timely
   message delivery and reliable transmission are of significant

   delay distribution for a two-lane road, where vehicles in one direction
   act as message carriers for the ones in the other direction and have the
   freedom to leave the road from randomly distributed road junctions with
   a certain probability. Packet generator vehicles store the original
   packets till meeting an RSU while sending multiple copies of each packet
   to packet carrier vehicles. Our analysis offers an analytical tool for
   an intelligent transportation system (ITS) service provider to determine
   the minimum RSU density required to cover a road for meeting a
   probabilistic requirement of the message delay. Extensive computer
   simulation results show the accuracy of our analysis and clearly
   indicate the relation of packet delay and the number of packet replicas.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of cross-band interference in single-antenna and
   multi-antenna OFDM cognitive transmitters is considered. Cross-band
   interference, which is caused by large OFDM signal sidelobes, is a major
   drawback of OFDM, especially in cognitive radio applications where it is
   crucial to protect primary licensed users from the secondary user's
   interference. In this paper, we propose a novel low complexity
   technique, referred to as a phase adjustment technique, to tackle this
   problem in single-antenna and multi-antenna OFDM cognitive transmitters.
   In this technique, the phase of each OFDM symbol is adjusted in an
   attempt to minimize the interference caused by the secondary user to the
   primary. Unlike prior methods, this technique does not decrease data
   throughput and has no impact on the bit-error-rate and peak-to-average
   power ratio of the OFDM symbols. Furthermore, to calculate the
   adjustment phases, three heuristics, one of which is very low complexity
   and achieves near optimal performance in numerical simulations, are also
   proposed. In addition, the performance of the proposed technique is
   evaluated analytically in some special cases in single and multi-antenna
   cognitive transmitters, and is verified by numerical simulations.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The physics of a two-dimensional vortex dipole impinging on the tip of a
   semi-infinite rigid plate is numerically examined. The dipole trajectory
   is initially orthogonal to the plate and aligned with its tip. The
   impact behavior is examined for three dipole Reynolds numbers. As the
   dipole approaches, vorticity is induced along the plate, as in the case
   of a dipole approaching a full wall, and is additionally shed from the
   tip. Upon impact, the dipole effectively splits, with half of it
   interacting with the vorticity induced on the plate and the other half
   with the vorticity shed from the tip. Each half of the original dipole
   forms a new secondary vortex pair whose behavior depends upon the
   Reynolds number of the original dipole. Contingent upon the rate of
   momentum diffusion, these secondary (and tertiary) vortex pairs may
   return and impact the plate again. Herein, we detail the interaction of
   the dipole impact at various Reynolds numbers, with a focus on the
   vortex dynamics and the distributed load imposed on the rigid plate by
   the fluid. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The capabilities of time-resolved laser-induced incandescence

   necessary to characterize the thermal accommodation coefficient, alpha,
   which specifies the heat conduction rate between the laser-energized
   nanoparticles and the surrounding gas. This paper extends a molecular
   dynamics (MD) methodology to calculate alpha for Fe/He, Fe/Ar, Mo/He,
   and Mo/Ar systems. A comparative analysis of the results shows that
   alpha is most strongly influenced by the potential well between the gas
   molecule and nanoparticle surface. Finally, the MD-derived value for
   alpha is used to recover the nanoparticle size distribution for TiRe-LII
   measurements made on molybdenum nanoparticles in argon.}},

   carbon nanotube, cubic spinel cobalt oxide and their physical mixture,
   respectively. The oxygen evolution current density of the composite was
   49\% higher than the physical mixture and even greater than each
   component alone after 500 CV cycles. The cause of high performance is
   presumably contributed to the synergistic coupling effects between the
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the cubic spinel cobalt oxide. (C)

Abstract = {{Golay sequences have been studied for more than five decades since Golay
   first discovered those sequences. However, the periodic autocorrelation
   of a single Golay sequence is unknown. In this paper, for H >= 2 being
   an arbitrary even integer, we show there exist three different
   constructions of Hary Golay sequences with a zero autocorrelation zone
   (ZACZ) of length approximately an half, a quarter or one eighth of their
   period. Those new discoveries on Golay sequences can be explored during
   synchronization and detection at the receiver end and thus improve the
   performance of the communication system. We present the application of
   binary Golay sequences with ZACZ for intersymbol interference (ISI)
   channel estimation. Compared with m-sequences, Golay-sequence-aided
   channel estimation has perfect autocorrelations within the zone.
   Compared with Frank-Zadoff-Chu sequences, Golay-sequence-aided channel
   estimation requires much lower hardware and computational complexity. We
   also discuss the performance of Golay-sequence-aided channel estimation
   in terms of its error variance. Finally, simulations are conducted to
   show the performance of our proposed scheme against m-sequences and FZC
   sequences in terms of symbol error rate. The simulations also confirm
   with our theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{Access infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi access points and cellular base
   stations (BSs), plays a vital role in providing pervasive Internet
   services to vehicles. However, the deployment costs of different access
   infrastructure are highly variable. In this paper, we make an effort to
   investigate the capacity-cost tradeoffs for vehicular access networks,
   in which access infrastructure is deployed to provide a downlink data
   pipe to all vehicles in the network. Three alternatives of wireless
   access infrastructure are considered, i.e., cellular BSs, wireless mesh
   backbones (WMBs), and roadside access points (RAPs). We first derive a
   lower bound of downlink capacity for each type of access infrastructure.
   We then present a case study based on a perfect city grid of 400 km(2)
   with 0.4 million vehicles, in which we examine the capacity-cost
   tradeoffs of different deployment solutions in terms of capital
   expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX). The rich

Abstract = {{Vehicular communication networks are increasingly being considered as a
   means to conserve fuel and reduce emissions within transportation
   systems. This paper focuses on using traffic light signals to
   communicate with approaching vehicles. The communication can be
   traffic-light-signal-to-vehicle (TLS2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V).
   Based on the information sent, the vehicle receiving the message adapts
   its speed to a recommended speed (S-R), which helps the vehicle reduce
   fuel consumption and emissions. The key contribution of this paper is
   the proposal of a comprehensive optimization model that involves V2V and
   TLS2V communications. The objective function is to minimize fuel
   consumption by and emissions from vehicles. The speed that can achieve
   this goal is the optimum S-R (S-R{*}). We also propose efficient
   heuristic expressions to compute the optimum or near-optimum value of

Abstract = {{An analytical model for the reliability of a dedicated short-range
   communication (DSRC) control channel (CCH) to handle safety applications
   in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is proposed. Specifically, the
   model enables the determination of the probability of receiving status
   and safety messages from all vehicles within a transmitter's range and
   vehicles up to a certain distance, respectively. The proposed model is
   built based on a new mobility model that takes into account the
   vehicle's follow-on safety rule to derive accurately the relationship
   between the average vehicle speed and density. Moreover, the model takes
   into consideration 1) the impact of mobility on the density of vehicles
   around the transmitter, 2) the impact of the transmitter's and
   receiver's speeds on the system reliability, 3) the impact of channel
   fading by modeling the communication range as a random variable, and 4)
   the hidden terminal problem and transmission collisions from neighboring
   vehicles. It is shown that the current specifications of the DSRC may
   lead to severe performance degradation in dense and high-mobility
   conditions. Therefore, an adaptive algorithm is introduced to increase
   system reliability in terms of the probability of successful reception
   of the packet and the delay of emergency messages in a harsh vehicular
   environment. The proposed model and the enhancement algorithm are
   validated by simulation using realistic vehicular traces.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular communications networks are envisioned for the access to
   drive-thru Internet and IP-based infotainment applications. These
   services are supported by roadside access routers (ARs) that connect
   vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to external IP networks. However,
   VANETs suffer from asymmetric links due to variable transmission ranges
   caused by mobility, obstacles, and dissimilar transmission power, which
   make it difficult to maintain the bidirectional connections and to
   provide the IP mobility required by most IP applications. Moreover,
   vehicular mobility results in short-lived connections to the AR,
   affecting the availability of IP services in VANETs. In this paper, we
   study the secure and timely handover of IP services in an asymmetric
   VANET and propose a multihop-authenticated Proxy Mobile IP (MA-PMIP)
   scheme. MA-PMIP provides an enhanced IP mobility scheme over
   infrastructure-to-vehicle-to-vehicle (I2V2V) communications that uses
   location and road traffic information. The MA-PMIP also reacts,
   depending on the bidirectionality of links, to improve availability of
   IP services. Moreover, our scheme ensures that the handover signaling is
   authenticated when V2V paths are employed to reach the infrastructure so
   that possible attacks are mitigated without affecting the performance of
   the ongoing sessions. Both analysis and extensive simulations in OMNeT++
   are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the MA-PMIP improves
   service availability and provides secure seamless access to IP
   applications in asymmetric VANETs.}},

Abstract = {{A study of changes in hydro-climatology of the Great Lakes was performed
   incorporating the nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend detection test and a
   recently developed Bayesian multiple change point detection model. The
   Component Net Basin Supply (C-NBS) and its components (runoff,
   precipitation, evaporation) as well as water levels of Great Lakes were
   analyzed for gradual (i.e. trend type) and abrupt (i.e. shift type)
   nonstationary behaviors at seasonal and annual scales. It was found that
   the C-NBS experienced significant upward trends only in the lower Great
   Lakes (Erie, Ontario) during the summer portion of the year. At an
   annual scale upward trends were observed only in Lake Ontario. Change
   point analysis suggested an upward shift in Great Lakes C-NBS in the
   late 1960s and early 1970s. A combination of gradual and abrupt change
   analysis of Great Lakes water levels indicated a common upward shift
   along with a change in trend direction around the early 1970s. It was
   also found that precipitation and runoff are on a plateau and in some
   cases on a decreasing course following an increasing trend in the early
   twentieth century. Results obtained from this study show that the
   hydro-climatology of Great Lakes is characterized by nonstationaiy
   behavior. Changes in this behavior have caused the Great Lakes water
   levels to decrease during the last few decades. This study provides
   valuable insights into the nature of the nonstationary behavior of
   hydro-climatic variables of Great Lakes and contributes useful
   information to the future water management planning. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Complex wavelet structural similarity (CW-SSIM) index has been
   recognized as a novel image similarity measure of broad potential
   applications due to its robustness to small geometric distortions such
   as translation, scaling and rotation of images. Nevertheless, how to
   make the best use of it in image classification problems has not been
   deeply investigated. In this paper, we introduce a series of novel image
   classification algorithms based on CW-SSIM and use handwritten digit
   recognition, and face recognition as examples for demonstration. Among
   the proposed approaches, the best compromise between accuracy and
   complexity is obtained by the CW-SSIM support vector machine based
   algorithms, which combines an unsupervised clustering method to divide
   the training images into clusters with representative images and a
   supervised learning method based on support vector machines to maximize
   the classification accuracy. Our experiments show that such a
   conceptually simple image classification method, which does not involve
   any registration, intensity normalization or sophisticated feature
   extraction processes, and does not rely on any modeling of the image
   patterns or distortion processes, achieves competitive performance with
   reduced computational cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for constructing seismic design
   spectra in near-fault regions. By analyzing the characteristics of
   near-fault pulse-type ground motions, an equivalent pulse model is
   proposed, which can well represent the characteristics of the near-fault
   forward-directivity and fling-step pulse-type ground motions. The
   normalized horizontal seismic design spectra for near-fault regions are
   presented using recorded near-fault pulse-type ground motions and
   equivalent pulse-type ground motions, which are derived based on the
   equivalent pulse model coupled with ground motion parameter attenuation
   relations. The normalized vertical seismic design spectra for near-fault
   regions are obtained by scaling the corresponding horizontal spectra
   with the vertical-to-horizontal acceleration spectral ratios of
   near-fault pulse-type ground motions. The proposed seismic design
   spectra appear to have relatively small dispersion in a statistical
   sense. The seismic design spectra for both horizontal and vertical
   directions can provide alternative spectral shapes for seismic design
   codes.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of metabolism in mammalian cell culture is closely linked
   to the process of apoptosis programmed cell death. Apoptosis negatively
   impacts culture viability, product yield, and quality. An improved

   improvements in product yield. This study presents a mathematical model
   that describes both the metabolic fluxes involving the extracellular
   metabolites and the progression of apoptosis in terms of intracellular
   caspases, and thus highlights the interactions between these two
   processes. The model is trained and validated against experimental
   observations of Chinese Hamster Ovary cell culture producing monoclonal
   antibody. Importantly, the model describes the continued production of
   monoclonal antibody in post exponential phase by incorporating different
   rates of antibody production for separate sub populations within the
   culture. A parameter estimability Lest was applied on the combined model
   to assess the confidence in parameter estimates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{M13 virus (phage) has been extensively used in phage display technology
   and nanomaterial templating. Our research aimed to use M13 phage to
   template sulfur nanoparticles for making lithium ion batteries.
   Traditional methods for harvesting M13 phage from Escherichia coli
   employ polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based precipitation, and the yield is
   usually measured by plaque counting. With this method, PEG residue is
   present in the M13 phage pellet and is difficult to eliminate. To
   resolve this issue, a method based on isoelectric precipitation was
   introduced and tested. The isoelectric method resulted in the production
   of purer phage with a higher yield, compared to the traditional
   PEG-based method. There is no significant variation in infectivity of
   the phage prepared using isoelectric precipitation, and the dynamic
   light scattering data indirectly prove that the phage structure is not
   damaged by pH adjustment. To maximize phage production, a dry-weight
   yield curve of M13 phage for various culture times was produced. The
   yield curve is proportional to the growth curve of E. coli. On a 200-mL
   culture scale, 0.2 g L-1 M13 phage (dry-weight) was produced by the
   isoelectric precipitation method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study energy harvesting from the beating of a
   biomimetic fish tail using ionic polymer-metal composites. The design of
   the biomimetic tail is based on carangiform swimmers and is specifically
   inspired by the morphology of the heterocercal tail of thresher sharks.
   The tail is constituted of a soft silicone matrix molded in the form of
   the heterocercal tail and reinforced by a steel beam of rectangular
   cross section. We propose a modeling framework for the underwater
   vibration of the biomimetic tail, wherein the tail is assimilated to a
   cantilever beam with rectangular cross section and heterogeneous
   physical properties. We focus on base excitation in the form of a
   superimposed rotation about a fixed axis and we consider the regime of
   moderately large-amplitude vibrations. In this context, the effect of
   the encompassing fluid is described through a hydrodynamic function,
   which accounts for inertial, viscous and convective phenomena. The model
   is validated through experiments in which the base excitation is
   systematically varied and the motion of selected points on the
   biomimetic tail tracked in time. The feasibility of harvesting energy
   from an ionic polymer-metal composite attached to the vibrating
   structure is experimentally and theoretically assessed. The response of
   the transducer is described using a black-box model, where the voltage
   output is controlled by the rate of change of the mean curvature.
   Experiments are performed to elucidate the impact of the shunting
   resistance, the frequency of the base excitation and the placement of
   the ionic polymer-metal composite on energy harvesting from the
   considered biomimetic tail.}},

Abstract = {{Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows for non-invasive 3D
   visualization of biological tissue at cellular level resolution. Often
   hindered by speckle noise, the visualization of important biological
   tissue details in OCT that can aid disease diagnosis can be improved by
   speckle noise compensation. A challenge with handling speckle noise is
   its inherent non-stationary nature, where the underlying noise
   characteristics vary with the spatial location. In this study, an
   innovative speckle noise compensation method is presented for handling
   the non-stationary traits of speckle noise in OCT imagery. The proposed
   approach centers on a non-stationary spline-based speckle noise modeling
   strategy to characterize the speckle noise. The novel method was applied
   to ultra high-resolution OCT (UHROCT) images of the human retina and
   corneo-scleral limbus acquired in-vivo that vary in tissue structure and
   optical properties. Test results showed improved performance of the
   proposed novel algorithm compared to a number of previously published
   speckle noise compensation approaches in terms of higher signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and better overall visual

Abstract = {{Rhodium catalysts are effective catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation of
   unsaturated polymers in aqueous media under optimum conditions.
   Hydrogenation of a nanosized polyisoprene (PIP) emulsion was carried out
   in a Parr reactor. Rhodium trichloride (RhCl3 center dot 3H(2)O) and
   different ligand types, triphenylphosphine (PPh3), trisulfonated
   triphenylphosphine (TPPTS) and monosulfonated triphenylphosphine (TPPMS)
   were used as a catalyst precursor. The hydrogenated PIP (HPIP) was
   characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1
   NMR). Low conversions of C=C were observed when RhCl3/PPh3 or
   RhCl3/TPPTS was used as catalyst precursors, however, 96.0\%
   hydrogenation (HD) was achieved when using RhCl3/TPPMS. The Hartley
   ionic spherical micelle model was proposed to explain the catalytic
   behavior. The process variables did not affect PIP particle size after
   hydrogenation. Mechanistic aspects of the hydrogenation of PIP in the
   presence of RhCl3/TPPMS were proposed on the basis of the observed
   kinetic results. Kinetic experiments for PIP hydrogenation in aqueous
   media indicate that the hydrogenation rate is first order with respect
   to catalyst and carbon-carbon double bond concentration. The
   hydrogenation rate was dependent on catalyst concentration, temperature
   and hydrogen pressure, and PIP particle size. The apparent activation
   energy over the temperature range of 120-140 degrees C was found to be
   117.0 kJ/mol. HPIP (96\%HD) has high thermal stability with a maximum
   decomposition temperature of 462 degrees C and a glass transition
   temperature of -49 degrees C. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that
   HPIP had a maximum storage modulus due to the saturated carbon domains
   of the ethylene segments in the polymer chains. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Although globally deployed for flicker assessment, the flickermeter
   presented by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard
   61000-4-15 has been proved to suffer from some deficiencies regarding
   voltage rectangular modulation and interharmonics. The latter results in
   flickermeter inability to accurately measure flicker for
   non-incandescent lamps, which are ubiquitous nowadays. The flickermeter
   inaccuracies tend to arise from its demodulator. So far, few solutions
   have been provided. Furthermore, the existing solutions deal with only
   the interharmonic case. This paper introduces a method to address IEC
   flickermeter deficiencies by developing a digital signal processing
   block that demodulates the voltage in a real-time manner for voltages
   that include interharmonics or are affected by rectangular modulation.
   The suggested demodulator implements discrete Fourier transform inside a
   sliding window. For rectangular modulation, this approach is used to
   demodulate the voltage. Meanwhile, for the interharmonics problem, this
   approach provides the interharmonic frequency. Using the measured
   frequency, least error squares technique is then employed inside another
   sliding window to find the interharmonics amplitude. On this basis, a
   modified flickermeter is devised. Performance of the modified
   flickermeter is evaluated and its effectiveness is verified using the
   results obtained from an experimental set-up. The contribution of this
   paper is not limited to IEC flickermeter modification; the proposed
   method can be employed for any application requiring interharmonic
   measurement.}},

Title = {{Bayesian road safety analysis: Incorporation of past evidence and effect
   of hyper-prior choice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{31-40}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Problem: This paper aims to address two related issues when applying
   hierarchical Bayesian models for road safety analysis, namely: (a) how
   to incorporate available information from previous studies or past
   experiences in the (hyper) prior distributions for model parameters and
   (b) what are the potential benefits of incorporating past evidence on
   the results of a road safety analysis when working with scarce accident
   data (i.e., when calibrating models with crash datasets characterized by
   a very low average number of accidents and a small number of sites).
   Method: A simulation framework was developed to evaluate the performance
   of alternative hyper-priors including informative and non-informative
   Gamma, Pareto, as well as Uniform distributions. Based on this
   simulation framework, different data scenarios (i.e., number of
   observations and years of data) were defined and tested using crash data
   collected at 3-legged rural intersections in California and crash data
   collected for rural 4-lane highway segments in Texas. Results: This
   study shows how the accuracy of model parameter estimates (inverse
   dispersion parameter) is considerably improved when incorporating past
   evidence, in particular when working with the small number of
   observations and crash data with low mean. The results also illustrates
   that when the sample size (more than 100 sites) and the number of years
   of crash data is relatively large, neither the incorporation of past
   experience nor the choice of the hyper-prior distribution may affect the
   final results of a traffic safety analysis. Conclusions: As a potential
   solution to the problem of low sample mean and small sample size, this
   paper suggests some practical guidance on how to incorporate past
   evidence into informative hyper-priors. By combining evidence from past
   studies and data available, the model parameter estimates can
   significantly be improved. The effect of prior choice seems to be less
   important on the hotspot identification. Impact on Industry: The results
   show the benefits of incorporating prior information when working with
   limited crash data in road safety studies. (C) 2013 National Safety

Abstract = {{Capsule endoscopes used for diagnosis in the gastro intestinal tract
   have gained much popularity in recent years due to the minimized patient
   discomfort and available operating range. New therapeutic applications
   of these devices are surgical interventions or medication at specific
   locations. So far capsule endoscopic devices are passively propelled
   prohibiting these new approaches. To overcome this issue we presented a
   Magnet Drive Unit (MDU) for external actuation for robotic capsule
   devices in our previous work. While MDU is used for manipulation of a
   capsule-robot, there has not been any information of the current
   location of the robot within the patient. Therefore, we propose a novel
   ultrasound based tracking system for the capsule-robot and endoscopic
   devices in this manuscript. The tracking system consists of a Cartesian
   robot actuating a transcutaneous sonographic probe in two degrees of
   freedom. While the capsule-robot is propelled by MDU, our tracking
   system generates sonographic images through the back of the patient
   showing the current location of the capsule. The results of our
   experiments unveil that our concept is feasible and can be used to
   navigate a robotic capsule device inside the human body.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration energy harvesting devices have shown potential applications to
   power many devices such as electronic self-sustainable units. Most
   traditional linear energy harvesters exploit the phenomenon of resonance
   to produce electric power. Nonlinear energy harvesters, however, present
   more interesting alternatives and there is potential for them to work
   well over relatively wider bandwidths due to characteristics such as
   bifurcation. The aim of this study is to introduce an alternative design
   to a nonlinear electromagnetic energy harvesting device to improve the
   power production of the unit. The configuration presented in the
   following work has demonstrated higher power efficiency over a wider
   range of frequencies compared to the previous design. The numerical
   power outputs for both designs are compared and validated against their
   experimental values. Finally, the validated numerical model is used to
   find the optimal design to produce the maximum power for the unit(2).}},

   controllers can be tuned by perturbing only the initial conditions of
   the servocompensator, and that the order of the resulting controller can
   be specified by the designer. Implementation of the proposed controller

Abstract = {{The effects of the lack of penetration flaw and misalignment on fatigue
   life of cruciform welded joints made of low-alloy steel were studied
   experimentally and theoretically. It was found that two locations of
   fatigue fracture were possible under cyclic tension loading, depending
   on the relative magnitude of the misalignment. In the absence of
   misalignment, all fatigue failures occurred as a result of fatigue
   growth of cracks emanating from the weld root. In the presence of
   misalignment, fatigue life depended on the fatigue growth of cracks
   growing from the weld toe. It has been shown that the entire fatigue
   life can be modeled as a fatigue growth of cracks starting either from
   the weld toe or the weld root. The initial crack size was selected as a
   small crack characteristic for a given material, i.e., being dependent
   only on the material. The weight function method was used to calculate

Abstract = {{The Bacteriophage lambda capsid protein gpD has been used extensively
   for fusion polypeptides that can be expressed from plasmids in
   Escherichia coli and remain soluble. In this study, a genetically
   controlled dual expression system for the display of enhanced green
   fluorescent protein (eGFP) was developed and characterized. Wild-type D
   protein (gpD) expression is encoded by lambda Dam15 infecting phage
   particles, which can only produce a functional gpD protein when
   translated in amber suppressor strains of E. coli in the absence of
   complementing gpD from a plasmid. However, the isogenic suppressors vary
   dramatically in their ability to restore functional packaging to lambda
   Dam15, imparting the first dimension of decorative control. In
   combination, the D-fusion protein, gpD::eGFP, was supplied in trans from
   a multicopy temperature-inducible expression plasmid, influencing
   D::eGFP expression and hence the availability of gpD::eGFP to complement
   for the Dam15 mutation and decorate viable phage progeny. Despite being
   the worst suppressor, maximal incorporation of gpD::eGFP into the lambda
   Dam15 phage capsid was imparted by the SupD strain, conferring a gpDQ68S
   substitution, induced for plasmid expression of pD::eGFP. Differences in
   size, fluorescence and absolute protein decoration between phage
   preparations could be achieved by varying the temperature of and the
   suppressor host carrying the pD::eGFP plasmid. The effective preparation
   with these two variables provides a simple means by which to manage
   fusion decoration on the surface of phage lambda.}},

Abstract = {{The failure to understand the mechanisms of biomaterial-associated
   thrombosis prevents us from improving the blood compatibility of stents
   and mechanical heart valves. Blood-material interactions trigger a
   complex series of events and anticoagulant and anti-platelet therapies
   are needed to reduce the risks of thrombotic complications with most
   cardiovascular materials. While material interaction with platelets has
   been widely studied, little is currently known on material-induced
   leukocyte activation in the presence of shear. Invitro experiments were
   performed to assess the effect of flow on blood cell activation induced
   by medical grade metals, ST316L and TiAl6V4. Blood was circulated in
   flow chambers preloaded with or without metal wires at shear rates of
   100, 500, and 1500s(-1). Platelet and leukocyte activation,
   leukocyte-platelet aggregation, and tissue factor expression on
   monocytes were measured by flow cytometry. Metal surfaces were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Under physiological shear
   rates, no significant platelet microparticle formation was observed.
   However, significant CD11b up-regulation, leukocyte-platelet aggregates,
   and tissue factor expression were observed at 100s(-1). As shear rate
   increased to 1500s(-1), leukocyte activation reduced to control values.
   TiAl6V4-induced leukocyte activation was generally lower than that of
   ST316L. Adhesion significantly decreased with increasing shear rate to
   1500s(-1). In blood, increase within physiological shear rates led to a
   significant reduction in invitro material-induced leukocyte activation,
   suggesting that difference between material biocompatibility may be
   better identified at low shear rates or under pathological shear
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We present recent progress in the growth of nitride based laser diodes
   (LDs) made by Plasma Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE). In this
   work we demonstrate continuous wave (cw) LDs grown by PAMBE operating in
   the range 430-460 nm. The LDs were grown on c-plane bulk GaN substrates
   with threading dislocation densities (TDDs) ranging from 10(3) cm(-2) to
   10(7) cm(-2). The low TDDs allowed fabrication of cw LDs with the
   lifetime exceeding 2000 h at 10 mW of optical output power. The maximum
   output power for these LDs was 80 mW. We used AlGaN cladding-free design
   of LDs with InGaN waveguides. The key element to achieve lasing for
   wavelengths above 450 nm was substantial increase of the nitrogen flux
   available for growth in PAMBE. The increase of N flux is beneficial for
   growth of efficient InGaN QWs, which allowed demonstration of optically
   pumped lasing from single quantum well InGaN laser structures at 501 nm.

Abstract = {{A data-centric, capability-focused approach is proposed to facilitate
   the architecture modeling and analysis of challenging system-of-systems
   (SoS). This approach abstracts essential information from the underlying
   complexity with the architecture modeling in a data-centric and
   semantically consistent fashion, and allows early understanding and
   exploration of the logical, behavioral, and performance characteristics
   to achieve the desired capabilities. More specifically, a high-level
   data meta-model, depicting the semantic relationships of constituent
   architectural data elements, is first presented to guide the
   architectural data modeling, which is aligned well with the US
   Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Meta-model (DM2).
   Then, the development of architectural descriptions and the construction
   of executable models are studied based on the core architectural data
   elements. Additionally, architecture analysis using static and
   executable models are discussed, including static analysis, dynamic
   analysis, and experimental analysis. The feasibility of the foregoing
   approach is demonstrated with an illustrative example. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{In Bingham plastic fluids, a central pre-yield or plug region exists in
   the middle of the concentric annular flow. In this region, the local
   shear stress is less than the dynamic yield stress, so the plug behaves
   like a rigid solid. This is the main feature that distinguishes the flow
   of a Bingham plastic fluid from that of a power law fluid. In this work,
   a simple-to-use correlation is developed to predict the boundaries of
   the plug of Bingham plastic fluids for laminar flow through annulus as a
   function of dimensionless yield stress and aspect ratio parameters for
   given values of the rheological constants, pressure gradient and the
   dimensions of the annulus. The results are found to be in excellent
   agreement with reported data in the literature with an average absolute
   deviation of less than 1.7\%. The predictive tool is simple and
   straightforward and can be readily implemented in a standard spreadsheet
   program. The prime application of the method is as a quick-and-easy
   evaluation tool in engineering studies where plug boundaries of Bingham
   plastic fluids for laminar flow through annulus are being considered.
   The method may also serve as a benchmark in numerical and rigorous
   simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Real-life construction projects are large in size and are challenged by
   many constraints, including strict deadlines and resource limits. In
   this paper, constraint programming (CP) is used as an advanced
   mathematical technique that suits schedule optimization problems. A
   practical CP optimization model has been developed to resolve both
   deadline and resource constraints simultaneously in large-scale
   projects. The proposed CP model is much faster than metaheuristic
   techniques and provides a set of feasible project durations that do not
   violate resource limits. The paper compares the CP results with several
   case studies from the literature to prove the practicality and
   usefulness of the CP approach to both researchers and practitioners. The
   CP model of this paper could provide solutions within 6.5\% deviation
   from optimum schedules for a large project of 2,000 activities within
   minutes of processing time. This paper thus contributes to introducing a
   superior optimization model that is suitable for large-size projects and
   helps to render schedule optimization a mainstream cost-saving function

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hands-on exercise on construction project
   management to augment traditional teaching methods and help students
   improve their construction experience and project management skills. The
   exercise involved 100 students participating in managing and
   constructing a 3.8-m (12.5-ft) model of Canada's CN Tower within a
   30-min deadline. Before construction, the groups prepared method
   statements, cost estimates, and schedules for constructing the model.
   During construction, the groups had to manage limited resources,
   procurement challenges, and forced interruptions to keep the project on
   track. To experience new project-tracking methods, students were
   introduced to a voice-based prototype for collecting progress
   information and automatically updating the schedule. The results
   indicate that students gained better understanding of the real
   construction environment and how to apply their acquired construction
   management skills to handle the involved complexities and
   interdependencies. The paper can be of interest mainly to researchers
   and educators. It presents the design, planning, and implementation of
   this educational exercise and discusses its practicality and ability to

Abstract = {{Trucking industry growth increases loads on existing roads and may raise
   the possibility of overloaded vehicles, which consequently cause
   significant damage to pavement. Weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology
   improves weight enforcement activities by increasing the capacity of
   static weigh stations and provides traffic monitoring and traffic data
   for pavement research and design. However, there is still a lack of
   knowledge about the behavior of WIM sensors installed in different
   environments, which affects reliable and precise data gathering.
   Therefore, different types of piezoelectric WIM systems, including
   quartz, polymer, and ceramic sensors, were installed at the Center for
   Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) test sites of the
   University of Waterloo in Canada. The objective of this research is to
   explore the behavior of piezoelectric WIM sensors under different load
   conditions specifically for the polarized sensors, which illustrated
   heteroscedasticity in weight estimations caused by inconsistent variance
   of estimations. The issue was solved by transformation of variables,
   which resulted in constructing a compensation curve. The investigated
   effect of the weight factor will assist in the recommendation of
   improved benefits of the least expensive WIM technology. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Operational state of many miniaturized devices deals with flow field in
   microchannels. Pressure-driven flow (PDF) and electroosmotic flow (EOF)
   can be recognized as the two most important types of the flow field in
   such channels. EOF has many advantages in comparison with PDF, such as
   being vibration free and not requiring any external mechanical pumps or
   moving parts. However, the disadvantages of this type of flow such as
   Joule heating, electrophoresis demixing, and not being suitable for
   mobile devices must be taken into consideration carefully. By using
   mixed electroosmotic/pressure-driven flow, the role of EOF in producing
   desired velocity profile will be reduced. In this way, the advantages of
   EOF can be exploited, and its disadvantages can be prevented. Induced
   pressure gradient can be utilized in order to control the separation in
   the system. Furthermore, in many complicated geometries such as T-shape
   microchannels, turns may induce pressure gradient to the electroosmotic
   velocity. While analytical formulas are completely essential for
   analysis and control of any industrial and laboratory microdevices, lack
   of such formulas in the literature for solving Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation and predicting electroosmotic velocity field in rectangular
   domains is evident. In the present study, first a novel method is
   proposed to solve Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE). Subsequently, this
   solution is utilized to find the electroosmotic and the mixed
   electroosmotic/pressure-driven velocity profile in a rectangular domain
   of the microchannels. To demonstrate the accuracy of the presented
   analytical method in solving PBE and finding electroosmotic velocity, a
   general nondimensional example is analyzed, and the results are compared
   with the solution of boundary element method. Additionally, the effects
   of different nondimensional parameters and also aspect ratio of channels
   on the electroosmotic part of the flow field will be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The need of a medium access control (MAC) protocol for an efficient
   broadcast service is of great importance to support the high-priority
   safety applications in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This paper
   introduces VeMAC, a novel multichannel TDMA MAC protocol proposed
   specifically for a VANET scenario. The VeMAC supports efficient one-hop
   and multihop broadcast services on the control channel by using implicit
   acknowledgments and eliminating the hidden terminal problem. The
   protocol reduces transmission collisions due to node mobility on the
   control channel by assigning disjoint sets of time slots to vehicles
   moving in opposite directions and to road side units. Analysis and
   simulation results in highway and city scenarios are presented to
   evaluate the performance of VeMAC and compare it with ADHOC MAC, an
   existing TDMA MAC protocol for VANETs. It is shown that, due to its
   ability to decrease the rate of transmission collisions, the VeMAC
   protocol can provide significantly higher throughput on the control
   channel than ADHOC MAC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for solving channel assignment
   problems (CAPs) in hexagonal cellular networks with nonhomogeneous
   demands in a 2-band buffering system (where channel interference does
   not extend beyond two cells). The CAP with nonhomogeneous demand is
   first partitioned into a sequence of smaller subproblems, each of which
   has a homogeneous demand from a subset of the nodes of the original
   network. Solution to such a subproblem constitutes an assignment phase,
   where multiple homogeneous demands are assigned to the nodes
   corresponding to the subproblem, satisfying all the frequency separation
   constraints. The whole assignment process for the original network
   consists of a succession of multiple homogeneous assignments for all the
   subproblems. Based on this concept, we present a polynomial time
   approximation algorithm for solving the CAP for cellular networks having
   nonhomogeneous demands. Our proposed assignment algorithm, when executed
   on well-known benchmark instances, comes up with an assignment which is
   always within about 6 percent more than the optimal bandwidth, but
   requires a very small execution time (less than 5 millisecond on a
   HPxw8400 workstation). The proposed algorithm is very much suitable for
   real-life situations, where fast channel assignment is of primary
   importance, tolerating, however, a marginal deviation (6 percent) from
   the optimal bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical nonstationary stochastic analysis
   scheme using pseudo-excitation method (PEM) for seismic analysis of
   long-span structures under tridirectional spatially varying ground
   motions, based on which the local site effects on structural seismic
   response are studied for a high-pier railway bridge. An
   absolute-response-oriented scheme of PEM in nonstationary stochastic
   analysis of structure under tridirectional spatial seismic motions, in
   conjunction with the derived mathematical scheme in modeling
   tridirectional nonstationary spatially correlated ground motions, is
   proposed to resolve the drawbacks of conventional indirect approach. To
   apply the proposed theoretical approach readily in stochastic seismic
   analysis of complex and significant structures, this scheme is
   implemented and verified in a general finite element platform, and is
   then applied to a high-pier railway bridge under spatially varying
   ground motions considering the local site effect and the effect of
   ground motion nonstationarity. Conclusions are drawn and can be applied
   in the actual seismic design and analysis of high-pier railway bridges
   under tridirectional nonstationary multiple excitations. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A stochastic structure for single and multi-agent level set method is
   investigated in this article in an attempt to overcome local optima
   problems in image segmentation. Like other global optimization methods
   that take advantage of random operators and multi-individual search
   algorithms, the best agent in this proposed algorithm plays the role of
   leader in order to enable the algorithm to find the global solution. To
   accomplish this, the procedure employs a set of stochastic partial
   differential equations (SPDE), each one of which evolves based on its
   own stochastic dynamics. The agents are then compelled to simultaneously
   converge to the best available topology. Moreover, the stochastic
   dynamics of each agent extends the stochastic level set approach by
   using a multi source structure. Each source is a delta function centered
   on a point of evolving front. Lastly, while the computational costs of
   these methods are higher than the region-based level set method, the
   probability of finding the global solution is significantly increased.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{360-365}},

Abstract = {{Composites of Zinc oxide (ZnO) with reduced graphite oxide (rGO) were
   synthesized and used as adsorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at 300
   degrees C. Various characterization methods (TGA, XRD, FT-IR, TEM and
   XPS) were performed in order to link their H2S adsorption performance to
   the properties of the adsorbent's surface. Microwave-assisted reduction
   process of graphite oxide (GO) provided mild reduction environment,
   allowing oxygen-containing functional groups to remain on the rGO
   surface. It was confirmed that for the ZnO/rGO synthesize using the
   microwave-assisted reduction method, the ZnO particle size and the
   degree of ZnO dispersion remained stable over time at 300 degrees C,
   which was not the case for only the ZnO particles themselves. This
   stable highly dispersed feature allows for sustained high surface area
   over time. This was confirmed through breakthrough experiments for H2S
   adsorption where it was found that the ZnO/rGO composite showed almost
   four times higher ZnO utilization efficiency than ZnO itself. The effect
   of the H-2 and CO2 on H2S adsorption was also investigated. The presence
   of hydrogen in the H2S stream had a positive effect on the removal of
   H2S since it allows a reducing environment for Zn-O and Zn-S bonds,
   leading to more active sites (Zn2+) to sulfur molecules. On the other
   hand, the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) showed the opposite trend,
   likely due to the oxidation environment and also due to possible
   competitive adsorption between H2S and CO2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of discrete pitch-based carbon fibres on

   incorporating 0\%, 0.25\%, 0.5\%, 0.75\% and 1\% carbon fibres by
   concrete volume with two water-to-binder ratios (0.35 and 0.40). The
   flowing ability (filling ability and passing ability) of the concrete
   mixtures was determined with respect to slump flow, J-ring slump flow,
   and T-50 slump flow time. The segregation resistance of the concrete
   mixtures was evaluated by using the sieve stability test. Visual
   stability index (VSI) was also used to assess the segregation resistance
   of concrete. Moreover, the freshly mixed concrete mixtures were tested
   for air content and unit weight. The hardened concretes were tested by a
   Scanning Electron Microscope to observe the distribution of fibres. Test
   results revealed that the increased amount of carbon fibres decreased
   the filling ability and passing ability of concrete. However, carbon
   fibres had no adverse effects on the segregation resistance of concrete.
   Also, no significant air entrapment occurred in the presence of carbon
   fibres. Carbon fibres were well-distributed and they slightly decreased
   the unit weight of concrete. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a comprehensive model of pasta drying combining Neumann
   boundary conditions, differential shrinkage and with consideration of
   the constant drying rate period and falling drying rate period was
   investigated through sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Results
   confirmed that shrinkage, moisture loss and drying rate during the
   constant drying rate period and external resistance to mass transfer did
   not have a significant impact on the predicted required drying time. The
   predicted required drying time was influenced predominantly by the
   effective moisture diffusion coefficient. A correlation to estimate the
   effective moisture diffusion coefficient was developed from published
   values and was used to predict the required drying time with an
   uncertainty of +/- 3.5 h at a 90\% confidence interval. Since this
   magnitude of uncertainty is unreasonable for most industrial uses,
   accurate data collection of effective moisture diffusivity should be
   viewed as a major objective in pasta drying research. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic sensors are able to provide highly accurate measurements if
   they are properly scheduled, otherwise, the intersensor interference
   (ISI) could greatly deteriorate the performance. In addition, the
   scheduling scheme should be performed in a distributed and
   energy-efficient way so that it can be conveniently implemented for a
   large-scale network. In this paper, for target tracking with multiple
   ultrasonic sensors, we convert the ISI avoidance problem to the problem
   of multiple access in a shared channel and adopt the time division
   multiple access strategy which has the properties of being collision
   free and energy efficient. Then, by graph theory, the scheduling problem
   is transformed into a coloring problem which aims at minimizing the
   number of used colors. Since the original problem has been proved to be
   NP-hard, we propose a distributed-saturation-degree-based algorithm
   (DSDA) which can be implemented locally by each node with information
   collected from its neighbors. Furthermore, we verify that an
   interference-free schedule is guaranteed to be obtained by DSDA. We
   derive analytical results for the complexity of this algorithm.
   Specifically, for different sensor network topologies, we prove that the
   expected converging time and the expected message transmissions per node
   are both upper bounded by O(delta), where delta is the maximum
   neighborhood size in the network. Extensive simulations demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our algorithm.}},

Title = {{Effect of Metal-Support Interface During CH4 and H-2 Dissociation on
   Ni/gamma-Al2O3: A Density Functional Theory Study}},

Abstract = {{Methane and hydrogen dissociation are important reactions in carbon
   nanotube (CNT) and hydrogen production. Although there is extensive
   literature on theoretical studies for CH4 and H-2 dissociation on Ni,
   little is known about the effect of the oxide support, especially the
   metal-support interface, on the dissociation properties of CH4 and H-2.
   In this study, the dissociations of CH4 and H-2 on Ni cluster supported
   on gamma-alumina were investigated using density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. Two systems: Ni-4 cluster supported on the spinel model of
   gamma-Al2O3 (100) surface, S(Ni-4), and on the nonspinel model of
   gamma-Al2O3 (100) surface, NS(Ni-4), have been used to model
   Ni-4/gamma-Al2O3. For both models, it was found that CH4 and H-2
   dissociations are kinetically preferred at the Ni-2 site located at the
   nickel-alumina interface when compared with the top of the Ni cluster.
   Also, the study of CH3 and H adsorption on different sites of the S(Ni,)
   and NS(Ni-4) show that CH3 and H bonded with the Ni-2 atom at
   Ni-4/gamma-Al2O3 interface are more stable than at the top site
   adsorption. Moreover, the calculation of the metal-support interaction
   indicates that molecular adsorption on the Ni particle weakened its
   interaction with the oxide. Hirshfeld charge analysis showed that the
   surface Al atom works primarily as a charge donation partner when CH3
   and H are bonded with the Ni-2 atom at the interface. This also resulted
   in an upshift of the d-orbital around the Fermi energy of the Ni-2 atom,
   which finally stabilized the interface adsorption by this Al
   (donor)-Ni-adsorbates (acceptor) effect. The results obtained from the
   DFT calculations indicate that the metal-oxide interface plays an
   essential role in the dissociation of CH4 and H-2.}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature nanojoining is an important phenomenon that has to be
   understood well for use in different applications, for example, for
   assembly of nanoscale building blocks into nanoscale and microscale
   structures and devices. However, the mechanism for nanoparticle joining
   at room temperature is not well established. In this research, we
   employed molecular dynamics simulation to explain how and why silver
   nanodisks are joined/assembled but with their original shape unchanged.
   To support our theoretical observations, we compared our simulation
   results to SEM and HRTEM observations of joined silver nanodisks. It was
   found that joining at a wide temperature range (1-500 K) can be done
   through short movement and rearrangement of surface atoms and subsequent
   elastic or plastic deformation of the particles, resulting in perfect
   crystal alignment at the joint interface. Our simulation shows the
   crystal defects such as dislocations due to initial lattice mismatch of
   the crystals can be sintered out to yield a perfect crystalline
   structure at the interface between joined particles, which is supported
   by the experimental observations.}},

   with ideally tailoring the physical properties of the catalyst support
   properties has proven very challenging. Using sulfur doped graphene (SG)
   as a support material, the heterogeneous dopant atoms could serve as
   nucleation sites allowing for the preparation of SG supported Pt
   nanowire arrays with ultra-thin diameters (2-5 nm) and dense surface
   coverage. Detailed investigation of the preparation technique reveals
   that the structure of the resulting composite could be readily
   controlled by fine tuning the Pt nanowire nucleation and growth reaction
   kinetics and the Pt-support interactions, whereby a mechanistic platinum
   nanowire array growth model is proposed. Electrochemical
   characterization demonstrates that the composite materials have 2-3
   times higher catalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction and
   methanol oxidation reaction compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed magnetotransport experiments in the high-temperature
   regime (up to 50 K) of the integer quantum Hall effect for
   two-dimensional electron gases in semiconducting heterostructures. While
   the magnetic field dependence of the classical Hall law presents no
   anomaly at high temperatures, we find a breakdown of the Drude-Lorentz
   law for the longitudinal conductance beyond a crossover magnetic field
   B-c similar or equal to 1 T, which turns out to be correlated with the
   onset of the integer quantum Hall effect at low temperatures. We show
   that the high magnetic field regime at B > B-c can be understood in
   terms of classical percolative transport in a smooth disordered
   potential. From the temperature dependence of the peak longitudinal
   conductance, we extract scaling exponents which are in good agreement
   with the theoretically expected values. We also prove that inelastic
   scattering on phonons is responsible for dissipation in a wide
   temperature range going from 1 to 50 K at high magnetic fields.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the multichannel exposed terminal problem in
   multihop wireless networks. We propose a multichannel medium access
   control (MAC) protocol, called multichannel MAC protocol with hopping
   reservation (MMAC-HR), to resolve the multichannel exposed terminal
   problem. MMAC-HR uses two radio interfaces; one interface is fixed over
   the control channel, and the other interface switches dynamically
   between data channels. The fixed interface supports broadcast
   information and reserves a data channel for any data transmission. The
   switchable interface, on other hand, is for data exchanges and follows
   independent slow hopping without requiring clock synchronization. In
   addition, the proposed protocol is a distributed one. By using the ns-2
   simulator, extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate that
   MMAC-HR can enhance the network throughput and delay compared with
   existing multichannel MAC protocol. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Xiawanggang River region is considered to be one of the most polluted
   areas in China due to its huge amount discharge of pollutants and
   accumulation for years. As it is one branch of Xiang River and the area
   downstream is Changsha city, the capital of Hunan Province, the
   ecological niche of Xiawangang River is very important. The pollution
   treatment in this area was emphasized in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of
   Chinese government for Xiang River Water Environmental Pollution
   Control. In order to assess the heavy metal pollution and provide the
   base information in this region for The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, contents
   and fractions of four heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) covering both
   sediments and soils were analyzed to study their contamination state.
   Three different indexes were applied to assess the pollution extent. The
   results showed this area was severely polluted by the four heavy metals,
   and the total concentrations exceeded the Chinese environmental quality
   standard for soil, grade III, especially for Cd. Moreover, Cd, rated as
   being in high risk, had a high mobility as its great contents of
   exchangeable and carbonates fractions in spite of its relative low
   content. Regression analysis revealed clay could well explain the
   regression equation for Cd, Cu and Zn while pH and sand could
   significantly interpret the regression equation for Pb. Moreover, there
   was a significant correlation between Non-residual fraction and I-geo
   for all the four metals. Correlation analysis showed four metals maybe
   had similar pollution sources.}},

Title = {{Correlated diffusion imaging}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death
   in the male population. Fortunately, the prognosis is excellent if
   detected at an early stage. Hence, the detection and localization of
   prostate cancer is crucial for diagnosis, as well as treatment via
   targeted focal therapy. New imaging techniques can potentially be
   invaluable tools for improving prostate cancer detection and
   localization.
   Methods: In this study, we introduce a new form of diffusion magnetic
   resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging, where the tissue
   being imaged is characterized by the joint correlation of diffusion
   signal attenuation across multiple gradient pulse strengths and timings.
   By taking into account signal attenuation at different water diffusion
   motion sensitivities, correlated diffusion imaging can provide improved
   delineation between cancerous tissue and healthy tissue when compared to
   existing diffusion imaging modalities.
   Results: Quantitative evaluation using receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curve analysis, tissue class separability analysis, and visual
   assessment by an expert radiologist were performed to study correlated
   diffusion imaging for the task of prostate cancer diagnosis. These
   results are compared with that obtained using T2-weighted imaging and
   standard diffusion imaging (via the apparent diffusion coefficient
   (ADC)). Experimental results suggest that correlated diffusion imaging
   provide improved delineation between healthy and cancerous tissue and
   may have potential as a diagnostic tool for cancer detection and
   localization in the prostate gland.
   Conclusions: A new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called
   correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) was developed for the purpose of
   aiding radiologists in cancer detection and localization in the prostate
   gland. Preliminary results show CDI shows considerable promise as a
   diagnostic aid for radiologists in the detection and localization of
   prostate cancer.}},

Title = {{Review of fall risk assessment in geriatric populations using inertial
   sensors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Falls are a prevalent issue in the geriatric population and
   can result in damaging physical and psychological consequences. Fall
   risk assessment can provide information to enable appropriate
   interventions for those at risk of falling. Wearable
   inertial-sensor-based systems can provide quantitative measures
   indicative of fall risk in the geriatric population.
   Methods: Forty studies that used inertial sensors to evaluate geriatric
   fall risk were reviewed and pertinent methodological features were
   extracted; including, sensor placement, derived parameters used to
   assess fall risk, fall risk classification method, and fall risk
   classification model outcomes.
   Results: Inertial sensors were placed only on the lower back in the
   majority of papers (65\%). One hundred and thirty distinct variables
   were assessed, which were categorized as position and angle (7.7\%),
   angular velocity (11.5\%), linear acceleration (20\%), spatial (3.8\%),
   temporal (23.1\%), energy (3.8\%), frequency (15.4\%), and other
   (14.6\%). Fallers were classified using retrospective fall history
   (30\%), prospective fall occurrence (15\%), and clinical assessment
   (32.5\%), with 22.5\% using a combination of retrospective fall
   occurrence and clinical assessments. Half of the studies derived models
   for fall risk prediction, which reached high levels of accuracy
   (62-100\%), specificity (35-100\%), and sensitivity (55-99\%).
   Conclusions: Inertial sensors are promising sensors for fall risk
   assessment. Future studies should identify fallers using prospective
   techniques and focus on determining the most promising sensor sites, in
   conjunction with determination of optimally predictive variables.
   Further research should also attempt to link predictive variables to
   specific fall risk factors and investigate disease populations that are
   at high risk of falls.}},

Abstract = {{Simplified phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PHOLEDs) have
   better efficiency performance but their lifetime is shorter compared to
   that of standard PHOLEDs. In this work, we find that their shorter
   lifetime is due to exciton-induced degradation of the indium tin oxide
   (ITO)/organic interface. The excitons are created by the recombination
   of electrons leaked from the emission layer with holes injected from the
   ITO. Reducing electrons at the interface reduces this degradation
   process, hence increases device lifetime. Introducing a layer of
   2,6-bis{[}3-(carbazol-9-yl)phenyl] pyridine (26DCzPPy) at the ITO
   interface results in an increase in device lifetime by one order of
   magnitude while maintaining the same efficiency. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

   data from kinetic experiments performed in a lab-scale semi-batch
   reactor. Four parameters are required to describe the activity of the
   catalyst: the polymerization rate constant and three site transformation
   rate constants. The model is able to reproduce changes in the rate
   profiles in response to reactant concentrations. The fits of the model
   to the data are comparable to those in similar studies.}},

Abstract = {{Disability glare due to scattering of light causes a reduction in visual
   performance due to a luminous veil over the scene. This causes problem
   such as contrast detection. In this note, we report a study of the
   effect of this veiling luminance on human stereoscopic vision. We
   measured the effect of glare on the horopter measured using the apparent
   fronto-parallel plane (AFPP) criterion. The empirical longitudinal
   horopter measured using the AFPP criterion was analyzed using the
   so-called analytic plot. The analytic plot parameters were used for
   quantitative measurement of binocular vision. Image degradation plays a
   major effect on binocular vision as measured by the horopter. Under the
   conditions tested, it appears that if vision is sufficiently degraded
   then the addition of disability glare does not seem to significantly
   cause any further compromise in depth perception as measured by the
   horopter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new approach for video super resolution problem.
   To this end Compressive Sensing (CS) theory along with contourlet
   transform has been used. In CS framework the signal is assumed to be
   sparse in a transform domain. An approach has been suggested using this
   fact in which contourlet domain is used as the transform domain and a CS
   algorithm helps to find the high resolution frame. A post processing
   step is applied afterward to the estimated outputs to increase the
   quality. The post processing step consists of a deblurring term and a
   Bilateral Total Variation (BTV) filter for increasing the consistency.
   This method helps to relax the conditions on hardware and increase the
   quality of the video after capturing, in fact the quality of the video
   streams in consumer applications can be increased even the capturing
   device represents the scene in a low resolution format. Experimental
   results show significant improvement over existing super resolution
   methods in both objective and subjective quality.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A service restoration process is achieved through the switching actions
   of the sectionalizing and tie switches in distribution feeders. After
   the faults have been located and isolated, restoration plans are applied
   in order to minimize the de-energized consumer load and the number of
   switching operations. All of these objectives are converted to monetary
   costs, which are then added together into a global objective. The
   solution to the problem, which is based on a genetic algorithm, is then
   aimed at achieving the minimum cost. In this work, numerous practical
   aspects related to service restoration have been considered, such as
   variations in the load and the priorities of the customers, price
   discounts for in-service customers based on their participation in a
   load-curtailment scheme that permits other customers to be supplied, the
   presence of manual and automated switches, and the incorporation of
   distributed generation (dispatchable and wind-based DG units) in the
   restoration process. The constraints involved include voltage limits,
   line current limits, and radial topology. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Schedulability analysis of hierarchical real-time embedded systems
   involves defining interfaces that represent the underlying system
   faithfully and then compositionally analyzing those interfaces. Whereas
   commonly used abstractions, such as periodic and sporadic tasks and
   their interfaces, are simple and well studied, results for more complex
   and expressive abstractions and interfaces based on task graphs and
   automata are limited. One contributory factor may be the hardness of
   compositional schedulability analysis with task graphs and automata.
   Recently, conditional task models, such as the recurring branching task
   model, have been introduced with the goal of reaching a middle ground in
   the trade-off between expressivity and ease of analysis. Consequently,
   techniques for compositional analysis with conditional models have also
   been proposed, and each offer different advantages. In this work, we
   revisit those techniques, compare their advantages using an automotive
   case study, and identify limitations that would need to be addressed
   before adopting these techniques for use with real-world problems.}},

Abstract = {{A novel drug delivery system based on two of the most abundant natural
   biopolymers was developed by modifying the surface of oxidized cellulose
   nanocrystal (CNC) with chitosan oligosaccharide (CSOS). First, the
   primary alcohol moieties of CNC were selectively oxidized to carboxyl
   groups using the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical catalyst.
   The amino groups of CSOS were then reacted with carboxylic acid groups
   on oxidized CNC (CNC-OX) via the carbodiimide reaction using
   N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
   as coupling agents. Successful grafting of CSOS to CNC-OX was confirmed
   by infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, potentiometric titration,
   and zeta potential measurements. The grafting resulted in a conversion
   of similar to 90 \% carboxyl groups on CNC-OX and the degree of
   substitution was 0.26. CNC-CSOS nanoparticles showed a binding
   efficiency of 21.5 \% and a drug loading of 14 \% w/w. A drug selective
   electrode was used to directly measure the concentration of procaine
   hydrochloride released from CNC-CSOS particles. The in vitro drug
   release was studied at pH 8 and the nanoparticles revealed a fast
   release of up to 1 h, which can be used as biocompatible and
   biodegradable drug carriers for transdermal delivery applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we study the growth mechanisms of InGaN in plasma-assisted

   regime, in the range in which growth temperature limits the maximum In
   content, growth rate depends on gallium flux. This mechanism was
   investigated by the growth of InGaN/InGaN multi quantum wells (MQWs). We
   show that for constant growth temperature and nitrogen flux, the growth
   rate of MQWs decreases with decreasing gallium flux. We demonstrate also
   that at constant growth temperature and gallium flux, the In content in
   InGaN layers depends on nitrogen flux. We present an InGaN growth model
   that describes indium incorporation as a function of gallium and
   nitrogen fluxes, assuming that nonequivalent atomic step edges play an
   important role in indium incorporation mechanisms in PAMBE. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new driving scheme utilizing an in-pixel
   metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) photosensor for luminance control of
   active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) pixel. The proposed
   3-TFT circuit is controlled by an external driver performing the signal
   readout, processing, and programming operations according to a luminance
   adjusting algorithm. To maintain the fabrication simplicity, the
   embedded MIS photosensor shares the same layer stack with pixel TFTs.
   Performance characteristics of the MIS structure with a nc-Si : H/a-Si :
   H bilayer absorber were measured and analyzed to prove the concept. The
   observed transient dark current is associated with charge trapping at
   the insulator-semiconductor interface that can be largely eliminated by
   adjusting the bias voltage during the refresh cycle. Other factors
   limiting the dynamic range and external quantum efficiency are also
   determined and verified using a small-signal model of the device.
   Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the MIS photosensor
   for the discussed driving scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Falling-film drain water heat recovery systems have proven to be a
   cost-effective and reliable class of heat exchanger for reducing primary
   energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings and in
   industrial buildings and processes. It is fitting, therefore, that
   regulatory bodies are preparing standards by which various products can
   be characterized, both for rating purposes and to provide data for
   building energy simulation. Unfortunately, standards development is
   progressing in the absence of measured performance data that
   characterize how these heat exchangers perform. The intention of the
   current work is to examine drain water heat recovery performance at
   various equal-flow conditions. The effectiveness of three drain water
   heat recovery systems was examined in a counter flow as a function of
   volumetric flow rate. The drain water heat recovery systems represented
   products from two manufacturers and two lengths. One of the drain water
   heat recovery systems was also tested in parallel flow. While the
   performance characteristics generally mirrored theoretical performance,
   there were some key differences. For the units tested, there was a clear
   transition region occurring between flow rates of 5 and 10 L/min (1.3
   and 2.6 gpm). While the presence of this region did not impact the
   proposed rating process, it could significantly impact the applicability
   of the data analysis to building simulation. It was also shown that the
   number of transfer units for the collector changed significantly with
   flow rate, but in a predictable manner. By fitting the number of
   transfer units versus flow rate data, and using this correlation in
   conjunction with theoretical E-number of transfer units equations, the
   drain water heat recovery performance could be well predicted over the
   entire range of operation.}},

Abstract = {{As SRAM cells are scaled aggressively to increase the overall packing
   density, the smaller transistors exhibit higher degrees of process
   variation and mismatch, leading to larger offset voltages. For SRAM
   sense amplifiers (SAs), higher offset voltages lead to an increased
   likelihood of an incorrect decision. In this brief, an SA capable of
   cancelling the input offset voltage is presented. The simulated and
   measured results in 180-nm technology show that the SA is capable of
   detecting a 4-mV differential input signal under dc and transient
   conditions. The proposed SA when compared with other offset cancellation
   schemes exhibits comparable offset cancellation performance with a
   smaller delay and significantly lower energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in micro/nano-domain technologies have led to a
   renewed interest in ultra-high resolution magnetic navigation platforms.
   A magnetic navigation platform (MNP) has been developed at the MagLev
   Microrobotics Lab of the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.
   This platform consists of two separate basic components: a magnetic
   drive unit and a microrobot. The magnetic drive unit produces and
   regulates the magnetic field for noncontact propelling of the microrobot
   in an enclosed environment. The MNP is equipped with an eddy-current
   damper to enhance its inherent damping factor in the microrobot's
   horizontal motions. This paper deals with the modeling and analysis of
   an eddy-current damper that is formed by a conductive plate placed below
   the levitated microrobot to overcome inherent dynamical vibrations and
   improve motion precision. The modeling of eddy-current distribution in
   the conductive plate is investigated by solving the diffusion equation
   for vector magnetic potential. An analytical expression for the
   horizontal damping force is presented and experimentally validated. It
   is demonstrated that eddy-current damping is a key technique to increase
   the damping coefficient in a noncontact way and improve levitation
   performance. This damping can be widely used in applications of magnetic
   actuation systems in micromanipulation and microfabrication.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A variety of support materials for sol-gel immobilized lipase were
   considered based on their ability to provide superior sol-gel adhesion,
   load protein, and synthesize methyl oleate. A standard approach was
   developed to formulate the supported lipase sol-gels and to allow
   comparison of the resulting hybrid materials. These supported sol-gels
   are proposed as an alternative immobilization regime to overcome some
   challenges associated with enzymatic biodiesel production such as enzyme
   stability and cost. The support materials considered were 6-12 mesh
   silica gel, Celite (R) R633, Celite (R) R632, Celite (R) R647,
   anion-exchange resin AG3-X4, and Quartzel (R) felt. Each support
   material exhibited unique properties that would be beneficial for this
   application including: Quartzel (R) felt had the highest initial sol-gel
   capacity (62.5 mL/g) and sol-gel adhesion (1100 mg sol-gel/g material);
   silica gel had the most uniform coating of deposited sol-gel; the
   anion-exchange resin AG3-X4 supported sol-gel had the highest protein
   loading (1060 mu g lipase/g) and reaction rate {[}1.25 mM/(min
   g-material)]; the Celite (R) support series were the most thermally
   stable and had the lowest water content; and the Celite (R) R632
   supported lipase sol-gels had the highest 6 h biodiesel conversion per
   gram of supported material (68\%) and enzymatic activity {[}9.4
   mmol/(min g-lipase)]. The supported sol-gels with the highest enzymatic
   properties (conversion, activity, and reaction rate) were those
   supported on Celite (R) R632, anion-exchange resin AG3-X4, and Quartzel
   (R). These supported sol-gels had superior performance in comparison
   with the unsupported sol-gels. Based on this study, the lipase sol-gel
   support material with the most potential for biodiesel production is
   Celite (R) R632.}},

Abstract = {{The stochastic gamma process model is widely used in modeling a variety
   of degradation phenomena in engineering structures and components. If
   degradation in a component population can be accurately measured over
   time, the statistical estimation of gamma process parameters is a
   relatively straight-forward task. However, in most practical situations,
   degradation data are collected through in-service and non-destructive
   inspection methods, which invariably contaminate the data by adding
   random noises (or sizing errors) to the data. Therefore, a proper
   estimation method is needed to filter out the effect of sizing errors
   from the measured degradation data. This article presents an efficient
   method for estimating the parameters of the gamma process model based on
   a novel use of the Genz transform and quasi-Monte Carlo method in the
   maximum likelihood estimation. Examples presented show that the proposed
   method is very efficient compared with the Monte Carlo method currently
   used for this purpose in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) thermal fluid model

   depth and mushy zone thickness at the centreline for different casting
   speeds, final strip thicknesses and heat transfer coefficients between
   the rolls and the surface of the strip. Moreover, the effect of these
   parameters on the average solidification cooling rate and secondary

   validation was done by comparing the predicted and measured exit strip
   surface temperature as well as the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS)
   through the thickness of the sheet to those measured using the Natural

Abstract = {{Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is an effective way of
   multipacket reception to combat interference in wireless networks. We
   focus on link scheduling in wireless networks with SIC, and propose a
   layered protocol model and a layered physical model to characterize the
   impact of SIC. In both the interference models, we show that several
   existing scheduling schemes achieve the same order of approximation
   ratios, independent of whether or not SIC is available. Moreover, the
   capacity order in a network with SIC is the same as that without SIC. We
   then examine the impact of SIC from first principles. In both chain and
   cell topologies, SIC does improve the throughput with a gain between 20
   and 100 percent. However, unless SIC is properly characterized, any
   scheduling scheme cannot effectively utilize the new transmission
   opportunities. The results indicate the challenge of designing an
   SIC-aware scheduling scheme, and suggest that the approximation ratio is
   insufficient to measure the scheduling performance when SIC is
   available.}},

Abstract = {{This paper establishes self-aligned double patterning (SADP)
   decomposition requirements and proposes a litho-friendly layout
   decomposition method. First, we explain the SADP-specific printability
   requirements that should be considered during decomposition. In silico
   experiments indicate that layout patterns that are printed by the trim
   mask may experience the highest levels of image distortion. Therefore,
   these patterns should be assisted by sidewalls of spacer patterns to
   improve printing robustness. Next, we present an integer linear
   programming-based decomposition method that avoids decomposition
   conflicts and sensitive trim edges simultaneously. To improve runtime
   and extend its application to partially decomposable layouts, too, a
   partitioning-based decomposition is also proposed. Our experiments
   reveal that the proposed methods decrease the total length of sensitive
   trim patterns and consequently reduce the total edge placement error
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{As technology scales, a lower supply voltage means transistors in ring
   oscillators frequently switch between triode and saturation. A model
   based on random mid-point voltage is developed in this brief. It reduces
   the number of first-passage time calculations. For instance, when
   applied to a current-starved inverter delay cell, the number of
   calculations is reduced from 5 to 1. Moreover, when applied to a
   differential pair delay cell, new design insights develop. These
   insights result in improved phase noise (PN) via a combination of
   reduced input pair size and the addition of extra poly capacitance at
   the output. Measured PN on oscillators fabricated in 0.18-mu m CMOS,
   which oscillate at 448 and 473 MHz, shows an improvement of 6 dBc/Hz. In
   both types of delay cells, the model agrees reasonably well with
   measurement results.}},

   The bacterial isolate Bacillus cereus FB11 has synthesized
   poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) copolymer under nutrient

   stretching and C-H vibrations, respectively. The result of H-1-NMR
   confirmed that it was composed of 88 mol \% of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 12
   mol \% of 3-hydroxyvalerate monomeric subunits. The nanoparticles were
   fabricated from copolymer and used as a carrier for anticancer drug
   ellipticine. The in vitro drug release studies showed that \% inhibition
   of A549 cancer cell line receiving ellipticine loaded
   poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) nanoparticles was two-fold
   higher in comparison to ellipticine alone. This drug delivery system

Abstract = {{The growing use of `targeted profiling' approaches for the deconvolution
   of 1D-H-1-NMR spectra by comparison to a pure compound library has
   created a need for an in-depth characterization of quantification
   variability that is beyond what is currently available in the
   literature. In this study, we explore the underlying source of
   quantification variability (tube insertion, spectra acquisition, and
   profiling) as well as a number of other factors, such as temporal
   consistency of repeated NMR scans, human consistency in repeated
   profiles, and human versus machine sampling. We also look at the effect
   of different pulse sequences on the differences between acquired spectra
   and the peak reference library. Two sample types were considered for
   this work-a synthetic five compound mixture as well as human urine. The
   result is a comprehensive examination of 1D-H-1-NMR quantification
   error. Our investigation into variability sources revealed that apart
   from profiling, sample insertion and/or shimming can play a significant
   role in final quantification, a finding that is equally applicable to
   all integration-based methods of quantification. Both sources of error
   were also found to have temporal relationships, with bias identified as
   a function of both scan and profiling order, reinforcing the need for
   randomization in scanning and profiling. As well as presenting a
   practical estimate of variability in human urine samples, we have
   uncovered a considerable amount of complexity in underlying NMR
   variability that will hopefully serve as impetus for future exploration
   in this area.}},

Abstract = {{For the last 70 years, direct-chill (DC) casting has been the mainstay
   of the aluminum industry for the production of monolithic sheet and
   extruded products. Traditionally, clad aluminum sheet products have been
   made from separate core and clad DC cast ingots by an expensive
   roll-bonding process; however, in 2005, Novelis unveiled an innovative
   variant of the DC casting process called the Fusion (TM) Technology
   process that allows the production of multialloy ingots that can be
   rolled directly into laminated or clad sheet products. Of paramount
   importance for the successful commercialization of this new technology
   is a scientific and quantitative understanding of the Fusion (TM)
   casting process that will facilitate process optimization and aid in the
   future development of casting methodology for different alloy
   combinations and ingot and clad dimensions. In the current study, a
   numerical steady-state thermofluids model of the Fusion (TM) Technology
   casting process was developed and used to simulate the casting of
   rectangular bimetallic ingots made from the typical brazing sheet
   combination of AA3003 core clad with an AA4045 aluminum alloy. The
   analysis is followed by a parametric study of the process. The influence
   of casting speed and chill-bar height on the steady-state thermal field
   within the ingot is investigated. According to the criteria developed
   with the thermofluids model, the AA3003/AA4045 combination of aluminum
   alloys can be cast successfully with casting speeds up to 2.4 mm s(-1).
   The quality of the metallurgical bond between the core and the clad is
   decreased for low casting speeds and chill-bar heights > 35 mm. These
   results can be used as a guideline for improving the productivity of the
   Fusion (TM) Technology process.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution during the homogenization heat treatment of
   Al-Mn-Fe-Si, or AA3xxx, alloys has been investigated using a combination
   of modeling and experimental studies. The model is fully coupled to
   CALculation PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) software and has explicitly taken
   into account the two different length scales for diffusion encountered
   in modeling the homogenization process. The model is able to predict the
   evolution of all the important microstructural features during
   homogenization, including the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of
   dispersoids and alloying elements in solution, the dispersoid number
   density and the size distribution, and the type and fraction of
   intergranular constituent particles. Experiments were conducted using
   four direct chill (DC) cast AA3xxx alloys subjected to various
   homogenization treatments. The resulting microstructures were then
   characterized using a range of characterization techniques, including
   optical and electron microscopy, electron micro probe analysis, field
   emission gun scanning electron microscopy, and electrical resistivity
   measurements. The model predictions have been compared with the
   experimental measurements to validate the model. Further, it has been
   demonstrated that the validated model is able to predict the effects of
   alloying elements (e.g. Si and Mn) on microstructure evolution. It is
   concluded that the model provides a time and cost effective tool in
   optimizing and designing industrial AA3xxx alloy chemistries and
   homogenization heat treatments. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Surfactant flooding aims at lowering the interfacial tensions between
   the oil and water phases to improve the displacement efficiency during
   oil recovery. However, surfactant losses due to adsorption on the
   reservoir rock impairs performance of the chemical flooding,
   consequently renders the process impractical economically. This article
   presents adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of Zizyphus Spina Christi
   (ZSC), a new non-ionic surfactant, onto carbonate rocks. The adsorption
   tests were conducted at a temperature range of 28-75 degrees C. A
   conductivity method was employed in this study to measure CMC parameter
   and surfactant concentration in the aqueous solutions. The equilibrium
   conditions for the crushed rock samples were obtained after about 2
   days. According to the experimental results, the equilibrium data were
   well-fitted by the Freundlich isotherm for carbonate samples.
   Furthermore, the adsorption process is exothermic and obeys the
   second-order kinetic model. Such a systematic investigation is very
   helpful to select a proper surfactant for EOR application and reservoir
   stimulation in the petroleum industry.}},
