Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been regarded as one of the 10
   important technologies in the 21st century. Because of its capability to
   rapidly and accurately collect and process data in real-time, RFID has
   been widely applied in many areas, such as Internet of Things and Smart
   Grid. However, the existing security threats become more severe toward
   RFID authentication scheme. The traditional security mechanisms cannot
   be used in RFID directly because of the limitations of processing
   capability, storage space, and power supply of RFID tags. In this paper,
   we propose a revocable secure efficient lightweight RFID authentication
   scheme (RSEL). To achieve authentication efficiency, the key of the tag
   is chosen to reduce the number of hash computing in the database.
   Furthermore, the key is stored in the database and updated constantly
   with the tag to prevent the tracking and synchronization attacks. The
   valid period of each tag is stored in the database so that RSEL can
   revoke the expired tag. The correctness of RSEL has been proved using
   GNY logic. The performance of RSEL in terms of security and efficiency
   is evaluated. Compared with other existing approaches, RSEL achieves
   stronger security and higher efficiency. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A modular synthesis technique was developed for producing
   graphene-supported titanium dioxide photocatalysts. The modular
   synthesis allowed for simple tuning of the ratio of particle loading on
   the graphene oxide (GO) surface as well as good photocatalytic activity
   of the composite and quick, efficient magnetic separability. GO flakes
   were used as a support for titanium dioxide nanoparticles and SiO2
   insulated nano-sized magnetite aggregates. Different composition ratios
   were tested, resulting in a catalyst formulation with photocatalytic
   activity exceeding that of a commercial photocatalyst by a factor of 1.2
   as well as excellent recyclability, with the capability to degrade 3
   mg/L methylene blue in aqueous solution over 10 consecutive trials with
   minimal loss in photocatalytic efficiency. Recovery of the catalyst was
   achieved by simply exposing the nanocomposite to a magnetic field for
   similar to 1 minute. Furthermore, it was found that the catalyst could
   be regenerated to its initial efficiency through simple UV treatment to
   provide additional re-use. To highlight the importance of the
   nanocomposite to the current water treatment industry, we showed rapid
   degradation of pharmaceutical compounds caffeine and carbamazepine
   within 60 min. The nanocomposite shows activity exceeding that of
   commercial photocatalyst P25 with the added benefit of being fully
   recoverable, reusable, and easy to produce. Overall, a simple technique
   for producing and tuning an effective magnetically recyclable
   nanocomposite was developed which should allow easy scalability and
   industrial production, a factor critical for the implementation of
   nano-based water treatment techniques.}},

Title = {{Effect of Thermal Degradation on the CO, C3H6, and NO Oxidation
   Performance of Pt/Al2O3 with a Zoned Distribution of Pt}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{5692-5700}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were used to evaluate
   the performance of uniformly (standard) and nonuniformly (zoned)
   distributed Pt/Al2O3 catalysts after homogeneous and heterogeneous
   thermal degradation. Both catalysts were homogeneously aged in an oven
   by exposing the entire catalyst to 750 degrees C in air for 4 h at
   atmospheric pressure. In heterogeneous aging, only the back of the
   catalysts was exposed at 675 degrees C, whereas the temperature at the
   inlet section did not exceed 550 degrees C. This was accomplished by
   introducing pulses of C3H6 and O-2, with an inert gas between each
   pulse, for 50 cycles and using the heat generated by the exothermic
   oxidation reaction to thermally age zones of the samples. The
   zone-coated catalyst, with more Pt concentrated in the front of the
   monolith, showed better performance than the standard sample after
   heterogeneous aging. The reason is that most of the Pt in the zoned
   sample, which was located in the front half, was not affected by the
   more significant aging at the back of the monolith. On the other hand,
   at a higher total flow rate and higher temperature, the performance of
   the homogenously aged zoned catalyst was worse than that of the standard
   sample, because the effect of the Pt-rich upstream area of the zoned
   catalyst was lost through the formation of larger particles, widening
   the reaction zone into the less Pt-rich downstream region.}},

Abstract = {{A novel process mode for gas separation by means of membranes was
   presented. It involved cyclic pressure-vacuum swings for feed
   pressurization and permeate evacuation, thereby increasing the
   transmembrane pressure difference and the feed to permeate pressure
   ratio. The feed pressurization and permeate evacuation were preferably
   done using a single pump capable of pressurization and suction.
   Unsteady-state permeation associated with the pressure-vacuum swing
   permeation was analyzed to elucidate the working principle of the
   process, and a parametric study was carried out to evaluate the effects
   of design and operating parameters on the separation performance. To
   exemplify the feasibility and effectiveness of the process, air
   separation for oxygen enrichment was investigated as a model
   application. It was shown that the separation efficiency was enhanced by
   means of the pressure-vacuum swing, and both product purity and product
   throughput higher than those from conventional steady-state permeation
   could be obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The joining of Al-Fe nanoparticles (NPs) by femtosecond (fs) laser
   irradiation is reported in this paper. Fe and Al NPs were deposited on a
   carbon film in vacuum via fs laser ablation. Particles were then exposed
   to multiple fs laser pulses at fluences between 0.5 and 1.3 mJ/cm(2).
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Diffraction X-ray
   observations indicate that Al and Fe NPs bond to each other under these
   conditions. For comparison, bonding of Al to Al and Fe to Fe NPs was
   also investigated. The nanostructure, as observed using TEM, showed that
   individual Al NPs were monocrystalline while individual Fe NPs were
   polycrystalline prior to joining and that these structures are retained
   after the formation of Al-Al and Fe-Fe NPs. Al-Fe NPs produced by fs
   laser joining exhibited a mixed amorphous and crystalline phase at the
   interface. Bonding is suggested to originate from intermixing within a
   region of high field intensity between particles. (C) 2014 AIP

   Global kinetic models for the oxidation of propene, NO and the SCR

Abstract = {{A biologically-inspired algorithm called Spiral Bacterial Foraging
   Optimization (SBFO) is investigated in this article. SBFO, previously
   proposed by the same authors, is a multi-agent, gradient-based algorithm
   that minimizes both the main objective function (local cost) and the
   distance between each agent and a temporary central point (global cost).
   A random jump is included normal to the connecting line of each agent to
   the central point, which produces a vortex around the temporary central
   point. This random jump is also suitable to cope with premature
   convergence, which is a feature of swarm-based optimization methods. The
   most important advantages of this algorithm are as follows: First, this
   algorithm involves a stochastic type of search with a deterministic
   convergence. Second, as gradient-based methods are employed, faster
   convergence is demonstrated over GA, DE, BFO, etc. Third, the algorithm
   can be implemented in a parallel fashion in order to decentralize
   large-scale computation. Fourth, the algorithm has a limited number of
   tunable parameters, and finally SBFO has a strong certainty of
   convergence which is rare in existing global optimization algorithms. A
   detailed convergence analysis of SBFO for continuously differentiable
   objective functions has also been investigated in this article.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional unsteady-state CFD (computational fluid dynamics)
   model is built to simulate biomass gasification in a circulating

   model is coupled with the enhanced wall treatment to describe the
   hydrodynamic regime of the gas-particle system. The conservation of
   momentum, mass, and energy equations are integrated with reaction
   kinetics to simulate chemical reactions in the gasifier. The impact of
   product distribution coefficient, theta, for char combustion on the CFD
   biomass gasification model is examined in nine cases. According to the
   simulation results, the coefficient of theta has a minor effect on the
   predictions of outlet gas compositions. However, it is found that the
   value of theta can influence the profile of gasifier temperature, and
   the peak temperature regions from the cases assigning 0.50 to the
   coefficient appear faster than those from the models using higher values
   of theta.}},

Abstract = {{The future smart grid is expected to be an interconnected network of
   small-scale and self-contained microgrids, in addition to a large-scale
   electric power backbone. By utilizing microsources, such as renewable
   energy sources and combined heat and power plants, microgrids can supply
   electrical and heat loads in local areas in an economic and environment
   friendly way. To better adopt the intermittent and weather-dependent
   renewable power generation, energy storage devices, such as batteries,
   heat buffers and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with vehicle-to-grid
   systems can be integrated in microgrids. However, significant technical
   challenges arise in the planning, operation and control of microgrids,
   due to the randomness in renewable power generation, the buffering
   effect of energy storage devices and the high mobility of PEVs. The
   two-way communication functionalities of the future smart grid provide
   an opportunity to address these challenges, by offering the
   communication links for microgrid status information collection.
   However, how to utilize stochastic modeling and optimization tools for
   efficient, reliable and economic planning, operation and control of
   microgrids remains an open issue. In this paper, we investigate the key
   features of microgrids and provide a comprehensive literature survey on
   the stochastic modeling and optimization tools for a microgrid. Future
   research directions are also identified.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled immobilization of proteins is crucial in many applications,
   including biosensors. Allergen biosensing, for example, requires
   molecular recognition of suitably immobilized proteins by specific
   antibodies and sensitive measurement of this interaction.
   Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), terminated by active functions, and
   are of great interest for the immobilization of biomolecules. The
   efficiency of further biorecognition involving molecules immobilized on
   these surfaces demonstrates an interesting dependence on the chain
   length and terminal function of the SAM. This motivated us to
   investigate adsorption of two proteins both known as milk
   allergens-beta-lactoglobulin and apo-transferrin-on amine-terminated
   SAMs. We varied the chain length by using either short or long chain
   amine-terminated thiols (cysteamine, CEA, and 11-mercaptoundecylamine,
   MUAM). We also investigated the influence of the addition of a rigid
   cross-linker, p-phenylene diisothiocyanate (PDITC), to these amine
   layers prior to protein adsorption. Protein binding was studied using
   polarization modulation-infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy
   (PM-IRRAS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize their
   amount and dispersion. We found that protein immobilization varies with
   SAM chain length and is also influenced by the presence of a
   cross-linker. The presence of a rigid cross-linker favours the binding
   of proteins on long chain SAMs, while the effect is almost nonexistent
   on shorter chains. In addition, the presence of the cross-linker induces
   a better dispersion of the proteins on the surfaces, regardless of the
   length of the thiols forming the SAMs. The effects of chain length and
   chemistry of protein binding are discussed. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{Fatigue crack growth in low carbon steel brazed joints with copper
   filler metal is modeled by an irreversible Cohesive Zone Model.
   Strain-controlled fatigue tests are performed on the brazed specimens,

   Cohesive Zone Model to irreversibly account for the joint stiffness
   degradation over the number of cycles. The damage law parameters are
   calibrated based on Irwin's analytical solution and the experimental
   fatigue crack growth data. Using the characterized irreversible Cohesive
   Zone Model, the fatigue crack growth is simulated and the corresponding
   fatigue crack growth rates are obtained. The agreement between the
   numerical results and the experimental data shows the applicability of

   using mathematical models play a significant role in risk estimation and
   consequently in decision-making processes. Uncertainty arises in the
   application of models because of physical complexities, simplifying
   assumptions, and parameter variability. A sensitivity analysis comparing
   the influence of different model parameters on predicted CO2 plume
   evolution uncertainty is presented. Both the role of the parameter in
   the model and the parameter uncertainty are included in the measure of
   sensitivity to distinguish between parameters with equal influence in
   the model output but having different degrees of intrinsic uncertainty.
   The sensitivity of the plume interface location, the maximum
   breakthrough distance of CO2, and the moment of inertia of the CO2 plume
   with respect to intrinsic physical system parameters and parameters
   introduced in constitutive relationships is investigated in a
   hypothetical site. parameters are used, each with a probability density
   obtained from measurements of the Nisku Aquifer, targeted for CO2
   injection in Alberta, Canada. Our sensitivity analysis shows that
   formation porosity, residual brine saturation, and entry capillary
   pressure are the most influential parameters in the uncertainty of plume
   evolution. Thus, the influence of constitutive relationship parameters
   in plume evolution uncertainty is as high as that of the physical
   characteristics of the system. Simulation outputs where insensitive to
   CO2 viscosity and the exponents in the Brooks-Corey model for capillary
   pressure and relative permeability; therefore, it is possible to reduce
   the dimensionality of future uncertainty and risk analyses, based on the
   model presented, by neglecting the uncertainty of these parameters and
   assuming them to be deterministic. While results are specific to the
   synthetic problem presented in the article, the methodology is general
   and applicable to other CO2 geosequestration sites. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An electron beam resist is typically applied by spin-coating, which
   cannot be reliably applied on nonplanar, irregular, or fragile
   substrates. Here we demonstrate that the popular negative electron beam
   resist polystyrene can be coated by thermal evaporation. A high
   resolution of 30 nm half-pitch was achieved using the evaporated resist.
   As a proof of concept of patterning on irregular surfaces, we fabricated
   nanostructures on the AFM cantilever and the optical fiber. Although an
   Ice (H2O) resist has also been recently demonstrated as being capable of
   nanopatterning on irregular and fragile substrates, it requires
   specially designed accessories mounted inside a SEM chamber, whereas our
   process works with any thermal evaporator and is thus simpler and much
   more accessible. Nanofabrication on nonplanar surfaces may find
   applications in fields such as (AFM) tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for
   chemical analysis and lab-on-fiber technology.}},

Title = {{Chaos Entanglement: Leading Unstable Linear Systems to Chaos}},

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Chaos entanglement is a new approach to connect linear systems to chaos.
   The basic principle is to entangle two or multiple linear systems by
   nonlinear coupling functions to form an artificial chaotic
   system/network such that each of them evolves in a chaotic manner.
   However, it is only applicable for stable linear systems, not for
   unstable ones because of the divergence property. In this study, a bound
   function is introduced to bound the unstable linear systems and then
   chaos entanglement is realized in this scenario. Firstly, a new 6-scroll
   attractor, entangling three identical unstable linear systems by sine
   function, is presented as an example. The dynamical analysis shows that
   all entangled subsystems are bounded and their equilibrium points are
   unstable saddle points when chaos entanglement is achieved. Also,
   numerical computation exhibits that this new attractor possesses one
   positive Lyapunov exponent, which implies chaos. Furthermore, a 4 x 4 x
   4-grid attractor is generalized by introducing a more complex bound
   function. Hybrid entanglement is obtained when entangling a
   two-dimensional stable linear subsystem and a one-dimensional unstable
   linear subsystem. Specifically, it is verified that it is possible to
   produce chaos by entangling unstable linear subsystems through linear
   coupling functions - a special approach referred to as linear
   entanglement. A pair of 2-scroll chaotic attractors are established by
   linear entanglement. Our results indicate that chaos entanglement is a
   powerful approach to generate chaotic dynamics and could be utilized as
   a guideline to effectively create desired chaotic systems for
   engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an investigation into the dry-band arcing mechanism

   by infrared camera correlates well with the temperature of degradation
   determined by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning
   calorimetry. To characterize the physical mechanism of dry-band arcing,
   wavelet-based multiresolution analysis up to seven levels of resolution
   is applied to the leakage current waveforms. The analysis shows that
   both stable and intense discharges characterize the eroding dry-band
   arcing. A time-to-eroding parameter is proposed to determine the
   relative resistance to the formation of residue. Faster accumulation of
   residue is evident under -DC than +DC. Earlier inception of erosion is

Abstract = {{We motivate and present two designs for the composition of the
   authentication protocol, Kerberos, and the key transport protocol,
   Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) for authenticated transport of
   cryptographic keys for secure group-communication in enterprise and
   public-safety settings. A technical challenge, and our main
   contribution, is the analysis of the security of the composition.
   Towards this, we design our compositions to have intuitive appeal and
   thereby less prone to security vulnerabilities. We then employ protocol
   composition logic (PCL), a state-of-the-art approach for analyzing our
   composition. For this, we first articulate two properties that are of
   interest. Both properties are on the group key that is transported; we
   call them Group Key Confidentiality and Acquisition. Group Key
   Confidentiality is the property that if a principal possesses the key,
   then it is an authorized member of the group. Group Key Acquisition is
   the property that if a principal is a member of the group, then it is
   able to acquire the group key. In the course of our rigorous analysis,
   we discovered a flaw in our first design, which we point out, and which
   lead us to our second design. We have implemented both designs starting
   with the publicly available reference implementation of Kerberos, and an
   open-source implementation of MIKEY. Our implementations are available
   as open-source. We discuss our experience from the implementation, and
   present empirical results.}},

Abstract = {{Continuum-based analyses for laterally loaded piles with rectangular and
   circular cross sections are presented using solutions that can be
   obtained quickly without requiring any elaborate inputs for the geometry
   and numerical mesh. The analysis is developed by solving the
   differential equations governing the displacements of the pile-soil
   system derived using the variational principles of mechanics. Parametric
   studies are performed to investigate the influence of the pile
   cross-sectional shape, soil layering, pile slenderness ratio, and
   pile-soil modulus ratio on the response of laterally loaded piles in
   heterogeneous soil in which the soil shear modulus varies continuously
   or discretely with depth. The results show that piles with the same
   second moment of inertia have similar lateral-load response. The lateral
   responses of piles in two-layer systems were mainly affected by the
   thickness and stiffness of the top soil layer. Soil layering also
   influences the lateral response of piles in three-layer soil deposits
   consisting of two thin layers overlying the third layer. Algebraic
   equations for estimating the pile-head deflection and maximum bending
   moment are proposed that can be readily used in design. A user-friendly
   spreadsheet program is developed as a tool to perform calculations of
   pile response using the analysis. Numerical examples demonstrating the
   use of the analysis are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogenated polyisoprene (HPIP) nanoparticles, synthesized via organic
   solvent-free hydrogenation using RhCl3/TPPMS as a catalyst, are novel
   nanofillers for natural rubber (NR) blends. Hydrogenation of a
   polyisoprene (PIP) emulsion was carried out in a Parr reactor. Rhodium
   trichloride (RhCl3 center dot 3H(2)O) and monosulfonated
   triphenylphosphine (TPPMS) were used as the catalyst precursor. The HPIP
   was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The
   PIP hydrogenation in the absence of organic solvent is a first-order
   reaction with respect to carbon carbon double bond concentration, and
   the rate constant was dependent on catalyst concentration. The highest
   hydrogenation degree of 93\% was achieved at a catalyst concentration of
   250 mu M with a reaction time of 12 h. The NR/HPIP blends (blend ratio =
   80:20) after thermal aging show high \% retention of their tensile
   strength and modulus, maintaining 94.5\% and 93.7\%, respectively.
   Moreover, a combination of HPIP in NR improved the ozone resistance at
   the surface of the rubber blends. Therefore, the NR/HPIP composite
   exhibited a good retention of tensile properties after thermal aging and
   good resistance toward ozone. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Single-dimension hydrogen, or proton, nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (1D-H-1 NMR) has become an attractive option for
   characterizing the full range of components in complex mixtures of small
   molecular weight compounds due to its relative simplicity, speed,
   spectral reproducibility, and noninvasive sample preparation protocols
   compared to alternative methods. One challenge associated with this
   method is the overlap of NMR resonances leading to ``convoluted{''}
   spectra. While this can be mitigated through ``targeted profiling{''},
   there is still the possibility of increased quantification error. This
   work presents the application of a Plackett-Burman experimental design
   for the robust estimation of precision and accuracy of 1D center dot H-1
   NMR compound quantification in-synthetic mixtures, with application to
   mammalian cell culture supernatant. A single, 20 sample experiment was
   able to provide a sufficient estimate of bias and variability at
   different metabolite concentrations. Two major sources of bias were
   identified: incorrect interpretation of singlet resonances and the
   quantification of resonances from protons in close proximity to labile
   protons. Furthermore, decreases in measurement accuracy and precision
   could be observed with decreasing concentration for a small fraction of
   the components as a result of their particular convolution patterns.
   Finally, the importance of a priori concentration estimates is
   demonstrated through the example of interpreting acetate metabolite
   trends from a bioreactor cultivation of Chinese hamster ovary cells
   expressing a recombinant antibody.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for modeling of electrically thin
   conductive shields in the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.
   The method is based on representation of the relation between the fields
   at two faces of the shield as an impedance boundary network condition
   (INBC) in the frequency domain. The INBC includes frequency-dependent
   self and mutual impedances which are approximated by series of partial
   fractions in terms of real or complex conjugate pole-residue pairs. A
   discrete time-domain INBC at the shield is generated, which is then
   incorporated within the FDTD method. The primary advantages of the
   proposed approach are: 1) the convolution equations are not used in the
   formulation, 2) the approximation applied for discretizing the Maxwell
   equation has second-order accuracy in time and first-order of accuracy
   in space, and 3) the stability of the method is governed by the
   classical Courant Friedrichs Lewy stability condition. Numerical
   examples are presented to validate the new method and to demonstrate its
   efficiency and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Input-output monotonicity is an important constraint found in many

   Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) system whose output is monotonically increasing
   or decreasing with respect to one or more inputs. This paper reviews the
   authors' previous work, which derived the parametric conditions for the
   MFS, and discusses the rationale lying behind the conditions. An MFS is
   developed by creating a monotonic rule base while preserving the
   relative monotonicity among the membership functions corresponding to
   the fuzzy rules. This paper also proves that the parametric conditions
   are necessary and sufficient to build a single-input zeroth-order MFS
   with two rules. Only the sufficiency of the conditions holds for a
   multi-input first-order or higher order TSK fuzzy system with three or

Abstract = {{We present a near-field waveguide probe with an embedded array of
   split-ring resonators (SRRs) that operate at 16.65 GHz. When the probe
   scans a metal surface, the magnetic flux generated from the currents on
   the metallic surface strongly affects the equivalent lumped parameters
   of the SRRs. This, in turn, affects the reflection coefficient of the
   feeding port leading to high sensitivity in detecting anomalies such as
   cracks in the surface. Experimental results indicated the feasibility of
   detecting cracks, as small as 25 mu m in width, in metallic surfaces.
   Additionally, the probe achieves good resolution in detecting closely
   spaced cracks.}},

   give reasoned account of the regulations they propose. Professional
   management of risk requires not just probabilistic analysis but also a

   should be objective and quantified. The economics of human welfare,
   expressed through the Life Quality Index, defines net benefit to society
   of regulations to mitigate such risks. Together with the marginal
   life-saving cost principle, the Life Quality Index provides a clear
   limit of benefit to risk reduction. The underlying principles and the
   Life Quality Index are explained. Some issues of practical application
   are illustrated by an example of temporary facilities for storage of
   toxic waste. Effective communications about risk, to authorities in the
   form of regulatory scorecards and to the public, are stressed as
   integral components of the risk management process.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of host specificity, combined with genomic sequencing of
   Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp., has demonstrated a microbial source
   tracking (MST) utility for these common waterborne microbes. To explore
   the source attribution potential of these pathogens, water samples were
   collected in a mixed rural-urban watershed in the Township of Langley,
   in southwestern British Columbia (BC), Canada, over a 2-year period.
   Cryptosporidium was detected in 63\% of surface water samples at
   concentrations ranging from no positive detection (NPD) to 20,600
   oocysts per 100 liters. Giardia was detected in 86\% of surface water
   samples at concentrations ranging from NPD to 3,800 cysts per 100 liters
   of water. Sequencing at the 18S rRNA locus revealed that 50\% of
   Cryptosporidium samples and 98\% of Giardia samples contained
   species/genotypes (Cryptosporidium) or assemblages (Giardia) that are
   capable of infecting humans, based on current knowledge of host
   specificity and taxonomy. Cryptosporidium genotyping data were more
   promising for source tracking potential, due to the greater number of
   host-adapted (i.e., narrow-host-range) species/genotypes compared to
   Giardia, since 98\% of Giardia isolates were zoonotic and the potential
   host could not be predicted. This report highlights the benefits of
   parasite genomic sequencing to complement Method 1623 (U. S.
   Environmental Protection Agency) and shows that Cryptosporidium
   subtyping for MST purposes is superior to the use of Giardia subtyping,
   based on better detection limits for Cryptosporidium-positive samples
   than for Giardia-positive samples and on greater host specificity among
   Cryptosporidium species. These additional tools could be used for risk
   assessment in public health and watershed management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Droop control is a key strategy for operating distributed generation
   (DG) islanded systems, i.e., islanded microgrids (IMGs). The droop
   parameter settings of the DG units can significantly impact the ability
   of an IMG to feed its demand. This paper proposes a new probabilistic
   algorithm for determining the optimum choice for such droop settings for
   the individual DG units in a distribution network in cases when a
   microgrid central controller is unavailable. The proposed algorithm
   adopts a constraint hierarchy approach to enhance the operation of IMGs
   by satisfying the operational constraints of the system and expanding
   its loading margin. The new algorithm takes into consideration the
   variety of possible IMG configurations that can be initiated in a
   distribution network (multi-microgrids), the uncertainty and variability
   associated with the output power of renewable DG units as well as the
   variability of the load, and the special features and operational
   philosophy associated with droop-controlled IMG systems. Simulation
   studies show that the proposed algorithm can facilitate the successful
   implementation of the IMG concept by reducing the customer interruptions
   and enhancing the IMGs' loadability margins.}},

Abstract = {{Mild traumatic brain injury caused by blast exposure from Improvised
   Explosive Devices has become increasingly prevalent in modern conflicts.
   To investigate head kinematics and brain tissue response in blast
   scenarios, two solid hexahedral blast-head models were developed in the
   sagittal and transverse planes. The models were coupled to an Arbitrary
   Lagrangian-Eulerian model of the surrounding air to model blast-head
   interaction, for three blast load cases (5 kg C4 at 3, 3.5 and 4 m). The
   models were validated using experimental kinematic data, where predicted
   accelerations were in good agreement with experimental tests, and
   intracranial pressure traces at four locations in the brain, where the
   models provided good predictions for frontal, temporal and parietal, but
   underpredicted pressures at the occipital location. Brain tissue
   response was investigated for the wide range of constitutive properties
   available. The models predicted relatively low peak principal brain
   tissue strains from 0.035 to 0.087; however, strain rates ranged from
   225 to 571 s-1. Importantly, these models have allowed us to quantify
   expected strains and strain rates experienced in brain tissue, which can
   be used to guide future material characterization. These computationally
   efficient and predictive models can be used to evaluate protection and
   mitigation strategies in future analysis. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A rate dependent Taylor type crystal plasticity formulation is employed
   to study the effects of post-necking hardening behavior on the
   Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) based forming limit diagram predictions. Three
   uniaxial stress-strain curves, identical up to the necking region, with
   three different post-necking hardening behaviors are generated using
   crystal plasticity formulation. The three curves are obtained by curve
   fitting the simulated uniaxial true stress-strain curve to the
   experimental curve for the CC AA5754. In the first curve the true stress
   strain curve saturates after necking while the other two curves
   demonstrate post-necking hardening. A representative volume element
   obtained from Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data is considered
   for the analysis. Numerical simulations of forming limit diagrams based
   on the classical M-K approach are performed with the same initial
   texture and the three different stress-strain curves. Analysis with the
   numerical model demonstrates that the post-necking behavior
   significantly affects the predicted FLDs. A new calibration approach is
   presented to accurately capture the post-necking behavior of metals.
   Predicted FLDs with this new approach are compared to the experimental
   FLD for the CC AA5754. In order to further characterize the process of
   finding the accurate post-necking hardening behavior, a method based on
   using equivalent stress-strain curve is presented. It is shown that the
   FLD, calculated using experimental uniaxial tensile data as input, is
   comparable with a FLD arising from equivalent stress-strain data. (C)

   Application to the development of Lake Superior regulation plan}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of environmental management problems are solved with a
   computationally intensive simulation-optimization framework. In this
   study, the ``model pre-emption{''} strategy is introduced for increasing
   the efficiency of solving such multi-objective optimization problems.
   This strategy makes the optimization algorithm avoid the full evaluation
   of predictably inferior solutions, is applicable to many optimization
   algorithms, and does not impact the optimization results.
   Multi-objective pre-emption is used to optimize a new regulation plan
   for Lake Superior. The new plan is designed to mitigate extreme water
   levels and increase the total regulation benefits. The rule curve
   parameters defining the plan are obtained from a multi-objective,
   multi-scenario optimization problem. Results show that model pre-emption
   drastically increases the efficiency by up to 75\%. The optimized
   regulation plan outperforms the current plan under the historical
   scenario. Notably, the optimized plan successfully handles an extremely
   dry scenario in which the current plan fails to maintain reasonable lake
   levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MULTIBODY SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{393-403}},

Abstract = {{The ability of a multibody dynamic model to accurately predict the
   response of a physical system relies heavily on the use of appropriate
   system parameters in the mathematical model. Thus, the identification of
   unknown system parameters (or parameters that are known only
   approximately) is of fundamental importance. If experimental
   measurements are available for a mechanical system, the parameters in
   the corresponding mathematical model can be identified by minimizing the
   error between the model response and the experimental data. Existing
   work on parameter estimation using linear regression requires the
   elimination of the Lagrange multipliers from the dynamic equations to
   obtain a system of ordinary differential equations in the independent
   coordinates. The elimination of the Lagrange multipliers may be a
   nontrivial task, however, as it requires the assembly of an orthogonal
   complement of the Jacobian. In this work, we present an approach to
   identify inertial system parameters and Lagrange multipliers
   simultaneously by exploiting the structure of the index-3
   differential-algebraic equations of motion.}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6-9}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Structural characterization, the mechanism of catalytic activity
   generation and the nature of active sites of a NiSO4/gamma-Al2O3
   catalyst for isobutene oligomerization were studied by temperature
   programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance
   infrared fourier transformed (DRIFTS) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The TPR measurements together with the
   XRD data indicated that calcination of the catalyst at 500 A degrees C
   did not form either nickel oxide or nickel aluminate. The presence of
   only one type of surface nickel species formed by the incorporation of
   nickel ions into the surface vacant sites of gamma-alumina lattice was
   indicated by XPS with Ar+ ions sputtering and TPR measurements. XPS
   analysis of the calcined catalyst suggested that the oxidation state of
   nickel ions in the calcined catalyst was (+2) and after calcination the
   nickel ions were coordinated to relatively more basic ligands. The
   surface acid centers of the catalyst were found to be only Lewis type.
   SO4 (2-) ions were found to be present as a chelating bidentate ligand
   and enhanced the acidity of metal ( and/or ) Lewis acid centers. The
   results suggested that the combined effects of the presence of the
   bidentate SO4 (2-) ligand and dehydroxylation generate coordinatively
   unsaturated that interact with isobutene during the oligomerization
   reaction. The formation of lower-valent nickel ions () was demonstrated
   by in situ DRIFTS using CO as a probe molecule and by XPS measurements.
   Formation of a binuclear bridging carbonyl complex, suggested that some
   lower-valent nickel species were formed via in situ reduction by
   isobutene. Analysis of Ni 2p photolines indicated the appearance of a
   new lower-valent nickel species () during the course of isobutene
   oligomerization. Hence it is plausible that lower-valent nickel species
   might act as the active center for the oligomerization reaction, while
   the SO4 (2-) ions enhance the acidity of the Lewis acid sites on the
   surface and assist in the adsorption of reactant molecules on the
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposite particles of amorphous carbon-Li4Ti5O12 (C-LTO) and carbon
   nanotube-Li4Ti5O12 (CNT-LTO) were synthesized by solvothermal method and
   subsequent high-temperature calcination. X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and selected area electron diffraction
   (SAED) were applied to characterize the phase structure, particle
   morphology, and the coating structure. XRD analysis, TEM micrographs,
   HR-TEM images and SAED analysis revealed that both LTO particles
   exhibited a well-developed spinel nanocrystal structure with average
   sizes between 20-70 nm. The C-LTO particles exhibited roughly spherical
   shape coated by an amorphous carbon layer up to 10 nm in thickness. The
   CNT-LTO samples showed uniform square nanocrystals with edge length
   around 20 nm and nanoscale graphitic layers covering the surface,
   revealing the carbon nanotubes interconnection networks among the
   particle assemblies. Electrochemical studies of lithium
   insertion/extraction performance are evaluated by the galvanostatic
   charge/discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Both LTO particles showed the superior
   initial discharge capacity of more than 200 mAh/g at 1/10C rate. The
   irreversible capacity of the C-LTO particles at more cycles was due to
   large polarization resulted from excessive carbon and possible residual
   precursors. The CNT-LTO particles show larger reversible capacity and
   enhanced electrochemical Li+ insertion/extraction kinetics at different
   cycling rates. The comparative structural and electrochemical analyses
   demonstrated that both nanoscale graphitic covering layers and the CNT
   interconnection networks increase the electronic conductivity and
   improve the kinetics rates of lithium insertion/extraction in the
   CNT-LTO particles.}},

   die quenching of boron steel at high temperatures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{396-404}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hot forming die quenching is used by the automotive industry to produce
   ultra high strength steel parts with a high strength-to-weight ratio.
   Crash-resistant structural parts with distributed properties can be
   obtained by controlling the local cooling rate during the quenching step
   using heated dies. This procedure requires detailed spatial knowledge of
   the heat transfer coefficient at the blank/die interface. Hot stamping
   experiments were conducted on Usibor (R) 1500P boron steel blanks to
   investigate how pressure and blank and die temperatures influenced the
   heat transfer coefficient, which was inferred using inverse heat
   conduction analysis. The heat transfer coefficient was found to vary
   throughout the experiment with deformation of the surface roughness
   peaks and evolution of the blank and die temperatures. Whereas the heat
   transfer coefficient at the beginning of the stamping process increases
   with the initial die temperature, it converges to a value that depends
   only on applied pressure. Moreover, the experimental heat transfer
   coefficient for zero pressure was found to match the air gap conductance
   predicted by semi-empirical models, but the pressure-dependent component
   was lower than the model-predicted solid contact conductance. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a systematic method for finding impossible
   differentials for block cipher structures, which we call the unified
   impossible differential finding method or 1.110-method. It is more
   effective than the U-method introduced by Kim et al. We apply the
   UID-method to some well-known block cipher structures. Using it, we find
   a 16-round impossible differential for Gen-Skipjack and a 19-round
   impossible differential for Gen-CAST256. By this i-esult we can disprove
   Sung's long standing conjecture that no such differential is possible
   for 16 or more rounds. On Gen-MARS and SMS4, the impossible
   differentials found by the UID-method are much longer than those found
   by the U-method. On the Four-Cell and Gen-RC6 block ciphers, our results
   are the same as the best results previously obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nanomechanical sensors, which have been expected as a promising platform
   for various applications, will not generate any measureable signal
   without an appropriate coating (receptor) layer. In spite of this
   critical dependence on the coating layer, there is almost no guideline
   for the optimization of these layers in terms of their material
   properties; such as, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and geometrical
   parameters. In the present study, the effects of coating layer thickness
   {[}3 nm similar to 10 mu m], Young's modulus {[}100 Pa similar to 1
   TPa], and Poisson's ratio {[}0.10 similar to 0.45] are investigated with
   the finite element analysis (FEA), focusing on systems with two
   dimensional (2D) stress induced either on top of the coating layer
   (i.e., surface stress) or at the interface between the coating layer and
   the silicon cantilever. It is found that the coating layer can either
   enhance or reduce the deflection of nanomechanical sensors depending on
   its material properties. These results provide guidelines for designing
   a coating layer to achieve higher sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of smart grid research, the Advanced Metering
   Infrastructure (AMI) has become the first ubiquitous and fixed computing
   platform. However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as
   complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and
   privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make
   AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related
   to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies
   lose more than \$25 billion every year due to energy theft around the
   world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the
   background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI
   should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first
   presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we
   summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three
   categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game
   theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on
   them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security
   vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research
   directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions
   for energy-theft detection.}},

Journal = {{GEOTHERMICS}},

Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The impact of heterogeneity in soil thermal properties on the
   performance of horizontal ground heat exchangers (HGHE) is closely
   examined using a custom-made finite element model. Ensembles of
   heterogeneous soil fields were generated with spatial correlation
   parameters derived from similar studies of heterogeneity in hydraulic
   parameters. Within these soil fields, a single loop HGHE was modelled as
   discrete pipes placed in a heterogeneous soil continuum. The effect of
   heterogeneity was found to be minimal relative to uncertainty of the
   mean soil thermal conductivity, supporting the continued use of the
   assumption of homogeneity when modelling and designing these systems.
   Multiple design techniques were identified which would allow HGHE
   designers to further mitigate any deleterious effects, such as
   preferential heat transfer between adjacent pipes which may act as a
   `short-circuit' mechanism, reducing HGHE effectiveness. (C) 2013

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},

Volume = {{194}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Capacitive detection of living microalgae from the sample suspension in
   a microfluidic chip is presented in this paper. A three-dimension
   capacitance sensor was designed by placing two cylindrical copper wires
   across the microfluidic channel. The frequency-dependent capacitive
   changes for both living and dead Dunaliella Salina were analyzed with
   Maxwell mixture theory and measured experimentally in this study. The
   results show that the amplitude of capacitive change is mainly
   influenced by algae's size, living status and the applied alternative
   current frequency. Specifically, capacitive change increases with the
   increase in algae size and decreases with the increase in frequency. For
   the same kind of algae, the capacitance change caused by the living
   algal, however, is larger than that of the dead one under the same
   frequency, which can be used to differentiate the living algae from the
   sample suspension. The method of frequency-dependent capacitive
   detection of live algae described in this paper is simple and sensitive.
   The experimentally determined frequency window can serve as a guideline
   to differentiate the living algal from the dead one. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) for desalination of water using
   hollow fiber membranes with a Shell-side feed configuration was
   investigated. The effects of membrane permeability, water salinity, teed
   temperature and flow rate on the water permeation rate were evaluated,
   and the water vapor pressure buildup in the fiber lumen was analyzed.
   The pressure buildup of water vapor in the fiber lumen was shown to
   adversely affect the driving force for water vapor permeation through
   the membrane pores, and a mathematical model was developed to describe
   the mass transfer in VIVID by incorporating the permeate pressure build
   up. The model predictions were validated with experimental data. The
   higher the membrane permeability, the more significant the permeate
   pressure build-up. This is especially important to consider in module
   design for practical applications. For VMD of saline water, the membrane
   played a dominant role in the overall mass transfer process, and the
   significance of the effect of liquid phase resistance on water
   permeation depended on the membrane permeability. An increase in
   operating temperature increased the water productivity in VMD, primarily
   due to increased driving force for permeation, whereas the permeability
   of the membrane was not significantly affected. A factorial design
   experiment was carried out to illustrate the effects of main factors
   involving membrane permeability and operating parameters (feed
   concentration, temperature and flow rate) on the VMD performance, and
   some interactions among the effects were shown to occur as well. (C)

Abstract = {{Particle probability hypothesis density (PHD) filtering is a promising
   technology for the multitarget-tracking problem. Traditional particle
   PHD filter solutions usually have high computational complexity, and the
   lack of dedicated hardware has seriously limited their usages in
   real-time industrial applications. The hardware implementation
   difficulty of the particle PHD filtering in field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA) platforms lies in that the number of observations for
   filtering is time varying while the number of parallel processing units
   in circuit is fixed. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel
   particle-based observation selection (POSE) PHD filter algorithm and its
   hardware implementation in this paper. Specifically, we
   opportunistically select a fixed number of observations out of a varying
   number of observations for filtering, where the approximation error is
   proved to be negligible by adapting the circuit budget to the
   environment accordingly. To implement the proposed POSE PHD filter, the
   hardware design issues are addressed in depth. Extensive simulations
   demonstrate that the POSE PHD filter has a comparable performance with
   the traditional one while its hardware implementation challenge is
   overcome. The hardware experiment results of the POSE PHD filter on a
   Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA platform match the simulation ones well.
   Furthermore, the execution time of the implemented hardware circuit is
   evaluated, and the results show that it can achieve a processing rate of
   6.892 kHz with a 50-MHz system clock.}},

Abstract = {{We present the simultaneous measurement of first and second order
   dispersion in short length (<1m) few mode fibers (polarization and

   generates results equivalent to balanced spectral interferometry,
   without the complexity associated with physical balancing. This is
   achieved by simulating a virtual reference with a group delay equal to
   that of the physical interferometer. The amplitude modulation that
   results from mixing the interferograms, generated in both the unbalanced
   interferometer and the virtual reference, is equivalent to the first
   order interference that would be produced by physical balancing. The
   advantages of the technique include speed, simplicity, convenience and
   the capability for simultaneous measurement of multiple modes. The
   theoretical framework is first developed and then verified
   experimentally. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The stability of a viscoelastic column under the excitation of
   stochastic axial compressive load is investigated in this paper. The
   material of the column is modeled using a fractional Kelvin-Voigt
   constitutive relation, which leads to that the equation of motion is
   governed by a stochastic fractional equation with parametric excitation.
   The excitation is modeled as a bounded noise, which is a realistic model
   of stochastic fluctuation in engineering applications. The method of
   stochastic averaging is used to approximate the responses of the
   original dynamical system by a new set of averaged variables which are
   diffusive Markov vector. An eigenvalue problem is formulated from the
   averaged equations, from which the moment Lyapunov exponent is
   determined for the column system with small damping and weak excitation.
   The effects of various parameters on the stochastic stability and
   significant parametric resonance are discussed and confirmed by
   simulation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62-63}},
Pages = {{164-173}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Current studies on stability of steel frames are primarily based on the
   assumption that steel columns are subjected to uniform elevated
   temperature. However, the temperature distribution of real fire in a
   building may be non-uniform due to thermal buoyancy effect. In this
   study, the elastic stability of unbraced steel frames subjected to a
   non-uniform elevated temperature distribution along the longitudinal
   direction of the column is investigated based on the concept of storey
   based buckling and a two zone fire model. First, to simulate a steel
   column exposed to non-uniform elevated temperature, an analytical model
   is proposed to examine the effects of axial loading, non-uniform
   elevated temperature distribution, and thermal boundary restraints on
   the lateral stiffness of steel columns in unbraced frames. The lateral
   stiffness equation of the column model is derived based on
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Then, the procedure to evaluate the
   stability capacity of unbraced steel frames subjected to non-uniform
   elevated temperature distribution is concluded. Numerical examples are
   presented to demonstrate the evaluation procedure of the proposed method
   and investigate the frame stability subjected to different scenarios of
   frame members exposed to the non-uniform elevated temperature
   distribution. The validity of the proposed method is verified by the
   numerical analysis with the use of finite element analysis. Crown

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for regional frequency analysis and
   spatial pattern features of the Annual Maximum Dry Spell Length (AMDSL)
   as an indicator of drought conditions using the well-known L-moments

   method identifies eight regions with distinctive AMDSL behaviours for
   Iran. Homogeneity testing indicates that most of these regions are
   homogenous. The goodness-of-fit test Z(Dist) shows that Generalized
   Logistic; Generalized Extreme Value and Pearson type III, distributions
   fit best for most regions. The spatial pattern of L-Moment statistics
   demonstrates that although the northwestern and northern parts of the
   country experience short dry spells, these periods are inconstant, and
   extreme dry spell events may happen in these areas. Almost all spatial
   mapping of AMDSLs at different probabilistic levels demonstrates that
   dry spells increase gradually from west to east and from north to south,
   and the southern parts (especially along the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea)
   and central areas, including most agricultural lands, stand out as the

Title = {{Design of an energy hub based on natural gas and renewable energy
   sources}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simulation model for an energy hub consisting of
   natural gas (NG) turbines as the main sources of energy (including both
   electricity and heat) and two renewable energy sourceswind turbines
   (WTs) and photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. The hub also includes water
   electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The hydrogen serves as an energy
   storage medium that can be used in some transportation applications, or
   it can be mixed with the NG feed stream to improve the emission profile
   of the gas-turbine unit. The capacity of the designed hub is meant to
   simulate and replace the coal-fired Nanticoke Generating Station with a
   NG-fired power plant. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a
   simulated model that combines different energy generation technologies,
   which are evaluated in terms of the total energy produced, the cost per
   kWh of energy generated, and the amount of emissions produced. The
   proposed model investigates the benefits, both economic and
   environmental, the technological barriers, and the challenges of energy
   hubs by developing several scenarios. The simulation of these scenarios
   was done using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS (R)). Although
   the software is strongly known for its optimization capability, the
   mixed complementary problems solver makes it a strong tool for solving
   equilibrium problems. Excess energy produced during off-peak demand by
   WTs and PV solar cells was used to feed the electrolyzer to produce H-2
   and O-2. The proposed approach shows that a significant reduction in
   energy cost and greenhouse gas emissions were achieved, in addition to
   the increased overall efficiency of the energy hub. Out of the examined
   three scenarios, Scenario C appeared to be the most feasible option for
   a combination of renewable and non-renewable technologies as it did not
   only produce hydrogen, but also provided electricity at relatively lower
   prices. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   in a good agreement with simulation when the loss due to the vortices is

Abstract = {{Two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-carbazole (Cz) based pi-conjugated
   copolymers, PDBTCz-H (P1) and PDBTCz-Me (P2), were designed and
   synthesized to study the effects of N-substitution of the carbazole unit
   on the molecular ordering, main chain conjugation, and charge transport
   properties of these polymers. It was found that the existence of
   hydrogen bonding interaction between the N-H group in the carbazole unit
   and the C=O group in the DPP unit has a significant impact on the UV
   absorption, crystallinity, thin film morphology, as well as charge
   transport characteristics of P1. The hydrogen bonding is a very
   competitive force with the is pi-pi stacking interaction, leading to the
   more twisted backbone structure and poorer molecular ordering of P1 in
   the solid state. Although the crystallinity of the P1 thin films could
   be somewhat improved by thermal annealing, the polymer main chains of P1
   remain rather twisted and less conjugated in comparison with P2. The
   poorer main chain conjugation of P1 caused by the hydrogen bonding led
   to a dramatic drop in charge transport performance in organic thin film
   transistors (OTFTs). The highest hole mobility achieved for P1 is 8.9 x
   10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which is almost two orders of magnitude lower
   than that of P2 (0.53 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{To calculate the radiant intensity at a point distant from a radiator, a
   geometrical or configuration factor must be used. If the temperature is
   known, then the emissive power can be calculated using the mean
   equivalent beam length, but before the radiant heat flux at a distance
   can be estimated, a configuration factor must be calculated. In this
   article a simple predictive tool is developed to estimate the
   configuration factor for a geometry including a receiving element lying
   on the perpendicular to one corner of a radiant rectangle. The results
   are found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in the
   literature with average absolute deviation being around 2\%. The results
   can be used in follow up calculations to estimate heat fluxes on
   surfaces exposed to radiation. The tool developed in this study can be
   of immense practical value for engineers as a quick check on the
   configuration factor for a geometry including a receiving element lying
   on the perpendicular to one corner of a radiant rectangle without opting
   for any experimental trials. In particular, engineers would find the
   approach to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no
   complex expressions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to nondestructively detect the presence of a single,
   traveling photon has been a long-standing goal in optics, with
   applications in quantum information and measurement. Realizing such a
   detector is complicated by the fact that photon-photon interactions are
   typically very weak. At microwave frequencies, very strong effective
   photon-photon interactions in a waveguide have recently been
   demonstrated. Here we show how this type of interaction can be used to
   realize a quantum nondemolition measurement of a single propagating
   microwave photon. The scheme we propose uses a chain of solid-state
   three-level systems (transmons) cascaded through circulators which
   suppress photon backscattering. Our theoretical analysis shows that
   microwave-photon detection with fidelity around 90\% can be realized
   with existing technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study that assessed the effect of corrosion of
   seven-wire steel strands on the residual capacity of pretensioned
   concrete T beams subjected to static flexural loading and the viability
   of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) repair in restoring the
   original capacity. The experimental program comprised testing six 3.6 m
   {[}12 ft] pretensioned concrete T beams, each having 400 mm (16 in.)
   flange width, 300 mm (12 in.) total height, and 100 mm (4 in.) web
   thickness. The experimental variables were the mass loss due to
   corrosion (0\%, 2.5\%, 5\%, and 10\%) and the repair condition
   (unrepaired and repaired beams using adhesively bonded CFRP sheets).
   Test results showed a reduction in flexure capacity and midspan
   deflection of up to 76\% and 26\%, respectively, at 10\% mass loss. CFRP
   repair was able to restore the load capacity to that of the uncorroded
   beams; however, the reduction in ductility due to corrosion was not

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{569-590}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A homogenized modeling technique is developed in this paper to account
   for viscous damping properties in beamlike lattice structures of
   repeated patterns. Necessary assumptions regarding the local free
   deformations, shear deformation beam theory, and compatibility
   conditions are made to obtain an equivalent continuum model of a
   threedimensional lattice. A dissipated energy equivalence approach is
   then used to relate the energy dissipation for a general case of damping
   matrix in a lattice element to an equivalent proportionally damped
   model. As a result, a continuum model with Kelvin-Voigt damping is
   obtained. Damped bending natural frequencies, frequency response
   functions, and damping ratios are found using this method and compared
   to the results of a finite-element analysis for several structures for
   the purpose of validation.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an objective quality assessment method for image retargeting.
   The key step in our approach is to generate a structural similarity
   (SSIM) map that indicates at each spatial location in the source image
   how the structural information is preserved in the retargeted image. A
   spatial pooling method employing both bottom-up and top-down visual
   saliency estimations is then applied to provide an overall evaluation of
   the retargeted image. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   IR-SSIM algorithm, we created an image database that contains images
   produced by different retargeting algorithms and carried out subjective
   tests to assess the quality of the retargeted images. Our experimental
   results show that IR-SSIM is better correlated with subjective
   evaluations than existing methods in the literature. To further
   demonstrate the advantages and potential applications of IR-SSIM, we
   embed it into a multi-operator image retargeting process, which
   generates visually appealing retargeting results.}},

Abstract = {{Sharing research data is necessary for collaboration within a research
   network and is required by funding agencies, such as the National
   Science Foundation (NSF), that enforce the scientific method and ethics

   currently underdeveloped; emphasizing the need for developing effective
   and efficient means for managing and sharing research data. A review of
   existing data management models reveals that there is currently no
   effective universal system for sharing the data obtained from
   construction research endeavours. This paper presents electronic product
   and process management systems (EPPMS) as a construction research data
   management and sharing approach. The developed EPPMS is a web-based
   system that utilizes workflows that can automate the collection,
   authorization, and dissemination of construction research data. A
   comparative analysis of the developed system to the existing web-based
   cloud and web-based share point systems indicates that an EPPMS offers a
   more fitting solution for construction research data management.}},

Abstract = {{Four studies examined help-seekers' beliefs about how past refusals
   affect future compliance. In Study 1, help-seekers were more likely than
   potential helpers to believe that a previous refusal would lead a
   potential helper to deny a subsequent request of similar size. Study 2
   replicated this effect and found that help-seekers underestimated the
   actual compliance rate of potential helpers who had previously refused
   to help. Studies 3 and 4 explain this asymmetry. Whereas potential
   helpers' willingness to comply with a subsequent request stems from the
   discomfort of rejecting others not once, but twice, help-seekers rely on
   dispositional attributions of helpfulness to estimate the likelihood of
   hearing ``yes'' from someone who has previously told them ``no.''}},

Abstract = {{Oxy-combustion is a promising pathway to capture CO2 from coal fired
   power plants that compete favourably with other CO2 capture technology
   pathways, such as post-combustion and pre-combustion. Oxy-combustion has
   attracted attention because it provides a CO2-enriched flue gas stream
   which can be further purified, if required, using a relatively simple
   multi-stage compression and cooling processes. Several studies have been
   published on the capture and purification of CO2 from oxy-combustion.
   However, knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of the CO2 capture and
   purification process is very limited. Dynamic insight is key to design
   suitable control schemes to ensure that this process can be operated at
   near optimal conditions, while maximizing CO2 recovery and meeting
   product quality requirements. This study aims to develop and validate a
   dynamic model of CO2 capture, purification and compression process for
   integration with oxy-fuel combustion plants. The model was developed and
   validated based on a study performed by the International Energy Agency
   Greenhouse Gas (IEAGHG) R\&D programme (Dillon et al., 2005).
   Mathematical models are provided, steady state data are validated and
   case studies performed to study the transient behaviour of the process
   in response to process disturbances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for deposition is presented and
   applied to the simulation of electrodeposition of a metal on a single
   crystal surface of the same metal under galvanostatic conditions. This
   method utilizes the multi-body embedded-atom method (EAM) potential to
   characterize the interactions of metal atoms and adatoms. The method
   accounts for collective surface diffusion processes, in addition to
   nearest-neighbor hopping, including atom exchange and step-edge atom
   exchange. Steady-state deposition configurations obtained using the KMC
   method are validated by comparison with the structures obtained through
   the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to relax KMC constraints.
   The results of this work support the use of the proposed KMC method to
   simulate electrodeposition processes at length (microns) and time
   (seconds) scales that are not feasible using other methods. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Unique tin oxide-mesoporous carbon (SnO2-CMK-3) composites have been
   synthesized as platinum nanoparticle electrocatalyst supports for low
   temperature fuel cell applications. In comparison with state-of-the-art
   commercial carbon-supported platinum (Pt/C) and pure CMK-3-supported
   platinum (Pt/CMK-3), Pt/SnO2-CMK3 demonstrated improved Pt-mass and
   surface area based ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) activity through
   half-cell electrochemical investigations, providing a 64.7 and 97.6 mV
   reduction in overpotential at 100 mA mg(Pt)(-1) upon comparison to
   Pt/CMK-3 and commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, improvements to the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics were observed, with Pt/SnO2-CMK3
   providing a kinetic current density of 3.40 mAcm(-2) at an electrode
   potential of 0.9 V vs RHE. The improved performance of Pt/SnO2-CMK-3 for
   EOR and ORR was attributed to the beneficial impact of the support
   properties, along with potential interactions occurring between the
   support and catalyst particles. Complemented by extensive
   physicochemical characterization, these unique materials show high
   promise for application in low temperature fuel cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Natural gas usually contains a large amount of water and is fully
   saturated during production operations. In natural gas dehydration
   units' water vapor is removed from natural gas streams to meet sales
   specifications or other downstream gas processing requirements. Many
   methods and principles have been developed in the natural gas
   dehydration process for gaining high level of triethylene glycol (TEG)
   purity. Among them, reducing the pressure in the reboiler at a constant
   temperature results in higher glycol purity. The main objective of this
   communication is the development of an intelligent model based on the
   well-proven standard feed-forward back-propagation neural network for
   accurate prediction of TEG purity based on operating conditions of
   reboiler. Capability of the presented neural-based model in estimating
   the TEG purity is evaluated by employing several statistical parameters.
   It was found that the proposed smart technique reproduces the reported
   data in the literature with average absolute deviation percent being
   around 0.30\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of radiation dose is very important for the detection of
   radiation damage. gamma-H2AX is a popular biological dosimeter to
   evaluate the radiation effect. Typically, bulky and expensive commercial
   flow cytometers are used to detect gamma-H2AX. This paper presents a
   miniaturized and high sensitive cytometer using a microfluidic chip for
   evaluating the radiation dose by detecting the mean immunofluorescence
   intensity of gamma-H2AX. A compact optical focusing system and a
   shift-phase differential amplifier are designed to improve the detection
   sensitivity. Sample lymphocyte cells are stained by FITC fluorescent dye
   after being irradiated by UVC. Comparison experiments between the
   developed miniature cytometer and a commercial flow cytometer were
   conducted under different radiation doses. The developed microfluidic
   cytometer also demonstrates a good linear correlation between the
   measured fluorescence intensity and the irradiation dose with a
   detection limit similar to that of the commercial flow cytometer. The
   developed cytometer can evaluate quantitatively the radiation dose by
   the mean fluorescence intensity of gamma-H2AX with a significantly
   smaller amount of blood samples than a commercial flow cytometer. (C)

Abstract = {{In two-way relay channels, two terminal nodes exchange information with
   the help of a relay node. Designing practical coding schemes for such
   channels is challenging, especially when messages are encoded into
   multiple streams and a destination node receives signals from multiple
   nodes. In this paper, we prove an achievable region for half-duplex
   three-phase two-way relay channels. Furthermore, we propose low-density
   parity-check (LDPC) codes for such channels where two source codewords
   are encoded by systematic LDPC codes at the relay node. To analyze the
   performance of the codes, discretized density evolution is derived for
   the joint decoder at terminal nodes. Based on the discretized density
   evolution, degree distributions are optimized by iterative linear
   programming in 3 steps. The length of the obtained optimized codes is
   26\% longer than the theoretic one.}},

Abstract = {{With the ever-increasing demands of multimedia services and the boom of
   smartphones, traditional online multimedia applications are extended to
   mobile users anywhere and anytime. However, the flourishing of
   multimedia services is still hindered by inherent security and privacy
   concerns. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy
   issues of multimedia services by studying a newly emerging
   multimedia-oriented mobile social network (MMSN), which helps users
   receive multimedia services not only from their online social
   communities but also from their social friends in the vicinity.
   Specifically, we first define the MMSN architecture, and identify the
   unique security and privacy challenges. Then we study three MMSN
   applications: content query, service evaluation, and content filtering.
   For each application, we present the specific security and privacy
   problems with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we propose
   some future research directions in the MMSN.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, risk-aware cooperative spectrum access schemes for
   cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with multiple channels are proposed,
   whereby multiple primary users (PUs) operating over different channels
   choose trustworthy secondary users (SUs) as relays to improve
   throughput, and in return SUs gain transmission opportunities. To study
   the multi-channel cooperative spectrum access, cooperation over single
   channel is investigated first, which involves a PU selecting the
   suitable SU and granting a period of access time to the selected SU as a
   reward, considering trustworthiness of SUs. The above procedure is
   modeled as a Stackelberg game, through which access time allocation and
   power allocation are obtained. Based on the above results, cooperation
   over multiple channels is studied from the perspectives of the primary
   network and secondary network, respectively. Two schemes are proposed
   accordingly: the primary network-centric matching (PCM) scheme and the
   secondary network-centric cluster-based (SCC) scheme. In PCM scheme,
   cooperating SU for each channel is determined to maximize the total
   utility of the primary network, which is formulated as a maximum weight
   matching problem. In SCC scheme, SUs first form a cluster to share the
   channel state information (CSI), and the best SUs are selected for
   cooperation with PUs over different channels to obtain the maximum
   aggregate access time for the secondary network. Then, SUs share the
   obtained resource using congestion game and quadrature signalling.
   Numerical results demonstrate that, with the proposed schemes, PUs can
   achieve higher throughput, while SUs can obtain longer average access
   time, compared with the random channel access approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a practical and cost-effective approach to construct
   a fully distributed roadside communication infrastructure to facilitate
   the localized content dissemination to vehicles in the urban area. The
   proposed infrastructure is composed of distributed lightweight low-cost
   devices called roadside buffers (RSBs), where each RSB has the limited
   buffer storage and is able to transmit wirelessly the cached contents to
   fast-moving vehicles. To enable the distributed RSBs working toward the
   global optimal performance (e. g., minimal average file download
   delays), we propose a fully distributed algorithm to determine optimally
   the content replication strategy at RSBs. Specifically, we first develop
   a generic analytical model to evaluate the download delay of files,
   given the probability density of file distribution at RSBs. Then, we
   formulate the RSB content replication process as an optimization problem
   and devise a fully distributed content replication scheme accordingly to
   enable vehicles to recommend intelligently the desirable content files
   to RSBs. The proposed infrastructure is designed to optimize the global
   network utility, which accounts for the integrated download experience
   of users and the download demands of files. Using extensive simulations,
   we validate the effectiveness of the proposed infrastructure and show
   that the proposed distributed protocol can approach to the optimal
   performance and can significantly outperform the traditional heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{Helical polymeric stents have been proposed as a suitable geometry for
   biodegradable drug-eluting polymer-based stents. However, helical stents
   often experience nonuniform local expansion (dog boning), which can
   prohibit full stent expansion using conventional methods. The
   development of stents and deployment methods is challenging and can be
   supported by numerical analysis; however, this complex problem is often
   approached with simplified boundary conditions that may not be
   appropriate for helical stents. The finite element method (explicit and
   implicit) was used to investigate three common stent expansion
   approaches with a focus on helical stent geometry, which differs from
   traditional wire mesh stent expansion. Although each of the three
   methods considered provided some insight into the expansion
   characteristics, common displacement controlled, and uniform expansion
   methods were not able to demonstrate the characteristic local
   deformations observed in expansion. A coupled stent-balloon model,
   although computationally expensive, was able to demonstrate the expected
   nonuniform deformation. To address nonuniform expansion, a progressive
   expansion approach has been investigated and verified numerically. This
   method may also provide a suitable solution for nonuniform expansion in
   other stent designs by minimizing loading and potential damage to the
   artery that can occur during stent deployment. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: A pilot study was conducted to evaluate human corneal
   epithelial cell shedding in response to wearing a silicone hydrogel
   contact lens/solution combination inducing corneal staining. The nature
   of ex vivo collected cells staining with fluorescein was also examined.
   Methods: A contralateral eye study was conducted in which up to eight
   participants were unilaterally exposed to a multipurpose contact lens
   solution/silicone hydrogel lens combination previously shown to induce
   corneal staining (renu (R) fresh (TM) and balafilcon A; test eye), with
   the other eye using a combination of balafilcon A soaked in a hydrogen
   peroxide care system (Clear Care (R); control eye). Lenses were worn for
   2, 4 or 6 hours. Corneal staining was graded after lens removal. The
   Ocular Surface Cell Collection Apparatus was used to collect cells from
   the cornea and the contact lens.
   Results: In the test eye, maximum solution-induced corneal staining
   (SICS) was observed after 2 hours of lens wear (reducing significantly
   by 4 hours; p<0.001). There were significantly more cells collected from
   the test eye after 4 hours of lens wear when compared to the control eye
   and the collection from the test eye after 2 hours (for both; n=5;
   p<0.001). The total cell yield at 4 hours was 813 +/- 333 and 455 +/-
   218 for the test and control eyes, respectively (N=5, triplicate,
   p=0.003). A number of cells were observed to have taken up the
   fluorescein dye from the initial fluorescein instillation. Confocal
   microscopy of fluorescein-stained cells revealed that fluorescein was
   present throughout the cell cytoplasm and was retained in the cells for
   many hours after recovery from the corneal surface.
   Conclusion: This pilot study indicates that increased epithelial cell
   shedding was associated with a lens-solution combination which induces
   SICS. Our data provides insight into the transient nature of the SICS
   reaction and the nature of fluorescein staining observed in SICS.}},

   delay for users is minimized. In addition, a traffic-shaping algorithm
   is proposed. The traffic-shaping algorithm converts the user health data
   traffic to the nonhealth data traffic such that the capability of
   traffic analysis attacks is largely reduced. Through the numerical
   analysis, we show the efficiency of the proposed traffic-shaping
   algorithm in terms of service delay and privacy preservation.
   Furthermore, through the simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed
   resource allocation scheme significantly reduces the service delay
   compared to two other alternatives using jointly the short queue and
   distributed control law.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new dual-band baseband equivalent (BBE) Volterra
   model devised to predict the behavior of dual-band power amplifiers
   (PAs) and/or to linearize their response. A series of derivations were
   applied to the original continuous passband Volterra-series expression
   to uncover a simple formulation that related the BBE envelopes of the
   output signals in each band to those at the input in the discrete
   domain. This yielded an inherently low-complexity dual-band
   Volterra-series model that does not require the empirical pruning
   commonly applied to the low-pass equivalent Volterra series. The
   proposed model was successfully applied to digitally predistort and
   linearize a dual-band 45-W class-AB GaN PA driven with different
   dual-band dual-standard test signals. For each band, the model
   necessitated less than 25 coefficients to reduce the adjacent channel
   leakage power ratio ACLR by up to 25 dB.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on a laboratory investigation of compaction
   characteristics of warm mix asphalt produced with the addition of
   synthetic zeolites. The influence of the time elapsed between mixing and
   compaction operations on mix compactibility was evaluated to define an

   completely release the water contained. A comparison between traditional
   hot mix asphalt and warm mixes was carried out; two compaction methods
   (impact and gyratory) were used. Mix compactibility was firstly
   evaluated in terms of air voids content for each condition of compaction
   (immediately after mixing or after 1-2 h of storage in an oven). Mix
   resistance to densification and to distortion was investigated by means
   of compaction indexes and traffic indexes. Data showed that the foaming
   process due to the addition of the zeolite has a peak value of intensity
   after 1 h of MFT. This effect seems to vanish after a longer period of
   time. Outcomes of this study are expected to benefit both practitioners
   and researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion of the reinforcing steel is a primary deterioration mechanism
   for reinforced concrete bridges. The spatial distribution of such
   spalling, relative to bar splices and laps, has not been considered in
   previous studies and may have a significant influence on structural

   concept for the practical evaluation of existing bridges. It uses
   graphical spalling surveys, reinforcement layout information, and
   existing information regarding material and geometric properties as
   inputs for the flexural and shear analysis of deteriorated bridge
   girders. This methodology is easily adapted for full bridge analysis and
   to consider the effects of bar section loss and bond deterioration. A
   case study bridge is evaluated to show that this methodology offers a
   viable tool for the rapid assessment of spalled bridge girders to
   facilitate the prioritization of rehabilitation projects.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing global concern regarding the impacts of large scale
   land disturbance by wildfire on a wide range of water and related
   ecological services. This study explores the impact of the 2003 Lost
   Creek wildfire in the Crowsnest River basin, Alberta, Canada on regional
   scale sediment sources using a tracing approach. A composite geochemical
   fingerprinting procedure was used to apportion the sediment efflux among
   three key spatial sediment sources: 1) unburned (reference) 2) burned
   and 3) burned sub-basins that were subsequently salvage logged. Spatial
   sediment sources were characterized by collecting time-integrated
   suspended sediment samples using passive devices during the entire ice
   free periods in 2009 and 2010. The tracing procedure combines the
   Kruskal-Wallis H-test, principal component analysis and
   genetic-algorithm driven discriminant function analysis for source
   discrimination. Source apportionment was based on a numerical mass
   balance model deployed within a Monte Carlo framework incorporating both
   local optimization and global (genetic algorithm) optimization. The mean
   relative frequency-weighted average median inputs from the three spatial
   source units were estimated to be 17\% (inter-quartile uncertainty range
   0-32\%) from the reference areas, 45\% (inter-quartile uncertainty range
   25-65\%) from the burned areas and 38\% (inter-quartile uncertainty
   range 14-59\%) from the burned-salvage logged areas. High sediment
   inputs from burned and the burned-salvage logged areas, representing
   spatial source units 2 and 3, reflect the lasting effects of forest
   canopy and forest floor organic matter disturbance during the 2003
   wildfire including increased runoff and sediment availability related to
   high terrestrial erosion, streamside mass wasting and river bank
   collapse. The results demonstrate the impact of wildfire and incremental
   pressures associated with salvage logging on catchment spatial sediment
   sources in higher elevation Montane regions where forest growth and
   vegetation recovery are relatively slow. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a reordered overlapped search mechanism for
   high-throughput low-energy content-addressable memories (CAMs). Most
   mismatches can be found by searching a few bits of a search word. To
   lower power dissipation, a word circuit is often divided into two
   sections that are sequentially searched or even pipelined. Because of
   this process, most of match lines in the second section are unused.
   Since searching the last few bits is very fast compared to searching the
   rest of the bits, we propose to increase throughput by asynchronously
   initiating second-stage searches on the unused match lines as soon as a
   first-stage search is complete. In our circuit implementation, each word
   circuit is independently controlled by a locally generated timing signal
   rather than a global signal. This allows the circuits to be in the
   required phase for their own local operation: evaluate or precharge,
   instead of having to synchronize their phase to the rest of the word
   circuits, which greatly reduces the cycle time. As a design example, a
   128 64-bit CAM is implemented and evaluated by HSPICE simulation under a
   90 nm CMOS technology. The proposed asynchronous CAM operates 5.98 times
   faster than a synchronous CAM with 14.2\% smaller energy dissipation.
   The post-layout proposed CAM achieves 385-ps cycle delay time and 0.773
   fJ/bit/search and is also evaluated under different corner conditions
   and PVT variations to guarantee it operates properly.}},

Abstract = {{Telecontrol of distribution switching devices is recognized as a major
   means for reducing interruption duration after a fault occurrence in
   modern distribution systems, since it allows one to isolate the faulted
   sections and to restore the healthy ones as quickly as possible. In
   order to reduce interruption frequency as well, it is necessary to
   increase the number of series automatic circuit breakers. Further
   benefits in terms of service continuity improvement can be obtained by
   allowing islanded operation of relatively small portions of distribution
   network (microgrids) in the presence of distributed energy resources in
   order to supply the local load autonomously during upstream faults. This
   paper aims to describe an innovative systematic method and its related
   analytical formulation to evaluate distribution system reliability
   indices accounting for advanced operation practices such as those based
   on telecontrol and islanding.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers optimal transmission switching (OTS) to reduce
   generation cost by removing lines from service. A mixed integer program
   (MIP) has been proposed to solve the OTS problem, based on the linear
   direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) model. Because of excessive
   computation times for large, real systems, the MIP model has been
   followed by some heuristics, also based on the DCOPF, to obtain
   near-optimal solutions quickly. However, the approximations in the DCOPF
   model may lead to poor choices of lines to remove from service. We
   assess the quality of line removal recommendations that rely on a
   previously published, DCOPF-based heuristic, by estimating actual cost
   reduction with the exact ACOPF model, using the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus
   test systems with several demand levels. We also extend this heuristic
   to be based on the ACOPF and compare the quality of its recommendations
   to those of the DCOPF-based heuristic. The DCOPF-based heuristic
   performs very poorly in several cases, even leading to cost increases
   sometimes. There is a need for approximations to the ACOPF which are
   accurate enough to produce reliably good results for OTS heuristics, but
   fast enough for practical use.}},

   hemoglobin structural changes, previously unreported large exothermic
   events have been repeatedly detected at temperatures below the

   association. Given the importance of protein-protein interactions and
   protein solution stability, this event was characterized with respect to
   concentration and scan rate. This detailed analysis revealed the
   formation of aggregates that differed in size, appearance, and settling
   time. While repeat mu DSC scans confirmed that this aggregation event
   was irreversible when samples were heated beyond 55 A degrees C, it was
   also found that aggregation could be prevented through the addition 0.02
   M urea. All evidence points to a significant occurrence of a kinetic
   pathway that leads to an intermediate aggregation event that is believed
   to be formed from dissociated hemoglobin subunits.}},

Abstract = {{Several crystallization-based techniques are used to measure the
   chemical-composition distribution of polyolefins, but they are limited
   to semicrystalline polyolefins. Recently, high-temperature thermal
   gradient interaction chromatography (HT-TGIC) has been developed to
   quantify the chemical-composition distribution of semicrystalline and
   amorphous polyolefins, thus broadening the range of techniques available
   for the analysis of polyolefin chemical-composition distribution. In
   HT-TGIC, the fractionation mechanism relies on the interaction of
   polyolefin chains with a graphite surface upon temperature change in an
   isocratic solvent. In the present investigation, a series of
   ethylene/1-octene copolymers having approximately the same molecular
   weight average and different comonomer fractions (up to 25\% of
   1-octene) is synthesized using a metallocene catalyst to investigate the
   fractionation mechanism of HT-TGIC. Three copolymer samples and their
   blends are also studied to determine which operation parameters
   influence the HT-TGIC peak shape and position. The cooling rate has no
   significant effect on the desorption temperature and the broadness of
   the HT-TGIC chromatograms. On the other hand, the heating rate and the
   elution flow rate substantially influence the peak temperature and
   breadth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers an approach to model the coupled physics of structural
   mechanics, moisture diffusion, and heat conduction together with
   physical aging. The modeling is performed on a glassy polymer blend and
   hence incorporates the material viscoelastic behavior. Determination of
   the coupling coefficients, which link the governing equations of the
   mechanisms to each other, is particularly challenging. In this work, an
   estimation procedure has been used to determine the coupling
   coefficients, based on the experimental data reported in our recent
   papers. The effects of physical aging on mechanical stress-strain are
   also included using the shift factors, which were specified
   experimentally. The effect of physical aging on moisture diffusion is
   also modeled using a time-varying boundary condition. Experimental
   verification of the model shows that the developed model is capable of
   predicting the deflection of plastic parts subjected to hygrothermal
   conditions; i.e., conditions where moisture diffusion and physical aging
   phenomena are influential.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A novel executable modeling approach is proposed for system-of-systems
   architecture by taking full advantage of the Department of Defense
   Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Metamodel (DM2) and defining the common
   model transformation specification at the metamodel level. This
   methodology provides more flexibility and adaptability for the automated
   construction of executable models directly from the architectural data
   rather than from static models. More specifically, the architectural
   data metamodel is first established to guide architectural data modeling
   of core data elements and associations in DM2 as the common and
   consistent data dictionary for architecture modeling, while the
   executable formalism metamodel is designed to formally define executable
   models. Then, the mapping rules between both metamodels are presented as
   the common transformation specification regardless of which modeling
   language or methodology is employed in developing architectural
   descriptions. Finally, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technology, like
   XML schema languages and eXtensible Stylesheet Language specifications,
   is discussed to facilitate the automated transformation of executable
   models from architectural instance data. The feasibility of the proposed
   approach is illustrated using a published example where colored Petri
   net (CPN) is used as the executable formalism.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of lossless compression of binary trees, with
   the aim of reducing the number of code bits needed to store or transmit

   each binary tree into a binary codeword in two steps. In the first step,
   the tree is transformed into a context-free grammar from which the tree
   can be reconstructed. In the second step, the context-free grammar is
   encoded into a binary codeword. The decoder of the grammar-based code
   decodes the original tree from its codeword by reversing the two
   encoding steps. It is shown that the resulting grammar-based binary tree
   compression code is a universal code on a family of probabilistic binary
   tree source models satisfying certain weak restrictions.}},

Abstract = {{Causal video coding is a coding paradigm where video source frames X-1,
   X-2,..., X-N are encoded in a frame-by- frame manner, the encoder for
   each frame can use all previous source frames and all previous encoded
   frames, and the corresponding decoder can use only all previous encoded
   frames. In the special case where the encoder for each frame X-k is
   further restricted to enlist help only from all previous encoded frames,
   causal video coding is reduced to predictive video coding, which all
   MPEG-series and H-series video coding standards proposed so far are
   based upon. In this paper, we compare the rate distortion performance of
   causal video coding with that of predictive video coding from an
   information theoretic perspective by modeling each frame Xk itself as a
   source X-k = \{X-k(i)\}(i = 1)(infinity).Let R-c({*}) (D-1,..., D-N)
   (R-p({*})(D-1,..., D-N), respectively) denote the minimum total rate
   required to achieve a given distortion level D-1,..., D-N in causal
   video coding (predictive video coding, respectively). We first show that
   like R-c({*}) (D-1,..., D-N), for jointly stationary and totally ergodic
   sources X-1, X-2,..., X-N, R-p({*})(D-1,..., D-N) is equal to the
   infimum of the nth order total rate distortion function Rp, n(D-1,...,
   D-N) over all n, where R-p({*}), n(D-1,..., D-N) itself is given by the
   minimum of an information quantity over a set of auxiliary random
   variables. We then prove that if the jointly stationary and totally
   ergodic sources X-1,..., X-N form a (first-order) Markov chain, we have
   R-p({*})(D-1,..., D-N) = R-c({*}) (D-1,..., D-N). However, this is not
   true in general if X-1,..., X-N do not form a (first-order) Markov
   chain. Specifically, we demonstrate that for independent and identically
   distributed vector source (X-1,..., X-N), if X-1,..., X-N do not form a
   (first-order) Markov chain, then under some conditions on source frames
   and distortion, R-c({*}) (D-1,..., D-N) is strictly less than
   R-p({*})(D-1,..., D-N) in general. Our techniques allow us to compare
   R-p({*})(D-1,..., D-N) with R-c({*}) (D-1,..., D-N) even when the
   single-letter characterization of R-p({*})(D-1,..., D-N), if any, is

Abstract = {{We investigate performance limits of a multiple access communication
   system with energy harvesting nodes where the utility function is taken
   to be the long-term average sum-throughput. We assume a causal structure
   for energy arrivals and study the problem in the continuous time regime.
   For this setting, we first characterize a storage dam model that
   captures the dynamics of a battery with energy harvesting and variable
   transmission power. Using this model, we next establish an upper bound
   on the throughput problem as a function of battery capacity. We also
   formulate a nonlinear optimization problem to determine optimal
   achievable power policies for transmitters. Applying a calculus of
   variations technique, we then derive Euler-Lagrange equations as
   necessary conditions for optimum power policies in terms of a system of
   coupled partial integro-differential equations. Based on a Gauss-Seidel
   algorithm, we devise an iterative algorithm to solve these equations. We
   also propose a fixed-point algorithm for the symmetric multiple access
   setting in which the statistical descriptions of energy harvesters are
   identical. To further support our iterative algorithms, along with the
   analysis, comprehensive numerical results are also obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Phytochelatins (PCs) are cysteine-rich peptides with high binding
   affinity for toxic metals. Expressing the PC synthase gene (PCS) in
   plant growth-promoting bacteria may enhance its metal resistance and
   accumulation, consequently increasing phytoremediation efficiency in
   heavy metal pollution. In this study, PCS from Schizosaccharomyces pombe
   was cloned and expressed in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which was
   confirmed by real-time RT-PCR through an increase in SpPCS mRNA
   expression level when induced by 20 mu mol of CdCl2 in the transformed
   Ps.putida cells. The recombined strain KT2440-SpPCS exhibited enhanced
   Cd, Ag and Hg resistance. Compared with the original strain,
   KT2440-SpPCS also displayed a threefold to fivefold increase in Cd
   accumulation (14 center dot 32 mu mol g(-1) to 17 center dot 38 mu mol
   g(-1); dry weight) when grown in 30 and 50 mu mol CdCl2, along with an
   increase in nonprotein thiols. Further experiments showed significantly
   enhanced germination rates and growth of wheat seeds in 0 center dot
   1mmol to 1 center dot 0mmol Cd when inoculated with KT2440-SpPCS. This
   study shows potential use of Ps.putida KT2440-SpPCS in plants to
   construct a symbiotic system for an enhanced phytoremediation of heavy
   metal-contaminated environments.
   Significance and Impact of the Study
   The symbiotic system of using plant growth-promoting bacteria
   Pseudomonas putida to express phytochelatin synthase gene of
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe together in plants resulted in high heavy
   metal resistance and high accumulation capacity, suggesting potential
   enhancement in phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Efficient dynamic simulation code is essential in many situations
   (including hardware-in-the-loop and model-predictive control
   applications), and highly beneficial in others (such as design
   optimization, sensitivity analysis, parameter identification, and
   controller tuning tasks). When the number of modeling coordinates n
   exceeds the degrees-of-freedom of the system f, as is often the case
   when closed kinematic chains are present, the governing dynamic
   equations consist of n second-order ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs) coupled with m=n-f algebraic constraint equations. This set of
   n+m index-3 differential-algebraic equations can be difficult to solve
   in an efficient yet accurate manner. Embedding (or generalized
   coordinate partitioning) can be used to obtain f ODEs (one for each
   independent acceleration), which are generally more amenable to
   numerical integration; however, the dependent positions are typically
   computed from the independent positions at each time step.
   Newton-Raphson iteration is often used for solving the position-level
   kinematics, but only provides solutions to within a specified tolerance,
   and can require several iterations to converge. In this work, Grobner
   bases are used to obtain recursively solvable symbolic solutions for the
   dependent positions, which can then be evaluated to within machine
   precision using a fixed number of arithmetic operations. Natural
   coordinates are particularly attractive in this context, since the
   resulting constraint equations are maximally quadratic polynomials and
   are, therefore, easily triangularized. The proposed approach is suitable
   for use in an automated formulation procedure and, as demonstrated by
   three examples, is capable of generating highly efficient simulation
   code with minimal additional effort required at the formulation stage.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a companding-based scheme is proposed to reduce the
   Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of an orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing system. At the transmitter side, a compressing polynomial
   function is appended to the inverse discrete Fourier transform block;
   and at the receiver the transmitted signal is retrieved iteratively
   through combining the discrete Fourier transform block with a reverse
   expanding function. In the iterative algorithm the Jacobi's method is
   used for solving the equations. Also, the general form of the
   compressing polynomial functions is attained through the use of
   Daubechies wavelet functions. As an advantage, the proposed method
   involves less complexity at the transmitter compared to other PAPR
   reduction methods. Furthermore, it requires less increasing to
   signal-to-noise ratio for the same bit error rate in comparison with
   other companding methods. The order of compressing polynomial and the
   number of iterations for the proposed algorithm at the receiver can be
   set in accordance with the performance-complexity trade off.}},

Abstract = {{In a ring oscillator, the behaviour in which the output voltage ramp
   (up/down) of its individual delay cell crosses the threshold, which
   triggers the next stage delay cell, is crucial in determining the timing
   jitter, and hence phase noise. Specifically, as the slew rate of the
   ramp decreases and/or the amount of noise contribution from the
   transistors in the delay cell increases, the voltage ramp (up or down)
   has a higher probability of crossing the threshold multiple times,
   before finally passing it at a time denoted as last passage time, which
   is more accurate than the conventional first passage time model. This
   multiple crossing results in a higher jitter. In the past, investigation
   in last passage time jitter model results in jitter expression that can
   only be calculated numerically and thus no design guidelines/insights
   are apparent. In this paper, a novel model is presented with a simple
   closed form formula, which shows the extra jitter, due to multiple
   crossing, adds a term that increases as a function of the fourth power
   of the noise strength/slew rate ratio. The formula is applied to a real
   life practical low slow rate/high noise ring oscillator which finds
   application, for example, in random number generator implementation.
   Corresponding transistor level simulation results agree reasonably well
   with the model. Furthermore, it is shown that, on example designs, the
   last passage time approach in this paper can lead to time jitter that is
   100 \% larger than that due to conventional first passage time model.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of
   images are revisited on a per image base. To better handle, the heavy
   tail phenomenon commonly seen in the DCT coefficients, a new model
   dubbed a transparent composite model (TCM) is proposed and justified for
   both modeling accuracy and an additional data reduction capability.
   Given a sequence of the DCT coefficients, a TCM first separates the tail
   from the main body of the sequence. Then, a uniform distribution is used
   to model the DCT coefficients in the heavy tail, whereas a different
   parametric distribution is used to model data in the main body. The
   separate boundary and other parameters of the TCM can be estimated via
   maximum likelihood estimation. Efficient online algorithms are proposed
   for parameter estimation and their convergence is also proved.
   Experimental results based on Kullback-Leibler divergence and chi(2)
   test show that for real-valued continuous ac coefficients, the TCM based
   on truncated Laplacian offers the best tradeoff between modeling
   accuracy and complexity. For discrete or integer DCT coefficients, the
   discrete TCM based on truncated geometric distributions (GMTCM) models
   the ac coefficients more accurately than pure Laplacian models and
   generalized Gaussian models in majority cases while having simplicity
   and practicality similar to those of pure Laplacian models. In addition,
   it is demonstrated that the GMTCM also exhibits a good capability of
   data reduction or feature extraction-the DCT coefficients in the heavy
   tail identified by the GMTCM are truly outliers, and these outliers
   represent an outlier image revealing some unique global features of the
   image. Overall, the modeling performance and the data reduction feature
   of the GMTCM make it a desirable choice for modeling discrete or integer
   DCT coefficients in the real-world image or video applications, as
   summarized in a few of our further studies on quantization design,
   entropy coding design, and image understanding and management.}},

Abstract = {{The turbulent wake development of a circular cylinder with a single
   stepwise discontinuity in diameter was investigated experimentally using
   flow visualization and two-component Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). A
   single step cylinder is comprised of two cylinders of different
   diameters (D and d). Experiments were performed at a Reynolds number
   (Re-D) of 1050 and a diameter ratio (D/d) of two. A combination of
   hydrogen bubble and laser induced fluorescence techniques allowed
   visualization of complex vortex dynamics in the near wake. The results
   show that turbulent vortex shedding from a single step cylinder occurs
   in three distinct cells of constant shedding frequency. The differences
   in frequency and strengths between vortices in the cells lead to complex
   vortex interactions at the cell boundaries. The results demonstrate that
   vortex splitting, half-loop vortex connections, and direct
   cross-boundary vortex connections occur near the cell boundaries. A
   comparative analysis of flow visualizations and velocity measurements is
   used to characterize the main vortex cells and the attendant vortex
   interactions, producing a simplified model of vortex dynamics in the
   step cylinder wake for Re-D = 1050 and D/d = 2.}},

Title = {{A decentralized blind source separation algorithm for ambient modal

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL CONTROL \& HEALTH MONITORING}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new decentralized identification method based on the
   principles of blind source separation (BSS) that can perform modal
   identification in the presence of narrowband external excitations is
   presented. This algorithm is based on the principle of sparse BSS
   involving wavelet transforms to undertake identification for
   underdetermined static mixtures. Most BSS methods in the context of
   modal identification assume that the excitation is white and does not
   contain narrow band excitation frequencies. However, this assumption is
   not satisfied in many situations when the excitation is a superposition
   of narrowband harmonic(s) and broadband disturbance, for example,
   rotating machinery fixed to flexible structures, human-induced vibration
   in pedestrian bridges, or dynamic interaction with surrounding
   structures. Under such conditions, traditional BSS methods (such as
   second-order blind identification) yield sources (modes) without any
   indication as to whether the identified source(s) is a system or an
   excitation harmonic. In the proposed method, underdetermined BSS is
   employed, involving transformation of measurements to the time-frequency
   domain, resulting in a sparse representation. The statistical
   characteristics of the sources are estimated using residual bootstrap
   technique, which are then used to delineate the sources corresponding to
   external disturbances versus intrinsic modes of the system, in a
   decentralized fashion. The decentralized architecture is aimed at
   reducing the cost of instrumentation in both traditional wired and
   recent wireless applications. The performance of the algorithm is
   demonstrated using both a numerical study and a bench-scale laboratory
   experiment. The primary advantage of the proposed method is its ability
   to identify the modal harmonics of a flexible structure under narrowband
   excitations, in a decentralized fashion, where traditional BSS
   algorithms fail to achieve the same goals. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley

Title = {{Bayesian methodology to estimate and update safety performance functions
   under limited data conditions: A sensitivity analysis}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{41-51}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In road safety studies, decision makers must often cope with limited
   data conditions. In such circumstances, the maximum likelihood
   estimation (MLE), which relies on asymptotic theory, is unreliable and
   prone to bias. Moreover, it has been reported in the literature that (a)
   Bayesian estimates might be significantly biased when using
   non-informative prior distributions under limited data conditions, and
   that (b) the calibration of limited data is plausible when existing
   evidence in the form of proper priors is introduced into analyses.
   Although the Highway Safety Manual (2010) (HSM) and other research
   studies provide calibration and updating procedures, the data
   requirements can be very taxing. This paper presents a practical and
   sound Bayesian method to estimate and/or update safety performance
   function (SPF) parameters combining the information available from
   limited data with the SPF parameters reported in the HSM. The proposed
   Bayesian updating approach has the advantage of requiring fewer
   observations to get reliable estimates. This paper documents this
   procedure. The adopted technique is validated by conducting a
   sensitivity analysis through an extensive simulation study with 15
   different models, which include various prior combinations. This
   sensitivity analysis contributes to our understanding of the comparative
   aspects of a large number of prior distributions. Furthermore, the
   proposed method contributes to unification of the Bayesian updating
   process for SPFs. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the developed
   methodology. Therefore, the suggested approach offers considerable
   promise as a methodological tool to estimate and/or update baseline SPFs
   and to evaluate the efficacy of road safety countermeasures under
   limited data conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{318-340}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This article reviews perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS)
   characteristics, their occurrence in surface water, and their fate in
   drinking water treatment processes. PFASs have been detected globally in
   the aquatic environment including drinking water at trace concentrations
   and due, in part, to their persistence in human tissue some are being
   investigated for regulation. They are aliphatic compounds containing
   saturated carbon-fluorine bonds and are resistant to chemical, physical,
   and biological degradation. Functional groups, carbon chain length, and
   hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are some of the important structural
   properties of PFASs that affect their fate during drinking water
   treatment. Full-scale drinking water treatment plant occurrence data
   indicate that PFASs, if present in raw water, are not substantially
   removed by most drinking water treatment processes including
   coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, biofiltration,
   oxidation (chlorination, ozonation, AOPs), UV irradiation, and low
   pressure membranes. Early observations suggest that activated carbon
   adsorption, ion exchange, and high pressure membrane filtration may be
   effective in controlling these contaminants. However, branched isomers
   and the increasingly used shorter chain PFAS replacement products maybe
   problematic as it pertains to the accurate assessment of PFAS behaviour
   through drinking water treatment processes since only limited
   information is available for these PFASs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Urea has the highest demand among all solid nitrogenous fertilisers
   within the agriculture industry. In this paper, a mathematical model and
   an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique are proposed for the
   simulation and optimisation of the urea plant in an industrial
   petrochemical company. The developed mathematical model consists of
   complex vapour-liquid equilibria for the NH3-CO2-H2O-(NH2)(2)CO system
   in thermodynamic and reaction frameworks. The smart technique (e.g. ANN)
   considers the CO2 conversion in terms of temperature and the molar
   ratios of NH3/CO2 and H2O/CO2 in the liquid phase. The ANN predictions
   were compared with the real data and results obtained from the
   mathematical model. An acceptable agreement was attained between
   deterministic methods. Through implementation of a systematic
   sensitivity analysis, it was found that a temperature of 191 degrees C,
   a pressure of 132atm and a NH3/CO2 ratio of 2.7 are the optimum process
   conditions for the urea production. It is concluded that the developed
   ANN (or connectionist) technique is an efficient tool for modelling
   complex phase equilibria with reaction in the industrial urea plant.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated drag reduction in turbulent flow of water using
   air bubbles and other additives. The first phase of the experimental
   program dealt with the effects of small air bubbles on wall shear stress
   and friction factor. The friction factor versus Reynolds number data
   exhibited different trends at low and high Reynolds numbers. At high
   Reynolds number, the two-phase mixture behaved as a pseudo-homogeneous
   system and the friction factor followed the single-phase behaviour. At
   low Reynolds number, the observed friction factor was significantly
   higher than that of single-phase fluids. The observed trends were
   interpreted in terms of the average bubble sizes predicted from a
   well-known empirical equation. The second phase of the experimental
   program investigated the effects of additive/air-bubble combinations on
   drag reduction in water flow where the additives used were frother and
   polymer. The addition of frother made the flow more homogeneous and the
   mixture followed the single-phase behaviour more closely. In the absence
   of polymer, the injection of air bubbles generally increased the wall
   shear stress and friction factor compared to single-phase flow,
   especially at low Reynolds number. However, the addition of polymer to
   two-phase water/bubbles mixture induced drag reduction up to as high as
   60\%. The friction factor data for polymer-solution/bubbles combination
   followed the polymer-solution line, regardless of the presence of
   frother.}},

Title = {{ON THE INTERPRETATION OF VISCOSITY DATA OF SUSPENSIONS OF ASPHALTENE

Abstract = {{The viscous behaviour of suspensions of asphaltene nano-aggregates is
   often described in terms of the Pal and Rhodes model (Pal, Rhodes, J.
   Rheol. 1989, 33, 1021). The model assumes particles to be spherical in
   shape and takes into account the solvation or hydration of particles.
   However, the solvation coefficient estimated from the Pal and Rhodes
   model for asphaltene particles is generally too high to be realistic.
   Furthermore, the model does not consider the packing limitations
   (maximum packing volume fraction) of the asphaltene particles. A large
   body (14 sets) of the available viscosity data for asphaltene
   suspensions are reinterpreted in terms of the Krieger-Dougherty model.
   The data analysis indicates that asphaltene nano-aggregates are
   non-spherical disk-shaped particles with low aspect ratio (ratio of
   particle thickness to particles diameter). The aspect ratio depends on
   the nature of the asphaltene/oil system. For a given system, it
   increases with the increase in the temperature. Interestingly, the
   maximum packing volume fraction (phi(m)) of asphaltene particles is
   found to be nearly constant (phi m approximate to 0.37), independent of
   the nature of the asphaltene/oil system and temperature. Also the values
   of phi(m) predicted from the viscosity data are in reasonable agreement
   with the values predicted from a percolation model. Based on the
   analysis carried out in this work, the following model is proposed for
   accurate estimation and correlation of the viscosity of asphaltene
   suspensions: (r)={[}1-(phi/0.37)](-0.37{[}]), where (r) is the relative
   viscosity, {[}] is the intrinsic viscosity and phi is the volume
   fraction of asphaltene particles.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to describe an alternative fire growth model that allows
   prediction of fire development, including time to flashover. The
   unpredictable nature of real fire development is incorporated into the
   model through use of probability distributions which can be defined
   using appropriate fire test data, when available. By assuming that the
   fire goes through five different stages starting from ignition and
   progressing to flashover, the total time to flashover may also be
   estimated. The model considers potential variability in the times at
   which the fire will undergo transitions between the various stages of
   development, using a state transition method called the semi-Markov
   process model. Different fire data may be incorporated into the model by
   defining appropriate statistical distributions for the transition
   descriptors, making the model flexible enough for use in a variety of
   applications important to both product design engineers and fire safety
   regulators.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive numerical model of the hot extrusion process for
   aluminium alloys has been developed and validated. Reflecting the
   complex thermomechanical changes effected in the alloys during
   extrusion, the model incorporated heat flow and plastic deformation
   during extrusion. This paper presents the overall numerical development
   of a hot extrusion process for AA3003 and validation of the numerical
   model, by comparison to industrial data. The plasticity module was
   developed using a commercial finite element package, DEFORM (R), a 2-D
   transient Lagrangian model which couples the thermal and deformation
   phenomena and is able to predict the temperature, strain rate and strain
   distribution in the billet/extrudate at any position in the container
   and die. A new algorithm using MATLAB was also developed so-that details
   of the material flow and formation of the transverse weld and-how it is
   affected by the feeder geometry could be quantified. Validation of the
   DEFORM model and the MATLAB algorithm of the material flow against
   industrial data indicated that it gave excellent predictions of the
   pressure and temperature history during extrusion as well as material
   flow effects such as surface cladding as one billet is fed in after
   another through the die. The results indicated that the die feeder
   design has a significant effect on the transverse weld formation with
   tapered dies showing lower transverse weld lengths compared to regular
   feeder plates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper friction stir-induced diffusion bonding is used for
   joining sheets of 5754 aluminum alloy to coated high strength steels
   (DP600 and 22MnB5) by promoting diffusion bonding in an overlap
   configuration. Mechanical performance and microstructures of joints were
   analyzed by overlap shear testing, metallography, and X-ray diffraction.
   Our results show that the strength of joint is dependent upon tool
   travel speed and the depth of the tool pin relative to the steel
   surface. The thickness and types of intermetallic compounds formed at
   the interface play a significant role in achieving a joint with optimum
   performance. That is, the formation of high aluminum composition
   intermetallic compounds (i.e. Al5Fe2) at the interface of the friction
   stir lap joint appeared to have a more negative effect on joint strength
   compared to the presence of high iron composition intermetallic phases
   (i.e. FeAl). This is in agreement with previously reported findings that
   FeAl intermetallic can improve the fracture toughness and interface
   strength in Al/St joints. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

   steel - Experiments and model}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between as-formed microstructure
   and mechanical properties of a hot stamped boron steel used in
   automotive structural applications. Boron steel sheet metal blanks were
   austenized and quenched at cooling rates of 30 degrees C/s, 15 degrees
   C/s and 10 degrees C/s within a Gleeble thermal-mechanical simulator.
   For each cooling rate condition, the blanks were simultaneously deformed
   at temperatures of 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C. A strain of
   approximately 0.20 was imposed in the middle of the blanks, from which
   miniature tensile specimens were extracted. Depending on the cooling
   rate and deformation temperature imposed on the specimens, some of the
   as-quenched microstructures consisted of predominantly martensite and
   bainite, while others consisted of martensite, bainite and ferrite.
   Optical and SEM metallographraphic techniques were used to quantify the
   area fractions of the phases present and quasi-static (0.003 s(-1))
   uniaxial tests were conducted on the miniature tensile specimens. The
   results revealed that an area fraction of ferrite greater than 6\% led
   to an increased uniform elongation and an increase in n-value without
   affecting the strength of the material for equivalent hardness levels.
   This finding resulted in improved energy absorption due to the presence
   of ferrite and showed that a material with a predominantly bainitic
   microstructure containing 16\% ferrite (with 257 HV) resulted in a 28\%
   increase in energy absorption when compared to a material condition that
   was fully bainitic with a hardness of 268 HV. Elevated strain rate
   tension tests were also conducted at 10 s(-1) and 80 s(-1) and the
   effect of strain rate on the ultimate tensile strength (sigma(UTS)) and
   yield strength (sigma(Y)) was shown to be moderate for all of the
   conditions. The true stress versus effective plastic strain (flow
   stress) curves generated from the tensile tests were used to develop the
   ``Tailored Crash Model II{''} (TCM II) which is a strain rate sensitive
   constitutive model that is a function of effective plastic strain, true
   strain rate and area fraction of martensite, bainite and ferrite. The
   model was shown to accurately capture the hardening behaviour and strain
   rate sensitivity of the multiphase material conditions examined. (C)

Abstract = {{Non-planar (3D) interconnects have an important role in the electronic
   packaging industry these days. These unconventional interconnects allow
   manufacturers to save materials and space while connecting circuit
   components on flexible and non-planar substrates. Among a variety of
   flexible boards, double-sided flexible substrates have attracted the
   electronic industry to effectively and compactly develop miniaturized
   flexible devices such as sensors-on-chips. This study reports our
   developmental procedure for the creation of non-planar silver
   interconnects on the edge of double-sided copper substrates separated by
   a layer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using laser-assisted
   maskless microdeposition (LAMM). The article consists of the
   characterization of the IAMM process to effectively deposit Ag
   nanoparticles for production of conductive interconnects. Several
   parameters, including the deposition and laser processing parameters,
   are optimized to achieve interconnects free of pores, cracks and
   delamination. For investigating the topography and microstructure of
   interconnects, various analytical tools, such as SEM, XRD,
   Profilometery, and EDS were used. Furthermore, a 3D finite element
   numerical model was developed to predict the laser processing of silver
   nanoparticles on the substrate. The model includes a coupled thermal and
   structural governing physics to derive the temperature history
   throughout the simulation as well as strain/displacement within the
   substrate, which is identified the major source of cark formation in Ag
   tracks. The SEM micrographs of the laser processed nanoparticles suggest
   that a minimum of 1.24 W laser power was needed for an effective
   nanoparticles sintering to obtain conductive 3D interconnects with
   minimum amount of cracks whereas a 1.7 W laser power caused PET to
   decompose. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-micron scale columnar nickel structures with different
   cross-sectional geometries and grain sizes were successfully fabricated
   via electron beam lithography and electroplating methods. Uniaxial
   microcompression tests revealed the flow stresses of these structures
   increase with smaller grain sizes, in close agreement with the
   Hall-Petch relationship. Size dependent softening effects were only
   observed in nickel pillars with average grain sizes in the range of
   9.4-13.2 nm. In contrast, pillars with grain size near similar to 22 nm
   do not exhibit any flow stress dependence on size, with the pillar
   strengths remaining relatively constant. In addition, for nickel pillars
   with the same microstructures, there is no observable dependence of flow
   stresses on the cross-sectional geometries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Investigation on use of recycled asphalt shingles in Ontario hot mix
   asphalt: a Canadian case study}},

Abstract = {{The usage of recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) in hot mix asphalt (HMA)
   pavements provides many benefits as long as they are properly engineered
   into the various HMA mixes. Contractors, consultants, and Departments of
   Transportation have evaluated the performance of these various
   materials, although they are still only used in a limited number of
   areas. Alternatively, recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is recognized as a
   high value recycled material and is actually the most recycled material
   in North America. In Ontario, RAP is successfully used in most HMA.
   Related studies on HMA containing RAS and RAP are limited in Canada
   although recently studies and field trials on effectively using RAS in
   HMA in Ontario have been completed by the Centre of Pavement and
   Transportation Technology (CPATT) at University of Waterloo in
   partnership with Miller Paving Ltd and the Ontario Centre of Excellence.
   This paper presents key findings from a comprehensive laboratory
   investigation and analysis of six asphalt mixes with RAS and RAP in
   Ontario through dynamic modulus, resilient modulus, thermal stress
   restrained specimen, and flexural fatigue testing. Using RAS alone or
   combining with RAP makes the asphalt stiffer at high and low
   temperatures respectively. Lowering the low temperature performance
   grade of the asphalt binder by 6 degrees C and incorporating 3\% RAS or
   less with RAP in HMA mix design can result in meeting the appropriate
   specification. While field testing of RAS pavements demonstrated that
   surface friction properties are in good condition in various
   environmental and loading conditions, the laboratory test results and
   field performances indicate that RAS can be a useful additive to asphalt
   mixes in Ontario hot mix pavement through reasonable mix design.}},

Abstract = {{The progress in the growth of nitride-based laser diodes (LDs) made by

   we describe the GaN and InGaN growth peculiarities, p-type doping
   efficiency, and the properties of InGaN quantum wells (QWs) grown by
   PAMBE. We demonstrate continuous wave (cw) LDs operating in the range
   from 410 to 482 nm. These LDs were grown on low dislocation (0 0 0 1)
   c-plane bulk GaN substrate, which allow one to fabricate cw LDs with a
   lifetime exceeding 2000 h. Also, the ultraviolet LDs at 388 nm grown on
   (2 0-2 1) semipolar substrates are discussed. The use of high active
   nitrogen fluxes up to 2 mu m/h during the InGaN growth was essential for
   pushing the lasing wavelengths of PAMBE LDs above 460 nm. Recent
   advancement of InGaN growth by PAMBE allows one to demonstrate
   high-quality quantum QWs and excellent morphology for thick layers. We
   discuss the influence of LDs design on their parameters such as lasing
   threshold current and laser beam quality.}},

Abstract = {{A novel combined-element frequency selective surface (FSS) is proposed
   for multi-band applications. In this design, complementary square loops
   and meandering slots are combined to construct the composite FSS. The
   proposed FSS provides three transmission poles and two transmission
   zeros, transmitting the desired signals at 8.5, 11 and 16 GHz while
   reflecting the unnecessary signals at 9.6 and 13.1 GHz. This FSS has the
   advantages of flexible and simple structure, easy processing and low
   profile compared with traditional multi-pole FSSs. The design strategy
   of the proposed FSS and the associated equivalent circuit model are
   provided to analyse the frequency characteristics. A prototype is
   fabricated and measured, showing a superior and stable frequency
   response in case of oblique incidence for both the transverse-electric
   (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) polarisations. Good agreement between
   the simulated and measured results is observed. Finally, the
   higher-order FSS with good frequency selectivity is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted using a custom double-stirred tank reactor to
   determine the rate constants of reactions between nitric oxide (NO) and
   both pentaaminecobalt(II) and hexaaminecobalt(II) at temperatures of
   298.2 and 303.2 K and pH levels between 8.50 and 9.87 under atmospheric
   pressure. The NO concentration of simulated flue gas stream ranged from
   400 to 1400 ppmv. Ammoniacal cobalt(11) solutions were prepared by
   adding aqueous ammonia into a cobalt(II) nitrate solution in the
   presence of concentrated ammonium nitrate. The reaction rate constants
   were calculated with an enhancement factor for gas absorption associated
   with parallel chemical reactions. The results showed that the reaction
   between NO and pentaaminecobalt(II) was first order with respect to both
   the NO and the pentaamminecobalt(II) ion. Similarly, the reaction
   between NO and hexaamminecobalt(II) was first order with respect to both
   the NO and the hexaamminecobalt(II) ion. The forward reaction rate
   constants of these two reactions were 6.43 x 10(6) and 1.00 x 10(7)
   L.mol(-1).s(-1) at 298.2 K, respectively, and increased to 7.57 x 10(6)
   and 1.12 x 10(7) L.mol(-1).s(-1) at 303.2 K, respectively. Ammoniacal
   cobalt(II) solutions also have the potential to simultaneously remove

Abstract = {{Reliable estimation of low flows at ungauged catchments is one of the
   major challenges in water-resources planning and management. This study
   aims at providing at-site and ungauged sites low-flow frequency analysis
   using regionalization approach. A two-stage delineating homogeneous
   region is proposed in this study. Clustering sites with similar low-flow
   L-moment ratios is initially conducted, and L-moment-based discordancy
   and heterogeneity measures are then used to detect unusual sites. Based
   on the goodness-of-fit test statistic, the best-fit regional model is
   identified in each hydrologically homogeneous region. The relationship
   between mean annual 7-day minimum flow and hydro-geomorphic
   characteristics is also constructed in each homogeneous region
   associated with the derived regional model for estimating various
   low-flow quantiles at ungauged sites. Uncertainty analysis of model
   parameters and low-flow estimations is carried out using the Bayesian
   inference. Applied in Sefidroud basin located in northwestern Iran, two
   hydrologically homogeneous regions are identified, i.e. the east and
   west regions. The best-fit regional model for the east and west regions
   are generalized logistic and Pearson type III distributions,
   respectively. The results show that the proposed approach provides
   reasonably good accuracy for at-site as well as ungauged-site frequency
   analysis. Besides, interval estimations for model parameters and low
   flows provide uncertainty information, and the results indicate that
   Bayesian confidence intervals are significantly reduced when comparing
   with the outcomes of conventional t-distribution method. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Good understanding of the H-2 electrochemical reaction mechanism helps
   optimize SOFC anode design and improve its performance. Controversies
   still exist regarding H2 oxidation mechanism despite extensive studies
   performed. In this work, a new charge transfer reactions mechanism
   proposed by Shishkin and Ziegler (2010) based on Density Functional
   Theory (DFT) study was investigated through kinetic modelling and
   pattern anode experimental validation. The new charge transfer reactions
   mechanism considers hydrogen oxidation at the interface of Ni and YSZ.
   It involves a hydrogen atom reacting with the oxygen ions bound to both
   Ni and YSZ to produce hydroxyl (Charge transfer reaction 1), the latter
   reacting with the other hydrogen atom to form water (Charge transfer
   reaction 2). The predictive capability of this reaction mechanism to
   represent our experimental results was evaluated. The simulated Tafel
   plots were compared with our experimental data for a wide range of Hy
   and H2O partial pressures and at different temperatures. Good agreements
   between simulation and experimental results were obtained. Charge
   transfer reaction 1 was found to dominate the overall charge transfer
   reaction under cathodic polarization. Under anodic polarization, a
   change in the dominating charge transfer reaction from charge transfer
   reaction 1 to charge transfer reaction 2 was found when increasing the
   H2O partial pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An induced current method for measuring zeta potential of electrolyte
   solution-air interface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{416}},
Pages = {{101-104}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel and very simple method for measuring the zeta
   potential of electrolyte solution air interface. When a measuring
   electrode contacts the electrolyte solution air interface, an electrical
   current will be generated due to the potential difference between the
   electrode air surface and the electrolyte solution air interface. The
   amplitude of the measured electric signal is linearly proportional to
   this potential difference; and depends only on the zeta potential at the
   electrolyte solution air interface, regardless of the types and
   concentrations of the electrolyte. A correlation between the zeta
   potential and the measured voltage signal is obtained based on the
   experimental data. Using this equation, the zeta potential of any
   electrolyte solution air interface can be evaluated quickly and easily
   by inserting an electrode through the electrolyte solution air interface
   and measuring the electrical signal amplitude. This method was verified
   by comparing the obtained results of NaCl, MgCl2 and CaCl2 solutions of
   different pH values and concentrations with the zeta potential data
   reported in the published journal papers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{The effects of the nanometric interstitial compounds TiC, ZrC and TiN on
   the mechanical and thermal dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of the
   nanocomposite lithium alanate (LiAlH4) hydride}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2575-2586}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Profuse mechanical dehydrogenation occurs during controlled high energy
   ball milling of LlAlH(4) containing 5 wt.\% of the nanometric
   interstitial compounds such as n-TiC, n-TiN and n-ZrC which involves a
   gradual decomposition of LlAlH(4) to the mixture of Li3AlH6 and Al
   (Stage I) followed by a further decomposition of Li3AlH6 to the mixture
   of Al and LiH (Stage II). XRD reveals that the interstitial compounds
   remain stable in the hydride matrix during entire ball milling duration.
   The effectiveness of the nanometric interstitial compound additives for
   mechanical dehydrogenation increases on the order of n-TiN > n-TiC >
   n-ZrC. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals that there is no measurable
   change in a unit cell volume of LlAlH(4) after ball milling which
   indicates that an accelerated mechanical dehydrogenation of LlAlH(4)
   containing the nanometric interstitial compounds is unrelated to the
   lattice expansion as we have already reported for the nanometric metal
   Fe (n-Fe). In addition, the observed strong catalytic activity of the
   nanometric interstitial compounds for mechanical dehydrogenation is not
   related to their valence electron concentration (VEC) number. However,
   the n-TiN additive, which is the most effective one for mechanical
   dehydrogenation, has the smallest average particle size of 20 nm and the
   largest Specific Surface Area (SSA > 80 m(2)/g). For thermal
   dehydrogenation in Stage I the average apparent activation energy, E-A,
   for the interstitial compound additives is within the range of 87 -96
   kJ/mol whereas, for comparison, the nanometric metallic additives, n-Fe
   and n-Ni, exhibit drastically smaller apparent activation energy on the
   order of 55-70 kJ/mol. The average apparent activation energy for
   thermal dehydrogenation in Stage II is in the range of 63-80 kJ/mol in
   the order of E-A(n-ZrC) < E-A(n-Ti = n-TiC) and is lower than that for
   the nanometric metal additives n-Ni and n-Fe. In summary, the nanometric
   interstitial compounds do not substantially affect the apparent
   activation energy of Stage I but are able to reduce the apparent
   activation energy of thermal dehydrogenation in Stage II. XRD reveals
   that the interstitial compounds remain stable in the hydride matrix up
   to the dehydrogenation temperature of at least 165 degrees C. Ball
   milled LiAlH4 containing 5 wt.\% n-TiC, n-TiN and n-ZrC is able to
   slowly discharge large quantities of H-2 up to 5-6 wt.\% during storage
   at 40 degrees C. Unfortunately, the results of rehydrogenation at 165
   degrees C under 95 bar for 5 h indicate that LiAlH4 containing the
   nanometric interstitial compounds exhibits no rehydrogenation. Copyright

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{509}},
Pages = {{333-342}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Trends and variability in the hydrologic regime of the Athabasca River
   region were analyzed. Twenty hydrologic variables were selected for flow
   analysis within both the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) and, for
   comparison, surrounding watersheds. Intra- and inter-basin scale
   analyses were performed, including a comparison of changes in streamflow
   at stations forming part of the Reference Hydrometric Basin Network
   (RHBN) and non-designated gauges. Streamflow trends were also compared
   with trends in air temperature and precipitation over the entire
   Athabasca and surroundings study region. Noteworthy results include
   strong decreasing trends in annual, warm season (March to October) and
   summer month flows over the majority of the study region, in addition to
   a greater number of decreasing trends in Athabasca watershed flows
   compared to the surrounding basins. The timing of the spring freshet was
   found to have not shifted toward an earlier onset, contrary to results
   from previous studies. Lastly, trends in streamflow were similar to
   those for precipitation over the ARB and surrounding region, but did not
   relate strongly to trends in air temperature. The results of this study
   should be of assistance to water- resources managers and policy makers
   in making decisions about water use in this rapidly changing watershed.

Abstract = {{The lifetime of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) can be limited by
   exciton-polaron interactions at the organic/organic interfaces. In this
   work, we show that simplified phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) are
   subjected to this phenomenon. By reducing the exciton concentration at
   the emission layer (EML)/electron transport layer (ETL) interface by
   means of increasing the EML thickness, hence broadening the
   recombination zone, the device lifetime can indeed be Unproved.
   Moreover, we report a device that displays the same extended lifetime,
   but with only 1 nm thin ETL. Studying the roles of this ultrathin ETL in
   increasing device efficiency reveals that electron injection, hole
   blocking, and triplet exciton blocking are all important factors. Hole
   blocking of the ETL can be achieved by highest occupied molecular
   orbitals level mismatch, where a layer thickness as low as 1 nm is
   sufficient, or by low hole mobility of the ETL, where a much thicker
   layer is required (> 5 nm). This ultrathin ETL also enables devices with
   only 50 nm total organic stacks, which is more than 50\% thinner than
   the typical. This structure opens up opportunities for much shorter
   processing time and lower fabrication costs in the OLED industry.}},

Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Continuous ethanol reforming in supercritical water was investigated in
   an Inconel-625 reactor without catalyst addition. Experiments were
   carried out for different operating conditions: temperatures from 450 to
   600 degrees C, pressures from 225 to 300 bar, ethanol concentrations
   from 2.5 to 10\% wt, and feed flow rates from 0.88 to 2.88 g/min. Higher
   temperatures increased the conversion and the hydrogen production, but
   above 575 degrees C the experiments failed due to excessive tar
   formation, which plugged the reactor and/or the back pressure regulator.
   The pressure effect in the range considered here was insignificant.
   Ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde was the main reaction pathway,
   followed by acetaldehyde decomposition to CH4 and CO. The catalytic
   effects of the reactor's wall were studied by varying the reactor's
   surface-to-volume ratio (Sly) by inserting Inconel wires. The results
   confirmed the significant catalytic effects of Inconel 625, especially
   above 525 degrees C, and also demonstrated that at 550 degrees C and for
   an S/V ratio of 3.1 l/mm, conversion up to 96\% was achieved without
   carbon deposition problems. Finally, a kinetic study for the ethanol
   dehydrogenation was carried out. This kinetic study revealed that
   ethanol dehydrogenation occurs mostly through wall-catalyzed reactions
   and that the homogeneous reaction is negligible in the reactor system
   considered here. Finally, an Arrhenius expression for the rate constant
   of the wall-catalyzed ethanol dehydrogenation reaction is proposed.}},

Title = {{Toward tripartite hybrid entanglement in quantum dot molecules}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Establishing the hybrid entanglement among a growing amount of matter
   and photonic quantum bits is necessary for scalable quantum computation
   and long-distance quantum communication. Here we demonstrate that
   charged excitonic complexes forming in strongly correlated quantum dot
   molecules are able to generate tripartite hybrid entanglement under
   proper carrier quantization. The mixed orbitals of the molecule
   construct multi-level ground states with sub-meV hole tunneling energy
   and relatively large electron hybridization energy. We show that
   appropriate size and interdot spacing keeps the electron particle weakly
   localized, opening extra recombination channels by correlating
   ground-state excitons. This allows for creation of higher order
   entangled states. Nontrivial hole tunneling energy, renormalized by
   multi-particle interactions, facilitates the realization of the energy
   coincidence among only certain components of the molecule optical
   spectrum. This translates to the emergence of favorable spectral
   components in a multi-body excitonic complex which sustain principal
   oscillator strengths throughout the electric field-induced hole
   tunneling process. We particularly analyze whether the level broadening
   of favorable spin configurations could be manipulated to eliminate the
   distinguishability of photons.}},

Title = {{Experimental Investigation of the VAPEX Process in Vuggy Porous Media}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-108}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the application of the vapor extraction (VAPEX) process
   was investigated to recover Cold Lake bitumen from vuggy porous media
   with n-pentane as the hydrocarbon solvent. Seven different sintered
   glass-bead models were designed and fabricated-four of which were
   vugular media with different vuggy-to total-pore-volume (PV) ratios. The
   vugs were arranged in aligned and staggered configurations. Three
   homogeneous sintered glass-bead models of different permeability and
   porosity were also fabricated to serve as baselines. The vug sizes were
   controlled in a narrow size-distribution range by embedding wood
   particles of uniform volumes (20 mm 3 each) in the packing of the
   glass-bead continuum, sandwiched between two parallel glass plates. The
   packing assembly was then sintered in the muffle furnace. For each
   particular VAPEX experiment, the oil-recovery performance was
   characterized by measurements {[}e. g., live-oil and dead-oil production
   rates, live-oil solvent content, and Residual Oil Saturation (ROS) (in
   the invaded area of the models)]. It was observed that the vugs
   significantly facilitated the live-oil production from the vuggy models
   compared with the corresponding homogeneous baseline model with the same
   matrix permeability. The increase in the vug porosity of the porous
   space significantly increased the live-and dead-oil production rates,
   and it slightly decreased the extent of ROS in the model. Unlike the
   sintered homogeneous models for which the live-oil-production rate
   remains reasonably constant during the lateral spreading phase of the
   VAPEX process, the vuggy-porosity models displayed a boost in the
   live-oil production rate when several vugs were being invaded by the
   solvent vapor. This behavior was more pronounced in the case of aligned
   vugs in which the vugs were closer to each other, and more vugs were
   invaded simultaneously compared with the case of a staggered-vug
   configuration. The enhanced pore-level mixing of solvent with bitumen,
   the improved petrophysical properties of the porous medium, and the flow
   communication of matrix with the vugs were found to enhance the live oil
   drainage towards the production well.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for solving a
   robust optimization problem when the description of parametric
   uncertainty is obtained using the Bayes' Theorem. In the Bayesian
   framework, the calculation of the probability distribution requires a
   large number of model runs. To this end, an approach based on
   multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is proposed to approximate the model
   with higher accuracy in the regions of parameter space where the
   probability is relatively higher. The approach is iterative where at
   each resolution level, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to select
   the parameter regions where the change in probability distribution is
   larger than a specified threshold. Then, at the next resolution level,
   basis functions are added only in these regions, resulting in an
   adaptive refinement. Once the uncertainty description in the parameters
   is obtained, an approach based on Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions is
   used to propagate the estimated parametric uncertainty into the
   objective function at each functional evaluation. Since the PC expansion
   allows computing mean and variances analytically, significant reduction
   in the computational time, when compared to Monte Carlo sampling, is
   obtained. A fed-batch process for penicillin production is used as a
   case study to illustrate the strength of the algorithm both in terms of
   computational efficiency as well as in terms of accuracy when compared
   to results obtained with more simplistic (e.g. normal) representations
   of parametric uncertainty. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the frequency analysis of droughts using a copula
   with the application of regionalization in the context of a bivariate
   homogeneity analysis. Drought events indicated by severity and duration
   were extracted from monthly flow averages. A K-means clustering
   algorithm was used to form initial regions. A fuzzy C-means algorithm
   was used to form the final groups of sites that meet the criteria of
   bivariate discordancy, bivariate homogeneity, and size. The application
   of the Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank copulas for bivariate drought
   frequency analysis was studied. Results show the importance of a clear
   definition of drought in every scenario since, in our example, the
   longest drought does not necessarily correspond to the most severe one.
   Another important observation of this study was that, given the average
   annual rainfall of a catchment, droughts seem to occur in almost all
   regions, humid or arid. However, areas with higher annual rainfall can
   experience shorter but more severe drought. The procedures of this study
   are applicable for flood frequency analysis as well. Furthermore,
   ungauged sites can be integrated in the procedure of regionalization.}},

Title = {{Ambient modal identification of structures equipped with tuned mass

Journal = {{SMART STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) decomposition based
   Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm is proposed for modal
   identification of structures equipped with tuned mass dampers. Tuned
   mass dampers (TMDs) are extremely effective vibration absorbers in tall
   flexible structures, but prone to get de-tuned due to accidental changes
   in structural properties, alteration in operating conditions, and
   incorrect design forecasts. Presence of closely spaced modes in
   structures coupled with TMDs renders output-only modal identification
   difficult. Over the last decade, second-order BSS algorithms have shown
   significant promise in the area of ambient modal identification. These
   methods employ joint diagonalization of covariance matrices of
   measurements to estimate the mixing matrix (mode shape coefficients) and
   sources (modal responses). Recently, PARAFAC BSS model has evolved as a
   powerful multi-linear algebra tool for decomposing an nth order tensor
   into a number of rank-1 tensors. This method is utilized in the context
   of modal identification in the present study. Covariance matrices of
   measurements at several lags are used to form a 3rd order tensor and
   then PARAFAC decomposition is employed to obtain the desired number of
   components, comprising of modal responses and the mixing matrix. The
   strong uniqueness properties of PARAFAC models enable direct source
   separation with fine spectral resolution even in cases where the number
   of sensor observations is less compared to the number of target modes,
   i.e., the underdetermined case. This capability is exploited to separate
   closely spaced modes of the TMDs using partial measurements, and
   subsequently to estimate modal parameters. The proposed method is
   validated using extensive numerical studies comprising of
   multi-degree-of-freedom simulation models equipped with TMDs, as well as
   with an experimental set-up.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a coarse-graining technique to reduce a given atomistic model
   into an equivalent coarse grained continuum model. The developed
   technique is tailored for problems involving complex crack patterns in
   2D and 3D including crack branching and coalescence. Atoms on the crack
   surface are separated from the atoms not on the crack surface by
   employing the centro symmetry parameter. A rectangular grid is
   superimposed on the atomistic model. Atoms on the crack surface in each
   cell are used to estimate the equivalent coarse-scale crack surface of
   that particular cell. The crack path in the coarse model is produced by
   joining the approximated crack paths in each cell. The developed
   technique serves as a sound basis to study the crack propagation in
   multiscale methods for fracture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{223-234}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the potential use of vibration isolation to reduce
   the dynamic response of wind turbine structures, with emphasis on
   structural response to seismic loading. Based on the concept of partial
   mass isolation, vibration isolators are proposed at the top of the
   turbine tower, just below the nacelle. The structural idealizations of a
   wind turbine including a nonlinear isolation system are presented and
   the responses are simulated using the finite element method. A sample
   turbine structure is presented and subjected to coherent wind and
   seismic loading in order to demonstrate the effect of isolation system
   parameters on the structural response. A parametric study is conducted
   to study the effect of isolation system parameters on the response of
   the turbine structure, including the blades. The responses are
   quantified in terms of several performance indices reflecting the
   trade-offs associated with implementing an isolation system on flexible
   structures. Results show that implementing an isolation system may be
   beneficial for reducing certain key parameters of the turbine's
   structural response, and may provide an excellent design option for the
   design of wind turbines in seismically active parts of the world. (C)

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the male
   population. The detection of prostate cancer using imaging has been
   challenging until recently. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) has been shown to allow accurate localization of the cancers and
   can help direct biopsies to cancer foci, which is required to plan the
   treatment. The interpretation of MRI, however, requires a high level of
   expertise and review of large multiparametric datasets. An endorectal
   receiver coil is often used to improve signal-to-noise ratio and aid in
   detection of smaller cancer foci. Moreover, computed high b-value
   diffusion-weighted imaging show improved delineation of tumors but is
   subject to strong bias fields near the coil. Here, a nonparametric
   approach to bias field correction for endorectal diffusion imaging via
   Monte Carlo sampling is introduced. It will be shown that the
   delineation between the prostate gland and the background and intensity
   inhomogeneity may be improved using the proposed approach. High b-value
   generated results also show improved visualization of tumor regions. The
   results suggest that Monte Carlo bias correction may have potential as a
   preprocessing tool for endorectal diffusion images for the prostate
   cancer detection and localization or segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in monitoring spatiotemporal expression patterns of
   genes and proteins with fluorescent probes, direct detection of
   metabolites and small molecules remains challenging. A technique for
   spatially resolved detection of small molecules would benefit the study
   of redox-active metabolites that are produced by microbial biofilms and
   can affect their development. Here we present an integrated
   circuit-based electrochemical sensing platform featuring an array of
   working electrodes and parallel potentiostat channels. `Images' over a
   3.25 x 0.9mm(2) area can be captured with a diffusion-limited spatial
   resolution of 750 mm. We demonstrate that square wave voltammetry can be
   used to detect, identify and quantify (for concentrations as low as 2.6
   mu M) four distinct redox-active metabolites called phenazines. We
   characterize phenazine production in both wild-type and mutant
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 colony biofilms, and find correlations with
   fluorescent reporter imaging of phenazine biosynthetic gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers an LTE-Advanced cooperative cellular network where
   a Type II relay station (RS) is deployed to enhance the cell-edge
   throughput and to extend the coverage area. To better exploit the
   existing resources, the RS and the eNodeB (eNB) transmit in the same
   channel (In-Band) with decode-and-forward relaying strategy. For such a
   network, this paper proposes joint Orthogonal Frequency Division
   Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarrier and power allocation schemes to optimize
   the downlink multi-user transmission efficiency. Firstly, an optimal
   power dividing method between eNB and RS is proposed to maximize the
   achievable rate on each subcarrier. Based on this result, we show that
   the optimal joint resource allocation scheme for maximizing the overall
   throughput is to allocate each subcarrier to the user with the best
   channel quality and to distribute power in a water-filling manner. Since
   QoS provision is one of the major design objectives in cellular
   networks, we further formulate a lexicographical optimization problem to
   maximize the minimum rate of all users while improving the overall
   throughput. A sufficient condition for optimality is derived. Due to the
   complexity of searching for the optimal solution, we propose an
   efficient, low-complexity suboptimal joint resource allocation
   algorithm, which outperforms the existing suboptimal algorithms that
   simplify the joint design into separate allocation. Both theoretical and
   numerical analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme can drastically
   improve the fairness as well as the overall throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) can be leveraged by introducing external
   spectrum sensing for secondary users (SUs) to overcome the hidden
   primary users (PUs) problem and improve spectrum utilization. In this
   paper, we investigate the DSA networks with external sensors, i.e.,
   external sensing agents, to utilize spectrum access opportunities
   located in cellular frequency bands. Considering the diversity of SUs'
   demands and the secondary bandwidths discovered by external sensors, it
   is critical to manage the detected spectrum resources in an efficient
   way. To this end, we formulate the resource management problem in the
   DSA networks as a dynamic resource demand-supply matching problem, and
   propose a cooperative matching solution. Specifically, spectrum access
   opportunities are classified into two types by the resource block size:
   massive sized blocks and small sized blocks. For the former type, SUs
   are encouraged to share the whole time-frequency block via forming
   coalitional groups with a ``wholesale{''} sharing approach. For the
   latter type, the resource ``aggregation{''} sharing approach is proposed
   to meet the time-frequency demand of individual SUs. To further reduce
   the delay in the spectrum allocation and compress the matching process,
   we develop a distributed fast spectrum sharing (DFSS) algorithm, which
   can deal with both two aforementioned types of resource sharing cases.
   Simulation results show that the DFSS algorithm can adapt to the dynamic
   spectrum variations in the DSA networks and the average utilization of
   detected spectrum access opportunities reaches nearly 90\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the resource allocation in a device-to-device

   enhance the network sustainability and efficiency by introducing power
   control and cooperative communication. Specifically, we propose optimal
   power adaptation schemes to maximize the network efficiency under two
   practical power constraints. We then take the dynamics of the charging
   and discharging processes of the energy buffer into consideration to
   ensure the network sustainability. To this end, the energy buffer is
   modeled as a G/D/1 queue where the input energy has a general
   distribution. Power allocation schemes are proposed based on the
   statistics of the energy buffer to enhance the network efficiency and
   sustainability. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results
   demonstrate that our proposed power allocation schemes can improve the

Abstract = {{A reactive extrusion process is developed for the modification of the
   rheological properties of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) by inducing
   long chain branching (LCB) using a photoinitiator and ultraviolet (UV)
   light. A central composite response surface design is selected to design
   the experimental runs at different photoinitiator concentrations,
   polymer flow rates, and extruder screw speeds. The selected processing
   factors at the specified levels produce negligible amounts of gel as
   indicated by extraction experiments. Linear viscoelastic properties at
   low frequencies indicate the presence of long chain branches. Both zero
   shear viscosity and relaxation time of the modified samples are enhanced
   with the branching. According to further molecular characterization, the
   molecular weight averages are slightly increased, however, the
   polydispersity index (PDI) of the modified samples remains the same.}},

Abstract = {{Results from the crosslinking kinetics of nitroxide-mediated radical
   polymerization (NMRP) of styrene (STY) in the presence of a small amount

   polymerization with
   N-tert-butyl-N-(2-methyl-1-phenylpropyl)-O-(1-phenylethyl) hydroxylamine
   (referred to as TIPNO-based alkoxyamine or 1-TIPNO) is first examined to
   see if the system exhibits controlled behavior. Then, typical profiles
   for crosslinking NMRP of STY/DVB in the presence of this alkoxyamine (as
   controller) are presented and contrasted with crosslinking under regular
   free radical polymerization, and NMRP of styrene (in the absence of
   crosslinker). Subsequently, the performance of crosslinking NMRP is
   evaluated based on rate of polymerization, molecular weights,
   polydispersity values and gel content under different operating
   conditions (different crosslinker and nitroxide concentrations).
   Finally, prediction profiles from a mathematical model are contrasted
   with experimental data to check the validity of the developed model with
   respect to both NMRP and crosslinking NMRP of STY/DVB with this
   TIPNO-based alkoxyamine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Antineoplastic drug ellipticine and its derivatives are used in human
   cancer therapy. However, their clinical applications have been limited
   by its great hydrophobicity and severe side effects. An efficient
   delivery system is therefore very desirable. In this research, an
   ellipticine-loaded core-shell structured nanosphere namely
   poly(DEAEMA)-poly(PEGMA) is designed as a drug carrier and prepared via
   a two-step semibatch emulsion polymerization method where DEAEMA and
   PEGMA represent 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and poly(ethylene
   glycol) methacrylate, respectively. The in-vitro release profiles of
   ellipticine towards the different pH liposome vesicles are recorded as a
   function of time at 37 degrees C. It is found that release of
   ellipticine from the core-shell polymer matrix is a pH-responsive and
   controlled release process. The three pH's of 3, 4, and 5 trigger a
   significant ellipticine release of 88\% after 98h, 83\% after 98h, and
   79\% after 122h, respectively. The release mechanism of ellipticine from
   the core-shell polymer matrix under acidic conditions is explored. The
   synthesis and encapsulation process developed herein provides a new
   perspective for the development of appropriate delivery systems to
   deliver the ellipticine and its analogues, as well as other types of
   hydrophobic drugs to a given target cell or tumor tissue.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of recent studies on the filtration of
   airborne nanoparticles. Classical filtration theory assumes that the
   efficiency of nanoparticle adhesion is at unity when nanoparticles
   strike a filter with a Brownian motion. However, it has been pointed out
   that small nanoparticles may have a sufficiently high impact velocity to
   rebound from the surface upon collision, a mechanism called thermal
   rebound. According to thermal rebound theory, the adhesion efficiency of
   nanoparticles decreases if their size is reduced. However, this
   phenomenon has not yet been clearly observed in experimental studies;
   there are still a number of uncertainties associated with the concept of
   thermal rebound, which is yet to be either proven or disproven. This
   review paper discusses the findings in the current literature related to

Abstract = {{Polyisoprene-montmorillonite (PIP-Mt) nanocomposites with an average
   particle size of 30 +/- 7.2 nm and narrow size distribution (20-50 nm)

   intercalated in the Mt layers expanding the d spacing of the Mt layer
   from 3.1 nm to 3.8 nm. The SDS (surfactant) concentration, isoprene
   monomer (IP) to water ratio and Mt loading were all found to affect the
   IP conversion level, and the solid content and particle size of the
   obtained PIP-Mt nanocomposites. An IP conversion level of 81\% and a
   solid content of 20\% were achieved at 025 wt.\% 2,2-azoisobutyronitrile

Abstract = {{Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are pervasively applied in modern
   industry. With increasing functionalities, modern NCSs tend to have
   dynamic workload by holding a variety of applications via a shared
   network. To handle workload variations and provide performance
   guarantees, dynamic network scheduling scheme is highly desired in NCSs.
   In this paper, we propose a network scheduling scheme, referred to as
   DTS, that can make on-the-fly decisions to schedule the applications in
   NCSs. DTS aims at NCSs that use time-triggered network as shared medium
   and Time division multiple access (TDMA) as network access method. DTS
   dynamically changes the network accessing sequence of the applications
   in a way to provide optimal system performance and maintain control
   stability in NCSs. DTS adopts a decentralized schedule mechanism where
   each application can make its local schedule decision, enhancing the
   scalability of NCSs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed scheme by improving the network bandwidth and providing
   better system performance in NCS comparing with the existing

Abstract = {{Distributed data mining applies techniques to mine distributed data
   sources by avoiding the need to first collect the data into a central
   site. This has a significant appeal when issues of communication cost
   and privacy put a restriction on traditional centralized methods.
   Although there has been development on many fronts in distributed data
   mining, we are still lacking models that abstract the process by showing
   similarities and contrasts between the different methods. In this paper,
   we introduce two abstract models for distributed clustering in
   peer-to-peer environments with different goals. The first is the Locally
   optimized Distributed Clustering (LDC) model, which aims toward
   achieving better local clusters at each node, and is facilitated by
   collaboration through sharing of summarized cluster information. The
   second is the Globally optimized Distributed Clustering (GDC) model,
   which aims toward achieving one global clustering solution that is an
   approximation of centralized clustering. We also report on concrete
   realizations of the two models that show their benefits, through
   application in text mining. The LDC model is realized through the
   Collaborative P2P Clustering algorithm, while the GDC model is realized
   through the Hierarchically distributed P2P Clustering algorithm. In the
   former, we show that peer collaboration results in significant increase
   in local clustering quality. The process utilizes cluster summarization
   to exchange information between peers. In the latter, we target
   scalability by structuring the P2P network hierarchically and devise a
   distributed variant of the k-means algorithm to compute one set of
   clusters across the hierarchy. We demonstrate through experimental
   results the effectiveness of both methods and make recommendation on
   when to use each method.}},

   became undetectable in MEC effluent (HRT 8 d), except for trivial
   acetate (4.16 +/- 1.86 mg COD/L). Accumulated methane only accounted for
   3.42\% of Delta COD. Pyrosequencing analyses showed abundant fermenters

   anode biofilm, propionate fermenters (Kosmotoga, and Syntrophobacter
   spp.), homoacetogens (Treponema spp.), and anode-respiring bacteria
   (ARB) (Geobacter spp. and Dysgonomonas spp.) were dominant. These

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-82}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Despite the large number of techniques proposed in recent years,
   accurate segmentation of digital images remains a challenging task for
   automated computer algorithms. Approaches based on machine learning hold
   particular promise in this regard, because in many applications, e. g.,
   medical image analysis, frequent user intervention can be assumed to
   correct the results, thereby generating valuable feedback for
   algorithmic learning. In order to learn segmentation of new (unseen)
   images, such user feedback (correction of current or past results) seems
   indispensable. In this paper, we propose the formation and evolution of
   fuzzy rules for user-oriented environments in which feedback is captured
   by design. The evolving fuzzy image segmentation (EFIS) can be used to
   adjust the parameters of existing segmentation methods, switch between
   their results, or fuse their results. Specifically, we propose a
   single-parametric EFIS (SEFIS), apply its rule evolution to breast
   ultrasound images, and evaluate the results using three segmentation
   methods, namely, global thresholding, region growing, and statistical
   region merging. The results show increased accuracy across all tests and
   for all methods. For instance, the accuracy of statistical region
   merging can be improved from 59\% +/- 30\% to 71\% +/- 22\%. We also
   propose a multiparametric EFIS (MEFIS) for switching between or fusing
   the results of multiple segmentation methods. Preliminary results
   indicate that MEFIS can further increase overall segmentation accuracy.
   Three thresholding methods with accuracies of 62\% +/- 11\%, 64\% +/-
   16\%, and 61\% +/- 9\% were combined to reach an overall accuracy of
   66\% +/- 15\%. Finally, we compare our SEFIS scheme with five other
   thresholding methods to evaluate its overall performance.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) powder was successfully synthesized by
   coprecipitation. In comparison with other methods, coprecipitation
   method provides advantages such as facile, economic and
   environmental-benign. The effects of Al-doping concentration and
   post-sintering treatment on electrical conductivity of AZO were
   investigated. Moreover, we also studied the influences of Al-doping
   concentration, pH, and type of dye on the photocatalytic activity of AZO
   powders. The objective of this study is to obtain a set of optimum
   parameters that will allow for improving electrical conductivity and
   photocatalytic activity of the powders. Additionally, the synthesized
   AZO powders which had high performance were modified by silane coupling
   agent KH-550 and then reinforced into polypropylene (PP) matrix. In
   order to improve the electrical conductivity of AZO/PP composites, the
   effect of modified-AZO filler content on electrical conductivity of
   AZO/PP composites was investigated. In the vicinity of the percolation
   threshold (around 3 wt\%), the AZO/PP composite's resistivity decreased
   dramatically by several orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{A technique was developed, using a laser flash thermal diffusivity
   apparatus, to measure the thermal contact resistance, R-c, of an Al lap
   joint during braze processing. The method required a determination of
   the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusivity of the individual
   Al braze sheets, as well as a two-layer lap joint made from these
   sheets, under identical conditions. A two-layer modeling method was then
   used to analyze the above data to determine R-c for the lap joint as a
   function of processing temperature. This in situ analysis of R-c for a
   developing joint during brazing was able to distinguish both solid-state
   and liquid-phase reactions occurring at the faying surfaces of the
   joint. Consequently, it represents a powerful, new experimental tool
   that can be used to investigate the mechanisms of braze joint formation
   and the thermal properties of a joint as a function of processing
   condition. In the particular case of this study, the technique
   demonstrates that the use of a Ni-based fluxless brazing process to join
   aluminum ( Al) sheets, reduced the R-c of the lap joint by 100-folds
   from 1.3 x 10(-4) m(2) K/W before brazing to 1.35 x 10(-6) m(2) K/W
   after brazing. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of micro-computed
   tomography to quantify wear in preclinical pin-on-plate testing of
   materials for use in joint arthroplasty. Wear testing of CoCr pins
   articulating against six polyetheretherketone plates was performed using
   a pin-on-plate apparatus over 2 million cycles. Change in volume due to
   wear was quantified with gravimetric analysis and with micro-computed
   tomography, and the volumes were compared. Separately, the volume of
   polyetheretherketone pin-on-plate specimens that had been soaking in
   fluid for 52 weeks was quantified with both gravimetric analysis and
   micro-computed tomography, and repeated after drying. The volume change
   with micro-computed tomography was compared to the mass change with
   gravimetric analysis. The mean wear volume measured was 8.02 +/- 6.38
   mm(3) with gravimetric analysis and 6.76 +/- 5.38 mm(3) with
   micro-computed tomography (p = 0.06). Micro-computed tomography volume
   measurements did not show a statistically significant change with drying
   for either the plates (p = 0.60) or the pins (p = 0.09), yet drying had
   a significant effect on the gravimetric mass measurements for both the
   plates (p = 0.03) and the pins (p = 0.04). Micro-computed tomography
   provided accurate measurements of wear in polyetheretherketone
   pin-on-plate test specimens, and no statistically significant change was
   caused by fluid uptake. Micro-computed tomography quantifies wear depth
   and wear volume, mapped to the specific location of damage on the
   specimen, and is also capable of examining subsurface density as well as
   cracking. Its noncontact, nondestructive nature makes it ideal for
   preclinical testing of materials, in which further additional analysis
   techniques may be utilized.}},

   Resolution and algebraic formulations of these definitions are provided

   the case of coalitions of the four basic individual stabilities

   coalitional stabilities are provided in this research. Furthermore, a
   range of the theorems establish the mathematical credibility of
   employing the innovative algebraic approach to conflict resolution when
   coalitions are present. Finally, a conflict over the proposed

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the use of a linear periodic controller (LPC)
   for the control of linear time-invariant (LTI) plants in the

   mode (DFM), it is well known that no decentralized LTI controller can
   stabilize it, let alone provide good performance. Here we show that, if
   the plant is centrally controllable and observable and the graph
   associated with the plant is strongly connected, then even if the plant
   has an unstable DFM, we can still design a decentralized LPC to provide
   LQR performance as close to the centralized optimal performance as
   desired; the proposed controller in each channel consists of a sampler,
   a zero-order-hold, and a discrete-time linear periodic compensator,
   which makes it easy to implement.}},

Abstract = {{Porous calcium polyphosphate (CPP) structures proposed as
   bone-substitute implants and made by sintering CPP powders to form
   bending test samples of approximately 35 vol \% porosity were machined
   from preformed blocks made either by additive manufacturing (AM) or
   conventional gravity sintering (CS) methods and the structure and
   mechanical characteristics of samples so made were compared. AM-made
   samples displayed higher bending strengths (approximate to 1.2-1.4 times
   greater than CS-made samples), whereas elastic constant (i.e., effective
   elastic modulus of the porous structures) that is determined by material
   elastic modulus and structural geometry of the samples was approximate
   to 1.9-2.3 times greater for AM-made samples. X-ray diffraction analysis
   showed that samples made by either method displayed the same crystal
   structure forming -CPP after sinter annealing. The material elastic
   modulus, E, determined using nanoindentation tests also showed the same
   value for both sample types (i.e., E approximate to 64 GPa). Examination
   of the porous structures indicated that significantly larger sinter
   necks resulted in the AM-made samples which presumably resulted in the
   higher mechanical properties. The development of mechanical properties
   was attributed to the different sinter anneal procedures required to
   make 35 vol \% porous samples by the two methods. A primary objective of
   the present study, in addition to reporting on bending strength and
   sample stiffness (elastic constant) characteristics, was to determine
   why the two processes resulted in the observed mechanical property
   differences for samples of equivalent volume percentage of porosity. An
   understanding of the fundamental reason(s) for the observed effect is
   considered important for developing improved processes for preparation
   of porous CPP implants as bone substitutes for use in high load-bearing
   skeletal sites. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

Abstract = {{Recently, a family of quadratic APN functions was demonstrated by
   Bracken et al. to exist over F(2)2k with k even and 3 (sic) k. This
   family of APN functions was firstly proposed by Budaghyan et al. and
   they exist provided the existence of a quadratic polynomial of the type
   x(2s+1) cx(2s) c(2k) x + 1 with no zeros in F(2)2k. Bracken et al.
   constructed such polynomials when k is even and 3 t k. In this paper, we
   show that such polynomials exist for all even integers k. As a result,
   the APN functions over F(2)2k exist for all even k. Furthermore, the
   Walsh spectra of these APN functions is shown to be the same as the one
   of the Gold APN functions. This gives a positive answer to one
   conjecture.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative communication (CC) can offer high channel capacity and
   reliability in an efficient and low-cost way by forming a virtual
   antenna array among single-antenna nodes that cooperatively share their
   antennas. It has been well recognized that the selection of relay nodes
   plays a critical role in the performance of multiple source-destination
   pairs. Unfortunately, all prior work has made an unrealistic assumption
   that spectrum resources are unlimited and each source-destination pair
   can communicate over a dedicated channel with no mutual interference. In
   this paper, we study the problem of maximizing the minimum transmission
   rate among multiple source-destination pairs using CC in a cognitive
   radio network (CRN). We jointly consider the relay assignment and
   channel allocation under a finite set of available channels, where the
   interference must be considered. In order to improve the spectrum
   efficiency, we exploit the network coding opportunities existing in CC
   that can further increase the capacity. Such max-min rate problems for
   cognitive and cooperative communications are proved to be NP-hard and
   the corresponding MINLP (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming)
   formulations are developed. Moreover, we apply the reformulation and
   linearization techniques to the original optimization problems with
   nonlinear and nonconvex objective functions such that our proposed
   algorithms can produce high competitive solutions in a timely manner.
   Extensive simulations are conducted to show that the proposed algorithms
   can achieve high spectrum efficiency in terms of providing a much
   improved max-min transmission rate under various network settings.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in the use of renewable energy sources to
   power wireless networks in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of
   conventional energy production or to enable deployment in off-grid
   locations. However, renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind,
   are by nature unstable in their availability and capacity. The dynamics
   of energy supply hence impose new challenges for network planning and
   resource management. In this paper, the sustainable performance of a
   wireless mesh network powered by renewable energy sources is studied. To
   address the intermittently available capacity of the energy supply,
   adaptive resource management and admission control schemes are proposed.
   Specifically, the goal is to maximize the energy sustainability of the
   network, or equivalently, to minimize the failure probability that the
   mesh access points (APs) deplete their energy and go out of service due
   to the unreliable energy supply. To this end, the energy buffer of a
   mesh AP is modeled as a G/G/1(/N) queue with arbitrary patterns of
   energy charging and discharging. Diffusion approximation is applied to
   analyze the transient evolution of the queue length and the energy
   depletion duration. Based on the analysis, an adaptive resource
   management scheme is proposed to balance traffic loads across the mesh
   network according to the energy adequacy at different mesh APs. A
   distributed admission control strategy to guarantee high resource
   utilization and to improve energy sustainability is presented. By
   considering the first and second order statistics of the energy charging
   and discharging processes at each mesh AP, it is demonstrated that the
   proposed schemes outperform some existing state-of-the-art solutions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a class of robotic manipulation that can
   automatically trace an unknown source of a scalar field by sensors
   attached to links of a robotic manipulator. To achieve this, one
   approach is to model the field map by a radial basis function (RBF)
   network and to update its weights in a recursive way so that the
   gradient estimate can be available in realtime to command the
   end-effector toward the target source. In this paper, we investigate the
   practical implementation of this autonomous manipulation scheme and
   demonstrate its performance through experimental tests. Firstly, we
   provide a selection guideline for the Gaussian-type RBF network.
   Secondly, the field estimation algorithm is simplified to a suboptimal
   estimator instead of the original recursive least square (RLS) filter
   previously used. Thirdly, a cross-coupled parameter estimator is newly
   introduced for global convergence of the combined control law. The
   overall control scheme is experimentally demonstrated using a two link
   planar robot. A smooth gray scale map is devised to represent the
   unknown physical potential field with its scalar values measured by
   color sensors on robot links. The effect of under fitting of the field
   model is also investigated through the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Stream reassembly is the premise of deep packet inspection, regarded as
   the core function of network intrusion detection system and network
   forensic system. As moving packet payload from one block of memory to
   another is essential for the reason of packet disorder, throughput
   performance is very vital in stream reassembly design. In this paper, a
   stream reassembly card (SRC) is designed to improve the stream
   reassembly throughput performance. The designed SRC adjusts the sequence
   of packets on the basis of the multicore network processing unit by
   managing and reassembling streams through an additional level of buffer.
   Specifically, three optimistic techniques, namely stream table
   dispatching, no-locking timeout, and multichannel virtual queue, are
   introduced to further improve the throughput. To address the critical
   role of memory size in SRC, the relationship between the system
   throughput and memory size is analyzed. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed SRC achieves more than 3Gbps in terms of
   reassembly and submission throughput and triply outperforms the
   traditional server-based architecture with a lower cost. Copyright (c)

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Active contours are a popular approach for object segmentation that uses
   an energy minimizing spline to extract an object's boundary.
   Nonparametric approaches can be computationally complex, whereas
   parametric approaches can be impacted by parameter sensitivity. A
   decoupled active contour (DAC) overcomes these problems by decoupling
   the external and internal energies and optimizing them separately.
   However a drawback of this approach is its reliance on the edge gradient
   as the external energy. This can lead to poor convergence toward the
   object boundary in the presence of weak object and strong background
   edges. To overcome these issues with convergence, a novel approach is
   proposed that takes advantage of a sparse texture model, which
   explicitly considers texture for boundary detection. The approach then
   defines the external energy as a weighted combination of textural and
   structural variation maps and feeds it into a multifunctional hidden
   Markov model for more robust object boundary detection. The enhanced DAC
   (EDAC) is qualitatively and visually analyzed on two natural image data
   sets as well as Brodatz images. The results demonstrate that EDAC
   effectively combines texture and structural information to extract the
   object boundary without impact on computation time and a reliance on
   color.}},

   Linkability for Roaming Service}},

Abstract = {{The roaming service enables mobile subscribers to access the internet
   service anytime and anywhere, which can fulfill the requirement of
   ubiquitous access for the emerging paradigm of networking, e.g., the
   Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a conditional
   privacy-preserving authentication with access linkability (CPAL) for
   roaming service, to provide universal secure roaming service and
   multilevel privacy preservation. CPAL provides an anonymous user linking
   function by utilizing a novel group signature technique, which can not
   only efficiently hide users' identities but also enables the authorized
   entities to link all the access information of the same user without
   knowing the user's real identity. Specifically, by using the master
   linking key possessed by the trust linking server, the authorized
   foreign network operators or service providers can link the access
   information from the user to improve its service, while preserving user
   anonymity, e.g., using individual access information to analyze user
   preferences without revealing user's identity. Furthermore, the
   subscribers can also use this functionality to anonymously query their
   usage of service. In addition, CPAL has an efficient revocation
   function, which revokes a group of users at the same time. Through
   extensive analysis, we demonstrate that CPAL resists various security
   threats and provides more flexible privacy preservation compared to the
   existing schemes. Meanwhile, performance evaluations demonstrate its
   efficiency in terms of communication and computation overhead.}},

   sheet during warm forming. The Barlat YLD2000 yield criterion is used to
   capture the anisotropy while the Bergstrom hardening rule predicts the

   those obtained from experiments. The measured stress-strain curves of
   the AA3003 aluminum alloy sheet at elevated temperatures and different
   strain rates are used to fit the Bergstrom parameters and measured
   R-values and directional yield stresses are used to fit the yield
   function parameters. Isothermal uniaxial tensile tests and nonisothermal
   deep drawing experiments are performed and the predicted response using
   the new constitutive model is compared with measured data. In
   simulations of tensile tests, the material behavior is predicted

   is proposed to estimate the true signal. The algorithm is compared to
   six other classic and state-of-the-art despeckling techniques. The
   comparison is performed both on synthetic noisy images added and on
   actual SAR images. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise

Title = {{Enabling Trustworthy Service Evaluation in Service-Oriented Mobile

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Trustworthy Service Evaluation (TSE) system
   to enable users to share service reviews in service-oriented mobile
   social networks (S-MSNs). Each service provider independently maintains
   a TSE for itself, which collects and stores users' reviews about its
   services without requiring any third trusted authority. The service
   reviews can then be made available to interested users in making wise
   service selection decisions. We identify three unique service review
   attacks, i.e., linkability, rejection, and modification attacks, and
   develop sophisticated security mechanisms for the TSE to deal with these
   attacks. Specifically, the basic TSE (bTSE) enables users to
   distributedly and cooperatively submit their reviews in an integrated
   chain form by using hierarchical and aggregate signature techniques. It
   restricts the service providers to reject, modify, or delete the
   reviews. Thus, the integrity and authenticity of reviews are improved.
   Further, we extend the bTSE to a Sybil-resisted TSE (SrTSE) to enable
   the detection of two typical sybil attacks. In the SrTSE, if a user
   generates multiple reviews toward a vendor in a predefined time slot
   with different pseudonyms, the real identity of that user will be
   revealed. Through security analysis and numerical results, we show that
   the bTSE and the SrTSE effectively resist the service review attacks and
   the SrTSE additionally detects the sybil attacks in an efficient manner.
   Through performance evaluation, we show that the bTSE achieves better
   performance in terms of submission rate and delay than a service review
   system that does not adopt user cooperation.}},

   bonded crush tubes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{39-52}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The use of lightweight materials in vehicle structures requires
   appropriate joining techniques, among them adhesive bonding. Testing
   full-scale structures such as vehicle crush tubes can be prohibitive in
   terms of cost and appropriate facilities may not be available, so it is
   often desirable to test sub-size structures. To address this need, the
   suitability of scaling to accurately describe the behavior of bonded
   crush tube structures during axial impact scenarios was investigated. A
   numerical simulation was validated using literature sources and
   experimental testing, and then used to investigate scaling. The
   predictions for structures constructed out of a single material, in
   terms of stress distributions and deformations were in good agreement
   between the numerical simulations of the model (experiment modified in
   size by a scale factor) and the prototype tubes (actual size
   experiment). When considering bonded structures with the possibility for
   joint separation, the Non-Direct Similitude technique was applied to
   scale the structure and the results showed a small departure between the
   predictions of the model and the prototype. For bonded crush tubes,
   where the presence of a second material in the form of an adhesive layer
   was small, the scaling method provides acceptable results. The
   limitations of the scaling technique were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Volume = {{247}},
Pages = {{961-966}},

Abstract = {{It is imperative to determine accurately battery discharge
   characteristics at various battery operating temperatures, which vary
   significantly over the vehicle lifetime and which strongly impact the
   performance, driving range and durability of batteries used in electric
   vehicles. In this study, an experimental facility has been developed to
   measure the battery discharge characteristics accurately through precise
   control of operating temperatures utilizing a water-ethylene glycol
   solution in a constant temperature thermal bath. The results show a
   maximum variation of 0.3 degrees C temporally and 0.4 degrees C
   spatially in battery temperature throughout the discharge tests at a 3C
   discharge rate, in contrast to 13.1 degrees C temperature change
   temporally and 4.3 degrees C spatially when using the conventional air
   convection temperature control method under the same test conditions.
   The new method of battery temperature control developed in this study
   yields more accurate battery discharge characterization due to both the
   elimination of state-of-charge drift caused by spatial variations in
   battery temperature, and inaccurate discharge characteristics due to
   battery heat up at various discharge and ambient conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is an enhanced oil recovery
   technology for heavy (or viscous) oil and bitumen that involves drilling
   two horizontal wells in underground formations. Laboratory work,
   pilot-plant studies, and mathematical model development, which are
   generally costly, difficult, and time-consuming tasks, are taken into
   account as important stages in finding an effective and economical
   method and also predicting the performance of the SAGD technique for a
   certain heavy-oil reservoir. Currently, smart techniques as accurate and
   fairly fast tools are highly recommended for these purposes. In this
   work, an experimental study and an artificial neural network (ANN)
   linked to an optimization technique, called particle swarm optimization
   (PSO), were employed to obtain performance parameters such as the
   cumulative steam-to-oil ratio (CSOR) and recovery factor (RF) for the
   SAGD process. The outputs of the developed connectionist modeling (i.e.,
   ANN-PSO) were compared with actual data, showing an average error lower
   than 7\%, mostly because of the supremacy of the ANN-PSO method compared
   to the conventional ANN method and the correlations developed in this
   study. Furthermore, it is concluded that, among the contributing
   parameters, reservoir thickness and oil saturation have the most
   significant impacts on RF and CSOR during SAGD operations. The current
   study confirms the potential of hybrid connectionist modeling to screen
   heavy-oil fractured reservoirs for the SAGD process.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption-driven self-assembly of nanoparticles at fluid interfaces is
   a promising bottom-up approach for the preparation of advanced
   functional materials and devices. Full realization of its potential
   requires quantitative understanding of the parameters controlling the
   self-assembly, the structure of nanoparticles at the interface, the
   barrier properties of the assembly, and the rate of particle attachment.
   We argue that models of dynamic surface or interfacial tension (DST)
   appropriate for molecular species break down when the adsorption energy
   greatly exceeds the mean energy of thermal fluctuations and validate
   alternative models extending the application of generalized random
   sequential adsorption theory to nanoparticle adsorption at fluid
   interfaces. Using a model colloidal system of hydrophobic,
   charge-stabilized ethyl cellulose nanoparticles at neutral pH, we
   demonstrate the potential of DST measurements to reveal information on
   the energy of adsorption, the adsorption rate constant, and the energy
   of particle-interface interaction at different degrees of nanoparticle
   coverage of the interface. These findings have significant implications
   for the quantitative description of nanoparticle adsorption at fluid

Abstract = {{The effect of Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) process on the
   microstructure and mechanical properties of wrought AM30 magnesium alloy
   was studied. Rod-shaped samples with 19 mm diameter were machined from
   an extrusion piece in the extrusion direction. Samples were pressed
   using an isothermal conical split ECAP die, with an internal channel
   angle of 90 degrees and outer radius angle of 20 degrees at 275 degrees
   C. The process was performed up to 4 passes, with samples being rotated
   by 90 degrees in the same orientation between passes. ECAP samples were
   sectioned for micro structural studies and tested for mechanical
   properties. The results showed a considerable effect of ECAP process in
   creating an ultrafine grain size structure. The grain structure was
   refined from original size 20.4 mu m to 3.9 mu m through the four
   passes. The grain uniformity increased as the number of passes
   increased, which was also reflected in the measured microhardness
   distribution color-coded maps. The elongation was increased in almost
   all passes, but the tensile yield strength reduction was observed. The
   changes in mechanical behaviors were due to texture modification. The
   twining was found in the compression test. The comparison of tensile and
   the compression test results along the ECAP direction showed that
   asymmetry in yield were reduced as the number of passes increased. (C)

Title = {{Color Generation and Refractive Index Sensing Using Diffraction from 2D

Abstract = {{Tunable structural color generation from vertical silicon nanowires
   arranged in different square lattices is demonstrated. The generated
   colors are adjustable using well-defined Bragg diffraction theory, and
   only depend on the lattice spacing and angles of incidence. Vivid colors
   spanning from bright red to blue are easily achieved. In keeping with
   this, a single square lattice of silicon nanowires is also able to
   produce different colors spanning the entire visible range. It is also
   shown that the 2D gratings also have a third grating direction when
   rotated 45 degrees. These simple and elegant solutions to color
   generation from silicon are used to demonstrate a cost-effective
   refractive index sensor. The sensor works by measuring color changes
   resulting from changes in the refractive index of the medium surrounding
   the nanowires using a trichromatic RGB decomposition. Moreover, the
   sensor produces linear responses in the trichromatic decomposition
   values versus the surrounding medium index. An index resolution of
   10(-4) is achieved by performing basic image processing on the collected
   images, without the need for a laser or a spectrometer. Spectral
   analysis enables an increase in the index resolution of the sensor to a
   value of 10(-6), with a sensitivity of 400 nm/RIU.}},

Abstract = {{Single layer coatings were prepared with poly(methyl
   methacrylate)/polystyrene nanoparticles blend by spin-coating,
   demonstrating excellent antireflection performance after selective
   removal of polystyrene particles. The thickness, refractive indices and
   surface roughness of the coatings, which significantly affect their
   optical performance, can be modulated by the coating conditions. The
   particle size can be well controlled by the operational conditions for
   the particle synthesis. The surface microscopic roughness of the coating
   strongly affects its light transmittance and the dimensionless
   parameter, roughness/wavelength ratio, dominates the deviation of the
   real transmittance from the theoretically predicted transmittance. By
   optimizing the reaction and the film preparation conditions, the
   transmittance of antireflection coatings can be up to 99.17\% in the
   visible light range. Compared with work previously reported in the
   literature, the transmittance in the visible light range can be
   significantly improved via surface roughness modification, which was
   generally a problem, especially at the short wavelength region. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Inspired by the amazing adhesion abilities of the toe pads of geckos and
   tree frogs, we report an experimental study on the integration of a
   dissipative material (resembling the dissipative and wet nature of the
   tree frog toe pads) to an elastic fibrillar interface (resembling the
   dry and fibrillar nature of the gecko foot pads). Accordingly, a new
   type of functionally graded adhesive is introduced, which is composed of
   an array of elastic micropillars at the base, a thin elastic
   intermediate layer and a viscoelastic top layer. A systematic
   investigation of this bioinspired graded adhesive structure was
   performed in comparison with three control adhesive materials: a
   viscoelastic film, a viscoelastic film coated on a soft elastomer, and
   elastic film-terminated micropillars. The results showed that this
   graded structure bestows remarkable adhesive properties in terms of
   pull-off force, work of adhesion, and structural integrity (i.e.,
   inhibited cohesive failure). Moreover, an extraordinary compliance was
   observed, which is attributed to the polymer slippage at the top layer.
   Overall, we attribute the improved adhesive properties to the synergetic
   interplay of top viscous-elastic layers with the base biomimetic
   micropillars.}},

Abstract = {{Auscultation based diagnosis of pulmonary disorders relies on the

   frequency domain and features are extracted over selected frequency bins
   containing distinct signal characteristics based on auto-regressive
   averaging, the recursively measured instantaneous kurtosis, and the
   sample entropy histograms distortion. The presented features are
   compared with existing features using a modified clustering index with
   different distance metrics. Mean classification accuracies of 97.7\% and
   98.8\% for inspiratory and expiratory segments respectively have been
   achieved using Support Vector Machine on real recordings. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Well-ordered, one-dimensional H2Ti2O5, H2Ti8O17, TiO2-B, and anatase
   TiO2/TiO2-B nanowire arrays were innovatively designed and directly
   grown on current collectors as high performance three dimensional (3D)
   anodes for binder and carbon free lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The
   prepared thin nanowires exhibited a single crystalline phase with highly
   uniform morphologies, diameters ranging from 70-80 nm, and lengths of
   around 15 mu m. Specifically, reversible Li insertion and extraction
   reactions around 1.6-1.8 V with initial intercalation capacities of 326
   and 271 mA h g(-1) at a cycling rate of 0.1 C (where 1 C = 335 mA g(-1))
   were observed for H2Ti8O17 and TiO2-B nanowire arrays, respectively.
   Among the four compounds investigated, the H2Ti8O17 nanowire electrode
   demonstrated optimal cycling stability, delivering a high specific
   discharge capacity of 157.8 mA h g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of
   100\%, even after the 500th cycle at a current rate of 1 C. Furthermore,
   the H2Ti8O17 nanowire electrode displayed superior, rate performance
   with rechargeable discharge capacities of 127.2, 111.4, 87.2, and 73.5
   mA h g(-1) at 5 C, 10 C, 20 C, and 30 C, respectively. These results
   present the potential opportunity for the development of
   high-performance LIBs based on nanostructured Ti-based anode materials

Abstract = {{A methodology to perform a ghost-cell-based immersed boundary method
   (GCIBM) is presented for simulating compressible turbulent flows around
   complex geometries. In this method, the boundary condition on the
   immersed boundary is enforced through the use of `ghost cells' that are
   located inside the solid body. The computations of variables on these
   ghost cells are achieved using linear interpolation schemes. The
   validity and applicability of the proposed method is verified using a
   three-dimensional (3D) flow over a circular cylinder, and a large-eddy
   simulation of fully developed 3D turbulent flow in a channel with a wavy
   surface. The results agree well with the previous numerical and
   experimental results, given that the grid resolution is reasonably fine.
   To demonstrate the capability of the method for higher Mach numbers,
   supersonic turbulent flow over a circular cylinder is presented. While
   more work still needs to be done to demonstrate higher robustness and
   accuracy, the present work provides interesting insights using the GCIBM
   for the compressible flows.}},

Abstract = {{Glycerol reforming was investigated under supercritical water conditions
   (450-575 degrees C, 250 bar). A feed containing 5 wt.\% of glycerol was
   continuously fed to an empty Inconel 625 reactor. The products of the
   reaction were separated into gas and liquid phases in a condenser. At a
   feed rate of 2.15 g/min, the glycerol conversion significantly increased
   from 0.05 to 0.97 when increasing operating temperature from 450 to 575
   degrees C. Although lowering the feed rate (i.e. increasing the
   residence time) could considerably improve the conversion, carbon
   formation became a problem especially at high operating temperatures
   (550 -575 degrees C). The major gaseous products were hydrogen
   (approximately 60 mol\%), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane
   with some traces of ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene. Various
   liquid products were detected including acetaldehyde, acetol, methanol,
   acetic acid, propionaldehyde, allyl alcohol, acetone, acrolein, ethanol,
   ethylene glycol, and acrylic acid but the major liquid components were
   acetaldehyde and acetol. With a feed glycerol concentration of 2.5 wt.\%
   and operating temperature of 525 degrees C, glycerol conversion of 0.91
   and H-2 yield of 2.86 can be obtained without carbon formation. Finally,
   it was demonstrated that higher H2 yield with much lower carbon
   formation was observed in supercritical water reforming (250 bar)
   compared to conventional steam reforming at 1 bar under similar
   temperatures. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

   obtained from experiments or calculations based on the Miedema,
   Born-Haber and Energetic models is also presented. An assessment of the
   effect of the Delta H-f values obtained by various methods on the
   structure stability maps was performed by plotting the enthalpy vs. the
   Mendeleev number M and the value of the chemical scale, chi. Moreover,
   based on two- and three-dimensional Pettifor plots, the enthalpy of
   hydride formation and hydrogen capacity of selected hydrides are
   presented with respect to the hydride stoichiometry, H-x, and the
   Mendeleev number M. Higher values of M indicate less hydride stability
   and, thus, larger stability variations. The metal hydrides with only one
   hydrogen atom (x = 1) and M from 0 to 21 exhibit stability that is
   adequate for practical applications. For M from 21 to 53, all hydrides
   exhibit high stability regardless of H-x For M from 53 to 102, all
   hydrides exhibit large variations in stability. Thus, the hydrides with
   x = 1-3 exhibit either high stability or stability that is adequate for
   practical applications, and those with x = 4 are highly unstable
   hydrides. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The goal of the study presented in this article was to evaluate the
   adequacy of the generation capacity of the Central Operating Area in
   Saudi Arabia. The generating capacity adequacy was evaluated to examine
   the ability of the generating capacity of the system to meet the total
   system demand. Over the last five decades, several probabilistic methods
   have been developed as a means of conducting such an evaluation. Three
   probabilistic simulation techniques were used for the evaluation of the
   designated system for this study: analytical, sequential, and
   non-sequential Monte Carlo. A variety of reliability indices, such as
   loss of load expectation and loss of energy expectation, were obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the uptake and release of the antifungal agent
   natamycin encapsulated within poly(D,L-lactide)-dextran nanoparticles
   (Dex-b-PLA NPs) from model contact lens (CL) materials. Methods: Six
   model CL materials (gel 1:poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate, pHEMA); gel
   2:85\% pHEMA: 15\% {[}Tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl]-propyl methacrylate
   (TRIS); gel 3: 75\% pHEMA: 25\% TRIS; gel 4: 85\% N,N dimethylacrylamide
   (DMAA): 15\% TRIS; gel 5:75\% DMAA: 25\% TRIS; and gel 6: DMAA) were
   prepared using a photoinitiation procedure. The gels were incubated in:
   (1) natamycin dissolved in deionized (DI) water and (2) natamycin
   encapsulated within Dex-b-PLA NPs in dimethylsulfoxide/DI water.
   Natamycin release from these materials was monitored using UV-visible
   spectrophotometry at 304nm over 7 d. Results: Natamycin uptake by all
   model CL materials increased between 1 and 7 d (p<0.001). The uptake of
   natamycin-NPs was higher than the uptake of the drug alone in DI water
   (p<0.05). Drug release was higher in materials containing DMAA than
   pHEMA (p<0.05). All gels loaded with natamycin-NPs also released more
   drug compared to gels soaked with natamycin in DI water (p<0.001). After
   1h, CL materials loaded with natamycin alone released 28-82\% of the
   total drug release. With the exception of gel 6, this burst released was
   reduced to 21-54\% for CL materials loaded with natamycin-NPs.
   Conclusions: Model CL materials loaded with natamycin-Dex-b-PLA NPs were
   able to release natamycin for up to 12h under infinite sink conditions.
   DMAA-TRIS materials may be more suitable for drug delivery of natamycin
   due to the higher drug release observed with these materials.}},

Abstract = {{Most hot forming lines use slow, energy-intensive roller hearth furnaces
   to austenitize boron steel ``blanks{''}. This paper describes an
   alternative heating technology in which blanks are austenitized by
   bringing them into contact with a hot monolith. The austenitizing
   temperature was reached in less than 30 seconds, and subsequent material
   characterization tests on oil-quenched blanks confirm that a fully
   martensitic structure is formed, and that the hardness and yield
   strength are comparable to furnace-treated samples. An Al-Si coating is
   typically used to prevent the oxidation and decarburization of the
   blanks within the furnace; preliminary tests found that the coating
   adheres to the monolith, impeding blank transfer and damaging the
   Al-Si-Fe ternary coating. Five interchangeable striking surfaces were
   assessed to see if they were less prone to adhering to the molten Al-Si
   coating.}},

Abstract = {{Lab-on-chip technology has tremendous potential for point-of-care and
   in-field medical diagnostics, but the uptake of such technologies is
   hampered by the high cost and large size of the instrumentation
   conventionally required. In the present work we demonstrate an
   instrument that fully automates sample preparation, enzymatic digestion
   and electrophoresis to implement DNA sizing and restriction fragment
   length polymorphism analysis for mutation detection. The instrument is
   largely based on a single CMOS chip, notably for fluorescence detection
   and high voltage generation, and can be operated in an off-the-shelf
   mode using low-cost pre-packaged polymeric microfluidic chips. We
   demonstrate the automated detection of the C282Y single nucleotide
   mutation in the HFE gene that underlies hereditary haemochromatosis. The
   system is currently in a portable form factor and could be implemented
   in a hand-held format. In higher volumes of manufacture, the remainder
   of the instrument could be moved to the CMOS chip, enabling a single
   chip instrument that could be housed within an inexpensive, thumb-sized
   device.}},

   three different types of bonding wires to identify their loading
   conditions under DC current. An experimental technique is also developed
   and deployed to study of the modal response of bonding wires under
   thermal loads. Experimental results show a drop in the natural frequency
   of bonding wires with increased thermal loads. The experimental
   procedures developed here and applied to thick bonding wires offer a
   template for quasi-static and modal analysis of thin bonding wires under
   thermal loads at the micro- and nano-scales.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative wire joining method is explored that utilizes femtosecond
   laser pulses directed towards the contact point of two pieces of 25-mu m
   diameter Au bonding wires typically used in microelectronic wire
   bonding. The two pieces are in the form of wire loops bonded onto four
   terminals in a crossing pattern. In-situ four-wire measurement is used
   to measure the contact resistance at the contact point of the crossed
   wires before and after femtosecond laser irradiation. A greater decrease
   in contact resistance correlates to stronger weld between the two wires.
   Laser parameters of pulse energy and pulse number are varied between 20
   to 40 mu J and 10 to 100 pulses to develop an initial process window.
   With a repetition rate of 1 kHz, the corresponding average power that
   the crossed wires received is between 20 to 40 mW. Over 90 \% of all
   crossed wires samples showed drops in contact resistance from 39.8 \% to
   83.3 \%, indicating that microwelding of gold microwires is possible
   with femtosecond laser pulses. A welding mechanism is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging area of e-textiles requires electrically conductive
   threads. We demonstrate that nylon and cotton threads can be made
   conductive by coating their surfaces with random networks of
   solution-synthesized silver nanowires. A resistance of 0.8 Omega/cm was
   achieved and can be engineered by varying the density of the nanowire
   coating. Because the nanowires are 35 nm in diameter, and the mesh
   structure does not cover the entire surface like a thin-film, less metal
   is used compared to conventional silver-coated conductive threads. The
   nanowire coating is less than 5\% of the weight of the typical silver
   thin-film coatings used in commercial conductive thread. The
   nanowire-coated thread is also more mechanically flexible, with its
   resistance increasing only 16\% after 200 bending cycles while the
   resistance of the commercial conductive thread increased by more than
   300\%.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in reducing the size of semiconductor
   devices to sub 20 nm scale for technical requirements, like low power
   consumption and high switching speed. Electronic devices based on nano
   Schottky junctions have the potential to address these issues. This is
   because nano metal-semiconductor contacts are expected to have narrower
   barriers compared to conventional Schottky diodes. Nano Schottky
   junctions have been investigated experimentally using gold (Au) coated
   AFM tips in contact with different silicon (Si) substrates. For
   nano-tips with an apex radius around 7 nm, the current-voltage (I-V)
   curves on low n-dope Si substrates have showed a reversed rectification
   diode behavior compared to the high n-dope Si samples. We have used a
   new theoretical model to study the electric field enhancement at the
   nano metal-semiconductor interface, and thus the enhancement of the
   tunneling current. We have found out that the tunneling current at the
   reverse bias is dominant on low dope substrates and very small on high
   dope substrates. This accounts for the reversed I-V rectification
   behavior on low dope Si Schottky contacts. The calculated I-V curves
   showed good agreement with the experimental results for both types of Si
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic discharge (ESD) and Electrical Overstress (EOS) are

   clamp, while the transient clamp consists of a PMOS as the main
   transistor with body bias and thyristor as a delay element. Simulation
   and measurement results show that the clamp has fast response for
   ESD-like event. Extensive stability analysis demonstrates that the clamp
   is stable against false triggering, oscillation, power supply noise and
   latch-up. Carried out measurement results also show that the clamp is
   capable of handling 1.55 A of current while its leakage is only 32.9nA,
   whereas the traditional clamp has a leakage of 1.4 7 mu A.}},

Abstract = {{Split Ring Resonators can be densely stacked to form energy harvesting
   systems arrays having per area efficiency higher than a single SRR unit
   cell. Although the concept of utilizing SRRs for electromagnetic energy
   was presented in our earlier work, the per area efficiency of an SRR
   array as compared to that of existing collectors (classical antennas) is
   fundamental to the viability of this technology. Here, we present a
   numerical comparative study where an array of SRRs is compared to an
   array of patch antennas both placed in an identical footprint. The
   results indicate that using SRR arrays can provide significant
   improvement in terms of power efficiency and collection bandwidth in
   comparison to microstrip antennas commonly used in electromagnetic
   energy harvesting systems.}},

Abstract = {{A smart microwave sensor for non-destructive thickness measurement of
   paint and dielectric coating of metallic plates is presented. The sensor
   is based on low cost microstrip transmission line with a Complementary
   Split-Ring Resonator (CSRR) in the ground plan. The CSRR sensor
   experiences a frequency shift proportional to the thickness of a
   dielectric layer backed with metallic plate as described. Ideally, one
   would like the frequency shift to be related directly to a thickness
   reading (usually in mm or um). An artificial intelligent regression
   model was developed to automate the post processing of the measurements
   and achieve actual thickness data. This work presents simulation,
   measurements, and data post-processing of CSRR sensor operating on
   metallic plate with different coating thicknesses. The post-processing
   was performed using Support Victor Regression (SVR) algorithm on the

Abstract = {{Realistic driver models can play an important role in developing new
   driver assistance technologies. A realistic driver model can reduce the
   time-consuming trial and error process of designing and testing
   products, and thereby reduce the vehicle's development time and cost. A
   realistic model should provide both driver path planning and arm motions
   that are physiologically possible. The interaction between a driver's
   hand and steering wheel can influence control performance and steering
   feel.
   The aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive yet practical model
   of the driver and vehicle. Consequently, a neuromuscular driver model in
   conjunction with a high-fidelity vehicle model is developed to learn and
   understand more about the driver's performance and preferences, and
   their effect on vehicle control and stability. This driver model can
   provide insights into task performance and energy consumption of the
   driver, including fatigue and co-contraction dynamics of a steering
   task. In addition, this driver model in conjunction with a high-fidelity
   steering model can be used to develop new steering technologies such as
   Electric Power Steering.}},

Abstract = {{A novel nonlinear planetary rover wheel/soil interaction model based on
   the properties of the penetration volume is proposed. This approach
   allows for fast multibody dynamic simulation of planetary rover
   operations by providing a closed-form solution for the contact forces.
   For the derivation of this contact model, the normal stress distribution
   under the planetary rover wheel is assumed to be a nonlinear function of
   the soil compression. The soil foundation with which the wheels of a
   robotic vehicle may interfere is represented by a continuum of
   hyperelastic springs. A linear version of this representation of the
   contact interface as a mattress of springs has been derived previously
   {[}1] and validated for the simulation of the interaction between two
   relatively inflexible objects {[}2]. However, for contacts involving
   large deformations, the nonlinear material properties have to be
   considered. In this paper, a brief summary of the elastic foundation
   model is given and the extension of the model to a hyperelastic
   foundation is provided so that it can be used for the intended purpose
   of modelling rover wheels in contact with soft terrain. A solution for
   the integral of the normal stress distribution of the rover wheels is
   proposed and verified in a number of numerical experiments by comparing
   the results against Bekker's analytical approach. Although the focus of
   this work is on wheel/soil interaction, the general form of the
   volumetric contact modelling approach can be applied to any hyperelastic
   contact problem.}},

   phalanges collectively as the second rigid body The model has four
   degrees of freedom: ankle x, y, hind-foot orientation, and metatarsal

   joints. Three different types of contact elements are targeted:
   Kelvin-Voigt, linear volumetric, and nonlinear volumetric. The models
   are kinematically driven at the ankle and the metatarsal joints, and
   simulated horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces as well as

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new encryption scheme for OFDM systems. The
   reason for physical layer approach is that it has the least impact on
   the system and is the fastest among all layers. This scheme is
   computationally secure against the adversary. It requires less key
   streams compared with other approaches. The idea comes from the
   importance of orthogonality in OFDM symbols. Destroying the
   orthogonality create intercarrier interferences. This in turn cause
   higher bit and symbol decoding error rate. The encryption is performed
   on the time domain OFDM symbols, which is equivalent to performing
   nonlinear masking in the frequency domain. Various attacks are explored
   in this paper. These include known plaintext and ciphertext attack,
   frequency domain attack, time domain attack, statistical attack and
   random guessing attack. We show our scheme is resistant against these
   attacks. Finally, simulations are conducted to compare the new scheme
   with the conventional cipher encryption.}},

Abstract = {{A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging technology which has a
   great potential in realizing a variety of new applications. This paper
   presents a new packet routing scheme which allows a vehicle to discover
   the existence of a gateway to the Internet and to send/receive packets
   to/from the gateway via multihop communications. The proposed routing
   scheme is based on a multichannel medium access control protocol, known
   as VeMAC {[}1], {[}2], using time division multiple access. The
   performance of this cross-layer design is evaluated for a multichannel
   VANET in terms of the end-to-end packet delay and the percentage of
   occupied time slots per frame in a highway scenario. Both packet
   queueing and service delays are considered in the end-to-end delay
   calculation by modeling each relay vehicle as a queueing system, in
   which the packets are served in batches of no more than a specified

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study distributed generation (DG) integration in smart
   grid, with a focus on the voltage regulation in smart distribution
   systems. To ensure the operation of a smart distribution system at an
   acceptable voltage level, voltage regulators are deployed at some
   strategic locations for voltage control. The two-way communication
   functionality of the smart distribution system is leveraged such that
   the voltage regulators are coordinated by a distribution substation.
   Based on the measurement reports from remote terminal units (RTUs)
   deployed at DG unit and load connection points, stochastic information
   management is performed by the distribution substation to address the
   randomness in renewable power generation and load demand. In this paper,
   we formulate a voltage regulation problem in the smart distribution
   system based on power flow analysis, while taking into account
   communication delays. We show that the problem can be represented as a
   partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). Since voltage
   regulation is performed at a relatively low frequency to avoid excessive
   wear and tear on the voltage regulators, a large amount of measurements
   should be reported by the RTUs and processed by the distribution
   substation for optimal voltage regulation. In order to reduce the
   communication and computational overhead, we further investigate the
   voltage regulation problem and mathematically prove that a relatively
   small amount of information is sufficient for the distribution
   substation to make an optimal decision. The theoretical results are
   evaluated based on a case study of IEEE 13-bus test system with real DG
   power generation and demand data.}},

Abstract = {{For the multibody simulation of planetary rover operations, a wheel-soil
   contact model is necessary to represent the forces and moments between
   the tire and the soft soil. A novel nonlinear contact modelling approach
   based on the properties of the hypervolume of interpenetration is
   validated in this paper. This normal contact force model is based on the
   Winkler foundation model with nonlinear spring properties. To fully
   define the proposed normal contact force model for this application,
   seven parameters are required. Besides the geometry parameters that can
   be easily measured, three soil parameters representing the hyperelastic
   and plastic properties of the soil have to be identified. Since it is
   very difficult to directly measure the latter set of soil parameters,
   they are identified by comparing computer simulations with experimental
   results of drawbar pull tests performed under different slip conditions
   on the Juno rover of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). A multibody
   dynamics model of the Juno rover including the new wheel/soil
   interaction model was developed and simulated in MapleSim. To identify
   the wheel/soil contact model parameters, the cost function of the model
   residuals of the kinematic data is minimized. The volumetric contact
   model is then tested by using the identified contact model parameters in
   a forward dynamics simulation of the rover on an irregular 3-dimensional
   terrain and compared against experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) development seems to be essential
   for a sustainable transportation system along with electric vehicles. An
   appropriate power management strategy for a PHEV determines how to blend
   the engine and the battery power in such a way that leads to significant
   fuel economy improvement and environmental footprint reduction. To
   evaluate and validate the controls design, software and
   hardware-in-the-loop (SIL/HIL) simulations are useful approaches,
   especially at the early stages of controls design. To conduct SIL/HIL
   tests, an accurate and relatively fast mathematical model of the real
   powertrain is required which solely contains the essential dynamics of
   the plant. In this paper, a physics-based model of a power-split plug-in
   powertrain is developed and implemented using MapleSim software. This
   model contains a chemistry-based lithium-ion battery pack, which can
   distinguish it from other models used in the literature, since the
   performance of a PHEV greatly depends on its battery. The symbolic
   computation power of MapleSimn makes the model very suitable for
   real-time SIL/HIL tests.}},

Abstract = {{Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising CO2 mitigation technology that will
   allow the continued utilisation of abundant coal reserves in the power
   sector in a carbon-constrained world. The CO2 capture and purification
   unit (CO2CPU) is an important unit that determines the CO2 product
   quality and energy consumption of the oxy-fired power plants. Several
   studies have been published on this unit but information on the dynamic
   behaviour of the CO2CPU is limited. This study developed a dynamic model
   of the pilot-scale CanmetENERGY's CO2CPU (CanCO(2)). Dynamic modelling
   of the CO2CPU is challenging due to the highly-integrated flow sheet
   structure and the occurrence of two phase flow heat transfer in heat
   exchangers. This study takes into account the property variation in the
   two phase region while calculating the heat transfer coefficients in
   heat exchanger models. Detailed mathematical models are provided and
   transient analyses were performed to gain insight into the dynamic
   behaviour of the CO2CPU. Dynamic data obtained from the transient
   analysis was used to design a suitable control scheme for this process
   and study the dynamic operability of this process in closed-loop. A
   decentralized multi-loop control scheme for the CO2CPU is proposed based
   on the Relative Gain Array (RGA) method. The performance of the proposed
   control structure was evaluated for both disturbance rejection and set
   point tracking scenarios. Stable closed loop responses were obtained.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mechanistic dynamic model of an industrial-scale
   carbon dioxide (CO2) capture plant using Monoethanolamine (MEA) as an
   absorbent. In order to remove 87\% of CO2 from the flue gas stream
   generated from a 750 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant and produce
   a CO2 concentration of 95\% in the CO2 product stream, a post-combustion
   CO2 capture plant with three absorbers and two strippers are needed,. A
   decentralized control structure composed of 11 proportional-integral
   (PI) controllers was proposed to maintain the dynamic operability of
   this commercial-scale CO2 capture plant. The evaluation of the plant's
   performance in closed-loop were conducted using multiple scenarios,
   i.e., the loss of CO2 recovery (\% CC) control loop during variation of
   flue gas flow rate, a positive ramp change in the flue gas flow rate
   under a maximum withdrawal constraint on the reboilers' heat duty, and
   the disturbance in the flue gas composition resulting from the variation
   in coal composition and air flow rate. The controllability analysis
   performed on the proposed industrial-scale MEA absorption plant using
   the control system designed in this study shows that the plant is able
   to recover fast from most of the disturbances considered in the
   analysis. The insight provided from the present study can then be used
   to address the integration of the present CO2 capture plant to a
   coal-based power plant and evaluate the dynamic feasibility of this
   integration under various scenarios. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the effect of process uncertainty on the
   optimal design of a CO2 capture plant. A recent method in the optimal
   design of large-scale chemical processes under uncertainty, which
   employs Power Series Expansion (PSE) models to approximate the process
   constraints, has been used in this work due to its computational
   benefits. Uncertainty in the CO2 content in the flue gas stream entering
   the plant is assumed; the problem under analysis aims to find the most
   economically feasible design, by sizing the plant's process equipment,
   as well as obtaining its optimal operating conditions, in the presence
   of uncertainty. The results show that process uncertainty have a direct
   effect on the sizes of the absorber and stripper columns and operation
   of the reboiler duty, whereas the cross heat exchanger and condenser's
   heat transfer areas are not significantly affected. (C) 2014 The

   electrical length that is used as a reference where the second
   electrical length CPW has different electrical length. The second

Abstract = {{A simple approach is proposed to employ symmetric yield functions for
   modeling the tension-compression asymmetry commonly observed in hcp
   materials. In this work, the strength differential (SD) effect is
   modeled by choosing separate symmetric plane stress Barlat Yld 2000
   yield functions for the tension i.e., in the first quadrant of principal
   stress space, and compression i.e., third quadrant of principal stress
   space. In the second and fourth quadrants, the yield locus is
   constructed by adopting Baler interpolating functions between uniaxial
   tensile and compressive stress states. The main advantage of this
   proposed approach is that the yield locus parameters are deterministic
   and relatively easy to identify when compared to the
   Cazacu-Plunkett-Barlat (CPB) family of yield functions commonly used for
   modeling the SD effect observed in hcp materials. The proposed yield
   function is implemented as a user material subroutine (UMAT) within the
   commercial finite element software, LS-DYNA. The predictions of the
   developed material model are compared with the measured
   load-displacement and strain distributions from a three-point bend
   experiment on AZ31B sheet.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse representation of signals and images using an over-complete basis
   function (dictionary) has attracted a lot of attention in the literature
   recently. Atoms of a dictionary are either chosen from a predefined set
   of functions (e.g. Sine, Cosine or Wavelets), or learned from a training
   set (KSVD). Recently, a nonlinear (NL) dictionary has been proposed by
   adding NL functions, such as polynomials, rational, logarithmic,
   exponential, and phase shifted and higher order cosine functions to the
   conventional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) atoms. In this paper, we
   present a comprehensive performance comparison of various NL functions
   that are added to the DCT dictionary. The NL dictionary is also compared
   with the other known dictionaries such as DCT, Haar and KSVD-based
   learned dictionary for sparse image reconstruction. In the second part,
   the NL dictionary is exploited for sparsity based image denoising.
   Retinal images are used for the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Off-Grid small wind turbines provide a very attractive renewable energy

Abstract = {{In this study, the power scheduling problem in mu grids is investigated
   taking the uncertainties in power demand and wind power into account.
   The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear
   optimization problem with the objective being minimizing the total
   mu-grid cost. The objective is subject to a set of operational
   constraints imposed on the generating units and the system itself. A
   two-stage stochastic programming method has been applied to find the
   optimal power generation schedule for a mu-grid. The developed approach
   was implemented in a General Algebraic Modeling System platform (GAMS).
   The developed method was tested on a mu-grid consisting of eight
   dispatchable units and a wind turbine. To demonstrate the necessity of
   uncertainty modeling, the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) and the
   expected value of perfect information (EVPI) were used to compare the
   stochastic power schedule obtained with the deterministic one.}},

   clustering algorithms. The main idea behind our cooperative approach was
   inherited from machine learning, as applied to document clustering, but
   has been modified for use in software clustering. The conceptual
   modifications include working with differing numbers of clusters
   produced by the input algorithms and using graph structures rather than
   feature vectors. The empirical modifications include experiments for
   selecting the optimal cluster merging criteria. Case studies using open
   source software systems show that forging cooperation between leading
   state-of-the-art algorithms produces better results than any one
   state-of-the-art algorithm considered.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications of medical image processing require co-aligning a set
   of sample images, followed by their subsequent averaging. In the cases
   when one of the data images can be designated as a reference, the
   problem of image co-alignment is trivially reduced to a number of
   separate image registration problems. Unfortunately, situations exist
   when all the data images are known to have been corrupted by arbitrary
   and generally unknown deformations, in which case registering the
   remaining images to any given one could produce undesirable
   post-registration errors. In this note, we propose a new solution to the
   problem of image co-alignment (aka image co-registration) aiming to
   minimize the cumulative distortion. The proposed method relies on a
   formal optimization framework, which allows one to incorporate arbitrary
   a priori information on the averaged image. Moreover, we also introduce
   a particularly efficient numerical scheme based on alternating direction
   method of multipliers. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
   demonstrated in a series of both in silico and in vivo experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The continued demand for higher performance in modern microprocessors
   places strict timing constraints on the high performance modules such as
   dynamic circuits and register files. In addition, the increased process
   variations in scaled technologies results in delay variations around its
   nominal value. This delay variability results in violating the timing
   constraints, and correspondingly, causes a timing yield loss. In our
   previous work, new negative capacitance circuits are connected to the
   highly capacitive nodes to reduce the overall parasitic capacitance at
   these nodes. This capacitance reduction reduces the circuit mean delay
   which results in timing yield improvement, which is verified by using
   post-layout simulations. In this paper, test chip measurements are
   provided showing that the adoption of the negative capacitance circuit
   to a 64-input wide dynamic OR gate is capable of improving the timing
   yield to 100\%.}},

   monocular image sequence captured by a calibrated camera is the only
   input to the system, and robust and accurate frame-to-frame camera poses
   and a 3D map of the environment can be estimated automatically by the
   approach. The pose estimation method takes advantage of the epipolar
   geometry in structure from motion (SfM) to recover the rotation matrix
   and translation term of the camera, and one 3D reference point is used
   to recover the camera's translation distance. Then, a random sampling
   consensus (RANSAC) framework is employed to find the robust rotation
   matrix and translation vector, and a nonlinear optimization algorithm is
   applied to optimize the estimated rotation matrix and translation vector
   by minimizing the projection errors. Finally, a local bundle adjustment
   algorithm is performed to optimize the results. Extensive experimental

Abstract = {{With the growth of complexity in the embedded domain, the use of
   distributed systems to support multiple real-time applications has
   become commonplace. These applications may share processor and network
   resources, and real-time scheduling policies can guarantee that these
   applications do not interfere with each other's ability to meet their
   temporal constraints. We believe that these applications should also be
   able to transparently share services and chains of services, without the
   coupling that such sharing typically implies. To solve this problem, we
   propose D-RES, a resource management system that guarantees temporal
   isolation between service-sharing applications in a distributed system.
   D-RES transparently tracks which application uses which service, billing
   the correct application even in case of nested service calls. We
   implemented D-RES, and demonstrate its ability to isolate
   service-sharing applications even in case of overload.}},

   of a well-established and subject-validated image quality assessment
   (IQA) model, without which fair comparisons and further improvement are
   difficult. Recently, a tone mapped image quality index (TMQI) was
   proposed, which has shown to have good correlation with subjective
   evaluations of tone mapped images. Here we propose a substantially
   different approach to design TMO, where instead of using any pre-defined
   systematic computational structure (such as image transformation or
   contrast/edge enhancement) for tone mapping, we navigate in the space of
   all images, searching for the image that optimizes TMQI. The navigation
   involves an iterative process that alternately improves the structural
   fidelity and statistical naturalness of the resulting image, which are
   the two fundamental building blocks in TMQI. Experiments demonstrate the
   superior performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Objective quality assessment of distorted stereoscopic images is a
   challenging problem. Existing studies suggest that simply averaging the
   quality of the left-and right-views well predicts the quality of
   symmetrically distorted stereoscopic images, but generates substantial
   prediction bias when applied to asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic
   images. In this study, we first carry out a subjective test, where we
   find that the prediction bias could lean towards opposite directions,
   largely depending on the distortion types. We then develop an
   information-content and divisive normalization based pooling scheme that
   improves upon SSIM in estimating the quality of single view images.
   Finally, we propose a binocular rivalry inspired model to predict the
   quality of stereoscopic images based on that of the single view images.
   Our results show that the proposed model, without explicitly identifying
   image distortion types, successfully eliminates the prediction bias,
   leading to significantly improved quality prediction of stereoscopic
   images.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of runtime verification is to inspect the correctness of a
   system by incorporating a monitor during its execution. Predictability
   of time distribution of monitor invocations and memory usage are two
   indicators of the quality of a monitoring solution, specially in
   cyber-physical systems, where the physical environment is a part of the
   system dynamics. In our previous work, we proposed a control-theoretic
   approach for coordinating time predictability and memory utilization in
   runtime verification of time-sensitive systems. To this end, we designed
   controllers that attempt to improve time predictability, while ensuring
   the soundness of verification by incorporating a maximally utilized
   bounded memory buffer that accumulates events.
   Since the frequency of occurrence of environment actions in
   cyber-physical systems is not known a priori, the system may run into
   situations, where the buffer is full, but a monitor invocation has not
   yet been scheduled. In control theory, this is called the overshooting
   phenomenon, which inherently decreases time predictability. In this
   paper, we address the issue of overshoots, by employing a second
   controller that allows limited memory reservations to temporarily extend
   the size of the event buffer when the system is subject to bursts of
   environment actions. We apply our solution to the verification of the
   air/fuel ratio in a car engine exhaust. The acceptable ratio varies
   depending on the driving circumstances, and monitoring that ratio is
   important to control emissions in a vehicle. A highly predictable
   monitor imposes uniform load on the engine control unit (ECU), thus, not
   negatively or sporadically affecting its control tasks. The experimental
   results exhibit two significant contributions: we (1) demonstrate the
   advantages of applying our approach to achieve low variation in the
   frequency of monitor invocations for verification, while maintaining
   maximum memory utilization, and (2) clearly illustrate that by
   negligible temporary increases in the size of the event buffer, the
   number of overshoots decreases significantly, which in turn
   substantially increases time predictability of runtime verification.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid finite-element-volume FEV method is extended to simulate
   turbulent non-premixed propane air preheated flame in a minichannel. We
   use a detailed kinetics scheme, i.e. GRI mechanism 3.0, and the flamelet
   model to perform the combustion modeling. The turbulence-chemistry
   interaction is taken into account in this flamelet modeling using
   presumed shape probability density functions PDFs. Considering an
   upwind-biased physics for the current reacting flow, we implement the
   physical influence upwinding scheme PIS to estimate the cell-face
   mixture fraction variance in this study. To close the turbulence
   closure, we employ the two-equation standard K-epsilon turbulence model
   incorporated with suitable wall functions. Supposing an optically thin
   limit, it needs to take into account radiation effects of the most
   important radiating species in the current modeling. Despite facing with
   so many flame instabilities in such small size configuration, the
   current method performs suitably with proper convergence, and the
   encountered instabilities are damped out automatically. Comparing with
   the experimental measurements, the current extended method accurately
   predicts the flame structure in the minichannel configuration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the frost formation and growth at the walls of a
   duct with uniform wall temperature variation. The simulation is
   performed for laminar flow regime considering suitable semi-empirical
   models incorporated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The
   frost growth is considered to be normal to the duct surface. Since the
   duct aspect ratio is high, we perform our simulations in two-dimensional
   zones. To simulate the frost layer properly, we solve both the energy
   and mass balance equations implementing some semi-empirical correlations
   on the frost side. At this stage, we suitably predict the required heat
   flux value at the solid boundary and the heat transfer coefficient,
   which are required to be used in the CFD calculations in the next stage.
   So, next is to use the CFD tool to calculate the required heat transfer
   parameters at the air side. Since the frost growth is performed locally
   along the wall, the achieved frost growth rate can be applied at any
   specific location independently. We also investigate the effects of
   various environmental parameters on the frost growth rate. The current
   achieved results are verified by comparing them with previous available
   experimental data. After verification the numerical algorithm, we
   investigate the frost growth in a duct with uniform wall temperature
   variation. We assume that the variation of temperature would be
   gradually and uniform with time. We eventually present the effects of
   different parameters affecting the frost growth along the duct surface.
   One significant contribution of this work is to address the effects of
   inlet boundary location on the frost growth. In this regard, the inlet
   boundary is placed initially at real entrance and then at a location far
   upstream of the real entrance. We evaluate the effect of this boundary
   location on frost thickness. The use of CFD is unavoidable in this study
   because we need its capability to compute the required wall heat flux
   condition, which is an input to our semi-empirical analysis in this
   problem with an unsteady thermal boundary condition situation, in which
   the wall temperature continuously varies with time. It should be noted
   that, our chosen empirical method estimate the wall heat flux based on
   the Nusselt number value. Therefore, CFD largely helps to correct the
   actual heat flux at the airside. Another contribution of this work is to
   study frost formation in confined flow cases, in which the flow is
   developing both hydrodynamically and thermally. Evidently this is in
   contrast to the frost growth over a simple flat plate like geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed mechanical properties can be obtained in ultra high strength
   steel parts formed via hot forming die quenching (HFDQ) by controlling

   HFDQ experiments with variable cooling rates were conducted by quenching
   Usibor (R) 1500P boron steel blanks between dies pre-heated up to 600
   degrees C. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the blank / die
   interface, which is used to determine the blank cooling rate, was
   evaluated via inverse heat conduction analysis. The HTC was found to
   increase with die temperature and stamping pressure. This heat transfer
   coefficient increase was attributed to macroscopic flattening of the
   boron steel blank as well as microscopic deformation of surface
   roughness peaks. At the end of the hot stamping process, the HTC reached

   noting the important effects of the medium characteristics for different
   organs and tissue. We propose a least-squares based adaptive algorithm
   with forgetting factor to estimate the 3-D location of an implant in the
   human body. After discussing convergence properties of the proposed
   localization algorithm, we perform simulations to analyze the transient
   characteristics of the proposed algorithm. Different white Gaussian
   noises are added to emulate the TOF measurement noises and environmental
   disturbances, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm is robust
   to such noises/disturbances. The algorithm is successful in keeping the

   corneal epithelial cell behavior.
   In the present study, polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with different elastic
   moduli have been prepared and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs)
   have been cultured on them. To investigate the effect that changes in
   elastic modulus may have on adhesion and migration of corneal epithelial
   cells, actin filament organization and expression of adhesion molecules
   were characterized. It was found that HCECs actin filament organization
   improves with increasing substrate stiffness and integrin alpha(3)

Abstract = {{The Chandler loop is an artificial circulatory platform for in vitro
   hemodynamic experiments. In most experiments, the working fluid is
   subjected to a stress field via rotation of the Chandler loop, which, in
   turn, induces biochemical responses of the suspended cells. For very low
   rotation rates, the stress field can be approximated using laminar flow
   in a straight tube as a model. However, as the rotation rate increases,
   while still maintaining laminar flow, the effect of the tube curvature
   causes the stress field to deviate considerably from the straight tube
   approximation. In this manuscript, we investigate the flow and
   associated strain rate field of an incompressible Newtonian fluid in a
   Chandler loop as a function of the governing non-dimensional fluid
   dynamic parameters. We find that the Dean number, which is proportional
   to the rotation rate, is the dominant parameter in determining the fluid
   strain rate. We propose an empirical formula for predicting the average
   fluid strain rate magnitude in the working fluid that is valid over a
   wide parameter space to be used in lieu of the common, yet restrictive,
   straight tube-based prediction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the implementation of an innovative
   interactive learning tool in teaching a Mechatronics Engineering course
   at the University of Waterloo. The course deals with digital logic, PLC
   programing, and assembly language. The interactive tool, developed at
   Top Hat Monocle Inc., was used in teaching the assembly language part of
   the course. The interactive tool has two components: students'
   electronic devices and a front-end website in which the instructor has
   control to launch demonstrations and quizzes and receive students'
   responses. Students are connected through WiFi connection or their smart
   phones. In this study, students' performance was evaluated using the
   final exam scores and the surveys. The exam results showed about 23\%
   improvement. According to the results of the survey administered at the
   end of the term, students who participated on the interactive simulation
   and quizzes agreed that it helped the concepts ``stick in their memory
   better{''}.}},

Abstract = {{It is critical for the construction industry to ensure that new building
   designs and materials, including wall and floor assemblies (e.g., a
   studded wall with insulation and drywall) provide an acceptable level of
   fire safety. A key fire safety requirement that is specified in building
   codes is the minimum fire resistance rating, which is a measure of the
   ability of an assembly to limit fire spread within a building. A
   manufacturer of building materials (e.g., insulation or drywall) is
   required to perform full-scale fire resistance furnace tests to
   determine the fire resistance ratings of assemblies that use their
   products. Fire resistance test facilities are very limited and these
   tests are very expensive to perform. Therefore, it can be difficult to
   properly assess the impact of changes to individual components on the
   overall fire performance of an assembly during the design process.
   As part of a project to develop methods of using small-scale fire test
   data to predict full-scale fire resistance test results, the heat
   transfer through scale models of common wall assembly designs was
   measured during cone calorimeter tests using an incident heat flux of 75
   kW/m(2). Wall assemblies consisting of single and double layers of 12.7
   mm (1/2 in.) regular and lightweight gypsum board, and 15.9 mm (5/8 in.)
   type X gypsum board, along with mineral wool insulation and wood studs
   were tested. Temperature measurements made at various points within
   these assemblies are presented in this paper, and are discussed using
   results from thermal gravimetric analysis tests of the three types of
   gypsum board. Implications of this research to the development of heat
   transfer models and scaling relationships are also briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing the causal interplay among a number of dynamic systems is a
   problem encountered in many applications across various disciplines.
   Given a family of time series, the objective is to determine whether one
   process is influenced by the others. Interdependence relations among
   wide-sense-stationary (WSS) sequences can be formally analyzed using
   Granger-causality as a tool. However, many processes encountered in
   practice are non-stationary and are described by parameters that change
   periodically with time. In this paper, it is shown that useful
   information on the Granger-causality between two cyclostationary (CS)
   time series can be obtained simply by treating the processes as WSS,
   without a consideration of the periodic nature of the parameters or the
   exact knowledge of the period of cyclostationarity. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate the use of time-invariant multivariate autoregressive (MVAR)
   estimators and Wiener filters in detecting Granger-causality among a
   number of CS time series.}},

Abstract = {{Inferring causal relations in a family of time series from a finite set

   represented as a connected graph, where nodes indicate the individual

   Interdependence relations can be detected through the fitting of
   multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models. However, because of
   inadequacy of data, this may lead to a representation that is difficult
   for both interpretation and prediction. In this paper, we propose a new
   technique that uses a frequency domain Lasso approach to detect causal
   connections. This method keeps the resulting graph sparse by preserving
   only the most significant edges, and is demonstrated to be a better
   alternative for long memory processes, compared to the group Lasso

Abstract = {{A comparative study using different cavitation models in mixture and
   Eulerian framework is carried out for the analysis of two-phase flows in
   diesel injectors. Three different cavitation models are investigated
   here: recently developed modified single-fluid, Schnerr-Sauer and
   Zwart-Gerber-Belamri models. The last two models have been implemented
   in both mixture and Eulerian framework. The numerical predictions are
   compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental results
   available in the literature. Qualitative assessments have been carried
   out with experimental images of two-phase flow in an optically
   accessible nozzle. Quantitative comparisons have been done with measured
   mass flow rates and velocity profiles. It appears that at low pressure
   differentials there can be considerable discrepancy in the predictions
   of the vapour distribution from the three models considered. The
   modified single-fluid approach turns out to be comparatively better with
   respect to the other two models. Implementation in mixture and Eulerian
   framework yields noticeable differences in the results because of the
   relative velocity of the two phases. Numerical experiments have been
   carried out with different two-phase turbulence modelling approaches,
   pressure-velocity coupling algorithms, gradient calculation methods and
   under-relaxation factors to assess the robustness of the models.
   Additionally comparisons have been carried out for conditions under high
   inlet pressure in an axisymmetric nozzle to understand the performance
   of the models under realistic operating conditions.}},

   of attack is equal to the static angle of maximum lift to drag ratio.
   Smoke wire flow visualization compares the wakes of static and dynamic
   cases for Re < 105 and shows the strong dependency of the wake structure
   on the Reynolds number. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measures the
   unsteady wake characteristics of the flow for Re = 10(5) and shows that
   increasing the amplitude of oscillation increases the boundary layer
   thickness. For all cases, a numerical simulation with the Transition SST
   method has been employed as an alternative method and shows good
   agreement with the experimental results. Finally, the unsteady loading
   will cause varying rotor loads.}},

Abstract = {{Although most smartphones today have both cellular data and WiFi
   capacity, network-selection techniques typically only allow for a single
   data interface to be used at a time. This leads to several problems
   including the interruption of existing connections when switching
   interfaces, complete loss of connectivity when the selected network is
   not functioning correctly, and significantly less bandwidth to the
   device than is possible if the available wireless capacity is
   aggregated. While interface bonding is not new, aggregating two such
   diverse networks is particularly challenging given that different
   wireless technologies, and even different networks of the same type,
   offer inconsistent link parameters, presenting dynamically fluctuating
   bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.
   In this paper we present a simple, but extremely efficient, hashing
   technique for multi-interface packet scheduling. We have implemented our
   system with aggregation proxies running in well-connected data centers
   and client code running on a Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.1. Our
   experimental results show that our prototype never loses connectivity
   even when networks fail as long as at least one network is functioning,
   does not break connections as interface selection is adjusted, and can
   increase bandwidth to the smartphone to the available aggregated network
   capacities. Transmission time is reduced by up to 60\% vs. using a
   single network interface.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) can be categorized into
   Type-I and Type-II OBL methodologies. The Type-I OBL is based on the
   opposite points in the variable space while the Type-II OBL considers
   the opposite of function value on the landscape. In the past few years,
   many research works have been conducted on development of Type-I
   OBL-based approaches with application in science and engineering, such
   as opposition-based differential evolution (ODE). However, compared to
   Type-I OBL, which cannot address a real sense of opposition in term of
   objective value, the Type-II OBL is capable to discover more meaningful
   knowledge about problem's landscape. Due to natural difficulty of
   proposing a Type-II-based approach, very limited research has been
   reported in that direction. In this paper, for the first time, the
   concept of Type-II OBL has been investigated in detail in optimization;
   also it is applied on the DE algorithm as a case study. The proposed
   algorithm is called opposition-based differential evolution Type-II
   (ODE-II) algorithm; it is validated on the testbed proposed for the IEEE
   Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2013 (IEEE CEC-2013) contest with
   28 benchmark functions. Simulation results on the benchmark functions
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as the first step
   for further developments in Type-II OBL-based schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The capabilities of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in solving nonlinear
   and non-convex optimization problems are significant. Among the many
   types of methods, differential evolution (DE) is an effective
   population-based stochastic algorithm, which has emerged as very
   competitive. Since its inception in 1995, many variants of DE to improve
   the performance of its predecessor have been introduced. In this
   context, opposition-based differential evolution (ODE) established a
   novel concept in which, each individual must compete with its opposite
   in terms of the fitness value in order to make an entry in the next
   generation. The generation of opposite points is based on the
   population's current extreme points (i.e., maximum and minimum) in the
   search space; these extreme points are not proper representatives for
   whole population, compared to centroid point which is inclusive
   regarding all individuals in the population. This paper develops a new
   scheme that utilizes the centroid point of a population to calculate
   opposite individuals. Therefore, the classical scheme of an opposite
   point is modified accordingly. Incorporating this new scheme into ODE
   leads to an enhanced ODE that is identified as centroid opposition-based
   differential evolution (CODE). The performance of the CODE algorithm is
   comprehensively evaluated on well-known complex benchmark functions and
   compared with the performance of conventional DE, ODE, and some other
   state-of-the-art algorithms (such as SaDE, ADE, SDE, and jDE) in terms
   of solution accuracy. The results for CODE are promising.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main disadvantages of population-based evolutionary
   algorithms (EAs) is their high computational cost due to the nature of
   evaluation, specially when the population size is large. The
   micro-algorithms employ a very small number of individuals, which can
   accelerate the convergence speed of algorithms dramatically, while it
   highly increases the stagnation risk. One approach to overcome the
   stagnation problem can be increasing the diversity of the population. To
   do so, a micro-differential evolution with vectorized random mutation
   factor (MDEVM) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the
   small size population benefit while preventing stagnation through
   diversification of the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on
   the 28 benchmark functions provided at the IEEE congress on evolutionary
   computation 2013 (CEC-2013). Simulation results on the benchmark
   functions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the
   convergence speed of its parent algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The municipal solid waste collected from Chatham-Kent is currently
   disposed to the Ridge Landfill in Blenheim, Ontario. Although the
   municipality implements recycling, the program does not include separate
   collection and processing of organic food waste. This paper presents an
   economic evaluation of composting alternatives for the organic food
   waste collected from households in Chatham-Kent. A cost-benefit analysis
   was performed for three scenarios: (i) continuing the current system of
   landfill disposal, (ii) backyard composting in detached dwellings, and
   (iii) centralized collection and off-site composting in London, Ontario.
   Results indicate that backyard composting is an economically feasible
   alternative to landfill disposal. The cost of backyard composting is
   comparable to landfill disposal (2\% lower at a 25\% participation rate
   and 8\% lower at full uptake), suggesting that long-term benefits offset
   the initial investments on backyard composters. Centralized composting
   is twice more expensive than landfill disposal at all uptake rates.
   Despite the lower initial cost of the collection bins compared to
   backyard composters, the cost of waste collection and transport is
   significantly higher for centralized composting. In terms of waste
   diversion at full uptake, the centralized collection of source-separated
   organics results in a 6\% increase in overall diversion rates compared
   to a 5\% increase for backyard composting. Further, landfill life is
   extended by 16 years for the centralized composting and by 12 years for
   backyard composting. The analytical method employed in this study can be
   applied to other regions exploring similar decision options on
   composting. The decision criteria presented in this paper can be
   expanded and modified to accommodate regional variability such as access
   to facilities, materials costs, and social acceptability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the existing construction waste management program
   in the Region of Waterloo to identify strategies for increasing waste
   diversion rates. The construction industry is a major economic driver in
   the Province of Ontario but it is also one of the largest contributors
   to landfill usage. The industry generates a large amount of solid waste,
   of which only a small fraction is recycled. The diversion rate for
   construction waste is currently at 16\%, which is significantly below
   the 60\% target specified in the 2004 Ontario Waste Diversion Goals. In
   this study, diversion options are identified for six waste streams:
   wood, concrete, steel, drywall, asphalt, and shingles. An economic
   evaluation of the cost of recycling these materials was also performed.
   Research findings indicate that there is poor monitoring of construction
   waste management in the region. Recycling costs can be minimized by
   increasing diversion rates for four waste streams (concrete, steel,
   drywall, and asphalt) rather than by imposing 60\% diversion across all
   streams. However, even with optimized diversion, there is little
   incentive for the construction industry to recycle - the minimum cost of
   60\% diversion is 15\% more costly than landfilling options. An
   assessment of the landfill disposal fee structure is recommended to
   identify strategies for incentivising waste diversion; for example,
   imposing higher landfill fees may encourage higher waste diversion
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Region of Waterloo implements a waste recycling program as
   part of its compliance with the 2004 Ontario Waste Diversion Goal a
   large fraction of its municipal solid waste ends up in the landfill.
   Landfill waste disposal adversely impacts the environment through the
   release of air pollutants and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and
   through the generation of leachate that may contaminate water sources.
   Landfills also require large land areas, which limit their long-term
   sustainability. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the
   environmental, economic, and social impacts of the current waste
   disposal program in the Region of Waterloo and of three waste management
   alternatives: (i) expansion of the organics collection program with
   biogas recovery, (ii) expansion of the recycling program, and (iii)
   incineration with energy recovery. Environmental impacts were evaluated
   by performing a life cycle analysis using the US EPA's Waste Reduction
   Model. Economic impacts were quantified using cost-benefit analysis;
   social impacts were evaluated using a previously developed scoring
   scheme. Finally, the overall impacts were ranked and analyzed using the
   Saaty's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine an optimal
   alternative to landfill disposal. Results indicate that incineration
   with energy recovery is ranked the highest overall in all three
   evaluation criteria categories. Incineration results in the greatest gas
   reductions (86\%) and the lowest cost to implement. Incineration also
   ranks the highest in the social impacts ranking due to reductions in
   foul odors, potential for attracting disease vectors, and land
   requirements. Expanding the recycling collection improves greenhouse gas
   emissions by 41\% of the current method; it also reduces disposal costs.
   Overall, all three alternatives are better than the current waste
   disposal method, and incineration is deemed the optimal waste management
   option for the Region of Waterloo.}},

   The proposed method, which uses a mechanism to add side information

   show that simply adding a small amount of soft constraints, in the form
   of must-link and cannot-link, improves the overall accuracy of the
   state-of-the-art method, ACA without adding any extra computational
   complexity. The results on the non-posed database VAM corpus for three

   improvements compared to the original approach.}},

Abstract = {{A key problem in designing multi-mode real-time systems is the
   generation of schedules to reduce the complexities of transforming the
   model semantics to code. Moreover, distributed multi-mode applications
   are prone to suffer from delays incurred during mode changes. We
   therefore aim to generate communication schedules that have low average
   mode-change delay for multi-mode real-time distributed applications.
   In this paper, we use optimization constraints associated to timing
   requirements to generate state-based schedules for multi-mode
   communication systems, and illustrate the workflow for generating
   schedules from specifications through a real-time video monitoring
   case-study. Our experiments in the case-study demonstrate that schedules
   generated using the proposed method reduce the average mode-change delay
   in relation to a randomized algorithm and the well-known EDF scheduling
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Their high strength-to-weight ratio and slenderness can make aluminium
   pedestrian bridges lively structures. The large amplitude of vibrations
   may reduce their serviceability under operational loads and may drive
   the dynamic design over the static one. In order to properly design
   aluminium bridges, it is important to define suitable load models to
   estimate structural response under human induced vibrations. The
   pedestrian force is commonly modeled in terms of periodic ground
   reaction forces (GRFs) on rigid surfaces, depending on weight and pacing
   frequency of the pedestrian, and the GRFs so obtained are approximated
   through Fourier series with dynamic load factors corresponding to the
   harmonics. However, most of these models have not been sufficiently
   verified from experimental and field measurements of bridge response
   under pedestrian excitations. The scope of this paper is to provide an
   overview of the periodic load models and their performance in predicting
   the response of footbridges. Predictions by the existing analytical load
   models are compared with field measurements conducted on a flexible
   aluminum bridge, and key observations regarding the applicability of
   existing models to predict the vibration behaviour of these bridges is
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Pendulum tuned mass dampers (PTMDs) are common auxiliary damping devices
   used to attenuate excessive motion in tall structures. The concept of
   effective or equivalent damping is commonly referenced when quantifying
   tuned mass damper (TMD) performance. Effective damping refers to
   determining the damping in a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillator
   operating at the same natural frequency that would produce an equal mean
   squared displacement response as the combined main and auxiliary system.
   Despite its simplicity, effective damping introduced by a TMD has
   experienced relatively little use in describing the performance of
   in-service TMDs, since its theoretical computation is based on the
   displacement response of the structure, which is seldom measured.
   Instead, acceleration response measurements are taken from which
   displacements need to be inferred. The proposed method applies the
   extended Kalman filter for combined state and parameter estimation for
   the purpose of estimating the effective damping introduced by a PTMD.
   The acceleration response measurements are fitted to the response of a
   SDOF system, where the unknown modal damping is appended to the state
   vector and estimated. The assumption of known bare structure natural
   frequency is subsequently relaxed and the natural frequency of the
   structure without the PTMD is estimated alongside the effective damping.
   The algorithm is first demonstrated using a numerical example and
   compared to the theoretical calculation. The methodology is also shown
   using full-scale acceleration response measurements collected from a
   structure equipped with a PTMD. The results of the study demonstrate the
   approach is an accurate and reliable means of quantifying the
   performance of in-service PTMDs without a direct measure of the
   displacement response of the attenuated structure and a priori knowledge
   of the underlying structure's natural frequency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, parallel factor tensor decomposition method is undertaken
   to perform underdetermined modal identification of structures in the
   presence of narrowband excitations. The algorithm is based on
   multiple-rank parallel factor decomposition of covariance tensors of
   vibration response measurements. Traditional output-only (blind) system
   identification methods assume intrinsic excitation to be broadband
   without having any narrowband frequencies. However when a pedestrian
   bridge is subjected to human walking loads, the effect of low-frequency
   narrowband excitation needs to be taken into account. Under such
   situations, the number of unknown frequency components in vibration
   responses proliferates compared to the number of measurements leading to
   the underdetermined modal identification problem. Presence of fewer
   number of vibration measurement increases futher the degree of
   inderdeterminacy of this problem. In this work, underdetermined modal
   identification problem is solved by exploiting the strong uniqueness
   condition of parallel factor tensor decomposition under multiple rank
   orders. The statistical characteristics of clusters of the resulting
   tensors are evaluated, which are then used to delineate the frequencies
   corresponding to external disturbances versus inherent modes of the
   structure. The proposed algorithm is finally validated using
   pedestrian-induced vibration data of a stress ribbon bridge located at
   the Technical University-Berlin, Germany.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic tests were conducted on {[}+/- 45](2S) angle ply carbon-epoxy
   specimens using stress ratios R (minimum/maximum stress) of 0.1 and
   -1.0. Damage was monitored by measuring progressive strain changes in
   the loading direction. The fatigue damage parameter was found to
   satisfactorily describe the evolution of damage throughout life. Two
   stages of damage evolution were identified. In Stage I, the fatigue
   damage parameter and the density of matrix microcracking rapidly
   increased to a level dependent upon the stress. This was followed by
   Stage II, a long period (90\% life) of gradual increase in damage,
   involving crack coalescence, debonding and delamination.
   On subjecting the specimens to variable amplitude loading tests, the
   total fatigue life was greater than that of the constant amplitude
   tests. Changes from low to high stress levels required more cycles to
   complete Stage I. For the high to low stress changes, the presence of
   large numbers of cracks and matrix debris within them resulted in
   closure, with a consequent increase in Stage II life.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular Network Localization (CNL) is a vital source of information to
   a wide range of emerging applications, to name a few, Location based
   services, traffic analysis and sensing, vehicles' anti-theft systems.
   Developing, validating, and testing of such applications require massive
   data sets of CNL a prerequisite that is impractical to be collected.
   Furthermore, it can not be simulated using hard computing models due to
   the lack of estimators that can ascribe accurate level of localization
   accuracy as to the change in various spatial properties. In this paper,
   we propose a soft computing model to simulate the CNL performance,
   called SCMCL. This model carries out the estimation of CNL performance
   according to a knowledge base built on the basis of empirical findings
   reported in the literature. SCMCL is fed with real-life vehicular traces
   and produces CNL. SCMCL is validated and demonstrated throughout various
   operation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method to detect the bias voltage shift caused by dielectric
   charging in immersed CMUT arrays is proposed. The proposed method uses
   acoustic crosstalk as a means of coupling ultrasonic signal from the
   transmitting element to the receiving element, thus no additional
   equipment is required except the standard driving circuits and
   amplifiers in CMUT systems. Continuous sinusoid waves with and without
   dc offset were used in experiments and output signals caused by acoustic
   crosstalk with peak to peak amplitudes in the range of 100-200mV were
   observed. The calculation of bias voltage shift was illustrated
   graphically. The array was then intentionally charged and a change of
   voltage shift in the correct direction was observed using the same
   method. The proposed method can be modified to use unipolar square
   pulses, thus enabling real time monitoring and automatic calibration of
   CMUT arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Developing 2D array-based systems for 3D imaging is overall more
   challenging due to the complexity in addressing the transducer elements.
   The Row-Column (RC) scheme results in a significant reduction in
   electrical leads at a reasonable cost in imaging quality. This paper
   presents imaging analysis on RC beamforming and provides evidence on why
   an RC-based Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (RC CMUT)
   array is suitable for mounting on the finger-tip for close-up imaging.
   The prototype can be fitted over a finger and be used for scanning a
   small targeted volume. The front-end electronics are also designed so
   that the device can be hands-free and be attached to the back of the
   hand. The simulation and experiment shows that the calculated scanning
   volume is highly limited by natural focusing. For a 4.8mm by 4.8mm,
   5.9MHz, 32x32 elements RC CMUT array, the calculated -6dB lateral
   resolution ranges from 0.3mm to 1mm within a 10mm depth. The effective
   scanning volume, given a 1mm resolution threshold, is approximately
   4.5mm by 4.5mm by 10mm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a parametric study of the dry-band arcing characteristics
   in the inclined plane tracking and erosion test is conducted under AC
   and DC voltages. The standard inclined plane testing apparatus is
   modified to promote stable and intense dry-band arcing, thereby
   analyzing the characteristics of the eroding dry-band arcing. The
   behavior of the liquid contaminant, which may bias the dry-band arcing
   current under equal AC and DC voltages, is investigated for different
   flow rates to determine suitable testing conditions. The highest leakage
   current magnitude is obtained under +DC followed by AC and -DC voltages,
   and reduced resistivity for the dry-band arcing column is shown under
   the +DC and AC as compared to the -DC voltages. The reduction in
   resistivity is speculated to be the result of metallic ions from
   electrode corrosion under +DC as compared to -DC, with less significant
   difference between +DC and AC. In addition, the inception behavior of
   the discharge influencing the length of the dry-band arc is found to be
   dependent on the voltage type. Reduced dry-band arcing length is
   measured for DC as compared to AC, with further reduction shown under
   +DC as compared to -DC. Thermal analysis is accordingly conducted,
   showing higher hot spot temperatures with dry-band arcing of a shorter
   length.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of insulation defects results in the initiation of partial
   discharge (PD) activities. As insulation failure and hence a failure of
   power equipment can occur due to the cumulative adverse effects of
   partial discharges, it is important to detect PD activities at early
   stages. The current techniques used in PD off-line analyses are not
   suitable for detecting defected insulators in the field. In this work,
   several cases of insulator defects are investigated in an effort to
   develop an on-line RF based PD monitoring technique using ceramic disc
   insulators with different types of defects. Like, an intentionally
   cracked ceramic insulator disc, a disc with a hole through the cap which
   results in internal discharges, and a completely broken insulator disc
   forming the first three classes. An external corona noise using a point
   to plane setup comprised the forth class. The defected discs are
   incorporated into strings of 2, 3 and 4 insulators. To analyze the
   discharges from different types of defects, the Artificial Neural
   Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are applied to
   the extracted features, and the recognition rates for each class are

   ASPHALT: A CANADIAN CASE STUDY}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relationship between the stiffness and
   rutting resistance of hot-mix asphalt. Ten different types of hot-mix
   asphalt were examined. The Superpave mix design method was utilized to
   produce nine mixes; the remaining mix was designed using the Marshall
   method. The asphalt mixes were tested for stiffness and rutting
   resistance under the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology
   research program at the University of Waterloo. The stiffness was
   determined by the laboratory resilient and dynamic moduli tests. The
   dynamic modulus test was conducted at six different loading frequencies
   and five different temperatures. The rutting test was executed by the
   Hamburg Wheel Rut Tester and the French Laboratory Rutting Tester to
   obtain rutting depth. The regression analysis was performed to examine
   the relationships of resilient and dynamic moduli with rutting depth.
   The results of the regression analysis revealed that resilient modulus
   did not correlate well with rutting depth. In contrast, dynamic modulus
   showed strong correlation with rutting depth for a number of loading
   frequencies and temperatures. The strong relationship was observed at
   the higher temperatures of +46.1 degrees C and +54.4 degrees C.
   Moreover, the relationship between dynamic modulus and rutting depth was
   better for lower loading cycles/wheel passes applied in the rutting
   test. It was also noticed that dynamic modulus exhibited a better
   relationship with rutting depth obtained from the French Laboratory
   Rutting Tester. The overall findings indicate that the dynamic moduli
   obtained at 0.1-1.0 Hz and +46.1-(+54.4) degrees C are useful to predict
   the rutting resistance of hot-mix asphalt.}},

Abstract = {{In current physical rehabilitation protocols, patients typically perform
   exercises without feedback or guidance following the initial
   demonstrations from the physiotherapist. This paper proposes a system
   providing continuous visual feedback and guidance to patients to improve
   quality of motion performance and adherence to instructions. The system
   consists of body-worn inertial measurement units which continuously
   measure the patient's pose. The measured pose is overlaid with the
   instructed motion on a visual display shown to the user during exercise
   performance. Two user studies were conducted with healthy participants
   to evaluate the usability of the visual guidance tool. Motion data was
   collected by the inertial measurement sensors and used to evaluate
   quality of motion, comparing user performance with and without visual
   feedback and with or without exercise guidance. The quantitative and
   qualitative results of the studies confirm that performing the exercises
   with the visual guidance tool promotes more consistent exercise
   performance and proper technique.}},

Abstract = {{The current diagnostic technique for melanoma solely relies on the
   surface level of skin and under-skin information is neglected. Since
   physiological features of skin such as melanin are closely related to
   development of melanoma, the non-linear physiological feature extraction
   model based on random forest regression is proposed. The proposed model
   characterizes the concentration of eumelanin and pheomelanin from
   standard camera images or dermoscopic images, which are conventionally
   used for diagnosis of melanoma. For the validation, the phantom study
   and the separability test using clinical images were conducted and
   compared against the state-of-the art non-linear and linear feature
   extraction models. The results showed that the proposed model
   outperformed other comparing models in phantom and clinical experiments.
   Promising results show that the quantitative characterization of skin
   features, which is provided by the proposed method, can allow
   dermatologists and clinicians to make a more accurate and improved
   diagnosis of melanoma.}},

   use low-level features, which are difficult to interpret by radiologists

   novel strategy comprising a tumor candidate identification scheme and a
   hybrid textural-morphological feature model for delineating between
   cancerous and non-cancerous tumor candidates in the prostate gland via
   multiparametric MRI. Experimental results using clinical multiparametric
   MRI datasets show that the proposed strategy has strong potential as a

Abstract = {{Objective: Motor unit loss associated with neuropathic disorders affects
   motor unit activation. Quantitative electromyographic (EMG) features of
   motor unit activation estimated from the sequences of motor unit
   potentials (MUPs) created by concurrently active motor units can support
   the detection of neuropathic disorders. Interpretation of most motor
   unit activation feature values are, however, confounded by uncertainty
   regarding the level of muscle activation during EMG signal detection. A
   set of new features circumventing these limitations are proposed, and
   their utility in detecting neuropathy is investigated using simulated
   and clinical EMG signals.
   Methods: The firing sequence of a motor neuron was simulated using a
   compartmentalized Hodgkin-Huxley based model. A pool of motor neurons
   was modelled such that each motor neuron was subjected to a common level
   of activation. The detection of the firing sequence of a motor neuron
   using a clinically detected EMG signal was simulated using a model of
   muscle anatomy combined with a model representing muscle fiber
   electrophysiology and the voltage detection properties of a concentric
   needle electrode.
   Significance: Findings are based on simulated EMG data representing 30
   normal and 30 neuropathic muscles as well as clinical EMG data collected
   from the tibialis anterior muscle of 48 control subjects and 30 subjects
   with neuropathic disorders. These results demonstrate the possibility of
   detecting neuropathy using motor unit recruitment and mean firing rate
   feature values estimated from standard concentric needle detected EMG
   signals.}},

Abstract = {{Human hands are the most dexterous of human limbs and hand gestures play
   an important role in non-verbal communication. Underlying
   electromyograms associated with hand gestures provide a wealth of
   information based on which varying hand gestures can be recognized. This
   paper develops an inter-individual hand gesture recognition model based
   on Hidden Markov models that receives surface electromyography (sEMG)
   signals as inputs and predicts a corresponding hand gesture. The
   developed recognition model is tested with a dataset of 10 various hand
   gestures performed by 25 subjects in a leave-one-subject-out cross
   validation and an inter-individual recognition rate of 79\% was
   achieved. The promising recognition rate demonstrates the efficacy of
   the proposed approach for discriminating between gesture-specific sEMG
   signals and could inform the design of sEMG-controlled prostheses and
   assistive devices.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-task gait allows assessment of impaired executive function and
   mobility control in older individuals, which are risk factors of falls.
   This study investigated gait changes in older individuals due to the
   addition of a cognitive load, using wearable pressure-sensing insole and
   tri-axial accelerometer measures. These wearable sensors can be applied
   at the point-of-care. Eleven elderly (65 years or older) individuals
   walked 7.62 m with and without a verbal fluency cognitive load task
   while wearing FScan 3000E pressuresensing insoles in both shoes and a
   Gulf Coast X16-1C tri-axial accelerometer at the pelvis.
   Plantar-pressure derived parameters included center of force (CoF) path
   and temporal measures. Acceleration derived measures were descriptive
   statistics, Fast Fourier Transform quartile, ratio of even-to-odd
   harmonics, and maximum Lyapunov exponent. Stride time, stance time, and
   swing time all significantly increased during dual-task compared to
   single-task walking. Minimum, mean, and median CoF stance velocity;
   cadence; and vertical, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral harmonic
   ratio all significantly decreased during dual-task walking. Wearable
   plantar pressure-sensing insole and lower back accelerometer
   derived-measures can identify gait differences between singletask and
   dual-task walking in older individuals and could be used in
   point-of-care environments to assess for deficits in executive function

Abstract = {{Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging or diagnostic ultrasound is used to
   measure geometric properties of the lumbar multifidus muscle to infer
   muscle strength or degeneration for back pain therapy. For this purpose,
   a novel semi-automatic approach (FTS: Fisher-Tippett Segmentation) based
   upon the Decoupled Active Contour is proposed to reliably and quickly
   segment the lumbar multifidus muscle in diagnostic ultrasound. To
   overcome speckle or hardly visible region boundaries in ultrasound
   images, we first propose a novel external energy functional to
   explicitly consider the underlying Fisher-Tippett distribution of
   ultrasound data. We then introduce a user-guided Hidden Markov Model
   trellis formation for improved segmentation of weakly-defined regions.
   Extensive experiments have shown that our approach not only improves the
   segmentation performance when compared to existing methods, but also
   does not rely on sub-specialized knowledge for segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-observer variability is the lack of agreement among clinicians in
   contouring a given organ or tumour in a medical image. The variability
   in medical image contouring is a source of uncertainty in radiation
   treatment planning. Consensus contour of a given case, which was
   proposed to reduce the variability, is generated by combining the
   manually generated contours of several clinicians. However, having
   access to several clinicians (e.g., radiation oncologists) to generate a
   consensus contour for one patient is costly. This paper presents an
   algorithm that automatically generates a consensus contour for a given
   case using the atlases of different clinicians. The algorithm was
   applied to prostate MR images of 15 patients manually contoured by 5
   clinicians. The automatic consensus contours were compared to manual
   consensus contours where a median Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of
   88\% was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal image registration has been a challenging task in medical
   images because of the complex intensity relationship between images to
   be aligned. Registration methods often rely on the statistical intensity
   relationship between the images which suffers from problems such as
   statistical insufficiency. The proposed registration method works based
   on extracting structural features by utilizing the complex phase and
   gradient-based information. By employing structural relationships
   between different modalities instead of complex similarity measures, the
   multi-modal registration problem is converted into a mono-modal one.
   Therefore, conventional mono-modal similarity measures can be utilized
   to evaluate the registration results. This new registration paradigm has
   been tested on magnetic resonance (MR) brain images of different modes.
   The method has been evaluated based on target registration error (TRE)
   to determine alignment accuracy. Quantitative results demonstrate that
   the proposed method is capable of achieving comparable registration
   accuracy compared to the conventional mutual information.}},

Abstract = {{In classification with Support Vector Machines, only Mercer kernels,
   i.e. valid kernels, such as the Gaussian RBF kernel, are widely accepted
   and thus suitable for clinical data. Practitioners would also like to
   use the sigmoid kernel, a non-Mercer kernel, but its range of validity
   is difficult to determine, and even within range its validity is in
   dispute. Despite these shortcomings the sigmoid kernel is used by some,
   and two kernels in the literature attempt to emulate and improve upon
   it.
   We propose the first Mercer sigmoid kernel, that is therefore
   trustworthy for the classification of clinical data. We show the
   similarity between the Mercer sigmoid kernel and the sigmoid kernel and,
   in the process, identify a normalization technique that improves the
   classification accuracy of the latter.
   The Mercer sigmoid kernel achieves the best mean accuracy on three
   clinical data sets, detecting melanoma in skin lesions better than the
   most popular kernels; while with non-clinical data sets it has no
   significant difference in median accuracy as compared with the Gaussian
   RBF kernel. It consistently classifies some points correctly that the
   Gaussian RBF kernel does not and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional methods for early detection of melanoma rely upon a
   dermatologist to visually assess a skin lesion using the ABCDE
   (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter, Evolution)
   criteria before confirmation can be done through biopsy by a
   pathologist. However, this visual assessment strategy taken by
   dermatologists is hampered by clinician subjectivity and suffers from
   low sensitivity. Computer-aided diagnostic methods based on
   dermatological photographs are being developed to aid in the melanoma
   diagnosis process, but most of these methods rely only on superficial,
   topographic features that can be limiting in characterizing melanoma. In
   this work, a hybrid feature model is introduced for characterizing skin
   lesions that combines low-level and high-level features, and augments
   them with a set of physiological features extracted from dermatological
   photographs using a nearest-neighbor nonlinear model to improve
   classification performance. The physiological features extracted from
   the lesion for the proposed hybrid feature model include those based on:
   i) eumelanin concentrations, ii) pheomelanin concentrations, and iii)
   blood oxygen saturation. The proposed hybrid feature model was evaluated
   on 206 dermatological photographs of skin lesions (119 confirmed
   melanoma cases, 87 confirmed non-melanoma cases) using a cross
   validation scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed
   hybrid feature model, with integrated physiological features, provided
   improved sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy for the
   purpose of melanoma classification.}},

Abstract = {{Buses and bicycles that share lanes interfere with each other,
   especially at bus stops. The primary objective of this study was to
   develop quantitative approaches to analyze interactions between buses
   and bicycles at bus stops. Field investigations were conducted at four
   types of bus stops in China. Observed data were used to test the
   significance of differences in bicycle speeds, and a model was proposed
   to predict the number of meeting events between buses and bicycles.
   Results indicate that bicycle speeds are influenced significantly when a
   bicyclist meets a bus at a bus stop where both vehicle types share the
   same lane. Setting strips to separate bus and bicycle movement
   trajectories can reduce or eliminate the impact on efficiency and
   safety. The number of meeting events between buses and bicycles can be
   used to characterize the level of service of this facility shared by
   buses and bicycles. The proposed model achieved relatively accurate
   prediction for the number of meeting events. The findings can contribute
   to a quantitative understanding of the effects on buses and bicycles at
   stops and to an evaluation of this facility shared by buses and

Abstract = {{One implementation alternative for network interconnects in modern
   chip-multiprocessor systems is priority-aware arbitration networks. To
   enable the deployment of real-time applications to priority-aware
   networks, recent research proposes worst-case latency (WCL) analyses for
   such networks. Buffer space requirements in priority-aware networks,
   however, are seldom addressed. In this work, we bound the buffer space
   required for valid WCL analyses and consequently optimize router design
   for application specifications by computing the required buffer space at
   each virtual channel in priority-aware routers. In addition to the
   obvious advantage of bounding buffer space while providing valid WCL
   bounds, buffer space reduction decreases chip area and saves energy in
   priority-aware networks. Our experiments show that the proposed buffer
   space computation reduces the number of unfeasible implementations by
   42\% compared to an existing buffer space analysis technique. It also
   reduces the required buffer space in priority-aware routers by up to
   79\%.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking multiple targets with non-linear dynamics is a challenging
   problem. One of the popular solutions, Sequential Monte
   Carlo-Probability Hypothesis Density (SMC-PHD) filter, deploys a Random
   Set (RS) theoretic formulation along with the Sequential Monte Carlo
   approximation, which is a variant of Bayes filtering. The performance of
   Bayesian filtering-based methods can be enhanced by using extra
   information incorporated as specific constraints into the filtering
   process. Following the same principle, this paper proposes a constrained
   variant of the SMC-PHD filter, in which the inherently vague
   human-generated data are transformed into a set of constraints using a
   fuzzy logic approach. These constraints are enforced to the filtering
   process by applying coefficients to the particles' weights. The Soft
   Data (SD) reports on target agility level; wherein, the agility refers
   to the case in which the observed dynamics of the targets deviates from
   its given probabilistic characterization. Consequently, the proposed
   constrained filtering approach enables dealing with multitarget tracking
   scenarios in presence of target agility, as demonstrated by the
   experimental results presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a distributed control scheme is proposed to mitigate the
   challenges of voltage regulation in DC distribution systems and
   facilitate high penetration of distributed and renewable energy
   resources. The proposed control scheme consists of two main stages. In
   the first stage, a distributed state estimation algorithm is implemented
   to estimate the voltage profile in a DC distribution system and enhance
   the AC/DC converter operation in order to keep the system voltage within
   its specified limits. Further, in case of occurrence of voltage
   violation that cannot be handled by the AC/DC interfacing converter a
   reconsideration of power management would take place. Thus, in the
   second stage, a distributed power management optimization problem is
   formulated to maximize the total DGs' revenue; while keeping the
   voltages of all system buses within limits. The formulated problem is
   classified as a convex optimization problem under global constraints. A
   distributed Lagrangian Primal-Dual Subgradient (DLPDS) algorithm that is
   superior in solving such optimization problems is proposed in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Charging stations are critical infrastructure for the integration of
   plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the future distribution systems.
   With a steadily increasing PEV penetration level, the PEV charging
   demands of charging stations are expected to constitute a significant
   portion of the total electric power demands. An accurate estimation of
   PEV charging demands is crucial for the planning and operation of future
   distribution systems. However, the estimation remains a challenging
   issue, as the charging demands of nearby charging stations are closely
   correlated to each other and depend on vehicle drivers' response to
   charging prices. The evaluation of charging demands is further
   complicated by the highly dynamic vehicle mobility, which results in
   random PEV arrivals and departures. In order to address these
   challenges, a BCMP queueing network model is presented in this paper, in
   which each charging station is modeled as a service center with multiple
   servers (chargers) and PEVs are modeled as the customers in the service
   centers. Based on the stationary distribution of the number of PEVs in
   each charging station, the statistics of PEV charging demands can be
   obtained. The analytical model is validated by a case study based on
   realistic vehicle statistics extracted from 2009 National Household
   Travel Survey and New York State Transportation Federation Traffic Data

Abstract = {{With the expectation of increasing market share of Plug-in Electric
   Vehicles (PEVs), utilities expect to see a significant increase in
   energy demand and system peak as a result of PEVs recharging their
   batteries from the grid, if the charging is not controlled at the
   distribution system level. By making the grid ``smarter{''}, utilities
   would be able to maximize utilization of existing assets and defer
   capital investments, while maintaining system security and reliability.
   The current research proposes a modeling framework for day-ahead
   dispatch and dynamic control of PEV loads as well as scheduling of taps
   and capacitors. The first step of the proposed work, which is presented
   in this paper, involves the development of a static Genetic Algorithm
   (GA)-based optimization model that determines the day-ahead schedule for
   PEV loads, taps and capacitors, with the base load and relevant PEV
   information provided as inputs to the model. In this case, the objective
   is to minimize the system peak, while satisfying the physical and
   operational limits of the distribution system, as a higher system peak
   translates into higher operational costs for the utility. The proposed
   approach is tested in an actual distribution feeder, demonstrating its
   feasibility for realistic applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new online coordination method for plug-in
   electric vehicles (PEVs) charging in smart distribution networks. The
   proposed method aims to optimally charge the PEVs in order to maximize
   the utility profit and minimize the PEVs charging costs based on
   real-time energy pricing signal. The proposed method takes into
   consideration the impacts of the future charging decisions and the
   normal load profile on the current charging decisions, which leads to
   improved utilization of the power system resources without violating the
   grid technical constraints. Simulation results on a typical distribution
   network are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   architecture, where PEVs owners' satisfaction is examined at different
   loading levels.}},

   System}},

Pages = {{54-63}},
Abstract = {{The concrete pavement industry is actively seeking new and modern
   solutions to the construction of more economical, more sustainable, and
   more durable roads. One innovative product being evaluated for use in
   pavement applications consists of interlocking modular, dome-shaped
   plastic units that serve as a permanent formwork. The result is a
   concrete slab with a system of interconnected vaultlike voids below the
   surface. The dome shape is capable of providing carrying capacities
   equivalent to those of conventional slabs but requires less concrete to
   do so and also provides additional drainage and ventilation benefits. To
   evaluate the feasibility of using this structural dome formwork system
   in road and highway applications, a collaborative research effort was
   undertaken. As part of this study, a full-scale, instrumented trial
   section was built for testing and evaluation in an accelerated loading
   scenario. Details about the design and construction of the experimental
   pavement sections are presented. A preliminary evaluation of pavement
   performance during the first year of service is provided as well as
   discussion about this product's feasibility as pavement technology. The
   results obtained to date suggest that this technology has great
   potential in concrete pavement applications. The trial pavement sections
   are performing well after more than 1 year of service and are carrying
   heavily loaded aggregate trucks in the harsh Canadian climate. More than
   1.34 million cumulative equivalent single-axle loads have been applied
   to the pavement to date without any significant pavement degradation.
   The findings obtained also indicate that the dome-shaped technology can
   provide significant material and cost savings as compared with
   conventional jointed plain concrete pavements.}},

Abstract = {{Optics is an enabling science that has far ranging importance in many
   diverse fields. However, many students do not find it to be of great
   interest. A solution to this problem is to train teachers in active
   learning methodologies so that the subject matter can be presented to
   generate student interest. We describe a workshop to present an example
   of an active learning process in Optics developed for training of
   teachers in developing countries (a UNESCO project) and will focus on 2
   two different activities: 1. Interference \& diffraction is considered
   by students as being very hard to understand and is taught in most
   developing countries as purely theoretical with almost no experiments.
   Simple experiments to enhance the conceptual understanding of these wave
   phenomena will be presented and 2. Image formation by the eye. Here we
   will discuss myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism as well as accommodation.
   In this module we will discuss image. The objective of the workshop will
   be to provide an experience of the use of the active learning method in
   optics including the use of experiments, mind's on \& hands-on
   exercises, group \& class discussions}},

Abstract = {{The Light and Optics Conceptual Evaluation (LOCE) was developed to
   examine conceptual understanding of basic geometric and physical optics
   for the Active Learning in Optics and Photonics program administered by
   UNESCO. This 50 item test (46 multiple choice, 4 ray-tracing short
   answer) was administered to entering students in the Optometry
   professional degree (OD) program. We wanted to determine how much of the
   physics/optics concepts from undergraduate physics courses (a
   pre-requisite for entry to the OD program) were retained. In addition,
   the test was administered after the first year students had taken a
   required course in geometric and visual optics as part of their first
   semester courses. The LOCE was completed by two consecutive classes to
   the program in 2010 (n=89) and 2011 (n=84). The tests were administered
   the first week of the term and the test was given without any prior
   notice. In addition, the test was administered to the class of 2010
   students after they had completed the course in geometric and visual
   optics. The means of the test were 22.1 (SD=4.5; range: 12-35) and
   21.3(SD=5.1; range: 11-35) for the two entering classes. There was no
   statistical significance between the two classes (t-test, p>0.05).
   Similarly there was no difference between the scores in terms of gender.
   The post-course test (administered during the first week of the second
   term) showed a statistically significant improvement (mean score went
   from 22.1 to 31.1, a 35\% improvement).
   It should be noted that both groups of students performed worse in
   questions related to physical optics as well as lens imaging, while
   scoring best in questions related to refraction and reflection. These
   data should be taken into consideration when designing optics curricula
   for optometry (and other allied health programs such as opticianry or
   ophthalmology).}},

Abstract = {{Coarse-resolution computational fluid dynamics simulations using the
   unsteady Delayed-Detached-Eddy simulation (DDES) and the steady
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methodologies were conducted to
   predict the aerodynamic performance of the Fortis Montana 5.8-kW
   horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). The turbulence models used for the
   closure of the DDES and RANS methodologies were the one-equation
   Spalart-Allmaras model and the two-equation shear stress transport k -
   omega model, respectively. To assess and validate the predictive
   performance of these two simulation strategies conducted with
   coarse-resolution computational grids, experimental measurements of the
   Fortis Montana 5.8-kW HAWT were conducted at the 9 m x 9 m National
   Research Council Canada wind tunnel. Results of a detailed comparison
   between the wind tunnel experimental measurements and the model
   predictions are presented. It was found that predictions of the power
   curve using the DDES methodology yielded good conformance with the
   associated experimental measurements. Furthermore, it was found that the
   RANS method fails to capture the correct power output at moderate and
   high tip speed ratios. It is concluded that accuracy in a wind turbine
   power curve prediction using the relatively coarse mesh in this study is
   probably satisfactory for most real-world industrial and engineering
   applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Feature space projection, or feature projection is an active research
   topic in machine learning. Some projection methods have been used in
   remote sensing for dimension reduction, especially for hyperspectral
   data due to high dimensionality. Projection methods can improve the
   performance of classifiers susceptible to the Hughes phenomenon.
   However, the effect of feature projection for more advanced classifiers
   has not been well-studied, and there are few studies comparing
   projection methods for hyperspectral image classification. A
   comprehensive study has been performed on the effect of feature
   projection for classification using both reduced and full dimensions.
   The performance of six feature projection methods (PCA, LLE, LDA, LFDA,
   LMNN, and SPCA) using three classifiers has been explored on three
   hyperspectral data sets. Results show that the performance of feature
   projection methods on different classifiers are mainly consistent for
   different data sets. LFDA achieves the best overall performance

Abstract = {{Accurate and detailed information of sea ice is crucial for navigation
   in ice-covered waters. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used as
   an effective tool in remote sensing to collect information for
   estimating the sea ice state. Image analysis experts produce manual
   image analysis charts based on their interpretation of the SAR imagery.
   Since the manual analysis is very time-consuming automatic methods can
   be used to discriminate ice-ocean and accelerate the task. Image texture
   features from Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) are used as a
   source of information for ice-water discrimination. In this work an

Abstract = {{Classification of hyperspectral imagery using too few labeled samples is
   a challenging problem considering the high dimensionality of
   hyperspectral imagery. In this paper, an ensemble method combining
   rotation forests and AdaBoost is proposed to tackle this problem. By
   adaptive boosting, AdaBoost can significantly reduce classification
   error in an iteration compared to a single classifier, and the rotation
   matrix can increase diversity so that the ensemble performance can be
   further improved. Experimental resutls show that the final
   classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm consistently
   outperforms other state-of-the-art classification methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel visual servoing system that is simple,
   robust, and relatively fast. Our system utilizes depth information
   available from an RGB-D Microsoft Kinect, rather than a stereo camera
   that is known to fail in poorly textured environments. The technique is
   based on a twophase controller. The first phase provides a coarse image
   plane alignment with a target image using image saliencies for
   registration. The second phase relies on a depth-maperror- minimization
   to further reduce the position error and precisely situate the robot.
   Based on the magnitude of error between actual and desired position the
   system activates one or both phases sequentially to successfully servo
   the robot to its destination. Experiments demonstrate the success of the
   proposed system for both large and small initial position errors.}},

   The diffusion of majority carriers should overcome the electric

   modification of shape memory alloy functional properties to create
   monolithic actuators that exhibit several different thermomechanical

   process a monolithic piece of NiTi shape memory alloy material to allow
   synergistic pseudoelastic and shape memory effect behavior. The
   resulting actuator contains self-biasing properties eliminating the need
   for a separate biasing mechanism for cyclic actuation. The
   characteristics of these different local behaviors were analyzed using
   tensile testing and differential scanning calorimetry. The stress and
   strain amplitude of the self-biasing linear actuation was characterized
   with relation to input current control. This work provides proof of

Abstract = {{A new method for a driver in the loop vehicle control is proposed in
   this paper. The driver is modeled as a linear optimal controller with
   time varying delay, who uses road preview information as well as dynamic
   behavior of the vehicle to steer the car and follow the desired path.
   The delay block represents the cumulative drivers observation and the
   action delay. Since regular controllers do not have access to the future
   road preview data, the road preview information is modeled as unknown
   bounded uncertainty. A robust state-feedback controller based on
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii methodology is designed to mitigate effects of
   delays and uncertainties. The controller in this scheme only uses the
   current states of the vehicle, driver input, and the driver model.
   Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of using an energy constrained
   sensor network to estimate the state of a linear dynamical system. The
   state estimate is computed using a Kalman filter and the goal is to
   choose a subset of sensors at each time step so as to minimize the a
   posteriori error covariance. Recent work has indicated that the simple
   greedy algorithm, which chooses the sensor at each time step that
   maximizes the error covariance reduction, outperforms many other known
   scheduling algorithms. In addition, it has been suggested that the cost
   function mapping a sensor sequence to an error covariance cost is
   submodular; this would imply that the greedy algorithm provides a near
   optimal sensor schedule.
   As a negative result, we show that the sensor schedule cost is not, in
   general, a submodular function. This contradicts an established result.
   We argue that given a linear dynamical system, it is computationally
   intractable to determine if it will yield a submodular cost. Thus, we
   provide sufficient and easily checkable conditions under which the
   dynamical system yields a submodular cost, and thus performance
   guarantees for the greedy schedule.}},

   for systems with uncertain but bounded model parameters and initial
   conditions. We assume that each uncertain parameter in the system model
   is bounded by conservative guaranteed bounds, and tighter conditional
   bounds. We define a class of systems by the number of conservative
   bounds required to bound all uncertain parameters. Using robust
   optimization, we solve a single linear program per class of systems to
   obtain gains for the interval observer. A conservative upper bound on
   the worst-case steady-state performance of the interval observers over
   the specified class of systems is minimized.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with applying techniques from L-2-optimal
   control allocation for the coordinated stabilization and control of
   vertical vehicle dynamics (roll, pitch, and vertical motion) using
   active and semi-active suspensions. This is accomplished by designing
   appropriate high-level controllers and control allocators for
   multiobjective control. The equations of motion for the vertical vehicle
   dynamics are presented and high-level controllers are designed using
   techniques from sliding mode control. Optimal control allocators are
   then designed by way of quadratic programs with special attention given
   to the differences inherent in active and semi-active (MR damper)
   suspension systems. Finally, the control system is implemented using a
   computationally efficient active set algorithm and validated in
   simulation with a CarSim model of a Chevrolet Equinox. Simulation shows
   that the control system designed here substantially improves the
   vertical vehicle dynamic response in the case of both active and
   semi-active actuators.}},

Abstract = {{Deterioration indexes that may combine types of surface distresses,
   serviceability, and structural indicators are commonly used for pavement
   management at the network level. These indexes differ in the types of
   deterioration and criteria considered to quantify severity and density
   of distresses. Most of these indexes were developed for interurban road
   networks; therefore, their application to urban networks is complex and
   not representative. For this reason, there is a need for a better
   understanding of urban pavement behavior to enable collection of the
   distresses relevant to these types of pavements and development of an
   overall condition index for urban pavements that represents the mix of
   the more relevant distresses for use in network analysis. This study is
   part of a 3-year project developed in Chile: Research and Development of
   Solutions for Urban Pavement Management in Chile. The main objective of
   this study was to calibrate and to validate an urban pavement condition
   index (UPCI) representative of the overall condition of these pavements,
   according to objective measures of surface distresses and evaluations of
   an expert panel. The scope of this study included the development of
   distress evaluation guidelines for asphalt and concrete pavements
   considering manual and automated surveys, the application of these
   guidelines in different types of urban networks, and the assessment of
   these networks by an expert panel. Finally, three UPCI equations were
   obtained with satisfactory validation for asphalt pavements with manual
   and automated data collection and for concrete pavements with manual
   data collection.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce ROC, a Rank-switching, Open-row Controller for Double Data
   Rate Dynamic RAM (DDR DRAM). ROC is optimized for mixed-criticality
   multicore systems using modern DDR devices: compared to existing
   real-time memory controllers, it provides significantly lower worst case
   latency bounds for hard real-time tasks and supports throughput-oriented
   optimizations for soft real-time applications. The key to improved
   performance is an innovative rank-switching mechanism which hides the
   latency of write-read transitions in DRAM devices without requiring
   unpredictable request reordering. We further employ open row policy to
   take advantage of the data caching mechanism (row buffering) in each
   device. ROC provides complete timing isolation between hard and soft
   tasks and allows for compositional timing analysis over the number of
   cores and memory ranks in the system. We implemented and synthesized the
   ROC back end in Verilog RTL, and evaluated its performance on both
   synthetic tasks and a set of representative benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time systems (RTS) were typically considered to be invulnerable to
   external attacks, mainly due to their use of proprietary hardware and
   protocols, as well as physical isolation. As a result, RTS and security
   have traditionally been separate domains. These assumptions are being
   challenged by a series of recent events that highlight the
   vulnerabilities in RTS. In this paper we focus on integrating security
   as a first class principle in the design of RTS: we show that certain
   security requirements can be specified as real-time scheduling
   constraints. Using information leakage as a motivating problem, we
   illustrate our techniques with fixed-priority (FP) real-time schedulers.
   We evaluate our approach and discuss tradeoffs. Our evaluation shows
   that many real-time task sets can be scheduled under the proposed
   constraints without significant performance impact.}},

   solar energy to power their operations. The aim is to minimize the
   energy usage over one orbit, while delivering a given amount of
   information from the satellite. We first assume that the channel gains
   as well as the amount of harvested energy in each time slot are
   completely known at the beginning of each orbit. The associated
   energy-minimization problem for this non-causal case is formulated and
   solved. For the causal case where the amount of harvested energy is
   assumed to be known only up to the present transmission slot, a greedy
   algorithm for on-line scheduling is presented. Finally, we present
   numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The achievable region of parallel Gaussian interference channels is
   investigated. The known coding schemes proposed for the the two-user
   Gaussian interference channel are extended to parallel Gaussian
   interference channels. The optimality of separate coding for two coding
   schemes namely, time division with power control and treat as noise, is
   proved. Moreover, the necessity of joint coding for simultaneous
   nonunique decoding and Han-Kobayashi coding is demonstrated. For all
   mentioned schemes, the optimal covariance matrix is shown to be
   diagonal. In addition, the ergodic fading interference channel is
   studied. The ergodic achievable sum-rate is investigated for different
   coding schemes and the optimality of diagonal covariance matrices is
   shown. It is proved that for time division with power control and
   simultaneous non-unique decoding, uniform power allocation over all
   sub-channels is sum-rate optimal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a hybrid setup for cognitive radio based on
   Gaussian interference channel where the secondary user can use both
   interweave and underlay strategies. The primary user does not cooperate
   or adapt since it is using legacy hardware. We show that these
   assumptions lead to a non-convex achievable rate region for various
   types of hybrid interweave-underlay strategies and that the rate
   optimization problem for the secondary user is in general non-convex and
   non-smooth. We analyze the structure of this optimization problem to
   reduce it to a number of tractable subproblems in various interference
   regimes. Numerical simulations are also presented to give insight into
   the performance of the proposed schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Al-Mg-Si-(Cu), i.e. AA6xxx, alloys are widely used light alloys which
   can be effectively strengthened through precipitation hardening. The
   final microstructure, and thus properties, of these alloys after common
   artificial aging treatments are largely determined by the
   composition-dependent nano-scale clustering and precipitation that occur
   during the earliest stage of aging. Therefore, multi-length scale
   analysis of the earliest-stage of precipitation can provide critical
   knowledge in understanding the basis for the microstructural evolution
   during aging and attaining the desired microstructures and properties.
   Here, we investigate the effect of alloy composition on the evolution of
   early-stage clusters and precipitates during aging at 180 degrees C
   using high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results map
   a sequential evolution of clusters with an FCC structure but different
   morphology/orientation characteristics. GP-zones with structures other
   than FCC, also form in the early stages of aging. The
   composition-dependent kinetics of beta{''} phase precipitation and
   hardening behavior are discussed in light of the results from
   differential scanning calorimetry experiments, microhardness
   measurements, and conventional transmission electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of a field study designed to quantify
   the effects of various factors on the snow-melting performance of salt.
   Many tests were conducted in a realistic environment over two winter
   seasons, covering more than 70 snow events, with temperatures ranging
   from -14 degrees C to 3 degrees C and snowfalls ranging from similar to
   0.2 to 21.0 cm. For each snow event, salts were applied to a set of test
   sections with specific application rates, and time series performance;
   condition data such as snow coverage or bare pavement status, friction,
   pavement and air temperature, sky view, and humidity were collected. An
   exploratory data analysis was performed to identify the key factors
   influencing the snow-melting performance of salt, such as application
   rate, temperature, and snow amount. A multiple linear regression model
   was calibrated for the relationship between the key snow-melting
   performance indicators: bare pavement regain time and various
   influencing factors. The calibrated model was then applied to determine
   the minimum amount of salt required for achieving a given level of
   service under specific weather events. Although the research was
   motivated by the need to develop optimal salt application rates for
   parking lots and sidewalks, the results could be equally applicable for
   other transportation facilities after factors specific to the facility,
   such as traffic and dilution, are accounted for.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH}},

Pages = {{601-617}},
Abstract = {{Anatoxin-a (ANTX-a) is a potent alkaloid neurotoxin, produced by several
   species of cyanobacteria and detected throughout the world. The presence
   of cyanotoxins, including ANTX-a, in drinking water sources is a
   potential risk to public health. This article presents a thorough
   examination of the cumulative body of research on the use of drinking
   water treatment technologies for extracellular ANTX-a removal, focusing
   on providing an analysis of the specific operating parameters required
   for effective treatment and on compiling a series of best-practice
   recommendations for owners and operators of systems impacted by this
   cyanotoxin. Of the oxidants used in drinking water treatment,
   chlorine-based processes (chlorine, chloramines and chlorine dioxide)
   have been shown to be ineffective for ANTX-a treatment, while ozone,
   advanced oxidation processes and permanganate can be successful.
   High-pressure membrane filtration (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis)
   is likely effective, while adsorption and biofiltration may be effective
   but further investigation into the implementation of these processes is
   necessary. Given the lack of full-scale verification, a multiple-barrier
   approach is recommended, employing a combination of chemical and
   non-chemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{Organic light-emitting diode (OLED), albeit is currently used in
   consumer electronics, still faces challenge with its limited performance
   stability. The degradation mechanisms that limit the lifetime of OLEDs
   can generally be separated into two categories: ambient and intrinsic.
   Much research has been devoted to understanding thus limiting these
   degradation mechanisms. However, surprisingly, there has been little
   work on how ambient and intrinsic degradation affect each other. In this
   work, the interplay between the ambient and intrinsic (more specifically
   exciton-induced) degradation is studied by comparing the effects of four
   degradation schemes, namely, no ambient or exciton-induced, ambient
   only, exciton-induced only and ambient and exciton-induced degradation
   on device lifetime. The results show that there is no interplay between
   ambient and exciton-induced degradation. Furthermore, it is evident that
   no photo-oxidation is present during ambient and exciton-induced
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Schottky-junction organic solar cells have been a topic of intense
   research in recent times due to their surprisingly high performance.
   Some aspects of their device physics are well understood but charge
   transport in neat-C-60 and donor-doped Schottky junction OSCs has not
   been studied in detail so far. In this study, charge transport in
   neat-C-60 OSCs is examined by studying the performance of these OSCs as
   a function of C-60 active layer thickness. Surprisingly, the fill-factor
   of the neat-C-60 Schottky OSC does not degrade for layer thicknesses
   between 20 nm - 80 nm indicating that charge transport is not an issue.
   However, the short-circuit current decreases significantly due to a
   reduction in the built-in voltage. The dissociation of excitons formed
   in C-60 aggregates is preferentially reduced. Devices with thicker C-60
   layers and consequently, higher C-60 aggregation, were found to have
   greater recombination. Finally, charge mobility in C-60 films with
   aggregates is found to be lower than charge mobility in films with
   little to no aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Processing additives are widely used to increase the efficiency of
   solution processed organic solar cells. We use the Hansen solubility
   parameters (HSPs) to investigate novel processing additives. The HSPs
   predict pyrrolidinone derivatives to be efficient processing additives
   for OSC systems based on
   poly(3-hexylthiophene)/{[}6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
   (P3HT/PCBM). Two pyrrolidinone derivatives are identified:
   1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and 1benzyl- 2-pyrrolidinone. The processing
   additives are introduced with various concentrations in the formulation
   of P3HT and PCBM solution. The electrical characterizations show that
   the two processing additives significantly increase the short circuit
   current and thus the power conversion efficiency of the OSCs. The
   results thus highlight HSPs as an effective and relatively
   straightforward tool that can be employed to optimize OSC morphology
   from a theoretical standpoint. Such a tool will be invaluable for
   identifying additives for novel high efficiency polymer species as they
   are synthesized, and thus to streamline the device fabrication and

Abstract = {{Reproducibility in efficiency and lifetime of organic solar cells (OSCs)
   remains a major concern, especially with the development of more complex
   and modern multi-layer device architectures. In this work, OSCs are
   studied for their efficiency and photo-stability as a function of the
   quality of their thermally evaporated MoOx hole extraction layer (HEL).
   To this end, the characteristics of the MoOx film are demonstrated to
   change with repeat evaporation runs from the same source material. These
   variations have strong effects on polymer OSCs (p-OSCs), with an
   effective halving of the power conversion efficiency after only three
   MoO3 evaporation runs. In contrast, vacuum deposited small molecule OSCs
   (sm-OSCs) appear to be unaffected by the history of the MoO3 source
   material. sm-OSCs are instead shown to be prone to large changes in
   efficiency as a function of the delay time in between deposition of the
   MoOx HEL and subsequent photo-active materials. Increased delay time
   between these deposition steps is also demonstrated to decrease the
   sm-OSC photo-stability. The results thus emphasize subtleties in
   materials deposition processes that can play a significant role in
   obtaining reproducible and scientifically relevant data.}},

Abstract = {{The morphodynamics of a highly urbanized gravel-bed watercourse have
   been investigated to evaluate the influence of land-use change
   (hydromodification) on channel bed morphology. In-situ inter-event-based
   particle tracking, utilizing radio frequency identification tags,
   combined with event-based pressure-difference bedload sampling has
   revealed bed material pulsing and capture behind keystones on an
   increased annual frequency. Observations have also noted limited
   longitudinal movement of the coarsest size fractions yet there is an
   increased frequency and decreased spacing interval of intermediate pools
   formed between keystone clusters resulting from bed contraction. Results
   further show that the path lengths of the coarser particles are not
   sensitive to discharge magnitude. The evolving channel morphology in
   this historically riffle-pool dominated channel is emulating a step-pool
   morphology at a lower gradient. The observed channel bed evolution is
   interpreted as an additional mechanism of energy dissipation resulting
   from more frequent competent discharge events observed through these
   systems. The results may be applicable to other hydromodified watersheds
   that exhibit similar hydrologic characteristics, such as reaches
   downstream of hydroelectric facilities where hydropeaking practices are
   undertaken.}},

Abstract = {{The Nortek Vectrino II (TM) (VII) is a commercially-available instrument
   designed for velocity profiling, yet few tests of the instrument
   performance have been published. The objectives here are to: 1)
   demonstrate the new analysis tool called the Multi Instrument Flow
   Turbulence Treatment Toolbox (MIFTTT); 2) detail an Autoregressive
   Moving Average (ARMA) model for spike detection and replacement; and 3)
   describe the influence of seeding material concentration, bin width, and
   sampling volume location on data quality of the VII. MIFTTT helps to
   visualize and standardize data analysis. Wider implementation would
   increase the ease of analysis, training and collaboration. The ARMA
   model effectively detects and replaces data spikes. Grouped errors and
   large scale turbulent fluctuations are handled well by the program.
   Spectral analysis shows that the VII should only be used for turbulence
   characterization where seeding concentration is sufficiently high and
   only within the `sweet spot' - a similar to 0.010 m subregion of the
   overall 0.035 m profiling distance.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanized rivers are heavily impacted by human activities that modify

   a small gravel-bed river (14.5 km(2) drainage area, 12 m width, 1\%
   slope, D-50 = 0.039 m) located in the suburban area of Toronto. Existing
   infrastructures are threatened by incision and lateral migration of the
   channel. In 2012, a 400 m long reach has been restored with a
   riffle-pool design that was assumed to be the most efficient to
   dissipate flow energy. This project investigates the interactions
   between hydrology, sediment transport and morphodynamics to assess the
   stability of the restoration design. We used topographic surveys and
   RFID tracking to assess the sediment mobility and morphodynamics changes
   in unrestored and restored sections. After two bankfull events,
   adjustments of the riffle-pool design consist primarily of local bank
   erosion and local exposure of the underlying glacial till.}},

Abstract = {{This study presented a statistical assessment of the impact of freeze

   Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and other partners
   to evaluate the use of perpetual flexible pavement design in southern
   Ontario, Canada. The test section was constructed on Highway 401, and
   samples from several asphalt mixes used in construction were
   structurally evaluated through dynamic modulus testing shortly after
   construction. The samples were then subjected to freeze thaw cycles and
   retested to evaluate the environmental impact on dynamic modulus
   (vertical bar E{*}vertical bar) as a representative of pavement
   structural deterioration. The dynamic modulus results were used to
   evaluate the benefits obtained by adding 0.8\% of additional binder to
   the regular Superpave (R) (SP) 25 mix to develop an SP 25 rich bottom
   mix (REM). The dynamic modulus results did not show a statistically
   significant difference between the average vertical bar E{*}vertical bar
   of the SP 25 and SP 25 REM after construction. However, the benefits of
   additional binder content showed up clearly after freeze thaw cycles
   simulating 1 year in service. Overall, the study provided guidance on
   perpetual pavement design and the various asphalt layer performances

   Collected by Bluetooth Detectors}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2442}},
Pages = {{117-128}},
Abstract = {{Bluetooth detectors are gaining in popularity as a cost-effective
   technology for acquiring travel time data. The sensors, which identify
   and record the unique media access control address of Bluetooth-enabled
   devices, can measure travel time when a device passes through the
   detection zone of two consecutive Bluetooth detectors. As with other
   automatic vehicle identification technologies (e.g., toll tags,
   automatic license plate recognition systems), there is a time lag
   because the travel time cannot be acquired until the vehicle has passed
   the downstream detector location. The increasing desire for accurate and
   timely traveler information and the desire for proactive traffic control
   present a need for accurate prediction of near-future travel times along
   roadway corridors. A significant body of literature has focused on this
   problem for freeways, but little effort has been directed toward
   signalized arterials. This paper presents a data-driven model for
   predicting near-future travel times on signalized arterials in real time
   by using data acquired from Bluetooth detectors. The model uses the k
   nearest neighbor pattern recognition technique to identify historical
   data from which an understanding of the near-future traffic patterns can
   be extracted. Unlike previous efforts, an objective approach was used to
   determine the variables to include in the k nearest neighbor feature
   vector and the optimal model parameters. The calibrated model was
   evaluated through application to a set of field data obtained from
   Bluetooth detectors deployed on a signalized arterial. The model
   provides performance improvements of approximately 20\% over a benchmark
   model.}},

Title = {{Algorithm for Detecting Outliers in Bluetooth Data in Real Time}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{129-139}},
Abstract = {{Bluetooth detectors are becoming increasingly popular as a technology
   for acquiring travel time data. However, these data include outliers
   that are caused by several factors, and a robust outlier detection
   algorithm is needed for filtering out the outliers. Arterial roadways
   present a particularly challenging environment because the traffic
   control devices introduce a large amount of variability to the measured
   individual travel times and because of the prevalence of other sources
   of error (e.g., en route stops, Bluetooth-enabled devices not in
   vehicles). This paper presents a new adaptive outlier detection
   algorithm that is proactive rather than reactive. Unlike conventional
   reactive algorithms that rely solely on recent data, the proposed
   algorithm uses both historical data and current data to predict the
   validity window. The performance characteristics of the proposed
   algorithm are illustrated, and field data from a signalized arterial are
   used to compare the proposed algorithm and a benchmark algorithm. The
   results show that the proposed model is superior to the benchmark model
   and that the model performs well across a wide range of traffic
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors investigate the potentials of an aggregated
   cooperative intelligent approach to optimise the size of components of a
   plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain. The intelligent model
   consists of a set of modular local neuro-fuzzy radial basis identifiers.
   These intelligent tools are finally incorporated to develop a global
   identifier called ensemble neuro-fuzzy radial basis network (ENFRBN).
   The resulted global identifier synchronously uses the local maps to
   predict the fuel consumption (FC) rate of a PHEV for a specific drive
   cycle. To do so, an experimental/simulative sampling process was
   performed in smart hybrid and electric vehicle system laboratory at the
   University of Waterloo to create a database including a set of
   input/output pairs. After extracting knowledge from prepared database,
   the authors use two well-known bee-inspired heuristic algorithms, i.e.,
   bee algorithm (BA) and artificial bee colony (ABC) to reach a compromise
   on optimal size of PHEV components.}},

Title = {{Nanoconcrete for Rigid Pavements Abrasion Response and Impact on
   Friction}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2441}},
Pages = {{28-37}},
Abstract = {{Abrasion resistance in concrete is related to the ability of the surface
   to resist being worn away by rubbing and friction. High-quality concrete
   is recognized as enhancing both abrasion and macrotexture durability
   under traffic loading. Pavement friction is the result of two primary
   frictional force components: adhesion and hysteresis. Adhesion is
   dependent on the microtexture of the surface, while hysteresis depends
   on its macrotexture; both microtexture and macrotexture significantly
   affect friction. Macrotexture is also significant in preventing
   hydroplaning because of its effect on the surface drainage of pavements.
   Improving the texture durability of concrete may provide important
   benefits in delivering long-term friction performance. A microtexture
   modification with nanotechnology improves the friction response in rigid
   pavements and enhances the durability of concrete materials by how it
   affects the deterioration mechanism at the molecular level.
   Nanomaterials can improve the calcium silicate hydrate component in
   hardened concrete; this action is crucial to enhancing the strength and
   durability of the cement paste. Therefore, applications using
   nanotechnology in concrete materials are receiving increased attention.
   This paper presents the results of a study in which several concrete
   samples were produced with different proportions of nanosilica. The
   results show that nanosilica enhances the compressive strength and
   abrasion resistance in concrete materials. Because of the relationship
   between abrasion response and macrotexture, it can be concluded that
   nanomaterials increase macrotexture durability and therefore improve the
   safety of concrete pavements in wet conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Power efficiency has been one of the main objectives of hardware design
   in the last two decades. However, with the recent explosion of mobile
   computing and the increasing demand for green data centers, software
   power efficiency has also risen to be an equally important factor. We
   argue that most classic concurrency control algorithms were designed in
   an era when power efficiency was not an important dimension in algorithm
   design. Such algorithms are applied to solve a wide range of problems
   from kernel-level primitives in operating systems to networking devices
   and web services. These primitives and services are constantly and
   heavily invoked in any computer system and by larger scale in networking
   devices and data centers. Thus, even a small change in their power
   spectrum can make a huge impact on overall power consumption in long
   periods of time.
   This paper focuses on the classic producer-consumer problem. First, we
   study the power efficiency of different existing implementations of the
   producer-consumer problem. In particular, we present evidence that these
   implementations behave drastically differently with respect to power
   consumption. Secondly, we present a dynamic algorithm for the multiple
   producer-consumer problem, where consumers in a multicore system use
   learning mechanisms to predict the rate of production, and effectively
   utilize this prediction to attempt to latch onto previously scheduled
   CPU wake-ups. Such group latching results in minimizing the overall
   number of CPU wakeups and in effect, power consumption. We enable
   consumers to dynamically reserve more preallocated memory in cases where
   the production rate is too high. Consumers may compete for the extra
   space and dynamically release it when it is no longer needed. Our
   experiments show that our algorithm provides up to 40\% decrease in the
   number of CPU wakeups, and 30\% decrease in power consumption. We
   validate the scalability of our algorithm with an increasing number of
   consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Bowling refers to a series of sports in which a player rolls a spherical
   ``bowling ball{''} towards a set of vertical targets or ``pins{''};
   where the objective is to knock down as many pins as possible, Werner
   (1995). In indoor bowling the game is played on a flat wooden or
   synthetic surface. To increase the probability of hitting the maximum
   number of pins, players often impart an initial spin that makes the ball
   curve and hit the target at an angle. For a right-handed player, the
   usual curve goes from right to left and is known as a ``hook shot{''}.
   In this paper, a volumetric contact model has been used to simulate the
   ``hook shot{''} by modeling the interaction between the ball and the
   lane. The principal objective is to study the effectiveness of the
   modeling framework towards the study of the effects of the lane friction
   and the initial kinematic conditions on the trajectory of the shot. The
   construction of the core of the ball and the variation of its radii of
   gyration will also be investigated for their contributions towards the
   ``hook{''}. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an easy-to-use model to assist in technology
   selection for transit planning. The model computes annual costs for two
   technologies-currently BRT and LRT-for a system with characteristics
   specified by the user and from ``real-world{''} operating data. The
   model computes the annualized capital and operating costs over a wide
   range of demand; it also calculates location-specific, energy-related
   emissions for both technologies' operations. Most importantly, the model
   allows the user to test the sensitivity of the technology selection
   result to nearly all inputs. The model is applied to a recent case in
   Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, to verify its functionality. The results show
   that, economically, these two technologies result in very similar annual
   costs for ``normal{''} demand levels. As a result, small changes in
   assumed input values for period of evaluation, interest rates, labor
   costs, and infrastructure costs can result in a change in recommended
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we develop a benchmark network model for vessel
   surveillance video uploading via a maritime wideband communication
   network. A broadband wireless network utilizing Time Division Multiple
   Access (TDMA) based media access control (MAC) protocol is exploited to
   provide a shore-side network framework, while the
   store-carry-and-forward routing scheme is adopted to mitigate the
   intermittent network connectivity in maritime communication scenarios.
   We are concerned about transmitting more important video packets to the
   administrative authority (i.e., TMP), based on the interpretation of
   throughput as the summation of weights of delivered video packets. Two
   offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, based on time-capacity
   mapping approach to convert the original time-based non-continuous
   resource allocation problem to a capacity-based continuous problem. As a
   retreat when optimal algorithm is out of reach, it is mathematically
   proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation ratio of 2, and a
   time complexity of O(n(2)). Simulation results validate the proposed
   algorithms, by obtaining the real ship route traces from navigation
   software BLM-Shipping.}},

Abstract = {{The advances of green wireless networks have brought an alternative
   energy for maritime wideband networks, which could significantly reduce
   the expense of maritime wideband networks construction and maintenance.
   In Chap. 3, the framework for vessel surveillance video uploading is
   developed. However, it has not considered the energy issues in the
   network scenario, i.e., both energy charging and discharging processes
   are not considered, and thus it is not applicable to the
   green-energy-powered maritime wireless networks. With the emerging green
   energy, such as solar, wind and hydro, etc, it is possible to
   cost-effectively construct green-energy-powered maritime wireless
   networks, which can render significant benefits in terms of both energy
   supplement and cost consumption. However, green energy is dynamic and
   sometimes even intermittent, which shifts the fundamental design
   criterion of maritime wideband communication networks from energy
   efficiency to energy sustainability. The video transmission scheduling
   issues considering network throughput and energy sustainability of
   green-energy-powered maritime wideband communication networks will be
   investigated in this chapter, by modeling the energy buffer of
   infostations and DTN throw box as a G/G/1 queue.}},

   the retinal images based on a novel patch filtering approach. The patch
   filtering has been performed sequentially based on clustering in two
   stages. In the first stage, the patches are selected exploiting an
   `isotropic' measure based on the ratio of maximum and minimum
   eigenvalues of the moment matrix representing the structure tensor. In
   the second stage, the patch filtering is based on the saliency measure.
   Finally, the optic disk is located from the centroids of the selected
   patches. Promising results are obtained for the low-contrast
   pathological retinal images using STARE database providing high
   localization accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{We examine two approaches of modifying L-2-based approximations so that
   they conform to Weber's model of perception, i.e., higher/lower
   tolerance of deviation for higher/lower intensity levels. The first
   approach involves the idea of intensity-weighted L-2 distances. We
   arrive at a natural weighting function that is shown to conform to
   Weber's model. The resulting ``Weberized L-2 distance{''} involves a
   ratio of functions. The importance of ratios in such distance functions
   leads to a consideration of the well-known logarithmic L-2 distance
   which is also shown to conform to Weber's model.
   In fact, we show that the imposition of a condition of perceptual
   invariance in greyscale space R-g subset of R according to Weber's model
   leads to the unique (unnormalized) measure in R-g with density function
   rho(t) = 1/t. This result implies that the logarithmic L-1 distance is
   the most natural ``Weberized{''} image metric. From this result, all
   other logarithmic L-p distances may be viewed as generalizations.}},

Abstract = {{The corruption of hyperspectral images by noise can compromise tasks
   such as classification, target detection and material mapping. For this
   reason, many methods have been proposed to recover, as best as possible,
   the uncorrupted hyperspectral data from a given noisy observation. In
   this paper, we propose and compare the results of four denoising methods
   which differ in the way the hyperspectral data is treated: (i) as 3D
   data sets, (ii) as collections of frequency bands and (iii) as
   collections of spectral functions. In the case of additive noise, these
   methods can be easily adapted to accommodate different degradation
   models. Our methods and results help to address the question of how
   hyperspectral data sets should be processed in order to obtain useful
   denoising results.}},

Abstract = {{Driver distraction and fatigue are considered the main cause of most car
   accidents today. This paper compares the performance of Random Forest
   and a number of other well-known classifiers for driver distraction
   detection and recognition problems. A non-intrusive system, which
   consists of hardware components for capturing the driver's driving
   sessions on a car simulator, using infrared and Kinect cameras, combined
   with a software component for monitoring some visual behaviors that
   reflect a driver's level of distraction, was used in this work.
   In this system, five visual cues were calculated: arm position, eye
   closure, eye gaze, facial expressions, and orientation. These cues were
   then fed into a classifier, such as AdaBoost, Hidden Markov Models,
   Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Conditional Random Field, or
   Neural Network, in order to detect and recognize the type of
   distraction. The use of various cues resulted in a more robust and
   accurate detection and classification of distraction, than using only
   one. The system was tested with various sequences recorded from
   different users. Experimental results were very promising, and show the
   superiority of the Random Forest classifier compared to the other
   classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{With the increased emphasis on sustainable transportation, advancements
   are necessary in the technical methods used in the planning and
   engineering of investments for nonmotorized modes. This paper used GPS
   data on cyclists' activities to estimate a utility or generalized-cost
   function that reflects cyclists' evaluation of path alternatives. For
   724 cycling trips, path attributes were compiled of the observed cycling
   path to four feasible but not-chosen alternatives. With two logit
   formulations, the relative importance of statistically significant path
   parameters-length, auto speed, grade, and the presence (or absence) of
   bike lanes-was estimated. Then the predictive powers of the models were
   tested on 181 trips that were observed in the same data set but were not
   used to calibrate the model. In the best case, this model correctly
   predicted the actual path for 65\% of these trips; for an additional
   13\% of trips, the difference in probabilities of selecting the best
   alternative path and the actual path was less than 5\%. These results
   were interpreted to mean that relatively robust path choice (and
   ultimately mode choice) models may be generated and included in enhanced
   multimodal travel forecasting models.}},

Abstract = {{N-4-chelate macrocycles comprise the foundation for non-precious metal
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst research, where the main
   electrochemical process occurs in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM)
   fuel cells. Although iron-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) complexes are known to
   be the most active non-precious ORR catalysts to date, a fundamental
   understanding of the ORR mechanisms of these materials is still in its
   nascent stage and needs further investigation. In this work, ab initio
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been applied to unveil
   the underlying principles for the electrocatalytic activity and
   structural stability of Fe-N-4 chelates exposed to acidic media.
   Therefore, we compared the electronic structures of ferrous
   phthalocyanine (Fe-Pc) and an in-house developed Fe-Pc modified with
   diphenylphenthioether substituent species (Fe-SPc). The results of these
   DFT simulations directly correlate with the results of the half-cell ORR
   activity and stability electrochemical testing in 0.1 M HClO4. The
   results indicate that the relative energetic position of the
   d(z2)-orbital with respect to the Fermi level can induce an Fe redox
   couple potential shift and modulate the catalytic activity towards the
   ORR. Furthermore, our combined DFT calculations and empirical
   observations highlight that the relative position of the d(z2)-orbital
   can be controlled by the incorporation of functional groups, resulting
   in the ability to tune the ORR activity of these complexes. Structural
   stability of the materials, as predicted by the DFT-calculated cohesive
   energies of Fe and FeO, can also be readily tuned by modulating Fe-Pc
   with the substituent species. This study, coupling rigorous experimental
   observations with DFT investigations, thereby provides a fundamental
   insight that can aid in the design of future generations of non-precious
   ORR catalysts with improved activity and stability.}},

Abstract = {{One of the strategies used to improve performance and increase the
   life-span of wind turbines is active flow control. It involves the
   modification of the aerodynamic characteristics of a wind turbine blade
   by means of moveable aerodynamic control surfaces. Trailing edge flaps
   are relatively small moveable control surfaces placed at the trailing
   edge of a blade's airfoil that modify the lift of a blade or airfoil
   section. An instrumented wind turbine test rig and rotor were
   specifically developed to enable a wide-range of experiments to
   investigate the potential of trailing edge flaps as an active control
   technique. A modular blade based on the S833 airfoil was designed to
   allow accurate instrumentation and customizable settings. The blade is
   1.7 meters long, had a constant 178mm chord and a 6 degrees pitch. The
   modular aerodynamic parts were 3D printed using plastic PC-ABS material.
   The blade design point was within the range of wind velocities in the
   available large test facility. The wind facility is a large open jet
   wind tunnel with a maximum velocity of 11m/s in the test area. The
   capability of the developed system was demonstrated through an initial
   study of the effect of stationary trailing edge flaps on blade load and
   performance. The investigation focused on measuring the changes in
   flapwise bending moment and power production for different trailing edge
   flap spanwise locations and deflection angles. The relationship between
   the load reduction and deflection angle was linear as expected from
   theory and the highest reduction was caused by the flap furthest from
   the rotor center. Overall, the experimental setup proved to be effective
   in measuring small changes in flapwise bending moment within the wind
   turbine blade and will provide insight when (active) flap control is
   targeted.}},

Abstract = {{Tuft flow visualisation has been used to study aerodynamic stall on wind
   turbine blades for several decades. In recent years, advances in the
   processing power of personal computers have made digital image
   processing vastly more accessible. In this paper, therefore, a novel
   method is presented to digitally analyse tuft flow visualisation on the
   blade of an operating wind turbine. Examination of the outboard 40\% of
   the blade of a 10 m diameter wind turbine revealed stalled flow in wind
   speeds from 5 m/s to 20 m/s. The region of stall at those speeds
   increased from 5\% to 40\% of the coverage area of the tufts. This
   increase in the amount of stalled flow is expected for stall-regulated
   wind turbines. Overall, the results are very promising and demonstrate
   potential for a wide range of aerodynamics applications including
   real-time blade stall determination and classical wind tunnel
   aerodynamics studies.}},

Abstract = {{High quality, controlled-structure nanowires (NWs), grown on a
   transparent flexible substrate, have attracted great interest as a mean
   of harvesting solar and mechanical energy. Clarifying their optical and
   piezoelectric properties is essential for this application. In this
   paper, vertically aligned lithium (Li) doped p-type ZnO NWs were grown,
   on a micro-patterned transparent flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)
   substrate, by electrochemical deposition at 88 degrees C. The substrate
   was coated with aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) thin layer, which served as a
   good seed layer and a transparent conductive oxide layer. Varying the
   seed layer thickness gave control of the individual NWs' diameter,
   density and alignment. The effect of doping on the optical band-gap,
   crystalline quality and Schottky barrier were investigated by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and piezoelectric characterization. The
   piezoelectric polarization induced piezo-potential in strained ZnO NWs
   can drive the flow of electrons without an applied electric bias, thus
   can be used to harvest mechanical energy and convert it into
   electricity. To prove this concept, flexible piezoelectric energy
   harvesters based on an array of ZnO NWs were fabricated. Results show
   that the patterned p-type NW-based energy harvester produces 26-fold
   output voltage and 19-fold current compared to the conventional un-doped
   ZnO NW energy harvester from the same acceleration input.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling is a major challenge for low-pressure membrane drinking water
   treatment systems. Previous research has demonstrated that under the
   right conditions, biofiltration is an effective method to reduce fouling
   of low-pressure polymeric membranes. This study provides additional
   insight into the effect of biofiltration as a pretreatment for fouling
   reduction by using river water with different raw water quality
   characteristics than has been examined in previous studies. Two parallel
   pilot-scale dual media (sand/anthracite) biological filters were
   operated continuously over a period of 14 months. Liquid
   chromatography-organic carbon detection analysis confirmed that the
   parallel biofilters performed similarly with both averaging on 21\%
   biopolymer removal. Raw and treated water biopolymer concentrations were
   correlated, with increased absolute removals occurring at higher raw
   water concentrations. Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling experiments
   showed substantial improvement in performance following biofiltration
   pretreatment by reducing hydraulically irreversible and reversible
   fouling rates by 14-68\% and 8-55\%, respectively. The results also
   reaffirm the importance of biopolymers at concentrations as low as
   similar to 0.1 mg/L on irreversible and reversible UF membrane fouling
   and a minimal impact of humic substances.}},

Abstract = {{A method is proposed to predict the state of traffic for the near
   future. Traffic conditions are assumed to follow a stochastic process. A
   Markov model is developed to characterize the transition between traffic
   states. Unlike previous models in the literature, the state transition
   probability matrix is assumed to be a function of traffic variables;
   therefore, the proposed Markov model considers time-varying covariates.
   The base transition matrix and the effect of each covariate are
   calibrated to a data set for an urban expressway in Toronto, Ontario,
   Canada, by using maximum likelihood estimation. Using the transition
   probabilities of the Markov model, the proposed procedure constructs the
   empirical distribution of travel speed. The procedure, which can be
   applied in real time, uses both the empirical distribution of travel
   speed for different traffic conditions and the predicted transition
   matrix for the near future. Therefore, the proposed method enables the
   prediction of both the expected speed value and its distribution for the
   near future. Finally, a procedure is proposed to improve the prediction
   results of any travel time prediction method. This procedure uses a
   short-memory time series model by incorporating the predicted transition
   probabilities of the proposed Markov model. An evaluation using field
   data demonstrates this improvement for a simple time series model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study three scenarios of smallcell deployment in a
   heterogeneous network comprising a macro base station (MBS) and a set of
   small cells. The first scenario corresponds to wired backhauling and the
   remaining two scenarios correspond to two different ways of wireless
   backhauling. In one of the scenarios of wireless backhauling, the
   backhaul links have to compete with the user links for LTE channel
   resources (user-band relay scenario). In the other, an additional
   (mmWave) band is available exclusively for operating the backhaul links
   (dedicated-band relay scenario). For each of the scenarios, several
   different configurations based on channel allocation and node
   capabilities are considered. We formulate an optimization framework to
   model, dimension and evaluate all of these configurations. For user-band
   relay scenario, our results show that some configurations offer either
   negative or negligible throughput gains over the MBS-only case. By
   noting that any relay deployment's performance is upper-bounded by wired
   backhauling with sufficiently large capacity, the results also show that
   some other configurations offer very good throughput gains, with values
   very close to the upper-bound. The results highlight the importance of
   the right choice of configuration to justify the deployment of user-band
   relay nodes. Further, our results show that, for dedicated-band relay
   scenario, a small fraction of a typical mmWave bandwidth suffices to
   yield performance very close to the upper-bound.}},

Abstract = {{Point-of-use (POU) and point-of-entry (POE) devices are, in some
   situations, considered to be a viable solution for drinking water
   suppliers and consumers alike to deal with site specific drinking water
   issues. This paper introduces a newly developed decision support system
   (DSS) that employs decision making techniques to select among the
   various devices based on their characterization and sustainability
   assessment. Careful illustration of the various aspects and components
   of the DSS is provided and the decision process is explained. Aspects of
   validity, usability and sensitivity analysis are demonstrated through a
   hypothetical case study for removing lead introduced in the distribution
   system of municipally treated drinking water. The output of the DSS
   helps to determine the more sustainable treatment devices which should
   have positive implications for the application of POU and POE devices.
   Other potential uses of the DSS are described to illustrate its
   versatility and usefulness. The DSS is not intended to replace common
   engineering practice in selecting POU and POE treatment systems, but
   rather to give support to the users by providing the necessary
   information about all possible solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Rising concerns about the efficiency, reliability, economics, and
   sustainability in electricity production and distribution have been
   driving an evolution of the traditional electric power grid toward smart
   grid. A key enabler of the smart grid is the two-way communications
   throughout the power system, based on which an advanced information
   system can make optimal decisions on power system operation. Due to the
   expected deep penetration of renewable energy sources, energy storage
   devices, demand side management (DSM) tools, and electric vehicles (EVs)
   in the future smart grid, there exist significant technical challenges
   on power system planning and operation. Specifically, efficient
   stochastic information management schemes should be developed to address
   the randomness in renewable power generation, buffering effect of energy
   storage devices, consumer behavior patterns in the context of DSM, and
   high mobility of EVs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
   literature survey on the stochastic information management schemes for
   the smart grid. We start this survey with an introduction to the smart
   grid system architecture and the technical challenges in information
   management. Various component-level modeling techniques are presented to
   characterize the sources of randomness in the smart grid. Built upon the
   component-level models, we further explore the system-level stochastic
   information management schemes for smart grid planning and operation.
   Future research directions and open research issues are identified.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{8651-8661}},
Abstract = {{Rapidly growing research interest in the field of printed electronics,
   especially polymer-based organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and
   organic photovoltaics (OPVs), stems from the dramatically improved
   performance of these devices, which become competitive to the amorphous
   silicon-based counterparts. The performance enhancement of polymer OTFTs
   and OPVs is largely attributed to the progress made in the development
   of polymer semiconductor materials. Therefore exploration of new
   building blocks for developing high-performance polymer semiconductors
   has been an area of extensive research. This article provides an
   overview of new building blocks including 21 electron acceptors and 20
   electron donors, which were developed over the past three years for
   constructing pi-conjugated polymers, particularly donor-acceptor (D-A)
   type polymers. Polymers containing these building blocks have shown very
   promising performance as active semiconductors in OTFTs and OPVs.
   Rationales for the structural design and the device performance of the
   polymers based on these new building blocks are discussed.}},

Journal = {{CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{302-317}},
Abstract = {{Although the polarisation of the light was discovered at the beginning
   of the nineteenth century, the Vikings could have used the polarised
   light around the tenth century in their navigation to America, using a
   `sunstone' evoked in the Icelandic Sagas. Indeed, the birefringence of
   the Iceland spar (calcite), a common crystal in Scandinavia, permits a
   simple observation of the axis of polarisation of the skylight at the
   zenith. From this, it is possible to guess the azimuth of a hidden Sun
   below the horizon, for instance. The high sensitivity of the
   differential method provided by the ordinary and extraordinary beams of
   calcite at its so-called isotropy point is about two orders higher than
   that of the best dichroic polariser and permits to reach an accuracy of
   +/- 1 degrees for the Sun azimuth (at sunrise and sunset).
   Unfortunately, due to the relative fragility of calcite, only the
   so-called Alderney crystal was discovered on board a 16th ancient ship.
   Curiously, beyond its use as a sunstone by the Vikings, during these
   last millennia calcite has led to the discovery of the polarisation of
   the light itself by Malus and is currently being used to detect the
   atmospheres of exoplanets. Moreover, the differential method for the
   light polarisation detection is widely used in the animal world.}},

   allowing for accurate relative pose estimation, even in the presence of

   the body-fixed inertial frame so that noisy measurements from the GPS
   and magnetometer sensors do not degrade the relative estimation

   presented, as well as experimental results of visual landing pad
   tracking for representative motions, which demonstrate the validity of
   the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Superpixels are a compact and simple representation of images that has
   been used for many computer vision applications such as object
   localization, segmentation and depth estimation. While useful as compact
   representations of images, the time complexity of superpixel algorithms
   has prevented their use in real-time applications like video processing.
   Fast superpixel algorithms have been proposed recently but they lack
   regular structure or required accuracy for representing image structure.
   We present Grid Seams, a novel seam carving approach to superpixel
   generation that preserves image structure information while enforcing a
   global spatial constraint in the form of a grid structure cost. Using a
   standard dataset, we show that our approach is faster than existing
   approaches and can achieve accuracies close to a state-of-the-art
   superpixel generation algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic global optimization
   approach whose search characteristics are controlled by three
   parameters; inertial weight w, cognitive parameter c(1) and social
   parameter c(2). Large parameter values facilitate exploration by
   searching new horizons of solution space. On the other hand, small
   parameter values facilitate exploitation by searching the neighborhood.
   An appropriate value of these parameters provides a balance between
   exploration and exploitation and results in better performance. An
   adaptive parameter PSO (AP-PSO) algorithm is proposed in this work where
   the inertial weight is gradually decreased and values of the cognitive
   and social parameters depend on the fitness values. Good fitness values
   support exploitation and poor fitness values support exploration. The
   proposed algorithm has shown excellent performance on low dimensional
   system identification problems as well as high dimensional articulated
   human tracking (AHT) problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, an effective blind source separation (BSS) algorithm is
   applied to solve the co-channel interference problem in wireless
   communication systems. Algorithms developed for this purpose must not
   only have the capability of working in the complex domain and improving
   output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), but also have
   relatively low computational complexity. We propose a fast Fourier
   transform (FFT)-based algorithm called feedback independent component
   analysis (FebICA) that is able to blindly separate complex modulated
   digital signals. By applying this algorithm to communication signals, it
   is observed that it has the advantages of SINR gain improvement as well
   as low computational complexity. The performance of the FebICA algorithm
   is shown to be better than the joint approximate diagonalization of
   eigen-matrices (JADE) algorithm in terms of the output SINR and requires
   lower computational complexity than the analytical constant modulus
   algorithm (ACMA). The algorithm is also shown to be more robust with
   increasing number of sources compared to other algorithms. The
   separation performance by using the collected field data has also been
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, azothiazole, namely (E)-1,2-di(thiazol-2-yl) diazene, is
   used as a building block to construct pi-conjugated polymer
   semiconductors. It is found that azothiazole is a strong electron
   withdrawing moiety and suitable as an electron acceptor unit to form
   donor-acceptor (D-A) polymers. Two D-A polymers comprising azothiazole
   as the acceptor and bithiophene and thieno{[}3,2-b] thiophene as the
   donors, respectively, are synthesized. These polymers have small band
   gaps (similar to 1.2-1.3 eV) and low energy levels. When being used as
   channel semiconductors in organic thin film transistors, they show
   promising p-channel field effect transistor performance with hole
   mobility as high as 0.019 cm(2) V-1 s(-1).}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{68}},
Pages = {{35833-35843}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study on the development of TiO2 nanostructures during
   anodization in fluoride-ion containing electrolyte has been conducted.
   The evolution of this nanostructure involves the inward growth of a
   porous network at the oxide/substrate interface that develops into
   nanotubes. A new explanation for the formation of these nanotubes during
   anodization is proposed based on the geometric changes observed. SEM
   examination reveals that the newer formed portions of the pore space
   closest to the oxide/substrate interface are larger in diameter than
   those above which form earlier in the process. This yields a structure
   in which pores are wider at their bases than at the outer
   oxide/electrolyte interface and appear to crowd each other in the lower
   portions as anodization proceeds. Further SEM evidence suggests that
   excessive crowding eventually causes some pores to degenerate into
   inter-tube regions and leave behind distinct nanotubes. We propose that
   this degeneration process is the main driving force for the structural
   transformations from the initial oxide layer to a network of nanopores
   and finally to fully developed nanotubes rather than a separate
   dehydration or dissolution process as proposed by other researchers. The
   differences in morphology between anodic TiO2 films formed in aqueous
   and ethylene glycol-based electrolytes are explained using the same
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio is a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity versus
   underutilization dilemma, which enables unlicensed users to
   opportunistically use the unused spectrum owned by licensed users to
   increase the spectrum utilization. To avoid interfering with the
   operation of licensed users, unlicensed users perform spectrum sensing
   before transmission to detect the available channels. However, the
   outcome of spectrum sensing may be inaccurate due to fading or
   shadowing. To overcome this problem, cooperation has been leveraged in
   cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this chapter, we first give a brief
   introduction to CRNs, including fundamentals of cognitive radio,
   spectrum sensing, and cooperation in CRNs.}},

   cooperation involves a PU selecting the most suitable secondary user
   (SU) to relay its message and giving the selected SU spectrum access
   right as a reward, taking the trustworthiness of SUs into consideration.
   While the SU, being starved for transmission opportunities, chooses a
   suitable power level for cooperation and its own transmission. The
   proposed cooperative strategy, including partner selection, time slot
   allocation and power allocation in an unfriendly environment, are
   analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that, with the proposed scheme,
   the PU can achieve higher throughput or energy saving through
   cooperation with the trustworthy SU.}},

Title = {{Effect of driving experience on collision avoidance braking: an
   experimental investigation and computational modelling}},

Abstract = {{Information technologies have been developed to facilitate driving
   performance and improve safety. However, there is a lack of
   computational methods that can take into account drivers' adaptation to
   driving. That is, how behaviour changes with experience. Modelling the
   effect of driving experience on driver behaviour is important to the
   development of in-vehicle information technologies, because drivers at
   different skill levels may need different types or levels of assistance.
   Cognitive-architecture-based human performance modelling is a valuable
   method that can integrate different cognitive aspects underlying human
   behaviour such as skill levels and support quantitative simulation of
   behaviour. The study reported in this paper tested and examined
   computational models built in ACT-R (Adaptive Control of
   Thought-Rational) to account for the effect of driving experience on
   collision avoidance braking behaviour. The modelling results were
   compared with human data collected from a simulated driving experiment.
   The models produced braking behavioural results similar to the human
   results. Moreover, model predictions of three other emergent-braking
   scenarios were generally similar to and in the same order with the
   empirical results reported in previous studies. Future research can
   further integrate the method and results into intelligent driver
   assistance systems such as collision warning systems to better adjust
   the systems to the need of different drivers with different skill
   levels.}},

Title = {{A KPCA texture feature model for efficient segmentation of RADARSAT-2
   SAR sea ice imagery}},

Abstract = {{Sea ice information obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images
   is crucial for ensuring safe marine navigation and supporting climate
   change studies in polar regions. We propose a kernel principal component
   analysis (KPCA) local texture feature model for efficient sea ice
   segmentation. The proposed KPCA texture feature model is significant for
   several reasons. First, it takes into account the multiplicative nature
   of SAR speckle noise. The resulting KPCA features therefore assume
   independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian-like noise,
   which satisfies the assumptions inherent in classical statistical models
   such as the k-means algorithm. Second, the KPCA features are compact and
   statistically independent and therefore capable of reducing data
   redundancy. Third, the KPCA texture features are discriminative.
   Finally, the extraction of KPCA features requires less computation.
   Based on the KPCA model, a segmentation scheme is implemented in four
   steps. First, local patch-based texture descriptors are extracted from
   the image. Second, KPCA is performed on the patch-based texture
   descriptors to obtain compact and discriminative texture features with
   Gaussian-like noise characteristics. Third, the k-means algorithm is
   performed on extracted KPCA features to segment the image. Finally, a
   neighbourhood-based majority voting scheme is employed to determine the
   final label of each pixel. We compared the proposed method with several
   other popular sea ice segmentation approaches. The results demonstrated
   that our method is robust to speckle noise level, is accurate and fast
   and may thus better support the operational segmentation of sea ice in
   SAR imagery.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity scaling law of wireless networks has been considered as one

   comprehensive overview of the development in the area of scaling laws

   background information on the notion of throughput capacity of random
   networks. Based on the benchmark random network model, we then elaborate
   the advanced strategies adopted to improve the throughput capacity, and
   other factors that affect the scaling laws. We also present the
   fundamental tradeoffs between throughput capacity and delay under a
   variety of mobility models. In addition, the capacity and delay for
   hybrid wireless networks are surveyed, in which there are at least two
   types of nodes functioning differently, e.g., normal nodes and
   infrastructure nodes. Finally, recent studies on scaling law for
   throughput capacity and delay in emerging vehicular networks are
   introduced.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate organic imaging sensor arrays fabricated on flexible
   plastic foil with the solution processing route for both photodiodes and
   thin film transistors. We used the photovoltaic P3HT:PCBM blend for
   fabricating the photodiodes using spin coating and pentacene as
   semiconductor material for the TFTs. Photodiodes fabricated with P3HT:
   PCBM absorb in the green part of the visible spectrum which matches with
   the typical scintillator output wavelength. The arrays consist of 32x32
   pixels with variation in pixel resolution of 200 mu mx200 mu m, 300 mu
   mx300 mu m and of 1mmx1mm. The accurate reproducibility of shadow images
   of the objects demonstrates the potential of these arrays for imaging
   purposes. We also demonstrate that the crosstalk is relatively
   insignificant despite the fact that the active photodiode forms a
   continuous layer in the array. Since both photodiodes and TFTs are made
   of organic material, they are processed at low temperatures below 150
   degrees C on foil which means that these imaging sensors can be
   flexible, light weight and low cost when compared to conventional
   amorphous silicon based imaging sensors on rigid substrates. In
   combination with a scintillator on top of the arrays, we show the
   potential of these arrays for the X-ray imaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) improves upon more
   traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in its ability to resolve the
   orientations of crossing and branching neural fibre tracts. The HARDI
   signals are measured over a spherical shell in q-space, and are usually
   used as an input to q-ball imaging (QBI) which allows estimation of the
   diffusion orientation distribution functions (ODFs) associated with a
   given region-of-interest. Unfortunately, the partial nature of
   single-shell sampling imposes limits on the estimation accuracy. As a
   result, the recovered ODFs may not possess sufficient resolution to
   reveal the orientations of fibre tracts which cross each other at acute
   angles. A possible solution to the problem of limited resolution of QBI
   is provided by means of spherical deconvolution, a particular instance
   of which is sparse deconvolution. However, while capable of yielding
   high-resolution reconstructions over spacial locations corresponding to
   white matter, such methods tend to become unstable when applied to
   anatomical regions with a substantial content of isotropic diffusion. To
   resolve this problem, a new deconvolution approach is proposed in this
   paper. Apart from being uniformly stable across the whole brain, the
   proposed method allows one to quantify the isotropic component of
   cerebral diffusion, which is known to be a useful diagnostic measure by
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the interaction between a human head exposed to a
   bluetooth-based cellular headset in different positions is studied. The
   exposure to the electromagnetic fields is a concern when people use
   these devices. The interaction of human head and bluetooth mobile
   headsets has not been considered in related standards. In this research
   three installed positions for the headset and two scenarios for the user
   are defined. In the first scenario the user is in free space and in the
   second scenario the user is in a car. For both scenarios path loss,
   antenna gain, total isotropic sensitivity, and specific absorption rate
   values for three positions of the headset on the head are obtained.
   SEMCAD X software is used as an FDTD-based simulation platform for our
   numerical studies. The result of our study can help manufacturers to
   consider the compatibility of these devices with safety guidelines of
   electromagnetic exposure specified by relevant institutes. Designers of
   wireless devices can use results of this study to design new headsets
   that can be used in an appropriate position while the performance of the
   device is less affected by the human head and the environment.}},

Abstract = {{An improved folded dipole is employed to realize broadband
   dual-polarization microwave absorber. To further widen the bandwidth,
   different kinds of lattice cells are considered in the array. It is

   relative bandwidth of the absorber surface consisting of triangle cells
   can reach up to a bandwidth of 112.1\% with frequency ratio 3.55 and
   thickness of 0.22 lambda(0). The sensitivity to the oblique incidence
   has been decreased and can be well kept with reflection of -10 dB within

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Gear shifting strategy of vehicle is important aid for the acquisition
   of dynamic performance and high economy. A dynamic programming (DP)
   algorithm is used to optimize the gear shifting schedule for off-road
   vehicle by using an objective function that weighs fuel use and trip
   time. The optimization is accomplished through discrete dynamic
   programming and a trade-off between trip time and fuel consumption is
   analyzed. By using concave and convex surface road as road profile, an
   optimal gear shifting strategy is used to control the longitudinal
   behavior of the vehicle. Simulation results show that the trip time can
   be reduced by powerful gear shifting strategy and fuel consumption can
   achieve high economy with economical gear shifting strategy in different
   initial conditions and route cases.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1673-1692}},
Abstract = {{A low cost, quasi real-time elastography system, displacement-gradient
   elastography (DGE), was developed by applying digital image correlation
   (DIC) method and smoothing algorithm to B-mode ultrasound images. In
   order to achieve quasi real-time elastogram display, a new fast pattern
   matching algorithm, decoupled cross-correlation (DCC), was proposed and
   validated. By applying the DGE to various phantoms, elastograms were
   generated to identify the lesion with wide variations of stiffness ratio
   and applied strain. The performance of DGE was qualitatively compared
   with those from a high-end ultrasound scanner using the elastograms of a
   commercial elastography breast phantom. DGE was also applied to the
   ultrasound images of human breast lesions in various BI-RADS categories.
   This study suggests that DGE may have comparable performance to
   conventional elastography in detecting breast cancer, while it can be
   easily implemented onto conventional ultrasound scanners.}},

Abstract = {{Hand-held scanners are required for the three-dimensional (3D) surface
   measurement of immobile objects and those difficult to access by
   conventional range-scanners. Existing hand-held scanners require
   secondary lighting, a tracking system, or surface markers to track the
   position and orientation of the range-sensor. Secondary lighting and
   tracking systems are bulky, limit the portability and ability to scan in
   confined spaces, and add cost to the system. This paper presents a
   hand-held 3D scanner that eliminates the above drawbacks. Multiple
   planes of light are simultaneously projected onto an object surface to
   provide sufficient surface information to enable surface fitting and
   fine interpolation between acquired data points. In scanning across a
   surface, the hand-held scanner acquires a sequence of spatiotemporally
   dense overlapping range-views from different viewpoints with enough
   overlap between range views and abundant information within a range view
   to permit registration of all acquired data into a single 3D object
   surface model.}},

Abstract = {{In surface-shape measurement based on fringe projection,
   camera-projector stereovision, and the heterodyne temporal phase
   unwrapping, residual random phase errors in the wrapped phase maps can
   lead to spike-like errors near the beat frequency in the computed
   unwrapped phase map. If the spike-like errors correspond to control
   points in the camera image, the corresponding projector-image control
   point coordinates cannot be correctly determined and the projector
   calibration will fail. This paper presents a method of error
   compensation in camera-projector calibration using an improved
   heterodyne phase-unwrapping method that detects and compensates for the
   spike-like errors, and thereby preserves rather than remove phase values
   at control points to ensure useful fringe-projection camera-projector
   stereovision-system calibration. Phase-unwrapping simulations and
   real-system experiments demonstrated the advantage of the improved
   method in correcting errors at the phase-unwrapping stage of system
   calibration. The projector calibration accuracy was improved from 18.2
   to 0.2 pixels, enabling surface-shape measurement on various test
   objects.}},

   (i.e., 50/50, 60/40, 70/30) on mechanical, dynamical and morphological
   properties was investigated. It was found that the tensile strength and
   hardness increased with an increase in ABS loading whilst the elongation
   at break decreased, indicating that the strength and hardness attributed
   to thermoplastic component whereas the elasticity of the blends
   contributed to the vulcanized NR The results showed that the 60/40
   NR/ABS blend provided the well-balanced mechanical properties. The
   storage modulus of thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) increased with
   increasing contents of rubber. This is due to that a higher content of
   vulcanized NR domain was dispersed in the ABS matrix. The results agreed
   well with the tan 8 and complex viscosity of the TPV at various blend
   ratios. SEM micrographs of 60/40 NR/ABS blend showed that vulcanized
   rubber domains were dispersed in a continuous ABS phase and it
   contributed to greater interfacial adhesion between the two phases and
   thus provided superior properties.}},

Abstract = {{Significant advances have been made in automotive safety; however,
   thoracic injuries resulting from side impact collisions continue to be a
   leading cause of fatality and severe injury. The goal of this study was
   to investigate thoracic response in side impact crash conditions using a
   detailed human thorax model to provide an improved understanding of side
   impact injury and the primary contributing factors. This study builds on
   an advanced numerical thorax and human model, which has been validated
   using available post-mortem human subject test data for pendulum and
   side sled impact tests. Crash conditions were investigated through the
   development of a coupled door and seat model to reproduce full-scale
   crash tests. The model accounts for several important factors that
   contribute to occupant response as noted in the literature: the relative
   velocities between the seat and door, the occupant to door distance,
   door shape, and door compliance. Importantly, the door and seat models
   were developed using experimental data and the coupled side impact model
   was validated using Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214
   and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) side impact test data,
   comparing the thoracic response predicted by the model to that of the
   EuroSID-2 (ES-2) dummy used in the crash tests. The side impact model
   correlated well with the thoracic compression, velocity, and viscous
   criterion (VC) response of the ES-2 in full-scale crash tests. Finally,
   the model was used to demonstrate the effects of seat foam stiffness,
   arm position, and restraint system on thoracic injury. It was found that
   both the presence of a restraint system as well as stiffer seat foam
   acted to improve the occupant contact with the seat and reduced thoracic
   response and the potential for injury. Importantly, it was found that
   the position of the occupant's arms can contribute to thoracic injury by
   causing a localised loading of the chest when the arm is aligned with
   the thorax. Occupant protection in side impact is challenging due to the
   limited door to occupant spacing associated with lateral collisions.
   However, the study has shown that there are several factors that may be
   utilised to further improve occupant safety in side impact collisions.}},

Abstract = {{Our study, involving a collaboration with radiologists (DK, NSK) as well
   as a leading international developer of medical imaging software (AGFA),
   is primarily concerned with improved methods of assessing the diagnostic
   quality of compressed medical images and the investigation of
   compression artifacts resulting from JPEG and JPEG2000. In this work, we
   compare the performances of the Structural Similarity quality measure
   (SSIM), MSE/PSNR, compression ratio CR and JPEG quality factor Q, based
   on experimental data collected in two experiments involving
   radiologists. An ROC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis indicates that
   compression ratio is not always a good indicator of visual quality.
   Moreover, SSIM demonstrates the best performance, i.e., it provides the
   closest match to the radiologists' assessments. We also show that a
   weighted Youden index(1) and curve fitting method can provide SSIM and
   MSE thresholds for acceptable compression ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, thin films have many applications in every field. So, in order
   to improve the performance of thin film devices, it is necessary to
   characterize their mechanical as well as electrical properties. In this
   research work we focus on the development of a model for the analysis of
   the mechanical and electrical properties of silver nanoparticles
   deposited on silicon substrates. The model consists of inter-particle
   diffusion modeling and finite element analysis. In this study, through
   the simulation of the sintering process, it is shown that how the
   geometry, density, and electrical resistance of the thin film layer are
   changed with sintering conditions. The model is also used to approximate
   the values of the film Young's modulus. Comparing results with
   experimental results shows the high accuracy of this approach.}},

   USING HYBRID INPUT-OUTPUT AND EVENT TREE ANALYSIS}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{60-80}},
Abstract = {{Disasters damage physical infrastructure systems, disrupt the movement
   of people and commodities, and cause significant economic losses. This
   paper develops an I-O model extension using an event tree analysis to
   assess the propagation of disaster effects across interdependent
   economic sectors using the inoperability and economic loss metrics.
   Inoperability, a dimensionless index that ranges between 0 and 1,
   indicates the extent to which a sector's production deviates below its
   normal state. On the other hand, economic loss is the monetary worth of
   the drop in output incurred in each sector of the economy due to the
   disaster. The new dynamic I-O extension is capable of adjusting the
   inoperability parameters within the disaster timeline to reflect events
   that can either degrade or enhance the predicted paths of sector
   recovery. It was implemented to the Nashville region - a metropolitan
   area in the USA known for its vibrant music and the tourism industry.
   The Nashville region is frequently hit by natural disasters such as
   tornadoes and floods, which makes it a suitable case study site for the
   model application. Results of the study can help identify critical
   economic sectors and ultimately provide insights for formulating
   preparedness decisions to expedite disaster recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The fourth generation of mobile telecommunications system (marketed as
   4G-LTE) is being commercially and widely deployed. Security mechanisms
   are crucial to protect communications of mobile users from potential
   malicious attacks as well as to ensure revenue for 4G-LTE network
   operators. The randomness properties of the keystream generated by the
   current cipher suites in 4G-LTE standard are difficult to analyze and
   some vulnerabilities with regard to the integrity algorithms have been
   recently discovered. To address those issues, we present a detailed
   specification and security analysis of a bit-oriented stream cipher
   WG-16 as well as the corresponding confidentiality and integrity
   algorithms in this paper. Our experimental results on smartphones and
   comparisons with the cipher suites in 4G-LTE standard demonstrate that
   WG-16 is a competitive candidate for securing the emerging 4G-LTE

   the welding tool to have a two-flat profile improves material
   consolidation and avoids defect formation during welding, and optimum
   welding parameters involve a combination of high tool rotation speed and
   travel speed. Optical and electron microscopy revealed that the
   integrity of the surface cladding layer could be maintained during
   friction stir welding while avoiding defect formation within the stir

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted on the crystalline properties of different
   polyethylene resins to identify their influence on phase
   interconnectivity between amorphous and crystalline regions. This work
   offers a thorough investigation on the potential correlation between
   environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR) and crystalline
   structure characteristics, namely, crystallinity, mean lamella thickness
   and its distribution, and lamella surface area (LSA). The initial
   objective of this work was to investigate an existing ambiguity in the
   literature with respect to the effect of the crystalline phase on ESCR.
   In addition, research was conducted to evaluate the degree of
   variability in the lamella surface area, as a measure of phase
   interconnectivity and ESCR, with processing temperature and post-process
   annealing. Annealing at various conditions, along with cooling at
   different rates, were employed to investigate the effect of temperature
   on LSA. It was observed that a clear correlation exists between
   crystalline phase properties and ESCR, given that the comparison is made
   between polymers with similar molecular weights. Annealing temperature
   and time were found to cause a general reduction in LSA, however, to
   varying degrees, according to the type of PE molecular structure
   (significant interactions exist between annealing conditions and polymer
   type). LSA showed a significant dependence on cooling rate, however, no
   interaction was found between cooling rate and type of PE molecular
   structure. Additionally, lamella surface areas obtained from quenching
   and air cooling were found to be almost the same.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{11398-11408}},
Abstract = {{Small molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced a resurgence
   of interest over their polymer solar cell counterparts, owing to their
   improved batch-to-batch (thus, cell-to-cell) reliability. In this
   systematic study on OSC device architecture, we investigate five
   different small molecule OSC structures, including the simple planar
   heterojunction (PHJ) and bulk heterojunction (BHJ), as well as several
   planar-mixed structures. The different OSC structures are studied over a
   wide range of donor: acceptor mixing concentrations to gain a
   comprehensive understanding of their charge transport behavior.
   Transient photocurrent decay measurements provide crucial information
   regarding the interplay between charge sweep-out and charge
   recombination, and ultimately hint toward space charge effects in
   planar-mixed structures. Results show that the BHJ/acceptor
   architecture, comprising a BHJ layer with high C-60 acceptor content,
   generates OSCs with the highest performance by balancing charge
   generation with charge collection. The performance of other device
   architectures is largely limited by hole transport, with associated hole
   accumulation and space charge effects.}},

Abstract = {{Clusters of fine stress corrosion cracks on the external surface of
   buried steel natural gas pipelines in contact with groundwater have been
   examined and studied. The growth rates of transgranular stress corrosion
   cracks have been modeled and determined by conducting laboratory tests
   under similar conditions to those recorded in practice. The steel
   samples were immersed in an anaerobic dilute, near neutral solution with
   an open circuit potential for various times under stress. Metallographic
   examination of the resulting stress corrosion cracks was then conducted.
   Transgranular fracture, similar to that observed in the field, was
   observed following tests carried out under low frequency cycling in
   combination with a high stress ratio (R= minimum load/maximum load). A
   quantitative relationship between the frequency and stress ratio was
   developed giving crack growth rates similar to those observed in
   practice. Also, a superposition model was developed and applied to the
   experimental data which gave very good agreement between the actual and
   predicted crack growth rates. Applying the superposition model to the
   operating natural gas pipeline data showed that realistic predictions of
   crack growth result when taking interaction of the cracks into account.}},

Title = {{On vortex shedding from low aspect ratio dual step cylinders}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{251-269}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A dual-step cylinder is comprised of two cylinders of different
   diameters. A large diameter cylinder (D) with low aspect ratio (LID) is
   attached to the mid-span of a small diameter cylinder (d). The present
   study investigates the effect of Reynolds number (Re-D) and LID on dual
   step cylinder wake development for D/d=2, 0.2 <= LID <= 3, and two
   Reynolds numbers, Re-D= 1050 and 2100. Experiments have been performed
   in a water flume facility utilizing flow visualization, Laser Doppler
   Velocimetry (LDV), and Particle Image Velocimetry (Ply). The results
   show that vortex shedding occurs from both the large and small diameter
   cylinders for 1 <= Lill< 3 at Re-D=2100 and 2 <= L/D <= 3 at Re-D=1050.
   At these conditions, large cylinder vortices predominantly form vortex
   loops in the wake and small cylinder vortices form half-loop vortex
   connections. At lower aspect ratios, vortex shedding from the large
   cylinder ceases, with the dominant frequency in the large cylinder wake
   attributed to the passage of vortex filaments connecting small cylinder
   vortices. At these lower aspect ratios, the presence of the large
   cylinder induces periodic vortex dislocations. Increasing LID increases
   the frequency of occurrence of vortex dislocations and decreases the
   dominant frequency in the large cylinder wake. The identified changes in
   wake topology are related to substantial variations in the location of
   boundary layer separation on the large cylinder, and, consequently,
   changes in the size of the vortex formation region. The results also
   show that the Reynolds number has a substantial effect on wake vortex
   shedding frequency, which is more profound than that expected for a
   uniform cylinder. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to expand the body of knowledge about the optical
   properties of battery cathode materials. Although some studies have been
   conducted on the optical properties of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4),
   to the authors' knowledge, this is the first study of its kind on
   electrodes extracted from commercially available LiFePO4 batteries. The
   use of Vis/NIR and FTIR spectroscopy provides for a methodology to study
   the optical properties of LiFePO4 and may allow for the characterization
   of other properties such as particle size and the proportions of LiFePO4
   versus FePO4 material. Knowledge of these properties is important for
   the development of a mechanism to measure the state-of-charge (SOC) in
   lithium ion batteries. These properties are also important in a host of
   other applications including battery modeling and materials
   characterization.
   Cylindrical LiFePO4 batteries (from A123 Systems Inc.) were acquired
   from the commercial market and charged to 10 different states between
   30\% and 80\% of their nominal capacity using a constant-current,
   constant-voltage (CCCV) cycling method. Visual inspection of the
   extracted electrodes shows that the LiFePO4/C-cathodes display subtle
   changes in color (shades of grey) with respect to SOC. Vis/NIR
   measurements support the visual observation of uniform intensity
   variations versus SOC. FTIR measurements show an absorbance signature
   that varies with SOC and is distinct from results found in the
   literature for similar LiFePO4-based material systems, supporting the
   uniqueness of the absorbance fingerprint.}},

Abstract = {{Certain designs for frustrated total internal reflection fiber optic
   evanescent wave sensors (FTIR FOEWS) include the partial removal of
   cladding along a finite length of the fiber optic that acts as the
   sensing region. This paper presents a model for a FTIR FOEWS that has a
   thin, partial cladding in the sensing region. Since the thickness of the
   cladding in the sensing region is in the 1 mu m range, while the
   propagating light is on the order of 850 nm, commonly used ray optic
   modeling techniques fail to properly simulate the thin film interference
   effects. In this study, a modification to the usual ray model is
   performed by including thin film optic analysis at the thin film sensing
   interface. The resulting hybrid ray/thin film model maintains the
   efficiency of previously reported models, but also adds the ability to
   fully model the partial cladding of the sensing region. The intensity
   and angular distributions of light from a Lambertian LED source onto the
   fiber input face is also derived to discuss the effects of launching
   conditions on the sensor performance. Investigation of a variety of
   meridional propagation ray distributions into the fiber are performed by
   varying the distance and angle of the point source to the fiber input
   face. Optimal cladding thicknesses, LED distance and tilt angle are
   studied and used to draw conclusions about FTIR FOEWS performance based

Abstract = {{Optical fibers are commonly used as evanescent wave sensors. Many
   factors affect the performance of fiber optic-based evanescent sensors,
   including, but not limited to, cladding thickness and the refractive
   index of the external medium. A lot has been done on analytical and
   numerical models to predict the effects of these factors in order to aid
   sensor design. However, many of these models are often complicated and
   difficult to solve. In this paper, the free open source
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation software called Meep
   (MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation) is used to predict the
   performance of a fiber optic evanescent wave sensor. The software is
   based on Maxwell's equations and it is used for this analysis due to its
   simplicity of setting up the simulation as well as its reasonable
   running time. Electromagnetic flux is calculated at various points along
   the structure to determine the power loss based on the physical
   dimensions and refractive indices of the structure. The dimensions used
   in the simulation are relative and therefore the results offered in this
   work are mainly qualitative. However, they are useful in guiding the
   overall design of evanescent fiber optic sensors. To validate the
   accuracy of the simulation results experimentally, optical fibers of 105
   mu m diameter core are etched with sensing regions of length 13mm and
   cladding thicknesses of 0.1-0.4 mu m. The change in transmitted power is
   then measured when an external medium of refractive index up to 1.466 is
   put in contact to the sensing region. The results are used to explore
   the advantages and limitations of using this free and open source
   software in the design, modeling and characterization of this type of
   photonic sensors.}},
