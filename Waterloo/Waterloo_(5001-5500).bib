Abstract = {{This paper presents a study that shows the effect of key environmental
   and operational factors on the Canadian Oil Sands operations for the
   production of synthetic crude oil (SCO) and commercial bitumen. Using an
   integrated energy optimization model developed in the GAMS platform, the
   present study determined the most economical oil schemes and energy
   commodities configurations at different CO2 capture levels. natural gas
   prices and steam-to-oil ratios (SOR). The sensitivity of these factors
   on the different aspects of the Oil Sands operations are explicitly
   discussed in this work, i.e., SCO unitary energy costs, energy commodity
   prices, energy plant's configuration. According to the CO2 emission
   target planned by the Canadian federal government for year 2020 (50 MT
   of CO2 eq/yr), 38\% of CO2 emission reduction with respect to the
   baseline emission is required from the Oil Sands industry. Similarly,
   the natural gas price is the operational factor that affects the energy
   costs associated to every product considered in this study. Furthermore,
   the SOR factor has a significant impact on the energy production costs
   of SAGD SCO and commercial bitumen. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A constant K-user interference channel in which the users are not
   symbol-synchronous is considered. It is shown that the asynchronism
   among the users facilitates aligning interfering signals at each
   receiver node while it does not affect the total number of degrees of
   freedom (DoF) of the channel. To achieve the total K/2 DoF of the
   channel when single antenna nodes are used, a novel interference
   alignment scheme is proposed wherein the alignment task is performed
   with the help of asynchronous delays which inherently exist among the
   received signals at each receiver node. When each node is equipped with
   M > 1 antennas, it is argued that the same alignment scheme is
   sufficient to achieve the total MK/2 DoF of the medium when all links
   between collocated antennas experience the same asynchronous delay. The
   proposed alignment scheme is also extended to achieve the total DoF of X
   networks at the presence of the asynchronism among the nodes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the relaxation dynamics of photogenerated carriers in
   silicon nanowires consisting of a crystalline core and a surrounding
   amorphous shell, using femtosecond time-resolved differential
   reflectivity and transmission spectroscopy at 3.15 eV and 1.57 eV photon
   energies. The complex behaviour of the differential transmission and
   reflectivity transients is the mixed contributions from the crystalline
   core and the amorphous silicon on the nanowire surface and the substrate
   where competing effects of state-filling and photoinduced absorption
   govern the carrier dynamics. Faster relaxation rates are observed on
   increasing the photogenerated carrier density. Independent experimental
   results on crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) help us in separating
   the contributions from the carrier dynamics in crystalline core and the
   amorphous regions in the nanowire samples. Further, single-beam z-scan
   nonlinear transmission experiments at 1.57 eV in both open- and

Abstract = {{The transport of wood in rivers during floods is an important process
   that underlies differences in habitat and morphology between water
   courses and regions. Quantitative data are needed to properly address
   management objectives and balance wood budgets. In this study we use a
   streamside video camera to detect wood passage and measure
   quasi-instantaneous rates of wood transport in the Ain River, France.
   The objectives are to verify the procedure, describe the relation
   between wood transport and discharge, and construct and validate a wood
   budget for the reach upstream of the camera. Verification of the
   procedure includes tests of detection frequency, wood velocity, and
   piece size. A log base two transformation is proposed to classify wood
   by piece length. It was found that a wood transport threshold occurs at
   approximately two thirds of the bankfull discharge. Wood transport
   follows a positive linear relation with discharge up to the bankfull
   discharge but is both more variable and less sensitive to discharge when
   the floodplain is inundated. Transport rates are approximately four
   times higher on the rising limb of the hydrograph than on the falling
   limb. Wood transport estimates from a three-stage rating curve are two
   to 10 times higher than those from a wood budget using local and aerial
   surveys of upstream dynamics. Future work should address uncertainties
   related to wood diameter measurements, sampling length and frequency,
   and antecedent floods. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nanojoining, a burgeoning research area, becomes a key manufacturing of
   complicated nanodevices with functional prefabricated components. In
   this work, various nanojoining methods are first reviewed. For
   nanojoining of Ag/Au nanoparticles, three methods are investigated
   comparatively. Thermal annealing shows a two-step solid state diffusion
   mechanism. Laser annealing by millisecond pulses displays the thermal
   activated solid state diffusion. Meanwhile, two effects have been
   identified in femtosecond laser irradiation with different laser
   intensities: photofragmentation at rather high intensity (similar to
   10(14) W/cm(2)) and nanojoining at low intensity (similar to 10(10)
   W/cm(2)). The photofragmentation forms a large number of tiny
   nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm. Control over irradiation
   conditions at intensities near 1010 W/cm(2) results in nanojoining of
   most of the nanoparticles. This nanojoining is obtained through a
   nonthermal melting and a surface fusion welding. Joined Au nanoparticles
   are expected to have numerous applications, such as probes for surface
   enhance Raman spectroscopy. (C) 2012 Laser Institute of America.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of both local generator design and
   global network architecture in improving the stability and operational
   performance of microfluidic droplet generators. We identify naturally
   occurring short-term and long-term oscillations that are related to
   changes in the flow of the two phases. Short-term oscillations are
   related to the creation of each droplet and are quantified by tracking
   droplet speed in the network. Long-term oscillations are caused by
   dynamic feedback associated with the periodic change in the hydrodynamic
   resistance of the network as droplets enter and exit the system. Our
   analysis identifies that these long-term oscillations are best
   quantified by measuring changes in droplet spacing rather than the
   conventional method of using droplet size. Furthermore, we find that
   these long-term oscillations have a periodicity that matches the
   residence time of droplets within the network. In combination with
   experiments, a simple compact model is developed to study these
   oscillations and guide the network design of droplet generators. As part
   of this analysis a set of design rules is developed to help improve
   overall generator performance using pressure-driven flow.}},

Title = {{An improved statistical model for predicting the deuterium ingress in
   zirconium alloy pressure tubes}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{184-191}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the CANDU pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), the nuclear fuel is
   contained in hundreds of Zr-2.5 Nb alloy pressure tubes. The corrosion
   of zirconium alloy produces deuterium that is absorbed by the body of
   the pressure tube. The presence of this deuterium causes hydrogen
   embrittlement of zirconium alloy with an adverse effect on the integrity
   of the pressure tube. An accurate prediction of deuterium accumulation
   over time is an important step for ensuring the fitness-for-service of
   pressure tubes.
   Deuterium ingress data collected from in-service inspection of pressure
   tubes exhibit heteroscedasticity, i.e., the variance of deuterium
   concentration is dependent on operating time (or exposure) and
   temperature. The currently used model by the nuclear industry involves a
   logarithmic regression of deuterium content over time and temperature.
   Since this approach does not deal with heteroscedasticity precisely, it
   results in a conservative prediction of the deuterium ingress.
   The paper presents a new approach for predicting deuterium ingress based
   on a weighted least-squares (WLS) regression that overcomes the
   limitations of the existing model, and it provides realistic prediction
   bounds of deuterium ingress. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Methodology for predicting flow-accelerated corrosion wear using
   unreferenced multiple inspection data}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{317-325}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The lack of fixed spatial referencing in inspection data is a
   confounding factor in the assessment of wall thinning due to
   flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC). Because of the loss of wall thickness
   over time, it is impossible to match any two unreferenced points
   precisely between inspection outages, making the use of point-to-point
   comparison methods highly uncertain. In this study, we develop a new
   methodology for estimating the FAC rate and component lifetime from
   spatially unreferenced inspection data. The method is based on a small
   circular patch that represents the minimum wall thickness as a random
   variable. This allows the predictions to be performed in a probabilistic
   setting, hence providing valuable risk information for long-term
   replacement planning and life-cycle management. The uncertainty and
   errors introduced by inspection and grid coverage are minimized in the
   analysis by fitting a continuous surface through the inspection data
   using the method of kriging. The developed methodology is applied to the
   assessment of carbon steel feeder piping in CANDU reactors, where the
   economic and safety consequences of FAC can be highly significant. Based
   on the analysis of a large industry dataset, FAC in feeder piping
   appears to be a relatively uniform and stationary process. The results
   of the study demonstrate the key advantages of the developed methodology
   and how it can be used to support risk-informed decision making with
   respect to FAC at power plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Autonomous operation of mechanical systems often requires the ability to
   detect and locate a particular phenomenon occurring in the surrounding
   environment. Being implemented to articulated manipulation, such a
   capability may realize a wide range of applications in autonomous
   maintenance and repair. This paper presents the sensor-driven task space
   control of an end-effector that combines the field estimation and the
   target tracking in an unknown spatial field of interest. The radial
   basis function network is adopted to model spatial distribution of an
   environmental phenomenon as a scalar field. Their weight parameters are
   estimated by a recursive least square method using collective
   measurements from the on-board sensors mounted to the manipulator. Then
   the asymptotic source tracking has been achieved by the control law
   based on the gradient of the estimated field. A new singularity tolerant
   scheme has been suggested to command the task space control law despite
   singular configurations. Simulation results using the three-link planar
   robot and the 6-revolute elbow manipulator are presented to validate the
   main ideas.}},

Abstract = {{The increased use of persulfate (S2O82-) for in situ chemical oxidation
   to treat groundwater and soils contaminated by chlorinated hydrocarbon
   compounds (CHCs) requires unbiased methods to assess treatment
   performance. Stable carbon isotope analysis offers a potential tool for
   assessing the in situ treatment performance of persulfate at sites
   contaminated with CHCs. This study investigated the extent of C isotope
   fractionation during oxidation of tetrachloroethene (PCE),
   trichloroethene (TCE) and cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) by persulfate
   activated by ferrous ion (Fe2+). An average carbon isotope enrichment
   factor epsilon(bulk) of -4.9 parts per thousand for PCE, -3.6 parts per
   thousand for TCE and -7.6 parts per thousand for cis-DCE were obtained
   in batch experiments. Variations in the initial S2O82-/Fe2+/CHC molar
   ratios did not result in any significant differences in carbon isotope
   fractionation. The occurrence of carbon isotope fractionation during
   oxidation and the lack of dependence of enrichment factors upon the
   S2O82-/Fe2+/CHC molar ratio demonstrate that carbon isotope analysis can
   potentially be used at contaminated sites as an additional technique to
   estimate treatment efficacy during oxidation of CHCs by Fe2+ activated

Abstract = {{For a class of multi-input and multi-output nonlinear uncertainty
   systems, a novel approach to design a nonlinear controller using minimax
   linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control is proposed. The proposed
   method combines a feedback linearization method with the robust minimax
   LQR approach in the presence of time-varying uncertain parameters. The
   uncertainties, which are assumed to satisfy a certain integral quadratic
   constraint condition, do not necessarily satisfy a generalized matching
   condition. The procedure consists of feedback linearization of the
   nominal model and linearization of the remaining nonlinear uncertain
   terms with respect to each individual uncertainty at a local operating
   point. This two-stage linearization process, followed by a robust
   minimax LQR control design, provides a robustly stable closed loop
   system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an
   application study is provided for a flight control problem of an
   air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicle (AHFV), where the outputs to be
   controlled are the longitudinal velocity and altitude, and the control
   variables are the throttle setting and elevator deflection. The proposed
   method is used to derive a linearized uncertainty model for the
   longitudinal motion dynamics of the AHFV first, and then a robust
   minimax LQR controller is designed, which is based on this uncertainty
   model. The controller is synthesized considering seven uncertain
   aerodynamic and inertial parameters. The stability and performance of
   the synthesized controller is evaluated numerically via single scenario
   simulations for particular cruise conditions as well as a Monte-Carlo
   type simulation based on numerous cases. It is observed that the control
   scheme proposed in this paper performs better, especially from the
   aspect of robustness to large ranges of uncertainties, than some
   controller design schemes previously published in the literature.

Abstract = {{Micellar affinity gradient focusing (MAGF) is a microfluidic counterflow
   gradient focusing technique that combines the favorable features of MEKC
   and temperature gradient focusing. MAGF separates analytes on the basis
   of a combination of electrophoretic mobility and partitioning with the
   micellar phase. A temperature gradient is produced along the separation
   channel containing an analyte/micellar system to create a gradient in
   interaction strength (retention factor) between the analytes and
   micelles. Combined with a bulk counterflow, species concentrate at a
   unique point where their total velocity sums to zero. MAGF can be used
   in scanning mode by varying the bulk flow so that a large number of
   analytes can be sequentially focused and passed by a single detection
   point. In this work, we develop a bilinear temperature gradient along
   the separation channel that improves separation performance over the
   conventional linear designs. The temperature profile along the channel
   consists of a very sharp gradient used to preconcentrate the sample
   followed by a shallow gradient that increases resolution. We fabricated
   a hybrid PDMS/glass microfluidic chip with integrated micro heaters that
   generate the bilinear profile. Performance is characterized by
   separating several different samples including fluorescent dyes using
   SDS surfactant and pI markers using both SDS and poly-SUS surfactants as
   the micellar phase. The new design shows a nearly two times improvement
   in peak capacity and resolution in comparison to the standard linear
   temperature gradient.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel distributed asynchronous multichannel medium
   access control (MAC) scheme for large-scale vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs), i.e., asynchronous multichannel medium access control with a
   distributed time-division multiple-access mechanism (AMCMAC-D). The
   proposed scheme supports simultaneous transmissions on different service
   channels while allowing rendezvous and broadcast of emergency messages
   on the control channel. The scheme is distributed, because it handles
   access to the shared control channel for different access categories
   without relying on the beacon frames from roadside units. This condition
   eliminates the overhead that is associated with channel allocation,
   making the proposed scheme suitable for large-scale networks in terms of
   the number of active nodes. Service differentiation in the proposed
   scheme is enhanced by allocating different numbers of time slots for
   different access categories. We compare the performance of the proposed
   scheme with the IEEE 1609.4 standard and the asynchronous multichannel
   Coordination Protocol (AMCP) in terms of throughput, packet delivery
   rate, collision rate, utilization of service channels, service
   differentiation, and the penetration rate of noncollided emergency
   messages. The results show that AMCMAC-D outperforms the IEEE 1609.4
   standard and AMCP in terms of system throughput by increasing the
   utilization of the control channel and service channels. The proposed
   scheme also demonstrates better performance in terms of packet delivery
   rate, collision rate on a service channel, load balancing, and service
   differentiation. Finally, AMCMAC-D mitigates the multichannel hidden
   terminal and missing receiver problems, which occur in asynchronous
   multichannel MAC schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Effective data forwarding is critical for most mobile social network
   (MSN) applications such as content distribution and information
   searching. However, it could severely be interrupted or even disabled
   when the privacy preservation of users is applied, because users become
   unrecognizable to each other, and the social ties and interactions are
   no longer traceable to facilitate cooperative data forwarding.
   Therefore, how we can enable efficient user cooperation in MSNs without
   intruding on user privacy is a challenging issue. In this paper, we
   address this issue by introducing social morality, which is a
   fundamental social feature of human society, to MSNs and accordingly
   design a three-step protocol suite to achieve both privacy preservation
   and cooperative data forwarding. First, the developed protocol adopts a
   novel privacy-preserving route-based authentication scheme that notifies
   a user's anonymized mobility information to the public. Second, it
   measures the proximity of the user's mobility information to a specific
   packet's destination and evaluates the user's forwarding capacity for
   the packet. Third, using a game-theoretical approach, it determines the
   optimal data-forwarding strategy according to users' morality level and
   payoff. Using analysis and examples, we show that the developed protocol
   suite can effectively protect user personal information such as identity
   and visited locations. Last, we conduct extensive trace-based
   simulations and show that the proposed protocol suite is effective for
   efficiently exploring the user cooperation and attain near-optimal
   performance in data forwarding.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology have
   boosted the deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Limited by
   the energy storage capability of sensor nodes, it is crucial to jointly
   consider security and energy efficiency in data collection of WSNs. The
   disjoint multipath routing scheme with secret sharing is widely
   recognized as one of the effective routing strategies to ensure the
   safety of information. This kind of scheme transforms each packet into
   several shares to enhance the security of transmission. However, in
   many-to-one WSNs, shares have high probability to traverse through the
   same link and to be intercepted by adversaries. In this paper, we
   formulate the secret-sharing-based multipath routing problem as an
   optimization problem. Our objective aims at maximizing both network
   security and lifetime, subject to the energy constraints. To this end, a
   three-phase disjoint routing scheme called the Security and
   Energy-efficient Disjoint Route (SEDR) is proposed. Based on the
   secret-sharing algorithm, the SEDR scheme dispersively and randomly
   delivers shares all over the network in the first two phases and then
   transmits these shares to the sink node. Both theoretical and simulation
   results demonstrate that our proposed scheme has significant improvement
   in network security under both scenarios of single and multiple black
   holes without reducing the network lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{A novel laser processing technique, capable of locally modifying the
   shape memory effect, was applied to enhance the functionality of a NiTi
   linear actuator. By altering local transformation temperatures, an
   additional memory was imparted into a monolithic NiTi wire to enable
   dynamic actuation via controlled resistive heating. Characterizations of
   the actuator load, displacement and cyclic properties were conducted
   using a custom-built spring-biased test set-up. Monotonic tensile
   testing was also implemented to characterize the deformation behaviour
   of the martensite phase. Observed differences in the deformation
   behaviour of laser-processed material were found to affect the magnitude
   of the active strain. Furthermore, residual strain during cyclic
   actuation testing was found to stabilize after 150 cycles while the
   recoverable strain remained constant. This laser-processed actuator will
   allow for the realization of new applications and improved control
   methods for shape memory alloys.}},

Abstract = {{The coupled interaction of a cantilevered Kirchhoff-Love plate with two
   vortex filaments of equal and opposite circulation in an infinite
   incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational fluid domain is investigated.
   The vortices initially advect toward the cantilevered plate, which is
   oriented perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the vortex
   pair and undergoes cylindrical bending. As the pair approaches the
   plate, the pressure field induced by the vortices deflects the plate and
   initiates vibration of the structure. The vibration of the structure, in
   turn, alters the path of the two vortices. The level of interaction
   depends on the vortex circulation and on the ratio of the plate inertia
   to the fluid inertia, termed the mass ratio. In general, the vortices
   tend to pass around the plate and eventually advect away from the plate,
   albeit with a modified trajectory, which depends on the strength of the
   fluid and structure coupling. The energy imparted to the plate increases
   with increasing vortex circulation and decreasing mass ratio. The
   findings of this study provide an initial framework for assessing the
   energy that can be imparted to a plate for energy harvesting purposes by
   coherent fluid structures in the absence of viscous effects.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for the sintering of silver (Ag) nanoparticle thin

   from 500 nm to 480 nm and red-shifted from 480 nm to 550 nm when laser
   power was varied from 100 W to 140 W and from 140 W to 200 W,
   respectively. This indicates a new technique to control light absorption
   through joining nanoparticles with laser sintering. According to
   theoretical calculations based on a heat diffusion model, the melting
   temperature of these Ag nanoparticles was estimated to be 440 A degrees
   C during laser irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{The critical path method (CPM) has been useful for project planning, yet
   its float calculation errors in cases of complex schedules hinders its

   scheduling technique and incorporates a rich visualization of all
   as-built events made by all parties, including work stops,
   accelerations, and rework. Its improved critical path calculation
   incorporates the decision variables used at the project control stage
   such as revised construction methods. It also uses a modified float
   calculation with forward-pass only to avoid float errors. A case study
   is used to demonstrate the proposed technique and its benefits for
   project control. This research has the potential to revolutionize
   scheduling computations to resolve CPM drawbacks and provide decision

Abstract = {{Pipe-works are among the most complicated items to be tracked in the
   course of monitoring construction project progress. Traditionally, the
   tracking of pipe-works progress is conducted either manually or using
   laser scanning technology. While laser scanning is a 3D imaging
   technique, and commercial software exists to construct 3D CAD models of
   piping based on such images, it suffers from portability, purchase cost,
   and other disadvantages. This paper describes digital photogrammetry
   technology as an alternative for pipe-works reconstruction and as a cost
   effective tracking tool. For validation, data was collected using a
   handheld digital camera to acquire images inside a new building under
   construction. Progress of the pipe-work networks of different types and
   sizes in the new building was monitored during the construction phases.
   In addition to the known accuracy and robustness of photogrammetry, it
   was found that the use of digital photogrammetry provided a practical
   and low-cost approach.}},

Abstract = {{Guarded evaluation is a power reduction technique that involves
   identifying subcircuits (within a larger circuit) whose inputs can be
   held constant (guarded) at specific times during circuit operation,
   thereby reducing switching activity and lowering dynamic power. The
   concept is rooted in the property that under certain conditions, some
   signals within digital designs are not ``observable{''} at design
   outputs, making the circuitry that generates such signals a candidate
   for guarding. Guarded evaluation has been demonstrated successfully for
   application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); in this paper, we
   apply the technique to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In ASICs,
   guarded evaluation entails adding additional hardware to the design,
   increasing silicon area and cost. Here, we apply the technique in a way
   that imposes minimal area overhead by leveraging existing unused
   circuitry within the FPGA. The primary challenge in guarded evaluation
   is in determining the specific conditions under which a subcircuit's
   inputs can be held constant without impacting the larger circuit's
   functional correctness. We propose a simple solution to this problem
   based on discovering gating inputs using ``noninverting{''} and
   ``partial noninverting{''} paths in a circuit's AND-inverter graph
   representation. Experimental results show that guarded evaluation can
   reduce switching activity on average by as much as 32\% and 25\% for
   6-input look-up table (6-LUT) and 4-LUT architectures, respectively.
   Dynamic power consumption in the FPGA interconnect is reduced on average
   by as much as 24\% and 22\% for 6-LUT and 4-LUT architectures,
   respectively. The impact to critical path delay ranges from 1\% to 43\%,
   depending on the guarding scenario and the desired power/delay tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigated different organic and inorganic
   hole-blocking contacts for amorphous selenium (a-Se)-based
   photodetectors: CeO2, TiO2, perylene tetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole
   (PTCBI), and polyimide (PI). CeO2 has previously been used as a blocking
   layer for high-gain a-Se devices. TiO2 has similar properties to CeO2.
   PTCBI has a higher ionization potential compared to a-Se and has a very
   low hole mobility. PI is a common insulator in the semiconductor
   industry. It was found that an 800-nm PI layer reduces the dark current
   by more than two orders of magnitude in comparison with 30 nm of CeO2,
   20 nm of TiO2, and 50 nm of PTCBI. No significant charge trapping was
   found in the devices consisting of an 800-nm PI layer. Unlike previously
   reported inorganic hole-blocking contact technology, PI layers further
   benefit from a simple spin coating fabrication step before evaporation
   of a-Se. Photodetector samples incorporating the PI layer are tested at
   high electric fields, and gains reaching 4.4 were observed at an
   electric field > 80 V/mu m. We conclude that using a PI layer is a
   promising step in the development of high-conversion-gain detectors for
   emerging applications in large-area medical diagnostic imaging,
   crystallography, and nondestructive test.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with quadriceps muscle weakness often have difficulty
   generating the knee-extension moments required to complete common
   mobility tasks. A new device that provides knee-extension moments
   through a range of knee angles was designed to help individuals perform
   stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand tasks. The novel knee-extension assist
   (KEA) was designed as a modular component to be incorporated into
   existing knee-ankle-foot orthoses or used in a knee orthosis. During
   stand-to-sit, a set of springs is loaded as the knee flexes under body
   weight and the KEA thus provides a knee-extension moment that aids in
   achieving a smoothly controlled knee flexion. The springs can be locked
   in place at the end of knee flexion to prevent unwanted knee extension
   while the user is seated. The entire knee extension assist can be
   disengaged to allow free joint motion anytime the affected leg is
   unloaded. During sit-to-stand, the KEA assists knee extension by
   returning the energy stored in the springs as an extension moment. In
   mechanical testing of a prototype of the new KEA, a mean maximum
   extension moment of 42.9 +/- 0.46 Nm was provided by the device during
   flexion and 28.4 +/- 0.28 Nm during extension. A biomechanical
   evaluation with two able-bodied individuals demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the KEA in successfully assisting stand-to-sit and
   sit-to-stand tasks. During stand-to-sit, the KEA provided 82\% and 75\%
   of the total (muscle and KEA) knee-extension moment required by the
   braced leg for the task for the two subjects, respectively; and during
   sit-to-stand, the KEA provided 56\% and 50\% of the total knee-extension
   moment for the two subjects, respectively. This KEA performance exceeded
   50\% knee-extension moment assistance for a 70 kg person.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a systematic method is introduced to determine the
   required accuracy of an automotive engine model used for real-time
   optimal control of coldstart hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. The engine
   model structure and development are briefly explained and the model
   predictions versus experimental results are presented. The control
   design problem is represented with a dynamic optimization formulation on
   the basis of the engine model and solved using the Pontryagin's minimum
   principle (PMP). To relate the level of plant/model mismatch and the
   control performance degradation in practice, a sensitivity analysis
   using a computationally efficient method is employed. In this way, the
   sensitivities or the effects of small parameter variations on the
   optimal solution, which is the minimum of cumulative tailpipe HC
   emissions over the coldstart period, are calculated. There is a good
   agreement between the sensitivity analysis results and the experimental
   data. The sensitivities indicate the directions of the subsequent
   parameter estimation and model improvement tasks to enhance the
   control-relevant accuracy, and thus, the control performance.
   Furthermore, they provide some insights to simplify the engine model,
   which is critical for real-time implementation of the coldstart optimal
   control system. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006217]}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the development of a virtual reality interface
   (VRI) for a magnetic-haptic micromanipulation platform (MHMP) (Mehrtash
   et al. in IEEE/ASME Trans Mechatron 16(3):459-469, 2011). Our previously
   developed MHMP has shown a great deal of promise in non-contact
   micromanipulations. This micromanipulation platform concerns the
   integration of magnetic actuation technology and a bilateral macro-micro
   teleoperation. The MHMP has two separate stations: one magnetic
   microrobotic station and one haptic. The magnetic microrobotic station
   manipulates micro-sized objects based on the commands from the haptic
   station. The haptic station uses bilateral communication with the
   magnetic microrobotic station to allow a human operator the feeling of a
   micro-domain environment. In this paper, we report a VRI that enables
   human operators to improve their skills in using the MHMP, before
   carrying out an actual dexterous task. The VRI is made up of three main
   components: a haptic station, a simulation engine, and a display unit.
   The haptic station provides the operator with the force/torque
   information from virtual or remote environments, and is also used to
   recognize the operator's hand motion command. Dynamical computation and
   control system modeling have been carried out on the simulation engine.
   Based on the real-time computation, this engine, as the heart of the
   system, provides force applied to the operator's hand and the
   microrobot's position for the haptic station and the display unit,
   respectively. The display unit employs 3D computer graphics to
   demonstrate the micromanipulation tasks and environments. The VRI is
   also developed in such a way that it can be separately used in parallel
   with the MHMP for the 3D visualization of a real task by providing
   multiple virtual viewports. This paper introduces the configuration of
   the proposed VRI, and reports the result of a preliminary experiment
   using micromanipulation investigation for validation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in micro/nano domain technologies have led to a
   renewed interest in ultra-high resolution magnetic-based actuation
   mechanisms. This paper deals with the development of a novel
   research-made magnetic microrobotic station (MMS) with promising
   potential in biological/biomedical applications. The MMS consists of two
   separate basic components: a magnetic drive unit and a microrobot. The
   magnetic drive unit produces and regulates the magnetic field for
   non-contact propelling of the microrobot in an enclosed environment. Our
   previous research findings have reported that the MMS should be equipped
   with high accuracy laser sensors for the position determination of the
   microrobot in the workspace. However, the laser positioning techniques
   can be used only in highly transparent environments. This paper seeks to
   address microrobot position estimation in non-transparent environments.
   A novel technique based on real-time magnetic flux measurement has been
   proposed for position estimation of the microrobot in the case of the
   laser beam blockage. A combination of Hall-effect sensors is employed in
   the structure of the magnetic drive unit to find the microrobot's
   position using the produced magnetic flux. The most effective
   installation position for the Hall-effect sensors has been determined
   based on the accuracy sensitivity of experimental measurements. We
   derived a mathematical function which relates Hall-effect sensors'
   voltage output and the position of the microrobot. The motion control
   capability of the Hall-effect-based positioning method is experimentally
   verified in the horizontal axis, and it was demonstrated that the
   microrobot can be operated in most of the workspace range with an
   accuracy of 0.3 mm as the root-mean-square of the position error.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a disaggregated modeling approach for
   investigating the link between winter road collision occurrence,
   weather, road surface conditions, traffic exposure, temporal trends and
   site-specific effects. This approach is unique as it allows for
   quantification of the safety effects of different winter road
   maintenance activities at an operational level. Different collision
   frequency models are calibrated using hourly data collected from 31
   different highway routes across Ontario, Canada. It is found that
   factors such as visibility, precipitation intensity, air temperature,
   wind speed, exposure, month of the winter season, and storm hour have
   statistically significant effects on winter road safety. Most
   importantly, road surface conditions are identified as one of the major
   contributing factors, representing the first contribution showing the
   empirical relationship between safety and road surface conditions at
   such a disaggregate level. The applicability of the modeling framework
   is demonstrated using several examples, such as quantification of the
   benefits of alternative maintenance operations and evaluation of the
   effects of different service standards using safety as a performance
   measure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The compressive sensing theory has been intensively inspired to develop
   new methods and applications. Energy conservation for every node and
   overall energy consumption in the network is one of the main design
   issues in such networks. In large-scale sensor networks, information is
   relatively sparse compared with the number of nodes. In such networks,
   the state recovery problem can be recast as a sparse signal recovery
   problem in the discrete spatial domain to be solved with a small number
   of linear measurements as an underdetermined linear system by an
   l(1)-norm minimization program. A series of signal processing methods is
   applied to recover the current state of sensory data, e. g.,
   temperature, pressure, force, flow, humidity, position, or motion, from
   noisy measurements. We propose an energy-efficient state recovery method
   for sensor networks; then, the proposed method is employed to recover an
   air quality signal in an air-quality-monitoring system. The signal
   contains the air quality indexes for all monitoring sites in the system.
   To have a sparse representation of the signal, it is first transformed
   to frequency domain and then recovered and reconstructed from a small
   portion of coefficients. Different random matrices driven from Bernoulli
   and Gaussian distributions are investigated to find an energy-efficient

   noticeable saving in deployment and maintenance cost, particularly in
   large-scale sensor networks with slowly varying phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembling peptide nanofibers have emerged as important
   nanobiomaterials, with such applications as delivery of therapeutic
   agents and vaccines, nanofabrication and biomineralization, tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine. Recently a new class of
   self-assembling peptides has been introduced, which takes into
   consideration amino acid pairing (AAP) strategies in the peptide
   sequence design. Even though these peptides have shown promising
   potential in the design of novel functional biomaterials, they have a
   propensity to initiate uncontrollable aggregation and be degraded by
   proteolytic enzymes. These present the most significant challenge in
   advancing self-assembling peptides for in vitro and in vivo
   applications. Functionalizing biomaterials with polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) has been shown to surmount such problems. Here the results of
   conjugating diethylene glycol (DEG), a short segment of PEG, to one of
   the AAP peptides, AAP8, with eight amino acids in sequence, are
   reported. The results indicate that incorporation of DEG into the
   peptide sequence modulates fiber self-assembly through creating more
   aligned and uniform nanostructures. This is associated with increasing
   solubility, stability, and secondary structure beta-sheet content of the
   peptide. The DEG conjugate of AAP8 also shows reduced cellular
   cytotoxicity. Functionalization of AAP8 improves the capability of the
   peptide to stabilize and deliver a hydrophobic anticancer compound,
   ellipticine, in aqueous solution, consequently inducing greater
   cytotoxicity to lung carcinoma cells over a relatively long time,
   compared with non-functionalized AAP8. The presented functionalized
   peptide and its drug delivery application indicate a potentially useful
   design strategy for novel self-assembling peptide biomaterials for
   biotechnology and nanomedicine. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{The effect of corrosion of longitudinal reinforcement on the structural
   performance of shear-critical reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams was
   experimentally investigated. A total of eight medium-scale reinforced
   concrete beams were constructed. The beams measured 150 mm wide, 350 mm
   deep and 1400 mm in length. The test variables included: corrosion
   levels (0\%, 5\%, and 7.5\%), existence of stirrups and FRP repair. Six
   beams were subjected to artificial corrosion whereas two beams acted as
   control un-corroded. Following the corrosion phase, all beams were
   tested to failure in three point bending. The test results revealed that
   corrosion of properly anchored longitudinal steel reinforcement does not
   have any adverse effect on the behaviour of shear critical RC deep
   beams. Corrosion changed the load transfer mechanism to a pure arch
   action and as a result the load carrying capacity was improved. A strut
   and tie model was proposed to predict the failure loads of
   shear-critical RC deep beams with corroded longitudinal steel
   reinforcement. The predicted results correlated well with the
   experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Discretized singular control problems in finance result in highly
   nonlinear algebraic equations which must be solved at each timestep. We
   consider a singular stochastic control problem arising in pricing a
   guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB), where the underlying asset
   is assumed to follow a jump diffusion process. We use a scaled direct
   control formulation of the singular control problem and examine the
   conditions required to ensure that a fast fixed point policy iteration
   scheme converges. Our methods take advantage of the special structure of
   the GMWB problem in order to obtain a rapidly convergent iteration. The
   direct control method has a scaling parameter which must be set by the
   user. We give estimates for bounds on the scaling parameter so that
   convergence can be expected in the presence of round-off error. Example
   computations verify that these estimates are of the correct order.
   Finally, we compare the scaled direct control formulation to a
   formulation based on a block version of the penalty method (Huang and
   Forsyth in IMA J Numer Anal 32:320-351, 2012). We show that the scaled
   direct control method has some advantages over the penalty method.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of scheduling concurrent periodic real-time
   transactions on Multidomain Ring Bus (MDRB). The problem is challenging
   because although the bus allows multiple nonoverlapping transactions to
   be executed concurrently, the degree of concurrency depends on the
   topology of the bus and of executed transactions. To solve this problem,
   first, we propose two novel efficient scheduling algorithms for
   topographically acyclic transaction sets. The first algorithm is optimal
   for transaction sets under restrictive assumptions while the second one
   induces a good sufficient schedulable utilization bound for more general
   transaction sets. Then, we extend these two algorithms for the
   scheduling of topographically cyclic transaction sets. Extensive
   simulations show that the proposed algorithm can schedule transaction
   sets with high bus utilization and is better than that of related works
   in most practical settings. The implementation of the algorithms in a
   real testbed shows that they have relatively low execution-time
   overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Because of society's full dependence on electricity and high cost of
   system outages, one important goal is to increase the reliability of the
   power system, which means that a salient attractive feature of smart
   grid is its self-healing ability. Smart grids will develop and enhance
   the automation of distribution by operating in a distributed manner
   through new digital technologies such as monitoring, automatic control,
   two-way communication, and data management. In this work, the smart grid
   concept and technologies have been applied to construct a self-healing
   framework for use in smart distribution systems. The proposed multiagent
   system is designed to locate and isolate faults, then decide and
   implement the switching operations to restore the out-of-service loads.
   The proposed control structure has two layers: zone and feeder. The
   function of zone agents in the first layer is monitoring, making simple
   calculations, and implementing control actions. Feeder agents in the
   second layer are assigned to negotiation. The constraints include
   voltage limits, line current limits, and radial topology. Load variation
   has been taken into consideration to avoid the need for further
   reconfigurations during the restoration period. The results of the
   simulation conducted using the new framework demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed control structure.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of smart grid has emerged as a convergence of traditional
   power system engineering and information and communication technology.
   It is vital to the success of next generation of power grid, which is
   expected to be featuring reliable, efficient, flexible, clean, friendly,
   and secure characteristics. In this paper, we propose an efficient and
   privacy-preserving aggregation scheme, named EPPA, for smart grid
   communications. EPPA uses a superincreasing sequence to structure
   multidimensional data and encrypt the structured data by the homomorphic
   Paillier cryptosystem technique. For data communications from user to
   smart grid operation center, data aggregation is performed directly on
   ciphertext at local gateways without decryption, and the aggregation
   result of the original data can be obtained at the operation center.
   EPPA also adopts the batch verification technique to reduce
   authentication cost. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that
   EPPA resists various security threats and preserve user privacy, and has
   significantly less computation and communication overhead than existing
   competing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{As an indispensable infrastructure for the future life, smart grid is
   being implemented to save energy, reduce costs, and increase
   reliability. In smart grid, control center networks have attracted a
   great deal of attention, because their security and dependability issues
   are critical to the entire smart grid. Several studies have been
   conducted in the field of smart grid security, but few work focuses on
   the dependability analysis of control center networks. In this paper, we
   adopt a concise mathematic tool, stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), to
   analyze the dependability of control center networks in smart grid. We
   present the general model of control center networks by considering
   different backup strategies of critical components. With the general
   SPNs model, we can measure the dependability from two metrics, i.e., the
   reliability and availability, through analyzing the transient and
   steady-state probabilities simultaneously. To avoid the state-space
   explosion problem in computing, the state-space explosion avoidance
   method is proposed as well. Finally, we study a specific case to
   demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model in the
   dependability analysis of control center networks in smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic (EM) forming is a high-speed forming process that uses
   the forces induced on a conductive workpiece by a transient high
   frequency magnetic field to form the workpiece into a desired shape.
   This paper describes the results of a work undertaken to study the
   reduction of a 20 mm radius to 5 mm in 1 mm AA 5754 sheet by
   conventional metal forming process and by electromagnetic forming. The
   combination of conventional and EM forming will be referred to as
   ``hybrid forming{''}. The 20 mm radius was pre-formed from flat sheet
   using a conventional die, punch and binder that allowed the material to
   draw in. The radius was then reduced to 5 mm, with no draw-in allowed
   for either process. Sheets were studied in the as-received condition and
   were also pre-strained to 5\%, 10\% and 15\% to simulate strain path
   effects in a multiple stage forming operation. The process was modelled
   numerically to gain insight into the stress, strain and strain rate
   histories. The research indicates that features that are not achievable
   using traditional stamping techniques can be obtained with the aid of EM
   forming. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, laser cladding of Fe-TiC composite coating on AISI 1030
   carbon steel is investigated using a numerical and experimental method.
   Correlation between temperature distributions and formed microstructures
   of the deposited material are studied. Numerical and experimental
   results show that the distribution of the TiC particles within the
   deposited tracks varies according to the local temporal cooling rates.
   By increasing the substrate average temperature and thus decreasing the
   cooling rates, the TiC particles distribution becomes less uniform and
   larger dendrites are formed. Due to the lower cooling rates at the end
   segment of the deposition, clusters of TiC particles are detected at the
   top of the clad. It is shown that although higher cooling rates result
   in relatively more uniform TiC particles distribution, they are the
   potential source of micro-crack formation across the deposited layers.

Abstract = {{In this letter, a new set of silicon probes, at submillimeter and
   terahertz frequency range, for I/O connectivity and instrumentation
   applications are introduced.The designed probes are optimized for
   testing of planar silicon-based integrated circuits using newly
   introduced network analyzers, e.g., a PNA-X. The probes have been
   optimized for different frequency windows matched to the standard
   metallic rectangular waveguides (WR-2, WR-4, and WR-6) corresponding to
   the frequency band of 110-500 GHz and higher. The probes comprised of
   highly resistive silicon channel waveguides, which are tapered on both
   sides laterally and vertically. The side of the probes which is coupled
   to the WR waveguide is tapered laterally and the other end which is used
   to couple the signal to or out of the sample under the test is tapered
   vertically with an angle of 54.6 degrees. The probes are pressed
   (side-coupled) on the sample under the test. The probing system
   consisting of the input and output tapers and a channel silicon
   waveguide as the sample under the test are designed and simulated using
   HFSS v.12 for three windows of frequencies including 110-170, 170-260,
   and 325-500 GHz. The simulation results show that the insertion loss and
   return loss are lower than 3 dB and higher than 15 dB, respectively;
   which are much better than the losses of commercially available high
   frequency probes. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol

Abstract = {{A generalised step-by-step procedure for fatigue crack growth analysis
   of structural components subjected to variable amplitude loading spectra
   has been presented. The method has been illustrated by analysing fatigue
   growth of planar corner crack in an attachment lug made of Al7050-T7451
   alloy.
   Stress intensity factors required for the fatigue crack growth analysis
   were calculated using the weight function method. In addition, so-called
   ``load-shedding{''} effect was accounted for in order to determine
   appropriate magnitudes of the applied stress intensity factors. The rate
   of the load shedding was determined with the help of the finite element
   (FE) method by finding the amount of the load transferred through the
   cracked ligament. The UniGrow fatigue crack growth model, based on the
   material stress-strain behaviour near the crack tip, has been used to
   simulate the fatigue crack growth under two variable amplitude loading
   spectra. The comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental
   data proved the ability of the UniGrow model to correctly predict
   fatigue crack growth behaviour of two-dimensional planar cracks under
   complex stress field and subjected to arbitrary variable amplitude
   loading. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{95-103}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To determine the retardation mechanisms due to overload and to predict
   the subsequent evolution of crack growth rate, investigations are
   conducted on crack retardation caused by single tensile overloads in
   base material and laser-welded sheets of AA6056-T6 Al alloy. The effect
   of the overload ratio on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the
   C(T) 100 specimens was analysed by using experimental and Finite Element
   (FE) methods. The crack growth rate and fracture surface features were
   investigated for both base material and laser-welded sheets. The
   retardation due to overload is described in terms of the affected
   regions in front of the crack tip. The size and shape of the crack-tip
   plastic zone and the damage profile induced during the application of
   the overload in the base material are predicted by FE analysis in
   conjunction with a porous-metal plasticity model. The results show that
   the mechanisms of retardation in under-matched welds are substantially
   different from that of the homogenous base material. More significant
   crack retardation due to overload has been observed in the laser weld of
   AA6056-T6. Based on SEM observations of the fracture surfaces and the
   damage profiles predicted by the proposed FE model, the shape of the
   crack front formed during the overload application can be predicted.
   During the overload, the crack front extends into a new shape, which can
   be predicted by the ductile damage model; a higher load results in a
   more curved crack front. These outcomes are used to determine the
   dominant retardation mechanisms and the significance of retardation
   observed in each region ahead of the crack tip and finally to define the
   minimum crack growth rate after overload. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Crack-face interference-free mode I and mode II crack-growth data was

   The crack growth models incorporated growth from a slip band (including

   growth on tensile planes. The models successfully predicted smooth

Abstract = {{The amino acid pairing peptide EAK16-II (EAK) has shown the ability to

   formulation of EAK-EPT complexes in vivo. The developed formulation can
   achieve a sufficiently high drug concentration required in vivo animal
   models. The nanostructure and surface properties of EAK-EPT complexes or
   nanoparticle were characterized by transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) and zeta potential measurements, respectively. 12 healthy male SD
   rats were divided into EPT group and EAK-EPT group randomly. Rats in EPT
   group were tail intravenously injected with the EPT (20 mg/kg); rats in
   EAK-EPT group were injected with EAK-EPT complexes (EPT's concentration
   is 20 mg/kg). EPT was extracted from rat plasma with dexamethasone
   sodium phosphate as internal standards (IS). The pharmacokinetic
   parameters were obtained using high pressure liquid chromatography
   (HPLC). Significant differences in main pharmacokinetic parameters
   between EPT and EAK-EPT complexes were observed, demonstrating that the
   complexation with EAK prolongs the residence time of the drug and
   enlarges the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). This means
   that EAK can serve as a suitable carrier to increase the bioavailability
   of EPT.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the noncovalent modification of multiwalled carbon
   nanotubes (MWNTs) immersed in aqueous solution using the
   ionic-complementary peptide EFK16-II. This modification presumably
   arises through the interaction between the hydrophobic side of the
   EFK16-II and MWNT sidewalls and orients hydrophilic functional groups
   toward the solution phase and enables them to form highly stable
   dispersions in water. This stability can be attributed to the
   electrostatic repulsion between self-assembled peptides on the MWNTs.
   This repulsion as determined by ? potential measurements increases as
   the pH diverges from the isoelectric point of 6.7 for EFK16-II. This
   trend is confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurements of the
   suspensions showing a decrease in their particle size as the ? potential
   increases. These EFK16-IIMWNT suspensions have been used to modify mica
   surfaces. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
   images show that this leads to a uniform distribution of individual
   modified MWNTs on the mica surfaces. Transmission electron microscopy
   reveals images of well-dispersed fibers with dimensions similar to those
   of individual MWNTs. Tissue culture plates previously contacted with
   EFK16-II-modified MWNTs have been shown to have enough biocompatibility
   for growth and attachment of cells. The biocompatibility and enhanced
   electrical conductivity that should result from the modification with
   these EFK16-IIMWNT suspensions opens up their use in a number of
   potential biomedical applications such as the design of bioelectrode
   interfaces and fabrication of biosensors with high sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Fusion zone of three TRIP steels, categorized as AT: C-Mn-Al, AST:
   C-Mn-Al-Si and ST: C-Mn-Si, in resistance spot welding was characterized
   with respect to microstructure, phase analysis, and hardness. The fusion
   zone microstructure was found to depend on chemistry: (i) AT steel
   contained ferrite phase surrounded by bainite and martensite regions,
   (ii) AST steel showed a bainite structures along with martensite laths
   and interlath retained austenite, whereas (iii) ST steel constituted
   single phase martensite laths with interlath austenite. X-ray
   diffraction study indicated that retained austenite fraction in the
   fusion zone increases with increase in Si content in it. The AST fusion
   zone hardness lies between those of the AT and ST steels: the ST fusion
   zone hardness was higher than that of AT steel because of the single
   phase martensite microstructure. Comparison of fusion zone
   microstructure and hardness to earlier study on laser welding of the
   TRIP steels with similar chemistries revealed that higher cooling rate
   in resistance spot welding led to higher fusion zone hardness compared
   to laser welding; which was attributed either to decrease in softer
   ferrite phase (AT steel) in the microstructure or refinement of
   martensite laths (ST steel). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Glawdel, C. Elbuken, and C. L. Ren, Phys. Rev. E 85, 016322 (2012)], we
   presented experimental findings regarding the formation process in the
   squeezing-to-transition regime, and in Paper II {[}T. Glawdel, C.
   Elbuken, and C. L. Ren, Phys. Rev. E 85, 016323 (2012)] we developed a
   theoretical model that describes the performance of T-junction
   generators without surfactants. Here we study dynamic interfacial
   tension effects for two surfactants, one with a small molecular weight
   that adsorbs quickly, and the other with a large molecular weight that
   adsorbs slowly. Using the force balance developed in Paper II we extract
   the dynamic interfacial tension from high speed videos obtained during
   experiments. We then develop a theoretical model to predict the dynamic
   interfacial tension in microfluidic T-junction generators as a function
   of the surfactant properties, flow conditions, and generator design.
   This model is then incorporated into the overall model for generator
   performance to effectively predict the size of droplets produced when
   surfactants are present.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for the simultaneous design and
   control of systems under random realizations in the disturbances. The
   key idea in this work is to perform a distribution analysis on the
   worst-case variability. Normal distribution functions, which approximate
   the actual distribution of the worst-case variability, are used to
   estimate the largest variability expected for the process variables at a
   user-defined probability limit. The resulting estimates in the
   worst-case variability are used to evaluate the process constraints, the
   system's dynamic performance and the process economics. The methodology
   was applied to simultaneously design and control a Continuous Stirred
   Tank Reactor (CSTR) process. A study on the computational demands
   required by the present method is presented and compared with a dynamic
   optimization-based methodology. The results show that the present
   methodology is a computationally efficient and practical tool that can
   be used to propose attractive (economical) process designs under

Abstract = {{Reliability and variability have become big design challenges facing
   submicrometer high-speed applications and microprocessors designers. A
   low area overhead adaptive body bias (ABB) circuit is proposed in this
   paper to compensate for negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI)
   aging and process variations to improve the system reliability and
   yield. The proposed ABB circuit consists of a threshold voltage-sensing
   circuit and an on-chip analog controller. In this paper, post-layout
   simulation results, referring to an industrial hardware-calibrated
   STMicroelectronics 65-nm CMOS technology transistor model, are
   presented. The transistor model contains process variations and NBTI
   aging model cards, which are declared by STMicroelectronics to be
   Silicon verified. Cadence RelXpert, Virtuoso Spectre, and Virtuoso
   UltraSim tools are used to estimate the NBTI aging and process
   variations impacts on a circuit block case study, extracted from a real
   microprocessor critical path. These results show that the proposed ABB
   compensates effectively for NBTI aging and process variations. For
   example, the proposed ABB improves the timing yield from 74.4\% to
   99.7\% at zero aging time and from 36.6\% to 97.1\% at 10 years aging
   time. In addition, the proposed ABB increases the total yield from 67\%
   to 99.5\% at zero aging time and from 35.9\% to 97.1\% at 10 years aging
   time.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal transmission switching (OTS) problem, a mixed-integer
   program (MIP), has been proposed as a way to choose lines to take out of
   service to reduce generation costs. One impediment to the use of OTS in
   practice is the very long computing time to solve it. This paper
   proposes two heuristics which rely on a line-ranking parameter that is
   based on the optimal solution to the ordinary dc optimal power flow
   problem, a linear program (LP). One heuristic solves a sequence of LPs,
   removing one line at a time, and the other heuristic solves a sequence
   of MIPs, removing one line at a time, and each MIP has far fewer binary
   variables (for switching the lines out of service) than the original
   MIP. The proposed heuristics are tested on 118-bus and 662-bus systems,
   and compared with the most common previous heuristic in the literature,
   which solves a sequence of MIPs, removing one line at a time, with each
   MIP having all binary variables, i.e., one for each line. Both
   heuristics are much faster than the previous heuristic from the
   literature. In almost all cases tested, both proposed heuristics find
   cost reductions that are approximately as large as the previous
   heuristic. The computing time reductions are so great that OTS may now
   be practical with respect to the computing time issue.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that conversion as a function of temperature hysteresis
   can occur during ignition and extinction exothermic reaction
   experiments, such as CO oxidation over Pt/Al2O3, with the activity
   during the ignition process not matching that during the extinction
   process. Conversions being higher during extinction than that during
   ignition are often observed. Several explanations have been proposed in
   which heat effects, different catalyst surface states, and different Pt
   oxidation states are the most common. In this work CO oxidation
   hysteresis behavior, when in a mixture with C3H6, was investigated. The
   results show that when C3H6 was absent, CO oxidation followed normal
   hysteresis behavior; however, when C3H6 was added to the mixture, the
   catalytic activity during the extinction phase decreased. As the C3H6
   concentration in the mixture increased, the hysteresis loop became
   smaller and ultimately reverse hysteresis was observed. The decrease in
   catalytic activity during extinction was due to the formation of C3H6
   oxidation intermediate species. These species competed with CO for
   active sites, thus inhibiting CO oxidation, and were not present during
   ignition as CO was the dominant adsorbed species when starting at low
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Using temperature-programmed desorption after NO adsorption at 200 A
   degrees C, a variety of catalytic materials as potential low-temperature
   lean NO (x) traps were tested after hydrothermal aging. For the non
   Pt/ceria related materials tested, there was a strong relationship
   between NO oxidation activity and NO (x) storage capacity, regardless of
   the type of storage phase. While for Pt/ceria containing samples, they
   exhibited relatively high NO (x) trapping ability although they showed
   relatively poor NO oxidation activity. DRIFTS results indicated that NO
   (x) can be stored via a ``nitrite{''} route for Pt/ceria materials and
   via a ``NO2{''} route for the other materials. Among all the materials
   tested, a Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 sample was found to have the best activity in
   terms of NO (x) trapping and NO oxidation, as compared with samples like
   Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CeO2, as well as a commercial LNT. Characterization data
   showed that the addition of CeO2 to Pt/Al2O3 helped maintain metallic Pt
   dispersion on Al2O3 after aging. Pt sintering on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt
   oxidation on Pt/CeO2, induced by strong interaction with the support,
   limited NO oxidation and trapping in the corresponding samples. Besides
   the stabilization effect on Pt, the addition of CeO2 introduced more NO
   (x) adsorption sites, which contribute to the enhanced NO (x) trapping
   observed. In addition, Pt dispersion was found to affect stored nitrate
   stability. Due to enhanced Pt dispersion by ceria modification, nitrates
   on Al2O3 decomposed at much lower temperature on Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 compared
   to Pt/Al2O3.}},

Abstract = {{Rezanezhad, F., Price, J. S. and Craig, J. R. 2012. The effects of dual
   porosity on transport and retardation in peat: A laboratory experiment.
   Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 723-732. Peat lands cover up to half of the local
   landscape in the Athabasca oil sands region, and peat materials are
   commonly used in reclamation. The toxicity of oil sands process-affected
   water (OSPW) derived from the Athabasca oil sands is related to the
   elevated concentration of naphthenic acids (NAs) and sodium (Na).
   However, the transport and retardation of solutes through peat is
   significantly delayed by sorption and by diffusion into immobile water
   contained in the peat matrix. Approximately 94\% of the 43.5 mg L-1 of
   OSPW was sorbed by 1 kg of peat. For Na similar to 84\% sorption
   occurred with 382 mg L-1 kg(-1) of peat. The sorption and desorption of
   NAs and Na on peat fitted linear isotherms with distribution
   coefficients of 6.53 and 5.74 L kg(-1), respectively. Solute
   breakthrough tests were performed for NaCl and the retardation due to
   sorption (R) of 1.73 was estimated for Na using a two-region (mobile and
   immobile) non-equilibrium transport model. However, the estimated mass
   transfer coefficient describing solute exchange between the mobile and
   immobile liquid regions indicated that part of retardation is attributed
   to solute exchange between the mobile and immobile phases. This was
   evident because Cl, a conservative solute (R = 1, no sorption), also
   exhibited characteristics of dual-porosity transport. Thus, the passage
   of the solute front was retarded by diffusion of solute into the
   immobile region and by solute exchange between the mobile and immobile
   phases, which occurs at a rate depending on the proportion of
   mobile/immobile pore spaces. In this study, we showed that the complex
   dual-porosity structure of the peat is the important factor in
   attenuating solute transport where the presence of immobile phase
   (dead-end pores) in the system contributes to the transport and sorption
   mechanism of solute into this porous medium.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing materials are an essential element for the fabrication of
   microfluidic chips. PDMS, the most widely used polymeric material, is
   associated with apparent disadvantages such as hydrophobic nature, while
   other materials also suffer from some limitations. In this paper, a new
   soft lithographic route was proposed for the facile manufacturing of
   hydrophilic sandwich microchips, using bisphenol A based epoxy acrylate
   (BABEA) as a new patterning material. The BABEA copolymers are
   hydrophilic, highly transparent in visible range while highly
   untransparent when the wavelength is less than 290 nm, and of high
   replication fidelity. By combining with appropriate monomers, including
   glycidyl methacrylate, methylmethacrylate, and acrylic acid, the
   copolymers contain active functional groups, which allows for easy
   postmodification for desirable functional units. A fabrication procedure
   was proposed for manufacturing hybrid quartz/BABEA copolymer/quartz
   microchips. In the procedure, no micromachining equipments, wet etching,
   or imprinting techniques were involved, making the fabrication approach
   applicable in ordinary chemistry laboratories. The performance of the
   prepared microchips was demonstrated in terms of CIEF with UV-whole
   channel imaging detection. The hydrophilic microchannel ensures stable
   focusing while the polymeric middle layer acts as a perfectly aligned
   optical slit for whole channel UV absorbance detection.}},

Abstract = {{The peroxide-initiated degradation of polypropylene in conventional
   screw elements of closely intermeshing twin-screw extruders is analyzed
   by means of a three-dimensional (3D) simulation approach. The 3D
   simulations of the reacting flow are implemented under the assumption of
   steady-state flow conditions, and scale-up considerations are addressed
   by simulating screw elements of two different size extruders. The
   effects of the initial peroxide concentration and reference mass
   throughputs on processing parameters are analyzed in terms of the
   specified extruder size. In this study, the scaled-up mass throughput is
   determined under the assumption of constant residence time. For the
   implemented processing conditions, the final values of the weigh-average
   molecular weight (Mw) and polidispersity index (PDI) for both the
   reference and scaled-up screw elements are similar when the flow rate is

Abstract = {{Progress in using biomimetic micropatterning of surfaces for tuning of
   wetting and adhesion properties of polymeric materials is reported.
   Surface patterning with low aspect ratios and low surface energy leads
   to superhydrophobicity and low adhesion while surface patterning with
   high aspect ratios leads to high adhesion. The condition of high aspect
   ratio and/or high number density creates the risk of fibril bundling
   owing to the adhesion between fibrils. A thin film-terminated structure
   can help overcome this problem and increase adhesion. In contrast to the
   spatular contacts, the conformal adhesion at interface can be enhanced
   significantly by creating micropatterns; the enhancement monotonically
   increases with the aspect ratios, where the side-wall friction plays an
   important role.}},

Abstract = {{In the control of linear time-invariant (LTI) decentralized systems, a

   complicated decentralized controllers; the ones which cannot are
   labelled quotient DFMs (QDFMs), since they arise from a related quotient
   system. The classical algorithm used to compute the QDFMs requires two
   steps: a partitioning of the sub-systems, using graph theory, followed
   by the application of standard tools from decentralized control. Here
   the goal is to provide a more direct approach to computing them. (C)

Title = {{Electrokinetic motion of a rectangular nanoparticle in a nanochannel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a theoretical study of electrokinetic motion of a
   negatively charged cubic nanoparticle in a three-dimensional nanochannel
   with a circular cross-section. Effects of the electrophoretic and the
   hydrodynamic forces on the nanoparticle motion are examined. Because of
   the large applied electric field over the nanochannel, the impact of the
   Brownian force is negligible in comparison with the electrophoretic and
   the hydrodynamic forces. The conventional theories of electrokinetics
   such as the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   slip velocity approach are no longer applicable in the small
   nanochannels. In this study, and at each time step, first, a set of
   highly coupled partial differential equations including the
   Poisson-Nernst-Plank equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the
   continuity equation was solved to find the electric potential, ionic
   concentration field, and the flow field around the nanoparticle. Then,
   the electrophoretic and hydrodynamic forces acting on the negatively
   charged nanoparticle were determined. Following that, the Newton second
   law was utilized to find the velocity of the nanoparticle. Using this
   model, effects of surface electric charge of the nanochannel, bulk ionic
   concentration, the size of the nanoparticle, and the radius of the
   nanochannel on the nanoparticle motion were investigated. Increasing the
   bulk ionic concentration or the surface charge of the nanochannel will
   increase the electroosmotic flow, and hence affect the particle's
   motion. It was also shown that, unlike microchannels with thin EDL, the
   change in nanochannel size will change the EDL field and the ionic
   concentration field in the nanochannel, affecting the particle's motion.
   If the nanochannel size is fixed, a larger particle will move faster
   than a smaller particle under the same conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Graphite oxide synthesized with phosphoric acid, labeled ``GOP{''},
   shows a higher degree of oxidation and has a larger interlayer spacing
   than the oxide prepared using the conventional Hummers method, referred
   to as ``GOH{''}, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   X-ray diffraction analyses. This study was performed under the
   assumption that the oxygen-containing functional groups between the GOP
   layers are more easily reduced than those between the GOH layers. Raman
   analysis supported this assumption in that the reduced graphene from GOP
   has a larger number of sp(2) carbons and fewer defects than the graphene
   obtained from GOH. The relative extent of defects in graphene can be
   investigated by dibenzothiophene (DBT) adsorption, which requires pi-pi
   interactions between the free g-bonds of sp(2) atoms from graphene and
   those from the aromatic ring of DBT. The graphene obtained from GOP
   showed higher DBT adsorption capacity than that synthesized from GOH. In
   addition, the DBT adsorption capacity on graphene decreased as the
   concentrations of other aromatic compounds increased.}},

Abstract = {{A new framework for the graph model for conflict resolution is developed
   so that decision makers (DMs) with fuzzy preferences can be included in
   conflict models. A graph model is both a formal representation for
   multiple participant-multiple objective decision problems and a set of
   analysis procedures that add insights into them. Within the new
   framework, graph models can include-and integrate into the analysis-both
   certain and uncertain information about DMs' preferences. One key
   contribution of this study is to extend the four basic stability
   definitions for two or more DMs to models with fuzzy preferences.
   Together, fuzzy Nash stability, fuzzy general metarationality, fuzzy
   symmetric metarationality, and fuzzy sequential stability provide a
   nuanced description of human behavior. A state is fuzzy stable for a DM
   if amove to any other state is not sufficiently likely to yield an
   outcome which the DM prefers, where sufficiency is measured according to
   a fuzzy satisficing threshold that is the characteristic of the DM. A
   fuzzy equilibrium, which is an outcome that is fuzzy stable for all DMs,
   therefore represents a possible resolution of the strategic conflict.
   The practical application and interpretation of these new stability
   definitions are illustrated with an example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a two-hop network in which information is
   transmitted from a source via a relay to a destination. It is assumed
   that channels are quasi-static fading with additive white Gaussian noise
   and that all nodes are equipped with a single antenna. The channel state
   information (CSI) of each hop is available only at the corresponding
   receiver and relay is not capable of data buffering over multiple coding
   blocks. One commonly used design criterion in such configurations is the
   maximization of the average received rate at the destination.
   Considering infinite-layer coding at both the source and the relay, in
   conjunction with decode and forward strategy at the relay, we present a
   procedure to optimally distribute the available source and relay powers
   to different layers of their corresponding codes. Next, we demonstrate
   how this transmission technique can be generalized to a multihop
   setting. Assuming Rayleigh fading, the performance of the proposed
   coding scheme is evaluated for a two-hop network and compared with the
   performance of previously known strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced-reference image quality assessment (RR-IQA) provides a practical
   solution for automatic image quality evaluations in various applications
   where only partial information about the original reference image is
   accessible. In this paper, we propose an RR-IQA method by estimating the
   structural similarity index (SSIM), which is a widely used
   full-reference (FR) image quality measure shown to be a good indicator
   of perceptual image quality. Specifically, we extract statistical
   features from a multiscale multiorientation divisive normalization
   transform and develop a distortion measure by following the philosophy
   in the construction of SSIM. We find an interesting linear relationship
   between the FR SSIM measure and our RR estimate when the image
   distortion type is fixed. A regression-by-discretization method is then
   applied to normalize our measure across image distortion types. We use
   six publicly available subject-rated databases to test the proposed
   RR-SSIM method, which shows strong correlations with both SSIM and
   subjective quality evaluations. Finally, we introduce the novel idea of
   partially repairing an image using RR features and use deblurring as an
   example to demonstrate its application.}},

Title = {{Multilayer bonding using a conformal adsorbate film (CAF) for the
   fabrication of 3D monolithic microfluidic devices in photopolymer}},

Abstract = {{Reliable microfabrication processes and materials compatible with
   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology are required
   by industry for the mass production of complex and highly miniaturized
   lab-on-a-chip systems. Photopolymers are commonly used in the
   semiconductor industry, and are suitable for the integration of
   multilayer structures onto CMOS substrates. This paper describes a novel
   photopolymer bonding process compatible with CMOS technology for the
   fabrication of three-dimensional monolithic microfluidic devices. The
   process consists of the formation of a conformal adsorbate film (CAF)
   approximately 15 nm thick on a patterned photopolymer layer (KMPR),
   thereby increasing the number of open polymer chains at the bonding
   interface and acting as an ultra-thin adhesive layer. This thin adhesive
   layer is made of the same photopolymer as the microfluidic structures,
   but has a substantially lower crosslinking density so it will be able to
   make better bonds during a thermocompressive bonding step. This CAF
   treatment substantially improves the bonding yield between two patterned
   and previously crosslinked photopolymer layers because both optimum
   structure strength (to resist deformation during bonding) and bonding
   strength from epoxy crosslinking can be achieved. We demonstrate high
   bonding yields of up to 99\% of the useful area of the substrate after
   three successive bonding steps. With this technique, up to six layers
   have been bonded in a single device. Unlike previously reported methods
   the quality of bonding is mostly decoupled from soft-bake parameters and
   crosslinking level of the previously patterned layers. Three different
   bonding processes were characterized to describe the bonding mechanism
   and the differences between the presented method and the
   partial-crosslinking bonding method. Capillary filling experiments were
   performed in microchannels of multilayer structures built with the CAF
   technique, without any observable leakage between layers.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate thermofluids model of aluminum direct-chill (DC) casting
   must solve the heat-transfer equations in the ingot with realistic
   external boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are typically
   separated into two zones: primary cooling, which occurs inside the
   water-cooled mold, and secondary cooling, where a film of water contacts
   the ingot surface directly. Here, a simple model for the primary cooling
   boundary condition of the steady-state DC casting process was developed.
   First, the water-cooled mold was modeled using a commercial
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, and its effective
   heat-transfer coefficient was determined. To predict the air-gap
   formation between the ingot and mold and to predict its effect on the
   primary cooling, a simple density-based shrinkage model of the
   solidifying shell was developed and compared with a more complex
   three-dimensional (3-D) thermoelastic model. DC casting simulations
   using these two models were performed for AA3003 and AA4045 aluminum
   alloys at two different casting speeds. A series of experiments was also
   performed using a laboratory-scale rectangular DC caster to measure the
   thermal history and sump shape of the DC cast ingots. Comparisons
   between the simulations and experimental results suggested that both
   models provide good agreement for the liquid sump profiles and the
   temperature distributions within the ingot. The density-based shrinkage
   model, however, is significantly easier to implement in a CFD code and
   is more computationally efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Discovering patterns from sequence data has significant impact in many
   aspects of science and society, especially in genomics and proteomics.
   Here we consider multiple strings as input sequence data and substrings
   as patterns. In the real world, usually a large set of patterns could be
   discovered yet many of them are redundant, thus degrading the output
   quality. This paper improves the output quality by removing two types of
   redundant patterns. First, the notion of delta tolerance closed itemset
   is employed to remove redundant patterns that are not delta closed.
   Second, the concept of statistically induced patterns is proposed to
   capture redundant patterns which seem to be statistically significant
   yet their significance is induced by their strong significant
   subpatterns. It is computationally intense to mine these nonredundant
   patterns (delta closed patterns and noninduced patterns). To efficiently
   discover these patterns in very large sequence data, two efficient
   algorithms have been developed through innovative use of suffix tree.
   Three sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate their performance.
   They render excellent results when applying to genomics. The experiments
   confirm that the proposed algorithms are efficient and that they produce
   a relatively small set of patterns which reveal interesting information
   in the sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide-expanded methanol (CXM) is for the first time employed to
   recover Wilkinson's catalyst from the matrix of hydrogenated nitrile
   butadiene rubber (HNBR) using the chelating agent N,N,N',N',N
   `'-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA). The effects of temperature
   and pressure on the extraction performance were carefully investigated
   over the temperature range of 40-100 degrees C and the pressure range of
   20-20 MPa. Increasing temperature effectively increased the extraction
   rate and became less influential when temperature is above 80 degrees C.
   Increasing pressure over the different pressure ranges at 80 degrees C
   impacted the extraction rate differently. 6 MPa was considered as the
   optimal pressure at 80 degrees C. The rhodium residue was reduced from
   700 to 222 ppm by a 5 h extraction at 6 MPa and 80 degrees C. An
   extraction mechanism was illustrated for interpreting the present
   extraction system and guiding the future work. This study establishes a

Abstract = {{Retrieved knee implants were examined to investigate the influence of
   patient and implant related factors on backside damage. Fifty-two
   implants of three different models were examined that all had cemented
   tibial trays without screw holes. A semi-quantitative grading system
   supplied backside damage scores (BDS) for each polyethylene (PE) tibial
   insert. Evidence was obtained to support the use of a constraining
   partial-peripheral locking mechanism and polished tibial tray surface
   (particularly for male patients) to reduce backside damage. Overall,
   male patients in the present study were associated with higher body mass
   and higher BDS compared with female patients. Furthermore, PE inserts
   sterilized by gamma-in-air had higher BDS than PE inserts sterilized in
   inert environments (gas-plasma or ethylene-oxide). Also, the proximal
   surfaces of tibial trays that had been grit-blasted showed embedded
   particles that may have increased backside damage. While none of these
   overall findings was unexpected, the present study provided detailed
   supporting analysis based on data from clinical retrievals, which may

Abstract = {{Fine-grained dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) is an important
   tool in managing the balance between power and performance in
   chip-multiprocessors. Although manufacturing process variations are
   giving rise to significant core-to-core variations in power and
   performance, traditional DVFS controllers are unaware of these
   variations. Exploiting the different power profiles of the cores can
   significantly improve energy efficiency. Process variations do not
   significantly affect dynamic power, so less-leaky processing units are
   more energy-efficient than their leakier counterparts at a given supply
   voltage and frequency. Taking advantage of this observation, three
   existing DVFS control algorithms are modified to shift work from
   inefficient, leaky processing units to efficient, less leaky ones,
   maintaining performance while reducing total power consumption. This
   work-shifting is carried out both between dies in a given speed bin and
   between voltage/frequency islands on a given die. The gains enabled by
   incorporating variability-awareness into the three DVFS algorithms are
   demonstrated on both multithreaded and multiprogrammed workloads. For a
   baseline 16-core design with per-core voltage/frequency islands (VFIs)
   and a 4 x 4 mesh on-chip network, the aggregate power per squared
   throughput (power/throughput(2) or P/T-2) over all fabricated dies is
   reduced by 9.2\%, 5.7\%, and 7.7\% for the three controllers. Chip
   multiprocessor designs using other VFI granularities and network
   topologies are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{The uniaxial fully reversed (R = -1) long life fatigue behavior of four
   shot-peened engineering steels with approximately the same hardness was
   investigated. Shot-peening, air-cooled forged AISI 1141 and crackable
   AISI 1070 steels had little effect on their fatigue limits (+2.5 and
   -2.0 pct, respectively). In the case of a powder forged 0.5 pct C steel,
   an increase in the fatigue limit of 10.4 pct was observed, albeit with a
   large standard deviation. Shot-peening quench and tempered AISI 1151
   steel decreased its fatigue limit 12.0 pct, as a result of cyclic
   softening. In general, the beneficial effects of shot-peening these
   smooth specimens were relatively small. Neither cyclic softening nor

Abstract = {{Nitinol has revolutionized many traditional engineering designs with its
   unique properties that include pseudoelasticity and the shape-memory
   effect (SME). However, the general lack of understanding on welding
   Nitinol limits its full potential in practical applications. The current
   study examined the microstructure and mechanical properties of
   resistance microwelded (RMW) Ni-rich Nitinol wires at different applied
   currents. The results revealed a solid-state bonding mechanism that
   consisted of six main stages, including (1) cold collapse, (2) dynamic
   recrystallization, (3) interfacial melting, (4) squeeze out, (5)
   excessive flash, and (6) surface melting. The joint strength and
   fracture mechanism were linked closely to the metallurgical properties
   of the welds. Through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) testing,
   it was found that the weld metal underwent phase transformation at lower
   temperatures compared with the base material. Also, the pseudoelastic
   property of Nitinol was found to have a large effect on the contact
   resistance during the onset of welding current. Compression tests with
   varying temperatures confirmed distinct differences in displacement
   (i.e., cold collapse) under the welding load of 5 kg-f caused by changes
   in the thermodynamic stability of the austenite phase. Both the dynamic
   resistance and displacement measurements were found to be significantly
   different during the RMW of Nitinol crossed wires compared with welding
   316 low-vacuum melted (LVM) stainless steel (SS) crossed wires.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new structural design is proposed which allows the
   tuning of the thermomechanical response of a bimaterial microcantilever.
   Through altering its cross section, it is shown that the bimaterial
   microcantilever can be tailored to either bend up or down when
   temperature increases, with tunable thermomechanical response. To prove
   the new design concept, various gold-polysilicon test specimens with
   capacitance readout system were fabricated using the PolyMUMPs (R)
   foundry process. Thermal loading experiments performed on these devices
   show good agreement with analytical modeling and finite element
   simulations. The new design concept is then used to show how the problem
   of sensitivity to temperature in gold-polysilicon bimaterial
   microcantilevers can be minimized for temperatures up to 100 degrees C.

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to furnish the research and design
   communities with a simple and convenient means of predicting quantities
   of engineering interest for slip flow in doubly connected microchannels.
   Slip flow in doubly connected microchannels has been examined and a
   simple model is proposed to predict the friction factor and Reynolds
   number product. As doubly connected regions are inherently more
   difficult to solve than simply connected regions, and for slip flow no
   solutions or graphical and tabulated data exist for nearly all doubly
   connected geometries, the developed simple model fills this void and can
   be used to predict friction factor and Reynolds number product, mass
   flow rate, pressure distribution, and pressure drop of slip flow in
   doubly connected microchannels for the practical engineering design of
   doubly connected microchannels. The proposed models are preferable since
   the effects of various independent parameters are demonstrated and the
   difficulty and investment is completely negligible compared with the
   cost of alternative numerical methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{745-755}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In air hybrid vehicles, there are two independent braking systems:
   frictional and regenerative. Since the regenerative braking torque is
   proportional to the parameters such as tank pressure and engine speed, a
   controller is needed for the control of the regenerative braking torque
   generated by internal combustion engine, based on the driver preference.
   In this work, a nonlinear control approach based on adaptive
   sliding-mode control (ASMC) is employed to tackle the problem of engine
   torque control during regenerative mode. To this end, a novel mean value
   model for a recently proposed cam-based air hybrid engine is derived for
   the regenerative mode and employed for designing the controller. The
   adaptive sliding-mode controller incorporates the approximately known
   inverse dynamic model output of the engine as a model-base component of
   the controller, and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the
   unmodeled dynamics, external disturbances (e. g., gear shifting), and
   time-varying system parameters such as tank pressure. The robustness and
   performance of the controller for this particular application is
   investigated and compared with that of a high-gain PID controller and a
   smooth sliding-mode controller numerically and experimentally. The
   results show that the controller performs remarkably well in terms of
   the robustness, tracking error convergence, and disturbance attenuation.
   Chattering effect is also removed by utilizing the ASMC scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Dislocation is defined as the change between discrete sequential
   locations of critical items in field environments such as large
   construction projects. Dislocations on large sites of materials and
   critical items for which discrete time position estimates are available
   represent critical state changes. The ability to detect dislocations
   automatically for tens of thousands of items can ultimately improve
   project performance significantly. Detecting these dislocations in a
   noisy information environment where low cost radio frequency
   identification tags are attached to each piece of material, and the
   material is moved sometimes only a few meters, is the main focus of this
   study. We propose in this paper a method developed in the frame of
   belief functions to detect dislocations. The belief function framework
   is well-suited for such a problem where both uncertainty and imprecision
   are inherent to the problem. We also show how to deal with the
   calculations. This method has been implemented in a controlled
   experimental setting. The results of these experiments show the ability
   of the proposed method to detect materials dislocation over the site
   reliably. Broader application of this approach to both animate and
   inanimate objects is possible. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An integrative conflict analysis approach, incorporating an Analytic

   successful operations and maintenance of the port facilities to handle
   international trade during the past few decades, the west coast is now
   facing increasing congestion problems, resulting in significant delays
   in transporting goods from the west coast to other parts of Canada and

   potential resolutions in which Canada would expand port facilities at

Title = {{Review of surrogate modeling in water resources}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Surrogate modeling, also called metamodeling, has evolved and been
   extensively used over the past decades. A wide variety of methods and
   tools have been introduced for surrogate modeling aiming to develop and
   utilize computationally more efficient surrogates of high-fidelity
   models mostly in optimization frameworks. This paper reviews, analyzes,
   and categorizes research efforts on surrogate modeling and applications
   with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the water resources
   field. The review analyzes 48 references on surrogate modeling arising
   from water resources and also screens out more than 100 references from
   the broader research community. Two broad families of surrogates namely
   response surface surrogates, which are statistical or empirical
   data-driven models emulating the high-fidelity model responses, and
   lower-fidelity physically based surrogates, which are simplified models
   of the original system, are detailed in this paper. Taxonomies on
   surrogate modeling frameworks, practical details, advances, challenges,
   and limitations are outlined. Important observations and some guidance
   for surrogate modeling decisions are provided along with a list of
   important future research directions that would benefit the common
   sampling and search (optimization) analyses found in water resources.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive fluorescence microscopy has been proposed as a promising
   approach for fast acquisitions at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. Given that
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very important in the design of
   fluorescence microscopy systems, a new saliency-guided sparse
   reconstruction ensemble fusion system has been proposed for improving
   SNR in compressive fluorescence microscopy. This system produces an
   ensemble of sparse reconstructions using adaptively optimized
   probability density functions derived based on underlying saliency
   rather than the common uniform random sampling approach. The ensemble of
   sparse reconstructions are then fused together via ensemble expectation
   merging. Experimental results using real fluorescence microscopy data
   sets show that significantly improved SNR can be achieved when compared
   to existing compressive fluorescence microscopy approaches, with SNR
   increases of 16-9 dB within the noise range of 1.5\%-10\% standard
   deviation at the same compression rate. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Around 40\% of the current world conventional oil production comes from
   carbonate reservoirs, dominantly mature and declining giant oilfields.
   Tertiary oil production methods as part of an Enhanced Oil Recovery
   (EOR) scheme are inevitable after primary and secondary oil production.
   The goal of surfactant flooding is to reduce the mobility ratio by
   lowering the interfacial tension between oil and water and mobilizing
   the residual oil. This paper highlights adsorption kinetics and
   equilibrium of Glycyrrhiza Glabra, a novel surfactant, in aqueous
   solutions for EOR and reservoir stimulation purposes. A conductivity
   technique was used to assess adsorption of the surfactant in the aqueous
   phase. Batch experimental runs were also performed at various
   temperatures to understand the effect of adsorbate dose on the sorption
   efficiency. The adsorption kinetics was experimentally investigated at
   room temperature (27 degrees C) by monitoring the uptake of the
   Glycyrrhiza Glabra as a function of time. The adsorption data were
   examined using different adsorption equilibrium and kinetic models. The
   Langmuir isotherm suits the equilibrium data very well. A pseudo-second
   order kinetic model can satisfactorily estimate the kinetics of the
   surfactant adsorption on carbonates. Results obtained from this research
   can help in selecting appropriate surfactants for design of EOR schemes
   and reservoir stimulation plans for carbonate reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene
   (UHMWPE)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites with
   different nanotube concentrations (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 wt \%) were
   prepared via in situ polymerization with a novel, bisupported
   ZieglerNatta catalytic system. Magnesium ethoxide {[}Mg(OEt)2] and
   surface-functionalized MWCNTs were used as the support of the catalyst.
   Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) accompanied by triethylaluminum
   constituted the ZieglerNatta catalytic system. Preparation of the
   catalyst and the polymerization were carried out in the slurry phase
   under an argon atmosphere. Support of the catalyst on the MWCNTs was
   investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results
   confirmed the interaction between the catalyst and the MWCNT hydroxyl
   groups. Intrinsic viscosity measurements showed an ultrahigh molecular
   weight in the produced samples. Scanning electron microscopy images
   confirmed the good dispersion of MWCNTs throughout the polyethylene (PE)
   matrix. The crystallization behavior of the samples was examined with
   differential scanning calorimetry. Its results showed that the crystal
   content of the samples increased with increasing MWCNT concentration up
   to 1.5 wt \%. The same trend was observed for the crystallization
   temperature, whereas the melting temperature did not change with
   increasing MWCNT concentration up to 1.5 wt \%, but it decreased beyond
   this concentration. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis results
   showed that the addition of MWCNTs noticeably improved all of the
   investigated thermal stability factors of the UHMWPE/MWCNT
   nanocomposites compared to those of pure PE. The results obtained from
   tensile testing revealed significant increases in the Young's modulus,
   yield stress, and ultimate tensile strength. This indicated a tremendous
   improvement in the mechanical properties of the PE/MWCNT nanocomposites
   compared to those of pure PE. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl

Abstract = {{Effects of processing sequence on the clay dispersion, phase morphology,
   and thermal and rheological properties of PA6-HDPE-clay nanocomposites
   are investigated in this study. It has been found that the processing
   sequence plays a key role in the clay dispersion and phase morphology of
   the PA6-HDPE-clay nanocomposites. When PA6 is extruded with clay first,
   either in the absence or presence of HDPE, a continuous PA6 phase domain
   forms with exfoliated clay platelets that seem to have strong
   interaction with the dispersed HDPE droplets, leading to a favorable
   phase morphology. When HDPE is extruded with clay in the first
   extrusion, nonpolar HDPE molecules are sheared into the clay interlayers
   and form HDPE intercalated clay, and the HDPE-clay aggregates do not
   have strong interactions with PA6 in the second extrusion, resulting in
   a phase morphology of large HDPE particles of hundreds of microns in
   size dispersed in PA6 phase. The DSC results indicate strong interaction
   between the polymers and clay; in particular, it is shown there is
   stabilization of ?-form crystals by the compatibilizer (PEMA).
   Rheological characterization indicates that the PA6-HDPE-clay
   nanocomposites exhibit significantly high storage and complex viscosity
   in the entire frequency range, and the loss modulus of the
   nanocomposites that have an exfoliated clay dispersion is lower than
   that of PA6 at high frequency. The results of this study suggest two
   types of microstructures of the PA6-HDPE-clay nanocomposites are
   possible using different processing sequences. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The effects of C3H6 on key SCR reactions over a model Cu/beta zeolite
   catalyst were characterized using step-response method reactor testing.
   Under standard SCR conditions, C3H6 clearly inhibited the reduction
   reaction at 200 degrees C and above. The inhibition was not caused by
   competitive adsorption between C3H6 and NH3, but by surface intermediate
   species formed during C3H6 oxidation, including acrolein-like and coke
   species as indicated by in situ DRIFTS. Similar to the standard SCR
   reaction, C3H6 also had a negative effect on the fast SCR reaction.
   Spaci-FTIR (spatially resolved capillary-inlet Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy) results indicated that NO2 was quickly reduced to
   NO by C3H6, leading to the occurrence of some standard SCR instead of
   purely fast SCR. However, C3H6 had a positive effect on NO2 SCR. The
   reduction of NO2 to NO by C3H6 resulted in the occurrence of the fast
   SCR reaction combined with NO2 SCR instead of pure NO2 SCR. The reaction
   pathway change also decreased N2O formation significantly. (C) 2012

   transition corresponded to the formation of larger aggregates consisting
   of several preformed micelles. This hypothesis was confirmed by light

Abstract = {{Understanding the physics of injection techniques required for large
   scale geological sequestration of CO2 is very important in order to
   mitigate the global warming in an effective and economical manner. In
   this paper, an analytical solution is presented to formulate the size of
   the CO2 droplets in terms of process parameters for Ex Situ Dissolution
   Approach (ESDA). The proposed solution is valid for turbulent bubbly
   flow regime and explicitly accounts for mass transfer and pressure
   changes along the pipeline length. Some technical and economic aspects
   of the ESDA are also addressed. In addition, the governing equation of
   mass transfer was numerically solved using the MATLAB (R) software.
   Comparison of the numerical and analytical results shows a good
   agreement for wide ranges of thermodynamic and flow conditions. The
   proposed analytical solution is very useful to estimate the length of
   pipeline required for full dissolution of CO2 droplets prior to
   injection into the ground. Results presented in this study indicate that
   the wellbore tubing could eliminate the need of horizontal mixing pipe
   in the ESDA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{374-380}},

Abstract = {{A Ni0.95La0.05O-SDC composite was tested as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
   anode fueled with methane at temperatures between 500 and 600 degrees C
   (i.e. for low temperature SOFC). It was found that NiO and La2O3 formed
   a solid solution and small amounts of La2NiO4 were also observed after
   sintering at 1340 degrees C. After subsequent reduction. NiO was reduced
   to Ni while La2O3 remained as oxide phase. The La modified NiO-SDC anode
   showed higher OCV, over 30\% improved maximum power density and better
   stability in humidified methane fuel as compared with the NiO-SDC anode.
   Meanwhile, the Ni0.95La0.05O-SDC anode cell displayed lower polarization
   resistance (e.g. at 600 degrees C, 0.12 Omega cm(-2) versus 0.34 Omega
   cm(-2) for NiO-SDC) implying higher surface reaction activity than the
   NiO-SDC anode cell. At 600 degrees C. the Ni0.95La0.05O-SDC anode
   exhibited similar performance and activity in H-2 and CH4 fuels. The SEM
   results indicated that La effectively prevented NiO coarsening giving
   rise to a much finer structure with smaller particle size and more
   uniform distribution, which can contribute to the better performance
   with La. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical ordered silicon nanowire arrays with diameters ranging from 30
   to 60 nm are fabricated and display enhanced Raman scattering. The
   first-order 520 cm(-1) phonon mode shows no significant shift or peak
   broadening with increasing laser power, suggesting that the excellent
   defect-free diamond crystalline structure and thermal properties of bulk
   silicon are maintained. The Raman enhancement per unit volume of the
   first-order phonon peak increases with increasing nanowire diameter, and
   has maximum enhancement factors of 7.1 and 70 when compared to the
   original silicon on insulator (SOI) and bulk silicon wafers,
   respectively. For the array with 60 nm diameter nanowires, the total
   Raman intensity is larger than that of the SOI wafer. The results are
   understood using a model based on the confinement of light and are

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio is a promising approach for efficient utilization of
   radio spectrum. Due to its high spectral efficiency and flexibility,
   OFDM is considered as a good signaling scheme for cognitive radios. In
   this paper, we investigate the problem of cross-band interference
   minimization in OFDM-based cognitive systems. Cross-band interference is
   mainly caused by high OFDM sidelobes. In the first part of our work, we
   propose a framework to study the trade-off between two recently proposed
   techniques, adaptive symbol transition which is performed in the time
   domain, and active interference cancellation which is performed in the
   frequency domain. We use the trade-off study results to maximize the
   useful data rate for a desired level of interference. Simulation results
   show that the best trade-off depends on the configuration of spectral
   opportunities. In the second part, a new method for interference
   reduction in multiple-antenna cognitive systems is developed. We show
   that with knowledge of the channel, the secondary transmitted sequences
   can be jointly optimized over multiple antennas such that the
   interference at the primary receiver location is better minimized.
   Computer simulations demonstrate an improvement of almost 10 dB compared
   to separate-antenna optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Downstream purification often represents the most cost-intensive step in
   the manufacturing of recombinant proteins since conventional
   purification processes are lengthy, technically complicated, and
   time-consuming. To address this issue, herein we demonstrated the
   simultaneous clarification and purification of the extracellularly
   produced recombinant protein by Escherichia coli using an integrated
   system of tangential flow filtration and anion exchange membrane
   chromatography (TFF-AEMC). After cultivation in a bench-top bioreactor
   with 1 L working volume using the developed host/vector system for
   high-level expression and effective secretion of recombinant penicillin
   G acylase (PAC), the whole culture broth was applied directly to the
   established system. One-step purification of recombinant PAC was
   achieved based on the dual nature of membrane chromatography (i.e.
   microfiltration-sized pores and anion-exchange chemistry) and cross-flow
   operations. Most contaminant proteins in the extracellular medium were
   captured by the anion-exchange membrane and cells remained in the
   retentate, whereas extracellular PAC was purified and collected in the
   filtrate. The batch time for both cultivation and purification was less
   than 2411 and recombinant PAC with high purity (19 U/mg), yield (72\%
   recovery), and productivity (41 mg of purified PAC per liter of culture)
   was obtained. Due to the nature of the non-selective protein secretion
   system and the versatility of ion-exchange membrane chromatography, the
   developed system can be widely applied for effective production and
   purification of recombinant proteins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In a cooperative cognitive radio network, secondary users are able to
   negotiate with primary users for dedicated transmission opportunities
   through providing tangible service. Two novel and simple user
   cooperation frameworks are introduced to improve the spectral efficiency
   and utilization. To this end, an orthogonal signaling-based cooperation
   technology for leveraging the degrees of freedom in two-dimensional
   modulation is discussed. In the proposed framework, anSU is enabled to
   simultaneously transmit its own data and relay another user's packets in
   two orthogonal channels. Specifically, in the framework of user
   cooperation between PUs and SUs, a cross-layer design for cooperative
   communications between an active PU and an SU is first investigated. In
   the framework of cooperative spectrum leasing by a group of SUs, a
   cross-layer design for cooperation among SUs is then presented.
   Cooperation performance in terms of a weighed sum throughput
   maximization under certain power and throughput constraints is evaluated
   and analyzed in both frameworks via simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Fusion zone (FZ) of advanced high strength steel welds, with similar and
   dissimilar combinations, in diode laser welding was characterised in
   respect to microstructure, microhardness and tensile strength. Average
   FZ hardness and tensile properties were correlated to the respective
   microstructure and chemistry. A linear relationship of the FZ hardness
   with carbon content was observed for all welding combinations; however,
   carbon equivalent representing all the alloying elements in the FZ
   showed slightly better linear fit. The plot of calculated martensite
   hardness and experimental FZ hardness versus carbon content represented
   three regions: high carbon content, >0.15 wt-\%, leads to fully
   martensitic microstructure with good hardness matching; reducing the
   carbon content to 0.1-0.15wt-\% resulted in mixed microstructure
   consisting dominantly martensite with few fraction of ferrite giving
   hardness value just below martensite hardness; and for low carbon
   content the microstructure was dominantly soft ferrite phase causing
   large deviation from martensite hardness. Fusion zone tensile strength
   was observed to follow linear relationship with hardness.}},

Abstract = {{The extraction of nontrivial software product lines (SPL) from a legacy
   application is a time-consuming task. First, developers must identify
   the components responsible for the implementation of each program
   feature. Next, they must locate the lines of code that reference the
   components discovered in the previous step. Finally, they must extract
   those lines to independent modules or annotate them in some way. To
   speed up product line extraction, this paper describes a semi-automatic
   approach to annotate the code of optional features in SPLs. The proposed
   approach is based on an existing tool for product line development,
   called CIDE, that enhances standard IDEs with the ability to associate
   background colors with the lines of code that implement a feature. We
   have evaluated and successfully applied our approach to the extraction
   of optional features from three nontrivial systems: Prevayler (an
   in-memory database system), JFreeChart (a chart library), and ArgoUML (a
   UML modeling tool).}},

Abstract = {{To ensure that a modified software system has not regressed, one
   approach is to rerun existing test cases. However, this is a potentially
   costly task. To mitigate the costs, the testing effort can be optimized
   by executing only a selected subset of the test cases that are believed
   to have a better chance of revealing faults. This paper proposes a novel
   approach for selecting and ordering a predetermined number of test cases
   from an existing test suite. Our approach forms an Integer Linear
   Programming problem using two different coverage-based criteria, and
   uses constraint relaxation to find many close-to-optimal solution
   points. These points are then combined to obtain a final solution using
   a voting mechanism. The selected subset of test cases is then
   prioritized using a greedy algorithm that maximizes minimum coverage in
   an iterative manner. The proposed approach has been empirically
   evaluated and the results show significant improvements over existing
   approaches for some cases and comparable results for the rest. Moreover,
   our approach provides more consistency compared to existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on a numerical investigation of the effects of
   variation in working fluids and operating conditions on the performance
   of a thermoacoustic refrigerator. The performance of a thermoacoustic
   refrigerator is evaluated based on the cooling power, coefficient of
   performance (COP), and the entropy generation rate within the device.
   The effect of the variation of the working fluid is observed by changing
   the Prandtl number (Pr) between 0.7 and 0.28. The operating conditions
   investigated are drive ratio (DR), stack plate spacing (y(0)). and mean
   pressure (p(m)). The present research shows that lowering the Pr of the
   working fluid does not improve the performance of a thermoacoustic
   refrigerator for all of the selected operating conditions. COP increases
   78\% by reducing the Pr from 0.7 to 0.28 at y(0) = 3.33 delta(k), at
   atmospheric pressure and a DR of 1.7\%. While the COP decreases by
   reducing the Pr from 0.7 to 0.28 at y(0) = 1.0 delta(k), at atmospheric
   pressure, and a DR of 1.7\%. The results are compared with the available
   experimental data and found good agreement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There are extensive bitumen deposits in Canada that, with the
   development of sustainable exploitation technologies, can satisfy the
   energy requirements of the nation for more than a century. The currently
   available surface mining and in situ recovery techniques are applicable
   to only similar to 15\% of the known in-place resources. There is an
   obvious need for improved technology to make more of the in-place
   resources exploitable. This paper is aimed at studying the macroscale
   performance of the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and the
   solvent-aided SAGD (SA-SAGD) processes. A two-dimensional (2-D) physical
   model of porous media was designed and fabricated for the purpose of
   implementing these two processes. The physical model was packed with
   different sizes of glass beads to create porous media with different
   permeability values. Athabasca bitumen was used as the oil phase. All
   the SAGD and SA-SAGD experiments were performed in an isothermal jacket
   as the controlled-temperature environment to reduce the amount of
   undesired heat loss from the model to the surrounding environment. In
   addition., layers of insulating materials attached to wooden frames were
   used to cover the back and side faces of the packed model to further
   reduce the heat losses. All the experiments were conducted under the
   free uptake flow circulation methodology at atmospheric pressure. For
   the SAGD experiments, replicate trials were also designed and conducted
   in order to ensure the repeatability of the experiments. According to
   the SAGD experimental results, the average mobile oil production rate,
   as well as that of the dead oil, is constant over the course of the
   process. When all other experimental variables are unchanged except the
   porous medium permeability, the higher the permeability of the porous
   medium, the higher the amount of water content of the produced mobile
   oil, but the lower the steam-to-oil ratio. The residual oil saturation
   in the invaded region of the porous medium was obtained to be similar to
   3\%-4.6\% of the total pore volume at higher and lower permeability
   levels, respectively. Moreover, the microstructure of the dispersed
   water condensate droplets in the continuum of the produced mobile oil
   was studied with the aid of an advanced photomicrography system
   integrated with image processing unit. It was determined that water
   condensate droplets with equivalent sizes as small as 5 mu m were
   dispersed in the mobile oil background. Average droplet size values were
   measured for both of the permeability levels used in the SAGD
   experiments, based on the image processing of the microscopic snapshots
   taken from the produced emulsion samples. One SA-SAGD trial was also
   conducted in order to demonstrate the enhancement made in the production
   performance of the SAGD process, following the coinjection of solvent
   with steam. It was determined that the average mobile oil and dead oil
   production rates of the SA-SAGD process are reasonably constant over the
   course of the experiment. In the SA-SAGD process, there were
   enhancements of similar to 18\% and 20\% in the mobile oil and dead oil
   production rates, respectively, compared to the corresponding average
   values in the SAGD experiments at similar permeability values. The
   average water production rate and the SOR values of the SA-SAGD
   experiment: were similar to 9\% and similar to 35\% less than those of
   the corresponding SAGD trials, respectively.
   The microscopic snapshots of the produced water in oil emulsion were
   also studied for the case of the SA-SAGD experiment and it was obtained
   that water condensate droplets with an equivalent size of as small as 5
   mu m were dispersed in the continuum of the produced mobile oil. In
   addition, an average water droplet size range was determined based on
   the measurements using image processing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel, supported on porous alumina (gamma Al2O3), non-porous alumina
   (Al2O3), and porous silica, was used to catalyze methane cracking in a
   fluidized bed reactor for hydrogen production. The effects of
   temperature, P-CH4, and particle diameter, and their interactions, on
   methane conversion were studied with each catalyst. Temperature was the
   dominant parameter affecting the hydrogen production rate for all
   catalysts and particle diameter had the strongest effect on the total
   amount of carbon deposited. Maximum methane conversion as a function of
   support type followed the order Ni/SiO2 > Ni/uAl(2)O(3) > Ni/gamma
   Al2O3. Nonetheless, better fluidization quality was obtained with
   Ni/gamma Al2O3. Methane conversion was increased by increasing
   temperature and particle size from 108 to 275 pm due to better
   fluidization achieved with 275 pm particles. Increasing the flow rate
   and methane partial pressure (P-CH4) caused a drop in methane
   conversion. Tests were also run in a fixed bed reactor, and at constant
   weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), higher conversion was achieved in
   the fixed bed, but at the same time faster deactivation occurred since a
   higher methane conversion led to increase in carbon filament and
   encapsulating carbon formation rates. A critical problem with the fixed
   bed was the pressure build-up inside the reactor due to carbon
   accumulation. Finally, a series of cracking/regeneration cycle
   experiments were carried out in the fluidized bed reactor. The
   regeneration was performed through product carbon gasification in air.
   Ni/alpha Al2O3 and Ni/gamma Al2O3 activity decreased significantly with
   the first regeneration, which is attributed to Ni sintering during
   exothermic regeneration/carbon oxidation. However, Ni/SiO2 was thermally
   stable over at least three cracking/regeneration cycles, but mechanical
   attrition was observed. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Broader application of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes in drinking water
   treatment is limited by particulate and organic fouling. This
   pilot-scale study demonstrated the ability of rapid biofiltration
   (without prior coagulation or ozonation) to reduce fouling of a UF
   membrane treating river water over a two-year period. Three biofilter
   empty bed contact times (EBCTs; 5, 10, and 15 min) were investigated,
   using parallel dual-media filters followed by a hollow-fiber membrane
   unit. Using essentially conventional rapid filtration operating
   conditions, biofiltration pretreatment enabled stable membrane operation
   with respect to hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling.
   Increased biofiltration EBCTs led to lower rates of irreversible
   fouling. The results were reproducible, and biofiltration was able to
   provide effective pretreatment during all seasons (T = 1-25 degrees C).
   The biofilters also contributed to effective turbidity removal. Overall,
   biofiltration pretreatment for UF is a promising chemical-free
   alternative to coagulation pretreatment. A particular niche application
   could be in small or remote systems.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements on airfoils at low Reynolds numbers can have a strong
   dependence on the experimental setup as a result of the Sensitivity of
   the transitioning separated shear layer that develops over the model. In
   this investigation, the effects of two aspects of the experimental
   setup, namely end plates and test-section blockage, on
   low-Reynolds-number airfoil experiments are explored through
   measurements on a NACA 0018 airfoil model at a chord Reynolds number of
   100,000. The improvement in mean spanwise uniformity with end plates
   installed is quantified and demonstrates the importance of using end
   plates in two-dimensional airfoil experiments at low Reynolds numbers.
   Consistent with previous studies on the use of end plates on circular
   cylinder models, it is found that mean quantities measured on the
   center-span plane are least sensitive to end-plate spacing for spacings
   greater than roughly 7 times the projected model thickness. It is shown
   that the end-plate configuration affects vortex-shedding characteristics
   and disturbance amplification in the separated shear layer. Blockage
   effects are investigated by comparing measurements before and after
   adaptive-wall test-section streamlining for solid-blockage ratios
   between 4 and 8\%. These blockage ratios are shown to cause errors in
   lift as high as 9\% of the maximum lift and 33\% in the wake
   vortex-shedding frequency. The results of this investigation can he used
   to estimate the effects of blockage on flow development in
   low-Reynolds-number airfoil experiments. It is demonstrated that a
   common blockage-correction method can accurately correct lift
   measurements for moderate blockages in low-Reynolds-number airfoil
   experiments for conditions under which a separation bubble forms over
   the model.}},

Abstract = {{As essential building blocks of the future smart grid, microgrids can
   efficiently integrate various types of distributed generation (DG) units
   to supply the electric loads at the minimum cost based on the economic
   dispatch. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized economic dispatch
   approach such that the optimal decision on power generation is made by
   each DG unit locally without a central controller. The prerequisite
   power generation and load information for decision making is discovered
   by each DG unit via a multiagent coordination with guaranteed
   convergence. To avoid a slow convergence speed which potentially
   increases the generation cost because of the time-varying nature of DG
   output, we present a heterogeneous wireless network architecture for
   microgrids. Low-cost short-range wireless communication devices are used
   to establish an ad hoc network as a basic information exchange
   infrastructure, while auxiliary dual-mode devices with cellular
   communication capabilities are optionally activated to improve the
   convergence speed. Two multiagent coordination schemes are proposed for
   the single-stage and hierarchical operation modes, respectively. The
   optimal number of activated cellular communication devices is obtained
   based on the tradeoff between communication and generation costs. The
   performance of the proposed schemes is analyzed and evaluated based on
   real power generation and load data collected from the Waterloo Region
   in Canada. Numerical results indicate that our proposed schemes can
   better utilize the cellular communication links and achieve a desired
   tradeoff between the communication and generation costs as compared with
   the existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A series of ferrofluids were made using oleic acid-capped Co3O4 (cobalt
   oxide) nanoparticles in liquid paraffin by a high-energy
   milling/sonication method. The average physical size of the dry Co3O4
   nanoparticles was determined to be 21 nm by measuring the peak
   broadening of the (311) crystal plane from X-ray diffraction data of the
   nanopowder. The results of measurements by an alternative gradient force
   magnetometer indicated that the dry nanoparticles were paramagnetic. The
   prepared colloids were characterized by dynamic light scattering and
   found to contain aggregated nanoparticles having between 51 and 835
   individual particles per aggregate. The rheological properties of these
   ferrofluids were then studied using a standard rotating rheometer, both
   in the presence and absence of an externally applied magnetic field.
   Magnetoviscous and thixotropic effects on the ferrofluids viscosity were
   studied as both the nanoparticle concentration and the applied magnetic
   field was varied. Nanoparticle aggregation and its effect on the
   rheological properties of these ferrofluids is discussed (i.e. the
   interactions between nanoparticles and aggregates). At nanoparticle
   concentrations above 30 wt\%, a combined thixotropic/magnetoviscous
   effect on the fluids viscosity was observed. The ferrofluids exhibited a
   thixotropic behaviour with little magnetoviscous effect at more dilute
   nanoparticle concentrations, 25 wt\%.}},

   element based on an S-shaped geometry. This reconfigurable device can be
   integrated with magnetoresistive elements and is relatively simple to

   geometrical parameter space in which the logic element performs
   reliably. The influence of imperfections on the device characteristics,
   that is, sidewall roughness and roundedness of the edges, is
   investigated. Special attention is paid to obtain configurations with

Abstract = {{An RNA-DNA hybridization assay microfluidic chip integrated with
   electrothermally actuated phase change microvalves for detecting
   pathogenic bacteria is presented in this paper. In order to realize the
   sequential loading and washing processes required in such an assay,
   gravity-based pressure-driven flow and phase-change microvalves were
   used in the microfluidic chip. Paraffin wax was used as the phase change
   material in the valves and thin film heaters were used to
   electrothermally actuate microvalves. Light absorption measured by a
   photodetector to determine the concentrations of the samples. The
   automatic control of the complete assay was implemented by a self-coded
   LabVIEW program. To examine the performance of this chip, Salmonella was
   used as a sample pathogen. Significantly, reduction in reagent/sample
   consumption (up to 20 folds) was achieved by this on-chip assay,
   compared with using the commercial test kit following the same protocol
   in conventional labs. The experimental results show that the
   quantitative detection can be obtained in approximately 26 min, and the
   detection limit is as low as 10(3) CFU ml(-1). This RNA-DNA
   hybridization assay microfluidic chip shows an excellent potential in
   the development of a portable device for point-of-testing applications.}},

Abstract = {{A new conceptual integrated two-stage biomass gasifier and solid oxide
   fuel cell (SOFC) system is proposed and a multi-physics model for
   predicting the performance of this system is developed. A method
   coupling the modeling equations of a quasi 2-D model for SOFC, a 1-D
   model for pyrolysis reactor, and 0-D model for the remaining components
   is applied. Several parametric studies are conducted using the model
   developed. With the main objective of operating this system being
   maximizing the net power output, the results for the parametric studies
   conducted show that the number of SOFC stacks, the mass ratio of air to
   steam entering the gasifier, and the temperature of the pre-heated air
   entering the gasifier should be taken as high as possible; whereas the
   moisture ratio of the wet biomass should be minimized; and there is an
   optimum point for the rotational speed of the pyrolysis reactor. For the
   considered input data and the range of parameters studied, the maximum
   net power output of the system is found to be 93 kW. At this condition,
   the useful heat output, the electrical efficiency of the system, and the

   noisy measurements is unarguably one of the central problems in imaging
   sciences. Despite its ill-posed nature, this problem can often be solved
   in a unique and stable manner, provided appropriate assumptions on the
   nature of the images to be recovered. In this paper, however, a more
   challenging setting is considered, in which accurate knowledge of the
   blurring operator is lacking, thereby transforming the reconstruction
   problem at hand into a problem of blind deconvolution. As a specific
   application, the current presentation focuses on reconstruction of
   short-exposure optical images measured through atmospheric turbulence.
   The latter is known to give rise to random aberrations in the optical
   wavefront, which are in turn translated into random variations of the
   point spread function of the optical system in use. A standard way to
   track such variations involves using adaptive optics. Thus, for example,
   the Shack-Hartmann interferometer provides measurements of the optical
   wavefront through sensing its partial derivatives. In such a case, the
   accuracy of wavefront reconstruction is proportional to the number of
   lenslets used by the interferometer and, hence, to its complexity.
   Accordingly, in this paper, we show how to minimize the above complexity
   through reducing the number of the lenslets while compensating for
   undersampling artifacts by means of derivative compressed sensing.
   Additionally, we provide empirical proof that the above simplification
   and its associated solution scheme result in image reconstructions,
   whose quality is comparable to the reconstructions obtained using
   conventional ( dense) measurements of the optical wavefront.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the optimum tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing
   gains in a two-user quasi-static Rayleigh fading interference channel
   (IC) is studied. The diversity and multiplexing gains are two basic
   performance measures in wireless networks which characterize the
   transmission reliability and the data rate, respectively. It would be of
   interest to investigate the optimal tradeoff between these two measures.
   First, we develop a coding scheme for the two-user quasi-static Rayleigh
   fading Gaussian IC with interference level alpha:= log INR/logSNR >= 1.
   Then, for this coding scheme the achievable diversity-multiplexing
   tradeoff (DMT) is characterized. Our achievable DMT coincides with its
   outer bound. In the low and high rate regions (to be defined later), the
   proposed coding scheme is a one-level Gaussian code, independent of the
   channel state information (CSI). In the middle rate region (to be
   defined later), the proposed coding scheme, depending on the partial
   CSI, can be a one-level or a two-level Gaussian code. We show that the
   relevant partial CSI can be represented by only one bit determined by
   the absolute value of the channel gain. In the middle rate region, we
   assume that the single-bit partial CSI for all the four channel gains of
   the Gaussian IC are available at both transmitters.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical decision model is proposed to select the optimal quality
   control strategies among various alternatives to pursue the most
   satisfying quality improvement for the supply chain in producing a
   complex product, such as an aircraft, warship, or satellite. More
   specifically, a novel framework, referred to as house of supply chain
   quality (HSCQ), is designed to provide necessary information for
   managing the supply chain quality, which can be transformed to a
   multi-objective program to determine the optimal quality control
   strategies and allocate proper quality control resources. Based on the
   relationships of the suppliers in the supply chain, an HSCQ network can
   be constructed and an associated multilevel multi-objective program can
   be established as the hierarchical decision model, which assists the
   enterprises in different tiers to choose the optimal quality control
   strategies for managing the quality of their outsourcing products. The
   result can significantly improve the overall quality performance of the
   supply chain. A case study on an aircraft production system is conducted
   to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new model, which
   furnishes a fresh perspective on the supply chain quality management of
   a complex product.}},

   promising lead-free bonding technique used in the electronic packaging

   of fabricated joints. We investigated the influence of the coffee-ring
   effect and ways to depress it by changing the bonding material
   composition. Our results show that, when using polyol-based Ag NP paste
   as the bonding material, the coffee-ring effect was successfully
   depressed due to increased Marangoni flow. The corresponding shear
   strength of joints was increased significantly to 50 MPa at bonding

Abstract = {{Effective planning and control for complex construction projects
   requires reliable material tracking, effective supply chain visibility,
   and accurate progress estimation. These applications highlight the
   importance of real time location and progress tracking technologies such
   as Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), Global Positioning
   Systems (GPS), and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) Systems. This paper presents a
   performance analysis of a UWB positioning system as a material and
   activity tracking tool for indoor construction projects, with emphasis
   on field implementation and site validation. This research was designed
   in three phases and examined the performance deterioration of an UWB
   system in complete occlusion situations using timber and steel as
   blocking materials, analyzed the location dependency of UWB system error
   and investigated the potential for location based error modelling, and
   investigated the UWB system performance over the construction period of
   a progressively more heavily congested piping project. The statistical
   analysis of this research has produced confidence intervals for UWB
   system error in the various tested configurations to be used in future
   research. Also, the performance deterioration of the UWB system in an
   active construction environment has been quantified. Finally,
   recommendations are provided for effective system implementation in
   indoor construction projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   corrective actions, and schedule analysis. As-built documentation,
   however, has mainly been a manual process that is time-consuming and
   error-prone. This paper proposes a low-cost framework that utilizes
   prevailing communication tools (email) to develop a project-wide system
   for progress tracking and bidirectional communication between project
   participants and head office. The framework integrates three main
   components: email forms for site data collection; customized scheduling
   application; and customized email application. In the schedule, the
   activities automatically initiate email requests for as-built
   information using an email form that has a checklist of possible site
   events and enables supervisors to attach notes and any requests for
   information. On a daily basis, the system automatically reads the
   supervisors' response emails and updates the schedule with all recorded
   as-built details. The paper discusses the development of a prototype
   system and demonstrates its usefulness on a small bridge-pier foundation
   example. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A benchmarking framework for simulation-based optimization of
   environmental models}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{19-30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Simulation models assist with designing and managing environmental
   systems. Linking such models with optimization algorithms yields an
   approach for identifying least-cost solutions while satisfying system
   constraints. However, selecting the best optimization algorithm for a
   given problem is non-trivial and the community would benefit from
   benchmark problems for comparing various alternatives. To this end, we
   propose a set of six guidelines for developing effective benchmark
   problems for simulation-based optimization.
   The proposed guidelines were used to investigate problems involving
   sorptive landfill liners for containing and treating hazardous waste.
   Two solution approaches were applied to these types of problems for the
   first time - a pre-emptive (i.e. terminating simulations early when
   appropriate) particle swarm optimizer (PSO), and a hybrid discrete
   variant of the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm (HD-DDS). Model
   pre-emption yielded computational savings of up to 70\% relative to
   non-pre-emptive counterparts. Furthermore, HD-DDS often identified
   globally optimal designs while incurring minimal computational expense,
   relative to alternative algorithms. Results also highlight the
   usefulness of organizing decision variables in terms of cost values
   rather than grouping by material type. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{209}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model of a flowing-electrolyte direct methanol fuel
   cell has been developed to predict the performance of the cell under
   various operating conditions. Governing equations including the proton
   and electron transport, continuity, momentum, species transport for
   methanol, water, and oxygen, and the auxiliary equations are coupled to
   determine the output parameters. These parameters are the concentration
   distribution of the species, cell voltage, power density, and the
   electrical efficiency of the cell. After validation with the
   experimental data, several simulations are carried out to study the
   effects of the fluid velocity at the fuel, air, and flowing electrolyte
   channel inlets on the output parameters. In addition, the effect of
   recirculating the methanol at the flowing electrolyte channel outlet is
   assessed. The results show that higher fluid velocities at the fuel,
   air, and flowing electrolyte channel inlets are needed to obtain higher
   power densities. However, an increase in the fluid velocity at the fuel
   channel inlet causes a decrease in the electrical efficiency of the
   cell. Iris also found that the electrical efficiency of the FE-DMFC can
   be further increased if the methanol leaving the flowing electrolyte
   channel is recirculated into the methanol storage tank. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{430-462}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Distributed real-time systems require bounded communication delays and
   achieve them by means of a predictable and verifiable control mechanism
   for the communication medium. Real-time bus arbitration mechanisms
   control access to the medium and guarantee bounded communication delays.
   These arbitration mechanisms can be static dispatch tables or dynamic,
   algorithmic approaches.
   In this work, we introduce a real-time bus arbitration mechanism called
   tree schedules that takes the best parts of both sides: It can be
   analyzed like static dispatch tables, and it provides a certain degree
   of flexibility similar to algorithmic approaches. We present tree
   schedules as a framework to specify real-time traffic and introduce
   mechanisms to analyze it. We discuss how tree schedules can capture
   application-specific behavior in a time-triggered state-based supply
   model by means of conditional branching built into the model. We present
   analysis results for this model specifically aiming at schedulability in
   fixed and dynamic priority schemes and waiting time analysis. Finally,
   we demonstrate the advantages of state-based supply over stateless
   supply by means of two case studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, effects of particle size, air speed, and time factor on
   the short-term resuspension of micron and submicron particles in
   straight ventilation ducts were experimentally studied with a focus on
   the particles airborne from the inner surface of ventilation ducts. The
   experimental method was designed to monitor continuously the particle
   resuspension rate owing to lift-off. The duct systems were made of
   typical commercial materials. The particles tested were in eleven size
   groups in the range of 0.4-10 mu m. The experiments were conducted at
   six air speeds: 3.8, 5.1, 6.3, 7.1, 8.0, and 8.8 m/s and each test
   lasted for 180 s.
   The measured particle resuspension rates increased with the increases of
   the air speed to a certain values, ranging from 9.2 x 10(-11) s(-1) to
   3.7 x 10(-9) s(-1) corresponding to the particle size of 0.4-10 mu m,
   while the measured particle resuspension rate was smaller than previous
   reported results. The measurements also showed that particle
   resuspension rates were independent of time during the first 60 s and
   then decreased sharply. The experiments suggest that more particles
   slide and roll off rather than being lifted into the air flow and that
   higher air speed may reduce the amount of particles lifted into air flow
   as more of the particles may become airborne due to sliding and rolling
   off. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{119-127}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we aim to identify the different factors that influence
   injury severity of highway vehicle occupants, in particular drivers,
   involved in a vehicle-train collision at highway-railway grade
   crossings. The commonly used approach to modeling vehicle occupant
   injury severity is the traditional ordered response model that assumes
   the effect of various exogenous factors on injury severity to be
   constant across all accidents. The current research effort attempts to
   address this issue by applying an innovative latent segmentation based
   ordered logit model to evaluate the effects of various factors on the
   injury severity of vehicle drivers. In this model, the highway-railway
   crossings are assigned probabilistically to different segments based on
   their attributes with a separate injury severity component for each
   segment. The validity and strength of the formulated collision
   consequence model is tested using the US Federal Railroad Administration
   database which includes inventory data of all the railroad crossings in
   the US and collision data at these highway railway crossings from 1997
   to 2006. The model estimation results clearly highlight the existence of
   risk segmentation within the affected grade crossing population by the
   presence of active warning devices, presence of permanent structure near
   the crossing and roadway type. The key factors influencing injury
   severity include driver age, time of the accident, presence of snow
   and/or rain, vehicle role in the crash and motorist action prior to the
   crash. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the contact behaviors of a nanoscopic stiff thin film
   bonded to a compliant substrate and derived an analytical solution for
   determining the elastic modulus of thin films. Microscopic contact
   deformations of the gold and polydopamine thin films (<200 nm) coated on
   polydimethylsiloxane elastomers were measured by indenting a soft tip
   and analyzed in the framework of the classical plate theory and
   Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) contact mechanics. The analysis of this
   thin film contact mechanics focused on the bending and stretching
   resistance of thin films and is fundamentally different from
   conventional indentation measurements where the focus is on the fracture
   and compression of the films. The analytical solution of the elastic
   modulus of nanoscopic thin films was validated experimentally using SO
   and 100 nm gold thin films coated on polydimethylsiloxane elastomers.
   The technical application of this analysis was further demonstrated by
   measuring the elastic modulus of thin films of polydopamine, a recently
   discovered biomimetic universal coating material. Furthermore, the
   method presented here is able to quantify the contact behaviors of
   nanoscopic thin films, effectively providing fundamental design
   parameters, the elastic modulus, and the work of adhesion, crucial for
   transferring them effectively into practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Monodispersed polyisoprene-SiO2 nanoparticles were successfully
   synthesized by a differential micro-emulsion polymerization of isoprene
   on silane treated nanosilica. Core-shell morphology was formed
   consisting of silica as the nano-core encapsulated by polyisoprene (PIP)
   as the nano-shell, as confirmed by TEM. PIP-SiO2 nanoparticles were
   produced at 20-60 nm with a narrow size distribution resulting in a
   reduced nano-SiO2 aggregation in the PIP matrix. The influence of
   surfactant concentration, monomer/water ratio and SiO2 loading on
   particle size, monomer conversion as well as grafting efficiency was
   investigated. The monomer conversion was 87\% and the polymer grafting
   efficiency was as high as 78\% at an extremely low surfactant
   concentration (3 wt.\% based on monomer). For rubber applications, the
   PIP-SiO2 nanocomposite has been used as an effective nano-filler in
   natural rubber (NR) latex and the NR filled with PIP-SiO2 prevulcanizate
   clearly showed an improvement in the storage modulus, tensile strength,
   tensile modulus, and anti-ageing properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{We computationally study the effect of uniaxial strain in modulating the
   spontaneous emission of photons in silicon nanowires. Our main finding
   is that a one to two orders of magnitude change in spontaneous emission
   time occurs due to two distinct mechanisms: (A) Change in wave function
   symmetry, where within the direct bandgap regime, strain changes the
   symmetry of wave functions, which in turn leads to a large change of
   optical dipole matrix element. (B) Direct to indirect bandgap transition
   which makes the spontaneous photon emission to be of a slow second order
   process mediated by phonons. This feature uniquely occurs in silicon
   nanowires while in bulk silicon there is no change of optical properties
   under any reasonable amount of strain. These results promise new
   applications of silicon nanowires as optoelectronic devices including a
   mechanism for lasing. Our results are verifiable using existing
   experimental techniques of applying strain to nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{The superior material properties of beta-keratin along with the
   hierarchical high-aspect-ratio structure of geckos' foot pad have
   enabled geckos to stick readily and rapidly to almost any surfaces in
   both dry and wet conditions. In this research, nonsticky fluoropolymer
   (Teflon AF) resembling beta-keratin rigidity and having an extremely low
   surface energy and dielectric constant was applied to fabricate a novel
   dry adhesive consisting of high-aspect-ratio nanopillars terminated with
   a fluffy top layer. Both the nanopillars and the terminating layer are
   fabricated concurrently by replica molding using a nanoporous anodic
   aluminum oxide membrane as the mold. These Teflon AF hierarchical
   nanostructures are shown to have an exceptional capacity to generate
   strong adhesion in both dry conditions and under water because of
   combined actions of van der Waals forces, electrostatic attractions, and
   hydrophobic effects. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part

   transmission and scanning electronic microscopy showed the formation of

   the composite preparation avoided the sulfur loss; the composite
   contained 65 wt\% of sulfur. AC impedance spectroscopy data exhibited
   remarkable reduction in charge transfer resistance of the composite
   compared with pristine sulfur. This may be due to the high conductivity
   and large surface area of polypyrrole. This charge transfer enhancement
   led to the electrochemical performance improvement of the composite
   cathode, delivering first discharge capacity of 1320 mAh g(-1). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{For condensed explosives, containing metal particle additives,
   interaction of the detonation shock and reaction zone with solid
   inclusions leads to high rates of momentum and heat transfer that
   consequently introduce non-ideal detonation phenomena. During the time
   scale of the leading detonation shock crossing a particle, the
   acceleration and heating of metal particles are shown to depend on the
   volume fraction of particles, dense packing configuration, material
   density ratio of explosive to solid particles and ratio of particle
   diameter to detonation reaction-zone length. Dimensional analysis and
   physical parameter evaluation are used to formalize the factors
   affecting particle acceleration and heating. Three-dimensional mesoscale
   calculations are conducted for matrices of spherical metal particles
   immersed in a liquid explosive for various particle diameter and solid
   loading conditions, to determine the velocity and temperature
   transmission factors resulting from shock compression. Results are
   incorporated as interphase exchange source terms for macroscopic
   continuum models that can be applied to practical detonation problems
   involving multi-phase explosives or shock propagation in dense

   assembly or compact multilayers by controlling the pH. The assembly
   provides a 3-D template where the adjacent GO sheets mechanically
   constraint the synthesis of nanomaterials. Using this template,
   nanoparticles are directly synthesized on the sheets with high density
   and uniform shape and size, without a capping agent. Both noble metal Au
   and Ag nanoparticles and inorganic CaCO3 nanoparticles are synthesized.
   The formation of nanoparticles leads to local straining of the sheets,
   and the location of the nanoparticles coincides with the formation of
   radial wrinkles on the sheets. Further electrochemical capacitors made
   with GO-CaCO3 composite shows capacitance values of 240 F/g, approaching
   the theoretical limits of 550 F/g, as the CaCO3 nanoparticles act as
   spacers between the sheets preserving their surface area.}},

Abstract = {{We report excellent antibacterial effect induced by amine-functionalized

   The idea originates from the excellent antibacterial property of

   polyacrylate sodium functional groups as nanoparticle surfactants are
   compared to show that poly(quaternary ammonium) functional groups are
   the main cause of the induced antibacterial effect. 99.999\% of E. coli
   can be destructed in 10 minutes by simply mixing bacteria with
   nanoparticle dispersions. The effect of nanoparticle concentrations on
   the antibacterial property is evaluated. Time required to significantly
   suppress bacteria growth is studied. The result indicates that the
   excellent antibacterial property can be introduced to any nanomaterials
   by using poly(quaternary ammonium) functional groups as surfactants. The
   engineered nanoparticles can find enormous applications such as
   self-cleaning surfaces, waste water treatment, Lab-on-a-Chip devices and

Abstract = {{Dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image data, such as

   transforming the dual-pol data (i) into a new two-channel feature space

   (univariate). Both real and synthetic dual-polarization SAR sea ice
   images were transformed using a variety of methods and segmented using a

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the effects of
   auditory and visual distractions on pedestrian ambulation. A fundamental
   temporal characteristic of ambulation is the temporal fluctuation of the
   stride interval. In this paper, we investigate the stationarity of
   stride interval time series when people are exposed to different forms
   of auditory and visual distractions. An increase in nonstationary
   behavior may be suggestive of divided attention and more frequent
   central modulation of locomotion, both of which may have ramifications
   on pedestrian vigilance and responsiveness to environmental
   perturbations. One group of fifteen able-bodied (6 females) young adult
   participants completed a music protocol (overground walking with and
   without music). A second group of fifteen (7 females) did a television
   protocol (treadmill walking while watching TV with and without sound).
   Three walking trials, each 15 min in duration, were performed at each
   participant's comfortable walking speed, with force sensitive resistors
   under the heel of each foot. Using the reverse arrangements test, the
   vast majority of time series were nonstationary, with a time-varying
   mean as the principal source of nonstationarity. Furthermore, the
   television trial with sound had the greatest number of nonstationarities
   followed by overground walking while listening to music. We discuss the
   possibility that these conditions measurably affect gait dynamics
   through a subconscious synchronization to external rhythms or a cyclic
   distraction followed by a period of increased conscious correction of
   gait timing. Our findings suggest that the regulation of stride timing
   is particularly susceptible to constant, time-evolving auditory stimuli,
   but that normal pacing can be restored quickly upon stimulus withdrawal.
   These kinds of sensory distractions should thus be carefully considered
   in studies of pedestrian ambulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The future smart grid is expected to be an integration of intelligent
   microgrids featured by localized electricity generation, storage, and
   consumption. Wireless communication is a promising means to facilitate
   pervasive microgrid monitoring and control at a high flexibility and low
   deployment cost. In order to avoid a single point of failure, multiagent
   system (MAS) based decentralized microgrid control is widely considered.
   In this article, we present a consensus theory based multiagent
   coordination scheme for information discovery in microgrids via wireless
   networks. The information discovery process is fully distributed such
   that each agent only needs to communicate with its direct neighbors. The
   multiagent coordination is investigated in the presence of interference
   due to wireless transmissions. Specifically, the communication links
   among multiple agents may not be established simultaneously to avoid
   transmission collisions. In order to assure the accuracy of the
   information discovered by each agent, the convergence of the multiagent
   coordination is studied. We present the mechanism and principles for the
   multiagent coordination to achieve convergence in a microgrid via
   wireless network based on the characteristics of the information to be
   discovered. Three protocols with different complexities are proposed for
   normal microgrid operation, which can be readily implemented to
   off-the-shelf wireless communication devices. The protocols are further
   extended to achieve microgrid fault recovery by restricting the
   information exchange in a disconnected region to improve recovery speed.
   The performance of the proposed protocols is evaluated via a case study
   based on the network topology and configuration of a realistic microgrid
   test system. Open research issues and directions are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, electrospinning is shown to be an effective method for
   overcoming the agglomeration of nanosilica in silicone rubber
   nanocomposites. Silicone rubber nanocomposites with 7 nm silica were
   produced using conventional mixing and electrospinning processes.
   Scanning electron microscopy is used to demonstrate homogenous filler
   dispersion in electrospun samples as compared to conventional mixed
   samples. Thermo-gravimetric analysis and infrared-laser-based thermal
   tests show significant improvements in thermal stability and heat
   transfer in electrospun nanocomposites. However, no significant
   improvements in either the mechanical properties or relative
   permittivity between the electrospun and conventional mixed samples were
   found. The improved thermal properties of the electrospun silicone
   rubber nanocomposites are attributed to the significantly reduced
   nanofiller agglomeration and their uniform dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{Condensate-to-gas ratio (CGR) plays an important role in sales potential
   assessment of both gas and liquid, design of required surface processing
   facilities, reservoir characterization, and modeling of gas condensate
   reservoirs. Field work and laboratory determination of CGR is both time
   consuming and resource intensive. Developing a rapid and inexpensive
   technique to accurately estimate CGR is of great interest. An
   intelligent model is proposed in this paper based on a feed-forward
   artificial neural network (ANN) optimized by particle swarm optimization
   (PSO) technique. The PSO-ANN model was evaluated using experimental data
   and some PVT data available in the literature. The model predictions
   were compared with field data, experimental data, and the CGR obtained
   from an empirical correlation. A good agreement was observed between the
   predicted CGR values and the experimental and field data. Results of
   this study indicate that mixture molecular weight among input parameters
   selected for PSO-ANN has the greatest impact on CGR value, and the
   PSO-ANN is superior over conventional neural networks and empirical
   correlations. The developed model has the ability to predict the CGR
   with high precision in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The
   proposed model can serve as a reliable tool for quick and inexpensive
   but effective assessment of CGR in the absence of adequate experimental
   or field data.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing is a promising technique that shifts the data and
   computing service modules from individual devices to a geographically
   distributed cloud service architecture. A general mobile cloud computing
   system is comprised of multiple cloud domains, and each domain manages a
   portion of the cloud system resources, such as the Central Processing
   Unit, memory and storage, etc. How to efficiently manage the cloud
   resources across multiple cloud domains is critical for providing
   continuous mobile cloud services. In this paper, we propose a service
   decision making system for interdomain service transfer to balance the
   computation loads among multiple cloud domains. Our system focuses on
   maximizing the rewards for both the cloud system and the users by
   minimizing the number of service rejections that degrade the user
   satisfaction level significantly. To this end, we formulate the service
   request decision making process as a semi-Markov decision process. The
   optimal service transfer decisions are obtained by jointly considering
   the system incomes and expenses. Extensive simulation results show that
   the proposed decision making system can significantly improve the system
   rewards and decrease service disruptions compared with the greedy
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to furnish the engineer with a simple and
   convenient means of estimating frictional pressure drop in ducts and the
   original physical behavior can be clearly reflected. Fully developed
   turbulent flow frictional pressure drop in noncircular ducts is
   examined. Simple models are proposed to predict the frictional pressure
   drop in smooth and rough noncircular channels. Through the selection of
   a novel characteristic length scale, the square root of the
   cross-sectional area, the effect of duct shape has been minimized. The
   proposed models have an accuracy of 6\% for most common duct shapes of
   engineering practice and can be used to predict pressure drop of fully
   developed turbulent flow in noncircular ducts. It is found that the
   hydraulic diameter is not the appropriate length scale to use in
   defining the Reynolds number to ensure similarity between the circular
   and noncircular ducts. By using the Reynolds number based on the square
   root of the cross-sectional area, it is demonstrated that the circular
   tube relations may be applied to noncircular ducts eliminating large
   errors in estimation of pressure drop. The square root of the
   cross-sectional area is an appropriate characteristic dimension
   applicable to most duct geometries. The dimensionless mean wall shear
   stress is a desirable dimensionless parameter to describe fluid flow
   physical behavior so that fluid flow problems can be solved in the
   simple and direct manner. The dimensionless mean wall shear stress is
   presented graphically and appears more general and reasonable to reflect
   the fluid flow physical behavior than the traditional Moody diagram.

   both useful, stability notions, input-to-state stability and stability

   class-KL function estimates and a comparison theorem for impulsive
   differential equations, two sets of sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions
   for input-to-state stability in terms of two measures are obtained for
   impulsive switched systems. These conditions exploit some nonlinear
   integral constraints in terms of generalized dwell-time conditions to
   balance the continuous dynamics and impulsive dynamics so that
   input-to-state stability is achieved, despite possible instability of
   individual continuous subsystems or destabilizing impulsive effects. An

Abstract = {{Helical coil polymeric stents provide an alternative method of stenting
   compared to traditional metallic stents, but require additional
   investigation to understand deployment, expansion, and fixation. A
   bilayer helical coil stent consisting of PLLA and PLGA was investigated
   using the finite element model to evaluate performance by uniform
   expansion and subsequent recoiling. In vitro material characterization
   studies showed that a preinsertion water-soaking step to mimic body
   implantation conditions provided the required ductility level expansion.
   In this case, the mechanical contribution of the outer PLGA layer was
   negligible since it softened significantly under environmental
   conditions. The viscoelastic response was not considered in this study
   since the strain rate during expansion was relatively slow and the
   material response was primarily plastic. The numerical model was
   validated with available experimental expansion and recoiling data. A
   parametric study was then undertaken to investigate the effect of stent
   geometry and coefficient of friction at the stent-cylinder interface on
   the expansion and recoiling characteristics. The model showed that
   helical stents exhibit a uniform stress distribution after expansion,
   which is important for controlled degradation when using biodegradable
   materials. The results indicated that increasing stent width, pitch
   value, and coil thickness resulted in a larger diameter after recoiling,
   which would improve fixation in the artery. It was also noted that a
   helical stent should have more than five coils to be stable after
   recoiling. This work is part of a larger research study focused on the
   performance of a balloon-inflated polymeric helical stent for artery
   applications. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005777]}},

   finite array of cavities is approximated using the array factor method,
   which does not take into account the coupling between the cavities, and
   is compared to the recently developed finite element-boundary element
   method to demonstrate the importance of the inclusion of the coupling
   effect. Dependence of the coupling interactions between the cavities on
   various parameters such as separation periods, incident angle of the
   plane-wave excitation, and permittivity and thickness of the dielectric
   coating is demonstrated quantitatively through several numerical
   examples. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an analytical model for the throughput of the
   enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism in the IEEE 802.11p
   medium-access control (MAC) sublayer. Features in EDCA such as different
   contention windows (CW) and arbitration interframe space (AIFS) for each

   analytical model is suitable for both basic access and the
   request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) access mode. Different from most
   of existing 3-D or 4-D Markov-chain-based analytical models for IEEE
   802.11e EDCA, without computation complexity, the proposed analytical
   model is explicitly solvable and applies to four access categories of
   traffic in the IEEE 802.11p. The proposed model can be used for
   large-scale network analysis and validation of network simulators under
   saturated traffic conditions. Simulation results are given to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical model. In addition, we

Abstract = {{The `Hydrogen Economy' is a proposed system where hydrogen is produced
   from carbon dioxide free energy sources and is used as an alternative
   fuel for transportation. The utilization of hydrogen to power fuel cell
   vehicles (FCVs) can significantly decrease air pollutants and greenhouse
   gases emission from the transportation sector. In order to build the
   future hydrogen economy, there must be a significant development in the
   hydrogen infrastructure, and huge investments will be needed for the
   development of hydrogen production, storage, and distribution
   technologies. This paper focuses on the analysis of hydrogen demand from
   hydrogen FCVs in Ontario, Canada, and the related cost of hydrogen.
   Three potential hydrogen demand scenarios over a long period of time
   were projected to estimate hydrogen FCVs market penetration, and the
   costs associated with the hydrogen production, storage and distribution
   were also calculated. A sensitivity analysis was implemented to
   investigate the uncertainties of some parameters on the design of the
   future hydrogen infrastructure. It was found that the cost of hydrogen
   is very sensitive to electricity price, but other factors such as water
   price, energy efficiency of electrolysis, and plant life have
   insignificant impact on the total cost of hydrogen produced. Copyright

Abstract = {{Porous and non-porous alumina catalysts were used as nickel supports to
   catalyze methane cracking. Different operating parameters were studied
   in a thermal gravimetric analyzer, including methane and hydrogen
   partial pressures, temperature and flow rate. During CH4 cracking,
   carbon builds up on the catalyst surface and therefore the catalyst
   requires periodic regeneration. Cycling tests were performed, using air
   during the regeneration phase to burn off the carbon. The results showed
   that the non-porous catalyst performed better than the porous catalyst
   in terms of cracking during the first cycle. Full regeneration of the
   catalysts by oxidizing the deposited carbon was achieved at 550 degrees
   C, while oxidation was very slow at 500 degrees C. After full
   regeneration, the performance of the porous catalyst became considerably
   better than the non-porous. The porous catalyst kept its activity for 24
   cracking/regeneration cycles, while the non-porous catalyst lost half of
   its activity by the second cracking cycle and almost all of its activity
   after six cycles. NiAl2O4 formation and Ni sintering caused the
   non-porous catalyst activity loss. TPO results showed that two carbon
   types were deposited on the catalysts, namely C beta and C gamma, where
   CO is more active than C gamma. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{The effects of the micrometric and nanometric iron (Fe) additives on the
   mechanical and thermal dehydrogenation of lithium alanate (LiAlH4), its
   self-discharge at low temperatures and rehydrogenation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{9088-9102}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{LiAlH4 containing 5 wt.\% of nanometric Fe (n-Fe) shows a profound
   mechanical dehydrogenation by continuously desorbing hydrogen (H-2)
   during high energy ball milling reaching similar to 3.5 wt.\% H-2 after
   5 h of milling. In contrast, no H-2 desorption is observed during low
   energy milling of LiAlH4 containing n-Fe. Similarly, no H-2 desorption
   occurs during high energy ball milling for LiAlH4 containing micrometric
   Fe (mu-Fe) and, for comparison, both the micrometric and nanometric Ni
   (mu-Ni and n-Ni) additive. X-ray diffraction studies show that ball
   milling results in a varying degree of the lattice expansion of LiAlH4
   for both the Fe and Ni additives. A volumetric lattice expansion larger
   than 1\% results in the profound destabilization of LiAlH4 accompanied
   by continuous H-2 desorption during milling according to reaction:
   LiAlH4 (solid) -> 1/3Li(3)AlH(6) + 2/3Al + H-2. It is hypothesized that
   the Fe ions are able to dissolve in the lattice of LiAlH4 by the action
   of mechanical energy, replacing the Al ions and forming a substitutional
   solid solution. The quantity of dissolved metal ions depends primarily
   on the total energy of milling per unit mass of powder generated within
   a prescribed milling time, the type of additive ion e.g. Fe vs. Ni and
   on the particle size (micrometric vs. nanometric) of metal additive. For
   thermal dehydrogenation the average apparent activation energy of Stage
   I (LiAlH4 (solid) -> 1/3Li(3)AlH(6) + 2/3Al + H-2) is reduced from the
   range 76 to 96 kJ/mol for the mu-Fe additive to about 60 kJ/mol for the
   n-Fe additive. For Stage II dehydrogenation (1/3Li(3)AlH(6) -> LiH+1/3Al
   + 0.5H(2)) the average apparent activation energy is within the range
   77-93 kJ/mol, regardless of the particle size of the Fe additive (mu-Fe
   vs. n-Fe). The n-Fe and n-Ni additives, the latter used for comparison,
   provide nearly identical enhancement of dehydrogenation rate during
   isothermal dehydrogenation at 100 degrees C. Ball milled (LiAlH4 + 5
   wt.\% n-Fe) slowly self-discharges up to similar to 5 wt.\% H-2 during
   storage at room temperature (RT), 40 and 80 degrees C. Fully
   dehydrogenated (LiAlH4 + 5 wt.\% n-Fe) has been partially rehydrogenated
   up to 0.5 wt.\% H-2 under 100 bar/160 degrees C/24 h. However, the
   rehydrogenation parameters are not optimized yet. Copyright (C) 2012,

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop methods for maximizing the throughput of a
   mobility-on-demand urban transportation system. We consider a finite
   group of shared vehicles, located at a set of stations. Users arrive at
   the stations, pickup vehicles, and drive (or are driven) to their
   destination station where they drop-off the vehicle. When some origins
   and destinations are more popular than others, the system will
   inevitably become out of balance: vehicles will build up at some
   stations, and become depleted at others. We propose a robotic solution
   to this rebalancing problem that involves empty robotic vehicles
   autonomously driving between stations. Specifically, we utilize a fluid
   model for the customers and vehicles in the system. Then, we develop a
   rebalancing policy that lets every station reach an equilibrium in which
   there are excess vehicles and no waiting customers and that minimizes
   the number of robotic vehicles performing rebalancing trips. We show
   that the optimal rebalancing policy can be found as the solution to a
   linear program. We use this solution to develop a real-time rebalancing
   policy which can operate in highly variable environments. Finally, we
   verify policy performance in a simulated mobility-on-demand environment
   and in hardware experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Project deadline and resource limits are practical constraints that
   coexist in most projects. While heuristic methods for constrained
   resource scheduling (CRS) have become mainstream in commercial
   scheduling software, no commercial software includes any time-cost
   trade-off (TCT) heuristic to help meet deadline, let alone any procedure
   to resolve both deadline and resource constraints. This paper,
   therefore, introduces a practical heuristic method to meet both deadline
   and resource limits. The proposed method basically uses cycles of
   crashing for lowest-cost critical activities (i.e., stepwise TCT
   process) and resolves any resource overallocation (i.e., CRS) within
   each TCT cycle. This intertwined approach is logical, fast, and provides
   a set of feasible project durations that do not violate resource limits.
   To facilitate its practical use, the proposed method has been programmed
   as an add-in tool to Microsoft Project software. The paper discusses
   several case studies that prove the practicality and usefulness of the
   proposed approach to both researchers and professionals and provides a
   comparison of results with other literature efforts. DOI:

Abstract = {{SPR biosensing is increasingly popular for the detection of a multitude
   of biomolecules. It offers label-free detection and study of proteins,
   nucleic acids, and other biomolecules in real time. A recent trend
   involves incorporation of AuNPs, either within the sensing surface
   itself or as signal enhancing tagging molecules. The importance of AuNP
   and detecting agent spacing is described and techniques using
   macromolecular spacing aids are highlighted. Recent methods to enhance
   SPR detection capabilities using gold nanoparticles are reviewed, as
   well as device fabrication and the results of incorporation. SPR
   detection is a highly versatile method for the detection of biomolecules
   and, with the incorporation of AuNPs, shows promise in extending it to a
   number of new applications.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution velocity profile measurements were taken over a series
   of riffles on a gravel-bed stream using a Pulse Coherent Acoustic
   Doppler Profiler (PCADP) to quantify the fluid structure of riffles and
   nests (redds) where brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) spawned. Velocity profiles were obtained on a
   highly discretized planometric scale ranging between 20 and 40?cm grid
   spacings, with vertical observations occurring every 1.6?cm. From the
   velocity profiles, between 15?000 and 38?000 velocity measurements were
   obtained over each riffle on any given day of measurement. Velocity
   profiles were converted to streamwise velocity magnitude, flow depth,
   Reynolds number, Froude number, shear stress, vertical velocity
   components and turbulent kinetic energy per unit area to evaluate the
   spatial structure of the riffles and the spatial structure of redds
   (pits and tailspills) relative to the surrounding riffle structure.
   Semi-variograms were employed to evaluate the persistence of the fluid
   structure based upon the metrics evaluated. Results showed that discrete
   velocity observations poorly described the spatial structure of the flow
   system and poorly correlated with redd locations. Reynolds number
   analysis identified a relatively consistent fluid property for distances
   typically 23 times the longitudinal length of redds. Turbulent kinetic
   energy per unit area consistently identified common regions on all
   riffles studied that corresponded with the location selections for redds
   where flow was identified as essentially uni-directional. Froude number
   was found to be insensitive in predicting the fluid spatial structure in
   wadeable flow depths and relating it to the fluid structure of redds.
   Results indicated that a series of metrics at varying spatial scales of
   turbulence may be necessary to understand the spatial complexity of redd
   selection. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Many detailed cervical spine models have been developed and primarily
   used to investigate kinematic response of the neck in impact scenarios.
   However, the goal of detailed models is to predict both kinematic
   response and provide insights into injury mechanisms and thresholds
   through tissue-level response. The objective of this study was to verify
   and validate an enhanced cervical spine segment finite element model to
   predict tissue-level failure under four load conditions: tension,
   flexion, and extension using a C4-C5 segment, and compression using a
   C5-C6-C7 segment. Mechanical tissue test data in relevant modes of
   loading was used in the model, and this data was also used to model
   ultimate tissue failure. The predicted failure locations were
   representative of reported cervical spine injuries for the different
   modes of loading, and the predicted peak failure forces were within the
   reported experimental corridors. The displacement to failure of the
   tension simulation was lower than expected in some cases, attributed to
   limitations in the constitutive model. This study provided a validated
   approach to predict tissue-level failure for cervical spine segments,
   predicting the location and sequence of tissue failure, and can be
   applied to future full cervical spine models for the prediction of
   injurious loading in automotive crash scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Polyamide 6 was modified with lithium chloride (LiCl) salt and N-butyl
   benzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA) plasticizer (additives). The modification
   was done in order to develop an environmentally friendly composite,
   composed of wheat straw (WS). A 15 wt\% of ground WS was compounded with
   Polyamide 6 along with the additives. Addition of LiCl decreased the
   melting point of the matrix, allowing for a lower compounding
   temperature. However, a pseudo-crosslinking formation upon addition of
   salt limited the polymer chain movement and restricted the processing
   temperature. LiCl addition increased the tensile and flexural modulus of
   the composite, but decreased the tensile and flexural strength. Decrease
   in the strength was found to be related to the increase in the residence
   time of material during extrusion causing severe WS thermal degradation.
   Addition of N-BBSA eased the processing due to lubrication effect,
   however, when used in excess, lowered the flexural modulus and strength.
   Addition of WS to Polyamide 6 increased the modulus of the matrix.
   Matrix tensile modulus and flexural modulus were enhanced by 27\%;
   however, a decrease in strength of the matrix was obtained. Addition of
   WS, LiCl, and plasticizer lowered the impact properties of Polyamide 6.
   It was concluded that combination of 2 wt\% LiCl and of 2 wt\% N-BBSA
   gives the best mechanical properties. POLYM. COMPOS., 2012. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Degradation kinetics of ground wheat straw (WS), polyamide 6, and a
   WS-polyamide 6 composites obtained from extrusion were investigated. 15
   wt\% of ground WS was melt blended with other additives naming; lithium
   chloride salt (LiCl) and N-butylbenzenesulfonamide plasticizer (N-BBSA)
   as matrix treatments. The additives were added to reduce the melting
   point of polyamide 6 and ease of composite processing (reduction in
   processing temperature and time). Two commonly used non-isothermal
   kinetic models were used to investigate the degradation kinetics of WS
   and the composite. Thermal gravimetric analysis was utilized to measure
   the thermal stability and degradation kinetics of different composite
   formulation. The activation energy of WS was identified by
   iso-conversional Friedman kinetic method. Through this method, WS
   activation energy was found to be around 141.4 kJ/mol. Composite kinetic
   studies were based on the Coats and Redfern procedure. It was concluded
   that the composite activation energy was correlated to the residual
   weight percentage of the composite at the maximum thermal degradation
   temperature. The onset of degradation of WS was dictated by the thermal
   stability of its lignin content and was found to be around 188 degrees
   C. WS, however, did not go through a major degradation up to 245 degrees
   C at which drastic decomposition starts. This temperature range overlaps
   with processing temperature of Polyamide 6 and required matrix/WS
   treatments. Addition of salt and plasticizer individually or with each
   other at any level decreased the onset of degradation temperature.
   Addition of plasticizer at 4 wt\% level, however, shifted the

Abstract = {{In this article, the performance of three different mixing elements on
   color dispersion in high-density polyethylene and linear low-density
   polyethylene polymer stream during extrusion is studied. Two similarly
   designed Maddock mixers and a Stratablend II mixer are used as the last
   part of a general purpose single screw. Moreover, an inline melt camera
   is used for the quantification of mixing quality by visualization of
   grayscale of the color dispersion and thus mixing. The Stratablend II
   mixer produces the lowest and most uniform standard deviation. Both the
   Maddock mixers showed the same trend but higher values of standard
   deviation. All results are then compared with a full 3D finite element
   method simulation. Simulations clearly indicate that the Stratablend II
   mixer has the best mixing abilities and that these are mainly given by
   its unique design with high average value of shear stress. The role of
   elongational stress does not appear to have a high influence on mixing
   for these mixers. The results also suggest that the key factor for
   achieving better mixing is the frequency by which a large fraction of
   the material passes through the high shear stress regions of the mixer.

Abstract = {{Hydrogen storage properties of the (nLiAlH(4) + LiNH2) hydride composite
   where n = 1, 3, 11.5 and 30, synthesized by high energy ball milling
   have been investigated. The composite with the molar ratio n = 1
   releases large quantities of H-2 (up to similar to 5 wt.\%) during ball
   milling up to 100-150 min. The quantity of released H-2 rapidly
   decreases for the molar ratio n = 3 and is not observed for n = 11.5 and
   30. The XRD studies indicate that the H-2 release is a result of a solid
   state decomposition of LiAlH4 into (1/3) Li3AlH6 + (2/3) Al + H-2 and
   subsequently decomposition of (1/3) Li3AlH6 into LiH + (1/3) Al +
   0.5H(2). Apparently, LiAlH4 is profoundly destabilized during ball
   milling by the presence of a large quantity of LiNH2 (37.7 wt.\%) in the
   n = 1 composite. The rate of dehydrogenation at 100-170 degrees C (at 1
   bar H-2) is adversely affected by insufficient microstructural
   refinement, as observed for the n = 1 composite, which was milled for
   only 2 min to avoid H-2 discharge during milling. XRD studies show that
   isothermal dehydrogenation of (nLiAlH4 + LiNH2) occurs by the same
   LiAlH4 decomposition reactions as those found during ball milling. The
   ball milled n = 1 composite stored under Ar at 80 degrees C slowly
   discharges large quantities of H-2 approaching 3.5 wt.\% after 8 days of

Abstract = {{The diene-based polymer nanoparticles represented by
   poly(butadiene-co-acrylonitrile) were prepared in the semi-batch
   emulsion polymerization system using Gemini surfactant (GS)
   trimethylene-1,3-bis(dodecyldimethylammonium bromide) as the emulsifier.
   The nanoparticles within the range of 17-54 nm were achieved with narrow
   molecular weight and particle size distributions. A spherical morphology
   was observed for the produced nanoparticles. The effects of GS
   concentration on the particle size, molecular weight, polymerization
   conversion and solid content, and composition of copolymer were
   investigated. The semibatch process using monomeric and conventional
   surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was compared. At the second
   stage of this study, the prepared unsaturated nanoparticles were
   employed as the substrates for the latex hydrogenation in the presence
   of Wilkinson's catalyst, that is, RhCl(P(C6H5)(3))(3). The effects of
   the particle size and catalyst concentration on the latex hydrogenation
   rate were investigated. The particle size is found to have a significant
   effect on the reaction rate. When the 17-nm nanoparticles were used as
   the substrates, a high conversion of 95 mol \% was obtained within 18 h
   using only 0.1 wt \% RhCl(P(C6H5)(3))(3). The latex hydrogenation
   process was completely free of organic solvents. The present synthesis
   and following ``green'' hydrogenation process can be extended to latices
   made from semibatch emulsion containing other diene-based polymers. This
   study shows great promise for decreasing the demanded quantity of
   expensive catalyst and eliminating the organic solvent in the
   hydrogenation process. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part

Title = {{Nonlinear micromechanics-based bond-slip model for FRP/concrete
   interfaces}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{11-23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Various experimental studies in the literature have reported that the
   local bond-slip profiles for fibre reinforced polymer (FRP)/concrete
   joints subjected to direct shear loading and the associated local bond
   strength values vary along the bonded length. This peculiarity of the
   local bond-slip curves has apparently not yet been considered in any of
   the available interface models.
   In this work, a procedure is developed for deriving a nonlinear
   bond-slip model for FRP/concrete interfaces that accounts for the
   variation of local bond strength along the bonded length. The bond-slip
   law was developed based on 3D nonlinear micromechanics-based finite
   element results using the microplane theory for concrete. In the finite
   element analysis, the microplane constitutive law is implemented as a
   user-defined subroutine in the ADINA finite element package to run the
   simulations. Subsequently, the finite element results have been used to
   develop the nonlinear bond-slip constitutive law for the FRP/concrete
   joints. This constitutive relation is developed considering the
   interaction between the interfacial normal stress components along the
   bonded length and local bond strength. Then a new mathematical approach
   is proposed to describe the entire local bond-slip relationship. The
   proposed interface law accounts for the nonlinear contributions of the
   FRP laminates, adhesive and concrete layers.
   Finally, to assess the efficacy of the proposed bond-slip model,
   validations are carried out using a large experimental database (results
   of 118 specimens). The predicted ultimate load carrying capacities show
   a satisfactory agreement with the test data. Furthermore, comparisons
   are made among the characteristics and predictions of the proposed model
   and those of two bond-slip models from the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at characterizing microstructural change and
   evaluating tensile and fatigue properties of fiber laser welded
   AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy with special attention to the effect of welding
   speed. Laser welding led to the formation of equiaxed dendrites in the
   fusion zone and columnar dendrites near the fusion zone boundary along
   with divorced eutectic Mg17Al12 particles and recrystallized grains in
   the heat-affected zone. The lowest hardness across the weld appeared in
   the fusion zone. Although the yield strength, ductility, and fatigue
   life decreased, the hardening capacity increased after laser welding,
   with a joint efficiency reaching about 90 pct. A higher welding speed
   resulted in a narrower fusion zone, smaller grain size, higher yield
   strength, and longer fatigue life, as well as a slightly lower
   strain-hardening capacity mainly because of the smaller grain sizes.
   Tensile fracture occurred in the fusion zone, whereas fatigue failure
   appeared essentially in between the heat-affected zone and the fusion
   zone. Fatigue cracks initiated from the near-surface welding defects and
   propagated by the formation of fatigue striations together with
   secondary cracks.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing genomic engineering protocols for manipulation of
   Escherichia coli are primarily focused on chromosomal gene knockout. In
   this study, a simple but systematic chromosomal gene knock-in method was
   proposed based on a previously developed protocol using bacteriophage
   lambda (lambda Red) and flippase-flippase recognition targets (FLP-FRT)
   recombinations. For demonstration purposes, DNA operons containing
   heterologous genes (i.e., pac encoding E. coli penicillin acylase and
   palB2 encoding Pseudozyma antarctica lipase B mutant) engineered with
   regulatory elements, such as strong/inducible promoters (i.e., P (trc)
   and P (araB) ), operators, and ribosomal binding sites, were integrated
   into the E. coli genome at designated locations (i.e., lacZYA, dbpA, and
   lacI-mhpR loci) either as a gene replacement or gene insertion using
   various antibiotic selection markers (i.e., kanamycin and
   chloramphenicol) under various genetic backgrounds (i.e., HB101 and DH5
   alpha). The expression of the inserted foreign genes was subjected to
   regulation using appropriate inducers {[}isopropyl
   beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and arabinose] at tunable
   concentrations. The developed approach not only enables more extensive
   genomic engineering of E. coli, but also paves an effective way to
   ``tailor{''} plasmid-free E. coli strains with desired genotypes
   suitable for various biotechnological applications, such as
   biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The calibration and comparison to experimental data of a parallel
   computing multi-zone combustion model for simulating operational
   characteristics of an n-butanol/n-heptane fuelled Homogeneous Charge
   Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine utilizing the negative valve overlap
   (NVO) technology is described. The model is calibrated using one
   experimentally characterized operating point and by taking into account
   the major features of NVO. The model simulations at other four operating
   points closely match the cylinder pressure trace and heat release rates
   of the experiments. The unburned hydrocarbon emission is predicted to a
   reasonable level while NOx (nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO2)
   formation is under-predicted. The difficulty in mapping the NOx emission
   is attributed to the fact that the combustion model operates within the
   closed cycle period of engines and therefore does not capture the
   complexity of the charge stratification within the NVO equipped engine.
   Nevertheless, the trend of increasing NOx levels with the increasing
   fraction of butanol in the fuel mixture is captured and the model is
   able to predict the pressure, heat release rates, and combustion phasing
   for the three fuel blends tested. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of the operating conditions on the performance of metal
   hydride hydrogen storage tanks are complicated and need detailed
   investigations for further optimization. In this study, a mathematical
   model is developed to understand the effects of the various operating
   conditions on the hydrogen absorption processes in a LaNi5 metal hydride
   tank. The numerical results indicate that the quickest charging process
   occurs within the first 20 s, and the quickest charging rate and
   duration are mainly affected by the charging pressure and initial
   temperature, respectively. The effect of cooling level on this process
   is insignificant. For both the short-time charging (2 min) and long-time
   charging, the hydrogen fueling performance is significantly affected by
   the cooling level (the heat transfer coefficient and surrounding
   temperature) and charging pressure. In order to ensure sufficiently
   quick hydrogen charging, the charging pressure needs to be kept enough
   higher than the equilibrium pressure, and due to the fast heating of the
   metal hydride, the influence of the initial temperature is less
   significant than the cooling condition. The general distributions of the
   absorbed hydrogen fraction and temperature are similar under the
   different operating conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Numerical assessment of metamodelling strategies in computationally
   intensive optimization}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{67-86}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Metamodelling is an increasingly more popular approach for alleviating
   the computational burden associated with computationally intensive
   optimization/management problems in environmental and water resources
   systems. Some studies refer to the metamodelling approach as function
   approximation, surrogate modelling, response surface methodology or
   model emulation. A metamodel-enabled optimizer approximates the
   objective (or constraint) function in a way that eliminates the need to
   always evaluate this function via a computationally expensive simulation
   model. There is a sizeable body of literature developing and applying a
   variety of metamodelling strategies to various environmental and water
   resources related problems including environmental model calibration,
   water resources systems analysis and management, and water distribution
   network design and optimization. Overall, this literature generally
   implies metamodelling yields enhanced solution efficiency and (almost
   always) effectiveness of computationally intensive optimization
   problems. This paper initially develops a comparative assessment
   framework which presents a clear computational budget dependent
   definition for the success/failure of the metamodelling strategies, and
   then critically evaluates metamodelling strategies, through numerical
   experiments, against other common optimization strategies not involving
   metamodels. Three different metamodel-enabled optimizers involving
   radial basis functions, kriging, and neural networks are employed. A
   robust numerical assessment within different computational budget
   availability scenarios is conducted over four test functions commonly
   used in optimization as well as two real-world computationally intensive
   optimization problems in environmental and water resources systems.
   Numerical results show that metamodelling is not always an efficient and
   reliable approach to optimizing computationally intensive problems. For
   simpler response surfaces, metamodelling can be very efficient and
   effective. However, in some cases, and in particular for complex
   response surfaces when computational budget is not very limited,
   metamodelling can be misleading and a hindrance, and better solutions
   are achieved with optimizers not involving metamodels. Results also
   demonstrate that neural networks are not appropriate metamodelling tools
   for limited computational budgets while metamodels employing kriging and
   radial basis functions show comparable overall performance when the
   available computational budget is very limited. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{In urban vehicular networks, where privacy, especially the location
   privacy of anonymous vehicles is highly concerned, anonymous
   verification of vehicles is indispensable. Consequently, an attacker who
   succeeds in forging multiple hostile identifies can easily launch a
   Sybil attack, gaining a disproportionately large influence. In this
   paper, we propose a novel Sybil attack detection mechanism, Footprint,
   using the trajectories of vehicles for identification while still
   preserving their location privacy. More specifically, when a vehicle
   approaches a road-side unit (RSU), it actively demands an authorized
   message from the RSU as the proof of the appearance time at this RSU. We
   design a location-hidden authorized message generation scheme for two
   objectives: first, RSU signatures on messages are signer ambiguous so
   that the RSU location information is concealed from the resulted
   authorized message; second, two authorized messages signed by the same
   RSU within the same given period of time (temporarily linkable) are
   recognizable so that they can be used for identification. With the
   temporal limitation on the linkability of two authorized messages,
   authorized messages used for long-term identification are prohibited.
   With this scheme, vehicles can generate a location-hidden trajectory for
   location-privacy-preserved identification by collecting a consecutive
   series of authorized messages. Utilizing social relationship among
   trajectories according to the similarity definition of two trajectories,
   Footprint can recognize and therefore dismiss ``communities{''} of Sybil
   trajectories. Rigorous security analysis and extensive trace-driven
   simulations demonstrate the efficacy of Footprint.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase flow boiling is being used in different applications because
   of its high heat flux capacity compared to single phase flow. However,
   the fundamentals of boiling fluid flow and heat transfer in microscale
   geometries are not yet fully understood. The aim of this work is to
   contribute to a better understanding of the underlying physical
   phenomena in flow boiling of water in small channels. For this purpose
   experiments were conducted to investigate flow patterns, boiling curves,
   and heat transfer coefficients in single channel, microevaporators with
   a channel depth, width and length of 198 x 241 x 21900 mu m and 378 x
   471 x 21900 mu m. High speed visualization (up to 30,000 fps) were
   performed simultaneously with heat transfer and pressure drop
   measurements to support the quantitative experimental data for better
   understanding of two-phase flow characteristics in microchannel
   evaporators. The influence of the heat flux and mass flux in the flow
   patterns, boiling curve and heat transfer coefficient were studied. Six
   different flow patterns were observed and classified using the most
   commonly accepted terms as bubbly, slug, churn, annular, wavy-annular,
   and inverted annular flow. The flow patterns were closely coupled with
   mass flux, heat flux, and channel size. Bubbly flow was mainly developed
   at lower heat fluxes and progressed to slug, churn, and annular flow as
   the heat fluxes increased. High speed visualization provided a means to
   characterize the formation of intermittent flows and the subsequent
   re-wetting of the channels that lead to pressure drop oscillations, the
   evolution of flow patterns and provided a physical explanation for the
   occurrence of reversed flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Early and late transition metal single-site catalysts revolutionised the
   polyolefin manufacturing industry and research with their ability to
   make polymers with uniform microstructural properties. Several of these
   catalysts are currently used commercially to produce commodity and

   industrial implementation resided in the fact that they could be used
   without major modifications in the polymerisation reactors that
   previously used heterogeneous ZieglerNatta and Phillips catalysts. Since
   most of these industrial processes use slurry or gas-phase reactors, the
   soluble single-site catalysts must be supported on adequate carriers
   that ensure not only high activity, but also the formation of polymer
   particles with the proper morphology and bulk densities. In this
   article, we will review several methods used for supporting single-site

Abstract = {{Nanofiltration (NF) (pressure-driven process) and electrodialysis with

   compared in terms of mass flux and mass balance. Molecular weight
   profile and protein, peptide and amino acids contents of the fractions
   obtained were also analysed. The two processes lead to different results
   since NF was more efficient in terms of mass flux than EDUF when
   compared on a same basis (membrane area, process duration), while EDUF
   recovered larger range of peptide molecular weights and amount of polar
   amino acids. The antioxidant capacity of the fractions was analysed and
   the more relevant fractions were tested for their potential neurone
   cells protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). The peptides
   isolated by EDUF in the anionic recovery compartments at pH 3 and 6
   showed an increase of the antioxidant capacities for the ORAC assay as
   well as for the H2O2 degradation assay. The anionic recovery compartment
   at pH 9 and the permeate from NF at pH 6 also showed a significant
   increase in antioxidant capacity only for the H2O2 degradation assay.
   These results, of the first study in the literature on the comparison of
   pressure-driven and electrically-driven processes for the fractionation
   of bioactive peptide fractions, showed that coupling NF and EDUF in a
   same process line would optimize their own separation performances and
   allow the production of more specific peptide fractions than alone. (C)

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate membrane electrode
   assembly (MEA) failure modes under accelerated test conditions via
   reactant relative humidity (RH) cycling. In this study, the anode and
   cathode underwent RH cycling in an unsymmetrical manner and the cell was
   run at a minimal `'idle{''} current during endurance testing. The cell
   performance was monitored periodically and the degradation curve showed
   a difference in the anode and cathode induced RH cycling modes. Anode RH
   cycling had a more pronounced effect on MEA degradation than cathode RH
   cycling. Electrochemical diagnostic testing methods such as AC impedance
   and H-2 crossover measurements revealed the degradation phenomena in
   more detail. The fluoride release data of the anode RH cycling cell
   showed a sudden increase in fluoride rate within a short period of
   endurance testing. The infrared imaging results revealed thinning and
   hotspot pinholes in the membrane, and ionomer delamination from the PTFE
   reinforcement layer was identified by scanning electron microscopy. The
   anode RH cycling cell had a shorter lifespan than the cell with cathode
   RH cycling, highlighting the significance of anode humidification for
   MEA durability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using Grobner bases to generate efficient kinematic solutions for the
   dynamic simulation of multi-loop mechanisms}},
Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},

Abstract = {{Many mechanical systems of practical interest contain closed kinematic
   chains, and are most conveniently modeled using a set of redundant
   generalized coordinates. The governing dynamic equations for systems
   with more coordinates than degrees-of-freedom are
   differential-algebraic, and can be difficult to solve efficiently yet
   accurately. In this work, the embedding technique is used to eliminate
   the Lagrange multipliers from the dynamic equations and obtain one
   ordinary differential equation for each independent acceleration.
   Grobner bases are then generated to triangularize the kinematic
   constraint equations, thereby producing recursively solvable systems for
   calculating the dependent generalized coordinates given values of the
   independent coordinates. For systems that can be fully triangularized,
   the kinematic constraints are always satisfied exactly and in a fixed
   amount of time. Where full triangularization is not possible, a
   block-triangular solution can be obtained that is still more efficient
   than using existing techniques. The proposed approach is first applied
   to the Gough-Stewart platform, whose fully triangular solution motivates
   the block-triangular solution strategy for a five-link suspension
   system. Finally, a fully triangular solution is obtained for an aircraft
   landing gear mechanism. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2405-2418}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple, novel, yet very powerful approach for
   robust rotation-invariant texture classification based on random
   projection. The proposed sorted random projection maintains the
   strengths of random projection, in being computationally efficient and
   low-dimensional, with the addition of a straightforward sorting step to
   introduce rotation invariance. At the feature extraction stage, a small
   set of random measurements is extracted from sorted pixels or sorted
   pixel differences in local image patches. The rotation invariant random
   features are embedded into a bag-of-words model to perform texture
   classification, allowing us to achieve global rotation invariance. The
   proposed unconventional and novel random features are very robust, yet
   by leveraging the sparse nature of texture images, our approach
   outperforms traditional feature extraction methods which involve careful
   design and complex steps. We report extensive experiments comparing the
   proposed method to six state-of-the-art methods, RP, Patch, LBP, WMFS
   and the methods of Lazebnik et al. and Zhang et al., in texture
   classification on five databases: CUReT, Brodatz, UIUC, UMD and
   KTH-TIPS. Our approach leads to significant improvements in
   classification accuracy, producing consistently good results on each
   database, including what we believe to be the best reported results for
   Brodatz, UMD and KTH-TIPS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Accelerating signature-based broadcast authentication for wireless
   sensor networks}},
Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{723-736}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), broadcast authentication is a
   crucial security mechanism that allows a multitude of legitimate users
   to join in and disseminate messages into the networks in a dynamic and
   authenticated way. During the past few years, several public-key based
   multi-user broadcast authentication schemes have been proposed to
   achieve immediate authentication and to address the security
   vulnerability intrinsic to mu TESLA-like schemes. Unfortunately, the
   relatively slow signature verification in signature-based broadcast
   authentication has also incurred a series of problems such as high
   energy consumption and long verification delay. In this contribution, we
   propose an efficient technique to accelerate the signature verification
   in WSNs through the cooperation among sensor nodes. By allowing some
   sensor nodes to release the intermediate computation results to their
   neighbors during the signature verification, a large number of sensor
   nodes can accelerate their signature verification process significantly.
   When applying our faster signature verification technique to the
   broadcast authentication in a 4 x 4 grid-based WSN, a quantitative
   performance analysis shows that our scheme needs 17.7-34.5\% less energy
   and runs about 50\% faster than the traditional signature verification
   method. The efficiency of the proposed technique has been tested through
   an experimental study on a network of MICAz motes. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current drug delivery techniques involve encapsulation, targeting
   and controlled release of the drug with various molecules or
   nanoparticles, but rarely has the drug molecular state or form been
   investigated. It is necessary to deliver a drug with a prescribed
   molecular state in order to maximize drug therapeutic effects. Here we
   present two facile methods to characterize molecular states of the
   anticancer drug ellipticine (EPT) encapsulated in the self-assembling
   peptide EAK, and relate the different molecular states of EPT to their
   respective cancer inhibition efficacies. The first method is UV-based,
   where drug loading capacity of a particular molecular state was
   determined. The experimental data corroborated a molecular binding
   model, where peptide-drug interaction was assumed to be electrostatic in
   nature. The developed model could elucidate a unique pH effect on
   protonated EPT loading capacity. The second method is based on
   fluorescence characteristics of EPT, which could differentiate the two
   molecular states: protonated and crystalline of EPT in situ. The inner
   filter effect was, however, found with this method, presenting an
   ineluctable obstacle in quantitative analysis of fluorescence data. A
   correction method for the inner filter effect was thus developed. With
   this approach, concentrations of EPT at different molecular states in
   its peptide complex solutions were determined. In vitro cytotoxicity
   assay was applied to evaluate the efficacy of the two molecular states
   of EPT, showing that protonated EPT was more efficient at killing cancer
   cells than crystalline EPT. The molecular binding model and two
   characterization methods for EAK-EPT complexation could be extended to
   other carrier-drug systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantitative detection of PfHRP2 in saliva of malaria patients in the
   Philippines}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria is a global health priority with a heavy burden of
   fatality and morbidity. Improvements in field diagnostics are needed to
   support the agenda for malaria elimination. Saliva has shown significant
   potential for use in non-invasive diagnostics, but the development of
   off-the-shelf saliva diagnostic kits requires best practices for sample
   preparation and quantitative insight on the availability of biomarkers
   and the dynamics of immunoassay in saliva. This pilot study measured the
   levels of the PfHRP2 in patient saliva to inform the development of
   salivary diagnostic tests for malaria.
   Methods: Matched samples of blood and saliva were collected between
   January and May, 2011 from eight patients at Palawan Baptist Hospital in
   Roxas, Palawan, Philippines. Parasite density was determined from
   thick-film blood smears. Concentrations of PfHRP2 in saliva of
   malaria-positive patients were measured using a custom chemiluminescent
   ELISA in microtitre plates. Sixteen negative-control patients were
   enrolled at UCLA. A substantive difference between this protocol and
   previous related studies was that saliva samples were stabilized with
   protease inhibitors.
   Results: Of the eight patients with microscopically confirmed P.
   falciparum malaria, seven tested positive for PfHRP2 in the blood using
   rapid diagnostic test kits, and all tested positive for PfHRP2 in
   saliva. All negative-control samples tested negative for salivary
   PfHRP2. On a binary-decision basis, the ELISA agreed with microscopy
   with 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Salivary levels of PfHRP2
   ranged from 17 to 1,167 pg/mL in the malaria-positive group.
   Conclusion: Saliva is a promising diagnostic fluid for malaria when
   protein degradation and matrix effects are mitigated. Systematic
   quantitation of other malaria biomarkers in saliva would identify those
   with the best clinical relevance and suitability for off-the-shelf
   diagnostic kits.}},

Abstract = {{Zone-coated diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) can be used to obtain
   overall improved performance in oxidation reaction extents. However, why
   this occurs and under what conditions an impact is expected are unknown.
   In order to demonstrate why these catalysts work better than their
   standard counterparts and how significant the improved performance is,
   the CO oxidation performance over a series of Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts,
   each with a different distribution of precious metal down the length,
   while maintaining equivalent totals of precious metal, was modeled.
   Simulations with different flow rates, ramp rates, steady-state
   temperatures at the end of the ramp rate, different total precious metal
   loadings, and CO inlet values were compared. In terms of light off, at
   conversions less than 50\%, the most significant differences were noted
   when the temperature was ramped to just at the CO oxidation light-off
   point, with catalysts containing more precious metal at the downstream
   portions leading to better light-off conversion performance. However, in
   terms of cumulative emissions over a long period of time, a
   ``front-loaded{''} design proved best. These results are readily
   explained by decreased CO poisoning and the propagation of the
   exothermic heat from the front to the rear of the catalyst. Also,
   although the trends were the same, regardless of change in the
   parameter, the impact of different distributions was more apparent under
   conditions where a catalyst would be challenged, i.e., at low
   temperature ramp rates, higher CC) inlet concentrations, and lower
   amounts of total catalyst used. At higher ramp rates, the input heat
   from the entering gas stream played an increasingly important role,
   relative to conduction associated with the exotherm, dampening the
   effects of the catalyst distribution. Therefore, although catalysts that
   are zone-coated with precious metals, or any active sites, could prove
   better in terms of performance than homogeneously distributed active
   site catalysts, this improvement is only significant under certain
   reaction conditions and thus application of these catalysts may not be
   appropriate for all drive cycles or applications.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile actor is a promising tool for wireless sensor and actor networks
   (WSANs) provisioning energy and time efficient data collection. In this
   paper, we study actors' mobility control in WSANs for efficient events
   detecting in terms of time and energy consumption. We introduce an
   innovative approach ORACLE, to make actors predict events before sensors
   detection and migrate to the areas where the event may occur. In
   specific, we propose an event prediction scheme to predict an event from
   collected sensory data by utilizing the maximum likelihood estimation.
   Based on the perception, we design a control policy of actor's mobility
   pattern with Markov decision process. ORACLE not only enables minimal
   motion of actors which conserves time and energy to reach the event
   areas but also is energy-efficiency for sensors to reduce the forwarding
   range for event detection message. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
   proposed scheme through extensive experimental analysis. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Well dispersed aqueous suspensions containing single walled carbon

   SWNTs in an acid treatment. SWNT coated electrodes were prepared from

   collectors. The EPD process was identified as the primary tool for
   reliably producing uniform SWNT nanoporous networks on SST substrates.
   Optical and scanning electron microscopic images and the BET surface
   area analysis were used to evaluate the SWNT dispersion quality of the
   electrodes. The average SWNT nanopore size produced from the EPD process
   was found about 1 nm and was nearly unaffected by extended EPD
   processing times. The SWNT coated electrodes were characterized using
   the cyclic voltammetry and their capacitance was determined. A
   correlation between the extended EPD processing time and the electrode
   capacitance was quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Population coding in sparsely connected networks of noisy neurons}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the relationship between population coding and
   spatial connection statistics in networks of noisy neurons. Encoding of
   sensory information in the neocortex is thought to require coordinated
   neural populations, because individual cortical neurons respond to a
   wide range of stimuli, and exhibit highly variable spiking in response
   to repeated stimuli. Population coding is rooted in network structure,
   because cortical neurons receive information only from other neurons,
   and because the information they encode must be decoded by other
   neurons, if it is to affect behavior. However, population coding theory
   has often ignored network structure, or assumed discrete, fully
   connected populations (in contrast with the sparsely connected,
   continuous sheet of the cortex). In this study, we modeled a sheet of
   cortical neurons with sparse, primarily local connections, and found
   that a network with this structure could encode multiple internal state
   variables with high signal-to-noise ratio. However, we were unable to
   create high-fidelity networks by instantiating connections at random
   according to spatial connection probabilities. In our models,
   high-fidelity networks required additional structure, with higher
   cluster factors and correlations between the inputs to nearby neurons.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a numerical stability analysis of the film blowing
   process is performed. The numerical scheme used is based on a
   variational principle model of the film blowing operation. This model
   employs non-isothermal processing conditions, non-Newtonian behavior of
   the polymer and physically limiting criteria (maximum tensile and/or
   hoop stress) to investigate the complex relationship between processing
   conditions (internal bubble pressure, heat transfer coefficient, mass
   flow rate, cooling air temperature, melt/die temperature), material
   parameters (rupture stress, Newtonian viscosity, flow activation energy,
   power law index) and film blowing stability. It has been shown that the
   melt/die temperature has the highest impact on the film blowing
   stability window size as well as on the maximum and minimum achievable
   film thickness. In more detail, it has been found that processing
   parameters together with flow activation energy have much higher effect
   on the film blowing stability and maximum achievable film thickness than
   the basic rheological characteristics of the polymer melt. On the other
   hand, the effect of basic rheological parameters of the polymer melt
   become much more important than processing parameters (except of
   melt/die temperature) in order to reach minimum film thickness. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The ultrasonic properties of two devulcanized rubber (DR) blends with a
   styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) copolymer compound (ACE) are
   investigated using a transmission method. The DR materials are obtained
   from commercial rubber crumbs (RC) by a proprietary devulcanization
   technique. Measurements on the acoustic attenuation and travel velocity
   are conducted on the samples with different sample thicknesses in the
   pulsed mode. Attenuation coefficients of the materials are obtained by
   changing the frequency of the ultrasound in the tuned tone-burst mode.
   The two DR/ACE blends show marked differences in the attenuation and
   attenuation coefficient, although the ultrasonic velocities are similar.
   These differences arise from the variation of the remaining degree of
   crosslinking in the DR materials. The acoustic velocities in the three
   materials are similar. The morphologies of the DR/ACE blend samples,
   observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with different
   staining agents, explain their similarities and differences. There are
   two crops of rubber particles: larger ones belong to the original rubber
   crumbs that survived devulcanization; the smaller ones are fragments of
   partially DR. These crosslinked particles contribute to the overall
   degree of crosslinking in the blends. The devulcanized fractions of the
   DR materials are dispersed in the ACE matrix. Scattering at the
   interface accounts for the differences in the acoustic attenuation of
   the samples. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2012}},

Abstract = {{Cost function based routing has been widely studied in wireless sensor
   networks for energy efficiency improvement and network lifetime
   elongation. However, due to the complexity of the problem, existing
   solutions have various limitations. In this paper, we analyze the
   inherent factors, design principles and evaluation methods for cost
   function based routing algorithms. Two energy aware cost based routing
   algorithms named Exponential and Sine Cost Function based Route (ESCFR)
   and Double Cost Function based Route (DCFR) have been proposed in this
   paper. For ESCFR, its cost function can map small changes in nodal
   remaining energy to large changes in the function value. For DCFR, its
   cost function takes into consideration the end-to-end energy
   consumption, nodal remaining energy, resulting in a more balanced and
   efficient energy usage among nodes. The performance of the cost function
   design is analyzed. Extensive simulations demonstrate the proposed
   algorithms have significantly better performance than existing competing
   algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an optimal cache replacement policy for data
   access applications in wireless networks where data updates are injected
   from all the clients. The goal of the policy is to increase effective
   hits in the client caches and in turn, make efficient use of the network
   bandwidth in wireless environment. To serve the applications with the
   most updated data, we also propose two enhanced cache access policies
   making copies of data objects strongly consistent. We analytically prove
   that a cache system, with a combination of our cache access and
   replacement policy, guarantees the optimal number of effective cache
   hits and optimal cost (in terms of network bandwidth) per data object
   access. Results from both analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate
   that the proposed policies outperform the popular Least Frequently Used
   (LFU) scheme in terms of both effective hits and bandwidth consumption.
   Our flexible system model makes the proposed policies equally applicable
   to applications for the existing 3G, as well as upcoming LTE, LIE
   Advanced and WiMAX wireless data access networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Camera global motion estimation is critical to the success of video
   stabilization. This paper presents an effective and robust feature based
   motion estimation method. In the proposed approach, feature points are
   collected from input video sequences based on Speeded Up Robust Features

   vectors and incorrect correspondences. In the global motion estimation,
   a particle filter is used to estimate the weight of feature points,
   solving the issue of Different Depth of Field (DDOF) for feature points.
   Then, the weighted least square (WLS) algorithm is applied to obtain the
   global motion estimation. Finally, a Kalman filter estimates the
   intentional motion, and the unintentional motion is compensated to
   obtain stable video sequences. Experimental results show that the
   proposed algorithm has the characteristics of high precision and good

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was developed to simulate the precipitation
   kinetics during heat treatment of multicomponent aluminum alloys. The
   model is based on the general numerical framework proposed by Kampmann
   and Wagner, and features a full coupling with CALPHAD software for the
   evaluation of the Gibbs-Thomson effect. It also does not rely on the
   assumption that precipitate phase composition is stoichiometric or
   uniform, and is therefore applicable for predicting complex
   precipitation kinetics encountered in industrial practices. Applications
   of the model to various aging treatments of binary Al-Sc alloys and a
   ternary Al-Sc-Zr alloy were conducted. It was found that the model
   predictions for extended time coarsening kinetics are in good agreement
   with the analytical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner coarsening theory. Its
   ability to reproduce the complex precipitation pathways in
   multicomponent alloys was demonstrated by simulation of the
   precipitation kinetics for an Al-0.09 at.\% Sc-0.03 at.\% Zr alloy.
   Comparison of the simulation results with experimental measurement has
   also highlighted research directions that require further effort. (C)

Abstract = {{The climate impact studies in hydrology often rely on climate change
   information at fine spatial resolution. Because general circulation
   models (GCMs) operate on a coarse scale, the output from a GCM has to be
   downscaled to obtain the information relevant to hydrologic studies. In
   this paper, downscaling models are developed using the state-of-the-art
   nonparametric method K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) approach, with an
   emphasis on optimal choice in selection of nearest neighbors for
   obtaining simultaneous projections of mean monthly maximum and minimum
   temperatures (T-max and T-min) as well as monthly precipitation and pan
   evaporation to lake-basin scale in a semiarid region that is considered
   to be a climatically sensitive region in India. The performance of the
   K-NN approach was evaluated based on several statistical performance
   indicators. A comparison of K-NN has been made with a linear multiple
   regression (LMR)-based downscaling model. Also, the prevailing view in
   the literature regarding optimal choice of selection of nearest
   neighbors is checked with different perturbations. A simple
   multiplicative shift was used for correcting predictand values. The
   K-NN-based models are found to be superior to LMR-based models, and,
   subsequently, the K-NN-based model is applied to obtain future climate
   projections of the predictands. An increasing trend is observed for
   T-max and T-min for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios, and the precipitation is
   projected to increase in the future for A2 and A1B scenarios, whereas no
   trend has been observed for pan evaporation in future. DOI:

Abstract = {{An adaptive medium access control (MAC) re-transmission limit selection
   scheme is proposed to improve the performance of IEEE 802.11p standard
   MAC protocol for video streaming applications over vehicular ad-hoc
   networks (VANETs). A multi-objective optimization framework, which
   jointly minimizes the probability of playback freezes and start-up delay
   of the streamed video at the destination vehicle by tuning the MAC
   retransmission limit with respect to channel statistics as well as
   packet transmission rate, is applied at road side unit (RSU). Periodic
   channel state estimation is performed at the RSU using the information
   derived from the received signal strength (RSS) and Doppler shift
   effect. Estimates of access probability between the RSU and the
   destination vehicle is incorporated in the design of the adaptive MAC
   scheme. The adaptation parameters are embedded in the user datagram
   protocol (UDP) packet header. Two-hop transmission is applied in zones
   in which the destination vehicle is not within the transmission range of
   any RSU. For multi-hop scenario, we discuss two-hop joint MAC
   retransmission adaptation and path selection. Compared with the
   non-adaptive IEEE 802.11p standard MAC, numerical results show that the

   adsorption of nanoparticles at the interface in the absence of NaCl.
   Although IFT values for acidic and neutral conditions were found to be
   similar, a noticeable decrease in the IFT was found for more basic
   conditions. Increasing the temperature of the system was found to cause
   an increase in both dynamic and equilibrium IFT values. These findings
   have implications for the self-assembly of functionalized gold
   nanoparticles at liquid-liquid interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Significant research efforts have recently been directed toward
   materializing smart grid for the purpose of transforming the aging power
   grid into an efficient and intelligent electric power distribution
   system. Conceptually, smart grid can be regarded as a fusion of
   different advanced technologies (i.e., electrical power engineering
   meets sensing, control, digital communication, and network information
   technologies). However, when these advanced technologies converge at
   smart grid, we will face many unforeseen challenges, particularly
   security challenges in smart grid communications. In this article,
   toward secure targeted broadcast in smart grid, we investigate the
   applicability of Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) for smart grid
   communication scenarios. In particular, we focus on the application of
   Key Policy ABE (KP-ABE), where a smart grid's control center can use
   KP-ABE to broadcast a single encrypted message to a specific group of
   users, and each user in the targeted group can individually use the
   defined key policy to decrypt the message. With this kind of KP-ABE
   targeted broadcast, it is possible to eliminate the need for issuing
   multiple unicast messages. As a result, both communication and
   computation efficiency can be ensured.}},

   The diagnostic test was administered to students before (pre) and after

   provide instructors with feedback on their teaching. Using classical
   test theory and item response theory, aggregated results were analyzed
   to assess internal consistency and measurement error, respectively.
   Students demonstrated an improvement from pre-to post-test scores,
   showing gains of 23\%-34\% in understanding of new concepts learned. The
   internal consistency of the test has ranged from 0.61 to 0.68. It can be

Abstract = {{Practitioners in the area of neurology often need to retrieve multimodal
   magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain to study disease progression
   and to correlate observations across multiple subjects. In this paper, a
   novel technique for retrieving 2-D MR images (slices) in 3-D brain
   volumes is proposed. Given a 2-D MR query slice, the technique
   identifies the 3-D volume among multiple subjects in the database,
   associates the query slice with a specific region of the brain, and
   retrieves the matching slice within this region in the identified
   volumes. The proposed technique is capable of retrieving an image in
   multimodal and noisy scenarios. In this study, support vector machines
   (SVM) are used for identifying 3-D MR volume and for performing semantic
   classification of the human brain into various semantic regions. In
   order to achieve reliable image retrieval performance in the presence of
   misalignments, an image registration-based retrieval framework is
   developed. The proposed retrieval technique is tested on various
   modalities. The test results reveal superior robustness performance with
   respect to accuracy, speed, and multimodality.}},

Abstract = {{Because pervious concrete pavement (PCP) has a porous structure and can
   percolate water to an underground layer, it has been proposed as a
   stormwater best management practice (BMP), an environmentally friendly
   product, and sustainable paving materials. This porosity makes PCP
   susceptible to freeze-thaw damage in cold climates. Therefore, PCP has
   not been widely applied and investigated in such a climate. Long-term
   performance data are rarely available, and no performance model has been
   developed for PCP to date. The main objective of this research is to
   integrate expert knowledge (using the Markov-chain process) and
   experimental data (PCP field investigations) to build a performance
   model for PCP through incorporation of the Bayesian technique. The
   combination of these sources of data is an efficient and effective
   approach to build a performance model for a new type of pavement, such
   as PCP, which has not had a long-term performance database. As a result,
   a robust linear performance model is developed and applied to predict
   the service life of PCP. The service life of PCP is estimated to be
   approximately nine years using the developed performance model. In
   general, the expert knowledge leads to more conservative results rather

Abstract = {{Pervious concrete pavement (PCP) is of significant importance in the
   field of stormwater management in terms of reducing runoff volume.
   Stormwater managers should initially ensure that PCP adequately performs
   over time to be able to implement it in a stormwater management system.
   Performance models are intended to predict the performance of an asset
   over its service life. To develop a performance model commonly long-term
   performance data are essential. No performance model has been developed
   for PCP to date because PCP long-term performance data are rarely
   available. In such a case, expert knowledge is an alternative method to
   collect data for developing a performance model. This research aims to
   develop performance models for PCP for the first time by using an
   integrated Markov chain technique (combination of homogenous and
   non-homogenous techniques) through incorporation of expert knowledge.
   Both deterministic and stochastic approaches are applied to build up
   Markov models by using expected values and the Latin hypercube
   simulation technique, respectively. Both approaches provide consistent
   results although the stochastic Markov model provides more detailed
   results. Short-term experimental field data are also incorporated to
   validate the Markov performance models. DOI:

Abstract = {{In this article, a passive mechanism for thermal stress regulation in
   micro-bridge structures is proposed. The mechanism is essentially a set
   of precisely designed parallel chevron beams that replace one of the
   fixed ends of the micro-bridge. The axial stress/force of the beam is
   determined by utilizing a sensing mechanism that makes use of two
   side-electrodes and the electromechanical buckling of the micro-bridge
   toward one of them. A combination of analytical and finite element
   methods has been employed for the modeling of the proposed mechanism. It
   has been demonstrated that the regulator mechanism has negligible
   dynamic effect on the sensing micro-beam. The model takes into account
   the effect of electric field fringes between the electrically charged
   bodies. It has been shown that there is a time delay between the moment
   that the pull-in occurs and the instant that the sensing beam rests on a
   side-electrode. The results of the modeling are verified by experiment
   on two devices fabricated using MetalMUMPs(A (R)) fabrication
   technology. The thermal stress sensitivities of the devices are positive
   and their residual stresses are in excellent agreement.}},

Abstract = {{A field emission microscope (FEM) is a useful tool for investigating
   molecular surface structures. Conventional FEMs suffer from poor image
   contrast level and low sensitivities when low-energy electron beams are

   capability of clearly capturing images of facet boundaries of crystal
   structures at the tip of a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire as defect sites on
   a Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film that is exposed to electron beams.
   The clear image of facet boundaries has not been reported in

Abstract = {{For the fatigue design of aluminum structures, most applicable
   international codes specify fatigue-resistance (S-N) curves with slopes
   that vary, depending on the detail category. This complicates the
   selection of appropriate damage equivalence factors for use in highway
   bridge applications. The existing codes also differ in their treatment
   of high cycle fatigue, with single-slope S-N curves specified in some
   cases and multislope curves specified in others. In this paper, a recent
   investigation conducted to examine the fatigue behavior of aluminum
   welds under in-service highway bridge loading conditions is summarized.
   Specifically, calculations performed to establish damage equivalence
   factors for aluminum for use with the AASHTO and Canadian Standards
   Association (CSA) CAN/CSA-S6 codes are first reviewed. Following this,
   small-scale fatigue tests of aluminum welds under simulated highway
   bridge loading conditions are described. A fracture mechanics model is
   then validated by comparison with the test results and used to perform
   simulations encompassing a wider range of loading conditions. On the
   basis of this work, the adequacy of the current design provisions is
   discussed and possibilities for further extending the employed
   methodology are identified. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000223. (C)

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Shape descriptors have demonstrated encouraging potential for retrieving
   images based on image content, and a number of them have been reported
   in the literature. Nevertheless, most of the reported descriptors are
   still face accuracy and computational challenges. Fourier descriptors
   are considered to be promising descriptors as they are based on a sound
   theoretical foundation and also have the advantages of computational
   efficiency and attractive invariance properties. This paper proposes a
   new curvature-based Fourier descriptor (CBFD) for shape retrieval. The
   proposed descriptor takes an unconventional view of the
   curvature-scale-space representation of a shape contour as it treats it
   as a 2-D binary image (hence referred to as curvature-scale image, or
   CSI). The invariant descriptor is derived from the 2-D Fourier transform
   of the curvature-scale image. This method allows the descriptor to
   capture the detailed dynamics of the shape curvature and enhance the
   efficiency of the shape-matching process. Experiments using the widely
   known MPEG-7 databases in conjunction with a created noisy database have
   been conducted in order to compare the performance of the proposed
   descriptor with six commonly used shape-retrieval descriptors:
   curvature-scale-space descriptor (CSSD), angular radial transform
   descriptors (ARTD), Zernike moment descriptors (ZMD), radial Tchebichef
   moment descriptors (RTMD), generic Fourier descriptor (GFD), and the 1-D
   Fourier descriptor (1-FD). The performance of the proposed descriptor
   has surpassed that of many of these notable descriptors. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Efficient drug delivery to the eye remains a challenging task for
   pharmaceutical scientists. Due to the various anatomical barriers and
   the clearance mechanisms prevailing in the eye, conventional drug
   delivery systems, such as eye drop solutions, suffer from low

Abstract = {{Many impact studies require climate change information at a finer
   resolution than that provided by global climate models (GCMs). This
   paper investigates the performances of existing state-of-the-art rule
   induction and tree algorithms, namely single conjunctive rule learner,
   decision table, M5 model tree, and REPTree, and explores the impact of
   climate change on maximum and minimum temperatures (i.e., predictands)
   of 14 meteorological stations in the Upper Thames River Basin, Ontario,
   Canada. The data used for evaluation were large-scale predictor
   variables, extracted from National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset
   and the simulations from third generation Canadian coupled global
   climate model. Data for four grid points covering the study region were
   used for developing the downscaling model. M5 model tree algorithm was
   found to yield better performance among all other learning techniques
   explored in the present study. Hence, this technique was applied to
   project predictands generated from GCM using three scenarios (A1B, A2,
   and B1) for the periods (2046-2065 and 2081-2100). A simple
   multiplicative shift was used for correcting predictand values. The
   potential of the downscaling models in simulating predictands was
   evaluated, and downscaling results reveal that the proposed downscaling
   model can reproduce local daily predictands from large-scale weather
   variables. Trend of projected maximum and minimum temperatures was
   studied for historical as well as downscaled values using GCM and
   scenario uncertainty. There is likely an increasing trend for T (max)
   and T (min) for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios while decreasing trend has
   been observed for B1 scenarios during 2081-2100.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate on-demand data services for high-speed
   trains via a cellular/infostation integrated network. Service requests
   and acknowledgements are sent through the cellular network to a content
   server, while data delivery is achieved via trackside infostations. The
   optimal resource allocation problem is formulated by taking account of
   the intermittent network connectivity and multi-service demands. In
   order to achieve efficient resource allocation with low computational
   complexity, the original problem is transformed into a single-machine
   preemptive scheduling problem based on a time-capacity mapping. As the
   service demands are not known a priori, an online resource allocation
   algorithm based on Smith ratio and exponential capacity is proposed. The
   performance bound of the online algorithm is characterized based on the
   theory of sequencing and scheduling. If the link from the backbone
   network to an infostation is a bottleneck, a service pre-downloading
   algorithm is also proposed to facilitate the resource allocation. The
   performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated based on a real
   high-speed train schedule. Compared with the existing approaches, our
   proposed algorithms can significantly improve the quality of on-demand
   data service provisioning over the trip of a train.}},

   efficiencies and longer operation periods.

   using the TRNSYS software and compared to a traditional solar domestic
   hot water (SDHW) system and an electric domestic hot water (DHW) system.
   All of the systems had the same load profile and delivered domestic hot
   water at a constant temperature. This insured that each system delivered
   the same amount of energy for the entire modeling period thereby
   creating a common basis for comparison. It is important to note that
   each system considered in this study was used for domestic water heating
   only. It was found that the electrical consumption and operating cost
   were the lowest with the i-SAHP system. Other i-SAHP configurations need
   to be modeled to determine which configurations work best under the
   local design constraints. Further, the incremental cost of the i-SAHP
   needs to be determined in order to estimate realistic payback periods
   and to gauge economic feasibility.
   This work was done as a preliminary stage and was meant to roughly gauge
   the feasibility of the specific i-SAHP system in the study. Therefore,
   generic inputs were consistently used with all of the TRNSYS components
   and the trends of the results were considered more important than the
   actual numerical values obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   common problem for in-service wind turbine blades, is simulated based on
   the range of erosion found in turbine operating conditions. For the

Abstract = {{Effective removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from flue gas allows more

Abstract = {{Biodiesel and more often its blends have been extensively used to
   mitigate the dependence on fossil fuel and the greenhouse gas emissions.
   However, a good understanding of the impact of the difference in the
   thermophysical properties of biodiesel and its blends from those of
   petroleum diesel is required to reap the benefits of biodiesel
   utilization. In this study a multicomponent evaporation model has been
   developed for pure and blended biodiesel droplets to investigate their
   evaporation characteristics in high temperature convective environment
   as encountered in practical combustion systems; and it is validated
   through a comparison with experimental results. The vaporization
   characteristics of pure diesel, pure biodiesel fuel droplets as well as
   the effect of mixing them in different proportions (B20 and B50) are
   presented. The results reveal that biodiesel droplets evaporate at a
   slower rate than the diesel droplets because of biodiesel's relatively
   low vapor pressure. Consequently, the blending of diesel fuel with small
   proportions of biodiesel results in an increase in the evaporation
   timescale of the blended fuel droplets. Diffusion in the liquid phase is
   observed to be the rate controlling factor for blended droplet
   vaporization. The possibility of internal gasification for blended
   droplets is also investigated. A droplet with higher quantity of diesel
   is more prone to undergo internal gasification but micro-explosion is
   not likely to occur at atmospheric pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Understanding of current distributions in proton exchange membrane fuel
   cells (PEMFCs) is crucial for designing cell components such as the flow
   field plates and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). In this study,
   the spatial current density distributions in a single PEMFC with three

   conditions such as stoichiometry ratios, inlet humidity levels, cell
   pressure and temperature on the local current density distributions for

   that the local current density distribution over the MEA is directly
   affected by the cell operating conditions along with the configuration
   of the flow arrangement. It is also found that among the different flow
   configurations tested under the various operating conditions, the
   counter flow arrangement provides the optimum average current density
   and the lowest variations in the local current densities along the flow

Abstract = {{Cycling of relative humidity (RH) levels in polymer electrolyte membrane
   (PEM) fuel cells reactant streams have been reported to decay fuel cell
   performance. This study focuses on accelerated durability testing to
   examine different modes of membrane failure via relative humidity
   cycling. A single fuel cell with an active area of 42.25 cm(2) was
   tested. A Hydrogenics G50 test station was used to establish baseline
   cell with 840 h of degradation under high humidity idle conditions at a
   constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The membrane electrode
   assembly (MEA) contained a Gore (TM) 57 catalyst coated membrane (CCM)
   and 35 BC SGL gas diffusion layers (GDLs). During the test, in situ
   diagnostic methods, including polarization curves and linear sweep
   voltammetry (LSV) were employed. Also, ex situ tests such as ion
   chromatography, infrared imaging, and scanning electron microscopy were
   used to identify degradation mechanisms. For RH cycling cell, H-2-air
   inlet gases were alternated under dry and 100\% humidified conditions
   every 10 and 40 min, respectively. Under idle conditions, operated at
   very low current density, a low chemical degradation rate and minimal
   electrical load stress were anticipated. However, the membrane was
   expected to degrade due to additional stress from the membrane
   swelling/contraction cycle controlled by RH. The degradation rate for
   steady state conditions (0.18 mV h(-1)) was found to be lower than under
   RH cycling conditions (0.24 mV h(-1)). Change in RH led to an overall
   PEM fuel cell degradation due to the increase in hydrogen crossover
   current and fluoride ion release concentration. This study advanced the
   development of `diagnostics' for PEM fuel cells in that failure modes
   have been correlated with in situ performance observations. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The problem of checking blocking properties is studied for networks
   consisting of arbitrary numbers of finite-state discrete-event
   subsystems. The topology of the networks is that of a fully connected
   graph: any subsystem can potentially interact with any other. Two types
   of blocking are studied: component blocking, whereby a subsystem is
   potentially prevented from entering its set of marker states, and
   network blocking, whereby the subsystems are potentially unable to
   occupy marker states simultaneously. It is shown that if the subsystems
   are all identical and broadcast\} actions are permitted, both types of
   blocking properties are undecidable; but in the absence of broadcast
   actions, they become decidable. If the subsystems are not necessarily
   identical but only isomorphic, then blocking properties are in general
   undecidable; however, a template is proposed for ensuring adequate
   structure for decidability. It is claimed that this template is
   sufficiently general to admit many realistic examples.}},

   soft coverage constraint. In the first case, the coverage is expressed
   in terms of the outage probability, while in the second case, the
   expected rate should satisfy a certain minimum requirement. It is shown
   that the optimum solution (achieving the highest expected typical rate
   for given coverage requirements) in both cases is achieved by an
   infinite layer superposition code for which the optimal power allocation
   among different layers is derived. The analysis is extended to a
   scenario with multiple transmit antennas. For the MISO case, a
   suboptimal coding scheme is proposed, which is shown to be
   asymptotically optimal, when the number of transmit antennas grows at
   least logarithmically with the number of users in the network.}},

Title = {{Integrator Leakage for Limit Cycle Suppression in Servo Mechanisms With

Abstract = {{It is well known that the positional proportional-integral-derivative
   (PID) control of a servo mechanism with stiction always leads to a limit
   cycle. Related to this fact, two basic questions have still remained
   unanswered. The first question is, if the limit cycle occurs, how large
   it becomes for a given value of stiction force. The second question,
   which is of more practical importance, is how we should modify the PID
   controller to avoid this limit cycle with minimal sacrifice of the servo
   performance. This paper presents a rigorous analysis to provide
   particular answers to these two questions, which turn out to be closely
   related to each other. More specifically, it is shown that, by
   exploiting algebraic properties of the state trajectory, a simple
   bisection algorithm can be devised to compute the exact magnitude of the
   periodic solution for a given value of stiction. Through the geometric
   analysis of the impact map, this result is then used to find the minimum
   value of the integrator leakage to avoid the limit cycle. The work in
   this paper will be useful as a specific reference in designing servo
   mechanisms with stiction free from limit cycle. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The characteristics of electroplated Sn bumps, fabricated without a PR
   (photoresist) mould on copper-plugged TSVs (through-silicon vias), in a
   Si chip were investigated. A new process of non-PR bumping developed in
   this research was considered to enhance the productivity and reduce the
   cost for three-dimensional (3D) chip stacking. To produce Sn bumps, Pt
   was adopted as an anode, and thinned Si die with Cu-plugged TSVs as a
   cathode. The polarization curve of the Sn electrolyte was analysed to
   determine the reduction potential of the Sn ion. The heights, widths,
   and uniformities of the Sn bumps produced through the proposed non-PR
   process were evaluated to assess the feasibility of reliable Sn bumping
   using this process. The experimental results showed that the Sn
   electrolyte had a reduction potential of 0.463 V. The Sn bumps with
   rivet-head shapes were produced successfully without a PR mould on
   Cu-plugged TSV. The Sn bumps grew in both vertical (thickness) and
   lateral (width) directions due to the absence of a PR mould. The plating
   time was varied from 2 to 60 min at a constant current density of 30
   mA/cm(2), and the bump height and width became 39 and 76 pm at 60 min,
   respectively. The morphologies of the Sn bumps without a PR mould showed
   the preferred facet growth by increasing the plating time, which
   resulted in increase of Sn facet size but decrease of number of facets.
   The uniformity of the bump widths on a chip was within the range of
   86.9-95.4\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Identification of Structures}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Ambient system identification in noisy environments, in the presence of
   low-energy modes or closely-spaced modes, is a challenging task.
   Conventional blind source separation techniques such as second-order
   blind identification (SOBI) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) do
   not perform satisfactorily under these conditions. Furthermore,
   structural system identification for flexible structures require the
   extraction of more modes than the available number of independent sensor
   measurements. This results in the estimation of a non-square modal
   matrix that is spatially sparse. To overcome these challenges, methods
   that integrate blind identification with time-frequency decomposition of
   signals have been previously presented. The basic idea of these methods
   is to exploit the resolution and sparsity provided by time-frequency
   decomposition of signals, while retaining the advantages of second-order
   source separation methods. These hybrid methods integrate two powerful
   time-frequency decompositionswavelet transforms and empirical mode
   decompositioninto the framework of SOBI. In the first case, the
   measurements are transformed into the time-frequency domain, followed by
   the identification using a SOBI-based method in the transformed domain.
   In the second case, a subset of the operations are performed in the
   transformed domain, while the remaining procedure is conducted using the
   traditional SOBI method. A new method to address the under-determined
   case arising from sparse measurements is proposed. Each of these methods
   serve to address a particular situation: closely-spaced modes or
   low-energy modes. The proposed methods are verified by applying them to
   extract the modal information of an airport control tower structure
   located near Toronto in Canada.}},

   usefulness in disclosures among the IPPs. It points out potential
   information asymmetry to decision making of the primary stakeholders who
   seek to invest in renewable and sustainable energy while countering
   short-termism over financial returns. A concerted policy effort on

   solely on fluorescence data collected 15 min from the start of the

   model-based optimization of backwashing times with the objective of
   minimizing the energy consumption per unit amount of water produced

Abstract = {{The production of biopharmaceuticals from mammalian cell culture is
   hindered by apoptosis, which is the primary cause of cell death in these
   cultures. As a tool for optimization of culture yield, this study
   presents a population-based model describing the progression of
   apoptosis in a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-producing Chinese hamster ovary
   (CHO) cell culture. Because mAb production does not cease when apoptosis
   begins, the model was designed to incorporate subpopulations at various
   stages in the progression of apoptosis. The model was validated against
   intracellular measurements of caspase activity as well as cell density,
   nutrient levels, and toxic metabolites. Since the specific details of
   apoptotic mechanisms have not been elucidated in this cell line, we
   employed a model comparison analysis that suggests the most plausible

Abstract = {{The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is a versatile and
   powerful platform for protein expression in insect cells. With the
   ability to approach similar post-translational modifications as in
   mammalian cells, the BEVS offers a number of advantages including high
   levels of expression as well as an inherent safety during manufacture
   and of the final product. Many BEVS products include proteins and
   protein complexes that require expression from more than one gene. This
   review examines the expression strategies that have been used to this
   end and focuses on the distinguishing features between those that make
   use of single polycistronic baculovirus (co-expression) and those that
   use multiple monocistronic baculoviruses (co-infection). Three major
   areas in which researchers have been able to take advantage of
   co-expression/co-infection are addressed, including compound
   structure-function studies, insect cell functionality augmentation, and
   VLP production. The core of the review discusses the parameters of
   interest for co-infection and co-expression with time of infection (TOI)
   and multiplicity of infection (MOI) highlighted for the former and the
   choice of promoter for the latter. In addition, an overview of modeling
   approaches is presented, with a suggested trajectory for future
   exploration. The review concludes with an examination of the gaps that
   still remain in co-expression/co-infection knowledge and practice. (C)

Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{Immobilized lipase has the potential to be the catalyst of choice for
   biodiesel production since it is efficient, effective, and
   environmentally friendly; however, the stability and activity of lipase
   must be addressed before enzymatic biodiesel production processes can be
   industrially accepted. This study investigates an enzyme immobilization
   procedure that immobilizes lipase in a sol-gel supported on diatomaceous
   earth (Celite (R) R632), and determines its potential for biodiesel
   production in terms of achievable conversion and apparent stability.
   Four immobilized materials (lipase sol-gels with and without Celite (R)
   at two protein loading levels) were compared in terms of their
   immobilized protein content, conversion of methanol to methyl oleate,
   lipase activity, long term stability, and glycerol-water adsorption. The
   Celite (R) R632 sol-gel with high protein loading achieved the maximum
   conversion in the 6-h reaction period (90\%). A drying step was found to
   be advantageous prior to the reaction, and the absorption of
   glycerol-water on the Celite (R) was only found to be significant at
   high levels of glycerol. The material was found to be very stable upon
   storage at 4 degrees C for up to 1.5 years, losing only about 15\% of
   its percent conversion capacity per year. Based on this study, the
   supported immobilization technique shows significant potential as a
   novel catalyst for biodiesel production. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In multihop cellular networks, the mobile nodes usually relay others'
   packets for enhancing the network performance and deployment. However,
   selfish nodes usually do not cooperate but make use of the cooperative
   nodes to relay their packets, which has a negative effect on the network
   fairness and performance. In this paper, we propose a fair and efficient
   incentive mechanism to stimulate the node cooperation. Our mechanism
   applies a fair charging policy by charging the source and destination
   nodes when both of them benefit from the communication. To implement
   this charging policy efficiently, hashing operations are used in the ACK
   packets to reduce the number of public-key-cryptography operations.
   Moreover, reducing the overhead of the payment checks is essential for
   the efficient implementation of the incentive mechanism due to the large
   number of payment transactions. Instead of generating a check per
   message, a small-size check can be generated per route, and a check
   submission scheme is proposed to reduce the number of submitted checks
   and protect against collusion attacks. Extensive analysis and
   simulations demonstrate that our mechanism can secure the payment and
   significantly reduce the checks' overhead, and the fair charging policy
   can be implemented almost computationally free by using hashing
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring on

   (Pt/C) catalysts in alkaline conditions is analyzed through rotating

   mechanisms reported in the literature. The purely chemical intermediate
   reactions are found to be insensitive in the modeling of this mechanism,
   whereby the models can be simplified to the occurrence of parallel two
   and four electrochemical electron pathways. Rotating ring disk
   measurements are shown to be an alternative technique to split the total
   current density into partial currents that could be associated with the
   respective reaction pathways. Experimental comparisons of the NCNT and
   Pt/C catalysts revealed that the ORR kinetics on these materials
   proceeds similarly throughout two and four electron pathways. The
   four-electron pathway is found to be the most dominant in both
   catalysts. Kinetic improvements for the NCNT catalysts are observed,
   positioning them as promising materials for the ORR catalysis in fuel

Abstract = {{Part I of this study carried out membrane electrode assembly degradation
   of a four-cell stack with Nafion membranes of different thicknesses,
   including N117, N115, NR212, and NR211, for 1000 h under idle
   conditions. Through on-line electrochemical measurements it was found
   that as degradation advanced, cells with thinner membranes experienced
   much more rapid performance degradation than those with thicker
   membranes, especially after 800 h of operation, due to a dramatic
   increase in hydrogen crossover. In the present work we investigate the
   degradation mechanisms of this four-cell stack using several ex situ
   diagnostic tools, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared
   (IR) imaging, ion chromatography (IC), gas permeability measurement,
   contact angle measurement, and simulation. The results indicate that the
   drastic increase in hydrogen crossover is due to membrane thickness loss
   and pinhole formation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Low power near-ultraviolet laser can be employed in various pattern
   transfer techniques such as maskless lithography and organic film

   creating micro-molds for metal deposition using electroplating and
   electroless deposition. This paper presents experimental results, a
   quantitative study and modeling of laser maskless processing using
   desktop Nd:YAG laser system using four different photoresists. Process
   variables were experimentally optimized to identify the appropriate
   laser parameters that would yield reliable and reproducible patterns. A
   finite element thermal model of the ablation process was created to
   investigate the effects of different substrate materials on the process

Abstract = {{Two semi-quantitative grading methods (referred to as the

   Also, the Modified-method gave significantly higher damage scores for
   males with gamma-in-air irradiated polyethylene inserts whereas the
   Hood/Wasielewski-method did not. Thus, the damage score obtained using

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The vapour-liquid phase behaviour of steam-solvent (light hydrocarbon)
   systems used in an oil sands recovery process called steam assisted
   gravity drainage (SAGD) is examined. Analysis shows that condensation
   occurs over a temperature range and that a concentration gradient exists
   between the liquid and vapour phases. In a large range of solvent
   concentrations, water condenses first from the vapour phase. Solvent
   only condenses first from the vapour phase at extremely high solvent
   volume fractions. Due to water condensing first at most concentrations,
   the ability of the solvent to directly contact the bitumen in the
   reservoir depends on the orientation of the vapour-liquid interface and
   the relative position in the vapour chamber. Addition of solvent into a
   mature SAGD operation can also cause a temporary suppression of the
   steam-oil ratio (SOR) due to the change in the temperature at the
   vapour-liquid interface. This effect must be taken into account in
   interpreting experimental or simulation results. The addition of solvent
   not only changes the temperature but also decreases the heat of
   condensation of the mixture. As the concentration of solvent changes,
   the SOR is also expected to change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study is performed on the use of higher-order terms of
   the crack tip asymptotic fields as enriching functions for the eXtended
   FEM (XFEM) for both cohesive and traction-free cracks. For traction-free
   cracks, the Williams asymptotic field is used to obtain highly accurate
   stress intensity factors (SIFs), directly from the enriched degrees of
   freedom without any post-processing. The low accuracy of the results of
   the original research on this subject by Liu et al. {[}Int. J. Numer.
   Meth. Engng., 2004; 59:11031118] is remedied here by appropriate
   modifications of the enrichment scheme. The modifications are simple and
   can be easily included into an XFEM computer code. For cohesive cracks,
   the relevant asymptotic field is used, and two widely used criteria
   including the SIFs criterion and the stress criterion are examined for
   the crack growth simulation. Both linear and nonlinear cohesive laws are
   used. For the stress criterion, averaging is avoided due to the highly
   accurate crack tip approximation because of the higher-order enrichment.
   Then, a modified stress criterion is proposed, which is shown to be
   applicable to a wider class of problems. Several numerical examples,
   including straight and curved cracks, stationary and growing cracks,
   single and multiple cracks, and traction-free and cohesive cracks, are
   studied to investigate in detail?the robustness and efficiency of the
   proposed enrichment scheme. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The resolution in optical coherence tomography imaging is an important
   parameter which determines the size of the smallest features that can be

   in producing high resolution OCT images with fewer camera pixels,
   reducing both the cost and the complexity of an imaging system. In this
   paper, we propose a non-local approach to the reconstruction of high
   resolution OCT images from sparsely sampled measurements. An iterative
   strategy is introduced for minimizing a homotopic, non-local regularized
   functional in the spatial domain, subject to data fidelity constraints
   in the k-space domain. The novel algorithm was tested on human retinal,
   corneal, and limbus images, acquired in-vivo, demonstrating the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating high resolution
   reconstructions from a limited number of camera pixels. (C) 2012 Optical

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with the dramatically increased penetration of wireless
   access, the conflict between spectrum scarcity and under-utilisation is
   becoming more and more aggravating. A promising technology to tackle
   such challenge is cognitive radio, of which spectrum sensing is one of
   the most important functionalities. In this study, the authors consider
   an essential problem of energy-efficient spectrum sensing in cognitive
   radio networks. Although most existing works of spectrum sensing mainly
   focus on determining an optimal sensing time to maximise the detection
   probability and/or to minimise the false alarm probability, our problem
   of how to schedule the power-constrained sensor is much more
   challenging, because of the trade-off among interests of the primary
   user, secondary user and sensor. The authors formulate it as a
   non-linear optimisation problem to maximise the sensor lifetime, with
   necessary constraints of quality and delay of spectrum sensing, and
   throughput for performance guarantee of primary and secondary users.
   Moreover, the authors incorporate the distribution information of
   channel occupancy/vacancy durations into the problem to yield a
   desirable solution. They propose a novel framework to obtain the optimal
   energy-efficient periodic scheduling by adopting both non-linear
   programming and linear programming. Extensive simulation results are
   provided to validate our theoretical analysis.}},

   considered to apply the most realistic model for the velocity boundary
   condition at the interface of the two fluids. Effects on the flow field
   of zeta-potential and viscosity ratio of the two fluids were
   investigated. Similar to the electroosmotic flow in microchannels, an
   approximately flat velocity profile exists in the aqueous solution. In
   the immiscible fluid phase, the velocity decreases to zero from the
   interface toward the immiscible fluid phase. The velocity in both phases
   increases with zeta-potential at the interface of the two fluids. The
   higher values of zeta-potential also increase the slip velocity at the
   interface of the two fluids. For the same applied electric field and the
   same zeta-potential at the interface of the two fluids, the more viscous
   immiscible fluid, the slower the system moves. The viscosity of the
   immiscible fluid phase also affects the flatness of the velocity profile
   in the aqueous solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate a fiber Bragg grating sensor for
   bio-chemical detection. In the sensor area, the fiber has been
   chemically etched to the core with a diameter of 7 mu m. Due to
   increased index contrast, the etched-core fiber Bragg grating supports
   multiple guided modes which respond differently to the refractive index
   of the surrounding medium, temperature and the strain. An asymmetric
   adiabatic taper is created between the etched and the unetched parts of
   the fiber resulting in excitation of both the symmetrical and the
   asymmetrical modes which can be interrogated with an erbium doped fiber
   amplifier amplified spontaneous emission source. The sensor is
   integrated with a Poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel for
   introduction of chemicals to be tested. A refractive index sensitivity
   of 92 nm/riu was achieved using the 3rd order mode. Further the sensor
   can simultaneously measure the refractive index, temperature and strain
   to an accuracy of 1 x 10(-4), 0.32 degrees C and 10 mu epsilon assuming
   a wavelength resolution of 0.01 nm. By using signal processing, these
   resolutions can be improved by a factor of 10.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, saline water was used as a preintercalating agent for
   pristine clay surface to assist clay dispersion in one-step melt state
   process. The solution contains dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride salt
   in distilled water and was injected into the twin-screw extruder using a
   high pressure dosing pump. To investigate the effect of dissolution of
   alkyl salt on clay dispersion, two samples with the same compositions
   were prepared through both salt solution and pure water injection which
   was compared with organo-modified prepared sample. The resultant
   compounds were characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and
   dynamic rheological measurements (RMS). Tensile and notched-Izod impact
   properties of the samples were measured as well. The XRD results showed
   no peak for the sample containing 2 wt \% pristine clay, prepared via
   injection of salt solution representing exfoliated microstructure. In
   addition, TEM images showed proper dispersion and distribution of clay
   platelets in the matrix. Furthermore, RMS results showed that the slop
   of the storage modulus has been declined and for the sample using
   saline, the variation was prominent as a result of network structure
   formation. Tensile results also showed an increase of tensile modulus in
   the range of about 22\% for the sample containing 2 wt \% clay. Izod
   impact strength in the sample prepared via injection of salt solution
   showed fracture energy comparable to neat polyethylene. Additionally,
   the crystallization data in terms of degree of crystallinity, melting,
   and crystallization temperatures of samples represented no noticeable
   change compared to neat polyethylene. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{The article provides a biomechanical analysis of ventral furrow
   formation in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Ventral furrow
   formation is the first large-scale morphogenetic movement in the fly
   embryo. It involves deformation of a uniform cellular monolayer formed
   following cellularisation, and has therefore long been used as a simple
   system in which to explore the role of mechanics in force generation.
   Here we use a quantitative framework to carry out a systematic
   perturbation analysis to determine the role of each of the active forces
   observed. The analysis confirms that ventral furrow invagination arises
   from a combination of apical constriction and apical-basal shortening
   forces in the mesoderm, together with a combination of ectodermal
   forces. We show that the mesodermal forces are crucial for invagination:
   the loss of apical constriction leads to a loss of the furrow, while the
   mesodermal radial shortening forces are the primary cause of the
   internalisation of the future mesoderm as the furrow rises. Ectodermal
   forces play a minor but significant role in furrow formation: without
   ectodermal forces the furrow is slower to form, does not close properly
   and has an aberrant morphology. Nevertheless, despite changes in the
   active mesodermal and ectodermal forces lead to changes in the timing
   and extent of furrow, invagination is eventually achieved in most cases,
   implying that the system is robust to perturbation and therefore
   over-determined.}},

Abstract = {{Whiplash injuries continue to have significant societal cost; however,
   the mechanism and location of whiplash injury is still under
   investigation. Recently, the upper cervical spine ligaments,
   particularly the alar ligament, have been identified as a potential
   whiplash injury location. In this study, a detailed and validated
   explicit finite element model of a 50th percentile male cervical spine
   in a seated posture was used to investigate upper cervical spine
   response and the potential for whiplash injury resulting from vehicle
   crash scenarios. This model was previously validated at the segment and
   whole spine levels for both kinematics and soft tissue strains in
   frontal and rear impact scenarios.
   The model predicted increasing upper cervical spine ligament strain with
   increasing impact severity. Considering all upper cervical spine
   ligaments, the distractions in the apical and alar ligaments were the
   largest relative to their failure strains, in agreement with the
   clinical findings. The model predicted the potential for injury to the
   apical ligament for 15.2 g frontal or 11.7 g rear impacts, and to the
   alar ligament for a 20.7 g frontal or 14.4 g rear impact based on the
   ligament distractions. Future studies should consider the effect of
   initial occupant position on ligament distraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The potential to use the results of biochemical acid potential (BAP)
   tests to predict the ultimate digestibility of raw and pretreated waste
   activated sludge (WAS) was investigated. The ultimate methane production
   from biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests on raw and pretreated
   samples which spanned a range of biodegradability proved linearly
   related to the volatile fatty acid (VFA) and soluble chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) production in corresponding BAP tests. In addition, a
   linear relationship between NH4-N production in the BMP and BAP tests
   was observed. Despite the linear nature of the relationships, the ratio
   of the production of methane in the BMP tests to the production of VFAs
   in the BAP tests varied with the biodegradability of the sludge samples.
   Waste Activated Sludge samples with low digestibility had ultimate
   yields of CH4 that were greater than the VFA yields in BAP tests,
   whereas sludge samples with high digestibility had lower yields of CH4
   than the corresponding VFA yields. This trend contrasted with the NH4
   results, in which the yields in the BAP tests were consistently less
   than those observed in the BMP tests. It was hypothesized that the
   varying relationship between CH4 and VFA yields was because of the
   inhibition of anaerobic oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in
   the BAP tests. Long-chain fatty acids would be converted to CH4 in BMP
   tests but produced as digestion intermediates in the BAP tests and were
   not measured as part of the VFA yield. Hydrogen and acetate were
   identified as the two most likely intermediates that would accumulate in
   the BAP tests (which would cause inhibition). A stoichiometric model to
   facilitate the development of an improved understanding of the
   biodegradation processes in the BAP and BMP tests was assembled. When
   the model was applied to the BAP tests the anaerobic oxidation of LCFAs
   and propionate and methanogenesis were excluded from the model. The
   model was employed to estimate the extent of degradation of lipids,
   carbohydrates, and proteins in the batch tests as a function of the
   ultimate biodegradability of the sludge samples. On the basis of model
   fitting, it was determined that the degradation of lipids in BMP tests
   decreased, whereas the degradation of carbohydrates and proteins
   increased as the digestibility of the sludge samples increased. The
   varying ratio of lipid to protein and carbohydrate degradability with
   increasing digestibility of the sludge samples describes the
   relationship between VFA production and CH4 production in the BAP, and
   BMP tests, respectively. Water Environ. Res., 84, 362 (2012).}},

Abstract = {{A lasing scheme for terahertz quantum cascade lasers, based on
   consecutive phonon-photon-phonon emissions per module, is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. The charge transport of the proposed
   structure is modeled using a rate equation formalism. An optimization
   code based on a genetic algorithm was developed to find a four-well
   design in the GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As material system that maximizes the
   product of population inversion and oscillator strength at 150 K. The
   fabricated devices using Au double-metal waveguides show lasing at 3.2
   THz up to 138 K. The electrical characteristics display no sign of
   differential resistance drop at lasing threshold, which, in conjunction
   with the low optical power of the device, suggest-thanks to the rate
   equation model-a slow depopulation rate of the lower lasing state, a
   hypothesis confirmed by non-equilibrium Green's function calculations.

Abstract = {{Extending time-resolved laser-induced incandescence (TiRe-LII), a
   diagnostic traditionally used to characterize soot and other
   carbonaceous particles, into a tool for measuring metal nanoparticles
   requires knowledge of the thermal accommodation coefficient for those
   systems. This parameter can be calculated using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations provided the interatomic potential is known between the gas
   molecule and surface atoms, but this is not often the case for many
   gas/surface combinations. In this instance, researchers often resort to
   the Lorentz-Berthelot combination rules to estimate the gas/surface
   potential using parameters derived for homogeneous systems. This paper
   compares this methodology with a more accurate approach based on ab
   initio derived potentials to estimate the thermal accommodation
   coefficient for laser-energized nickel nanoparticles in argon. Results
   show that the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules overestimate the true
   potential well depth by an order of magnitude, resulting in perfect
   thermal accommodation, whereas the more accurate ab initio derived
   potential predicts an accommodation coefficient in excellent agreement
   with experimentally-determined values for other metal nanoparticle
   aerosols. This result highlights the importance of accurately
   characterizing the gas/surface potential when using MD to estimate
   thermal accommodation coefficients for TiRe-LII.}},

Abstract = {{The modified cross-correlation (MCC) blind identification method is
   extended to handle the underdetermined case of structural system
   identification. The underdetermined case is one in which the number of
   sensors is less than the number of identifiable modes. The basic
   framework of the modified cross-correlation method is retained in cases
   in which multiple covariance matrices constructed from the correlation
   of the responses are diagonalized. The solution to the underdetermined
   blind identification consists of two stages: the generation of intrinsic
   mode functions (IMFs) from the measurements by using empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD) and the application of the modified
   cross-correlation method to the decomposed signals. The available
   measurements are first decomposed into IMFs by using the sifting process
   of EMD. Subsequently, the IMFs are used as initial estimates for the
   sources, and the MCC method is implemented in an iterative framework.
   Initial estimates for the mixing matrix necessary to start the iterative
   process are selected using assumed shape functions that satisfy the
   essential boundary conditions. The need for sensor measurements at all
   the relevant degrees of freedom (DOF) to identify the mode shapes is
   alleviated in this approach. This is the main advantage of the proposed
   method. Vibration responses collected from the apron control tower
   located at the Toronto Pearson International Airport are used for
   demonstration.DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000328. (C) 2012 American

   furan content in transformer oil. The predictors were chosen based on
   the physical nature of oil/paper insulation degradation under
   transformer operating conditions. Moreover, stepwise regression was used
   to further tune the prediction model by selecting the most significant

Abstract = {{Popular smart wireless devices become equipped with multiple radio
   interfaces. Multihoming support can be enabled to allow for multiple
   simultaneous associations with heterogeneous networks. In this study, we
   focus on video streaming traffic and propose analytical approaches to
   evaluate the packet-level and call-level performance of a multipath
   transmission scheme, which sends video traffic bursts over multiple
   available channels in a probabilistic manner. A probability generation
   function (PGF) and z-transform method is applied to derive the PGF of
   packet delay and any arbitrary moment in general. Particularly, we can
   obtain the average delay, delay jitter, and delay outage probability.
   The essential characteristics of video traffic are taken into account,
   such as deterministic burst intervals, highly dynamic burst length, and
   batch arrivals of transmission packets. The video substream traffic
   resulting from the probabilistic flow splitting is characterized by
   means of zero-inflated models. Further, the call-level performance, in
   terms of flow blocking probability and system throughput, is evaluated
   with a three-dimensional Markov process and compared with that of an
   always-best access selection. The numerical and simulations results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis framework and the
   performance gain of multipath transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to study the impact of advanced physical
   layer techniques on the maximum achievable throughput of wireless
   multihop mesh networks. We formulate a cross-layer optimization
   framework for the routing and scheduling problem jointly with the
   following physical layer techniques: successive interference
   cancellation, superposition coding, dirty-paper coding and their
   combinations. In the case when each node is enabled with superposition
   coding, we need to formulate a power allocation subproblem for the
   optimal power partition of the superimposed signals. We solve these
   joint problems exactly to compute the maximum achievable throughput in
   realistic size networks. This allows us to quantify the performance
   gains obtained by using these techniques (and their combinations).
   Specifically, we find that the use of dirty-paper coding (only at the
   gateway) is not justified in networks with mixed uplink and downlink
   flows. On the other hand, the combination of superposition coding with
   successive interference outperforms significantly other techniques
   across all transmission power range for both uplink and downlink flows.
   We also provide a number of interesting practical insights on throughput
   improvement by comparing different combinations of these techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a microfluidic method of continuous separation of
   marine algae and particles by DC dielectrophoresis. The locally
   non-uniform electric field is generated by an insulating PDMS triangle
   hurdle fabricated within a PDMS microchannel. Both the particles and
   algae are subject to negative DEP forces at the hurdle where the
   gradient of local electric-field strength is the strongest. The DEP
   force acting on the particle or the algae depends on particles' or
   algae's volume, shape and dielectric properties. Thus the moving
   particles and algae will be repelled to different streamlines when
   passing the hurdle. In this way, combined with the electroosmotic flow,
   continuous separation of algae of two different sizes, and continuous
   separation of polystyrene particles and algae with similar volume but
   different shape were achieved. This first demonstration of DC DEP
   separation of polystyrene particles and algae with similar sizes
   illustrates the great influence of dielectric properties on particle
   separation and potentials for sample pretreatment.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic characterization of ultrasonic wave propagation in wood

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{484-493}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Wood poles are widely used in North America to support power electric
   transmission and distribution lines. Wood poles are continuously exposed
   to wide ranging temperature and moisture conditions, making them
   vulnerable to internal decay and rotting. The resulting loss of strength
   makes the poles vulnerable to failure under adverse weather conditions,
   such as wind and snow storms. These failures can result in forced
   outages and customer disruptions with significant economic losses.
   Ultrasonic testing is a non-destructive method that has been used for
   detection of internal deterioration of in-service wood poles, which is
   based on the comparison of the measured wave velocity with a reference
   wave velocity associated with sound wood. The current ultrasonic methods
   assume that the reference wave velocity for a given wood species is
   constant in a pole cross section. This approach is simplistic because
   wood is an orthotropic material with highly variable material
   properties. This paper presents a method for probabilistic
   characterization of ultrasonic wave propagation in wood poles
   considering wood as an orthotropic material. A better understanding and
   characterization of ultrasonic wave propagation in a pole cross section
   will contribute to improve the condition assessment of in-service wood
   poles based on ultrasonic tests. As an example, P-wave velocity, surface
   waves, frequency response function, and magnitude spectrum area are used
   to characterize the propagation of ultrasonic waves at a cross section
   of a Douglas-fir pole of 25 cm diameter.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique for mitigating simultaneous switching noise
   propagation in high-speed printed circuit boards is presented. The
   proposed concept is based on etching complementary split-ring resonators
   (CSRRs) on only one metallic layer of the printed circuit board. By such

   It is shown here that by concentrically cascading CSRRs, an
   ultrawideband suppression of switching noise from sub-GHz to 12 GHz is
   achieved. A prototype of the proposed concept was simulated, fabricated,
   and tested. Good agreement is observed between simulation and
   measurement. Moreover, electromagnetic interference radiation from such
   perforated boards is investigated. Finally, the performance of the
   proposed board with CSRRs is assessed through signal integrity analysis
   using eye diagrams and compared with a reference (solid) board.}},

Abstract = {{A region-based unsupervised segmentation and classification algorithm

   incorporates region growing and a Markov random field edge strength
   model is designed and implemented. This algorithm is an extension of the

   and classification algorithm, which was designed for amplitude only SAR
   imagery, to polarimetric data. Polarimetric IRGS (PolarIRGS) extends
   IRGS by incorporating a polarimetric feature model based on the Wishart
   distribution and modifying key steps such as initialization, edge
   strength computation, and the region growing criterion. Like IRGS,
   PolarIRGS oversegments an image into regions and employs iterative
   region growing to reduce the size of the solution search space. The
   incorporation of an edge penalty in the spatial context model improves
   segmentation performance by preserving segment boundaries that
   traditional spatial models will smooth over. Evaluation of PolarIRGS
   with Flevoland fully polarimetric data shows that it improves upon two
   other recently published techniques in terms of classification accuracy.}},

Title = {{The use of a genetic algorithm-based search strategy in geostatistics:
   application to a set of anisotropic piezometric head data}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{In any geostatistical study, an important consideration is the choice of
   an appropriate, repeatable, and objective search strategy that controls
   the nearby samples to be included in the location-specific estimation
   procedure. Almost all geostatistical software available in the market
   puts the onus on the user to supply search strategy parameters in a
   heuristic manner. These parameters are solely controlled by geographical
   coordinates that are defined for the entire area under study, and the
   user has no guidance as to how to choose these parameters. The main
   thesis of the current study is that the selection of search strategy
   parameters has to be driven by data-both the spatial coordinates and the
   sample values-and cannot be chosen beforehand. For this purpose, a
   genetic-algorithm-based ordinary kriging with moving neighborhood
   technique is proposed. The search capability of a genetic algorithm is
   exploited to search the feature space for appropriate, either local or
   global, search strategy parameters. Radius of circle/sphere and/or radii
   of standard or rotated ellipse/ellipsoid are considered as the decision
   variables to be optimized by GA. The superiority of GA-based ordinary
   kriging is demonstrated through application to the Wolfcamp Aquifer
   piezometric head data. Assessment of numerical results showed that
   definition of search strategy parameters based on both geographical
   coordinates and sample values improves cross-validation statistics when
   compared with that based on geographical coordinates alone. In the case
   of a variable search neighborhood for each estimation point,
   optimization of local search strategy parameters for an elliptical
   support domain-the orientation of which is dictated by anisotropic
   axes-via GA was able to capture the dynamics of piezometric head in west
   Texas/New Mexico in an efficient way. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A comprehensive steady-state model for Co-Ni alloy co-deposition in
   sulfate solutions at pH 3 that accounts for mass-transfer and kinetic
   effects is presented. It also incorporates empirical expressions
   describing the variation of the diffusion coefficients with
   concentration. The model is statistically fit to experimental
   polarization curves obtained at different NiSO4/CoSO4 concentration
   ratios and used to determine the kinetic parameters for the proposed
   reaction mechanism. It is subsequently used to predict the alloy
   composition and current efficiency at a different bath composition and
   found to agree very well with the experimental measurements. Various
   mechanisms previously proposed to explain the anomalous behaviour
   observed for the electrodeposition of iron-group alloys are also
   assessed. Analysis of the model reveals that a previously proposed
   reaction pathway involving the formation of a mixed adsorbed
   intermediate NiCo(III)(ads) on the electrode surface during alloy
   co-deposition is not required to explain the anomalous behaviour of the
   system. The model also indicates that the anomalous behavior cannot be
   attributed to the preferential surface coverage of the adsorbed
   intermediate Co(I)(ads) over that of Ni(I)(ads). Instead, it appears
   that the main factor is the much faster charge-transfer of Co(II)
   reduction than that of Ni(II) reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A thin-film phototransistor with a peak wavelength sensitivity of 420 nm
   was fabricated by integrating a bilayer hydrogenated-amorphous-silicon
   absorber with a nanocrystallinesilicon channel layer. The
   phototransistor response at lambda = 420 nm was about 92 mA/W for an
   incident power density of 0.16 mW/cm(2). A readout pixel circuit having
   a single transistor, acting as both the sensing and switching elements,
   is proposed to demonstrate the device potential for high-resolution
   pixelated X-ray imaging arrays. Simulation results reveal less than 150
   mu s to read out the pixel voltage with a storage capacitor of 1 pF.
   Thus, a frame rate of about 75 ms is predicted for a 500 x 500 pixel
   imaging array. Transient photocurrent measurements yield on (rise) and
   off (fall) times of 0.6 and 3 ms, respectively, verifying the
   requirements for a high frame rate.}},

Title = {{Circumnavigation Using Distance Measurements Under Slow Drift}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Consider an agent A at an unknown location, undergoing sufficiently slow
   drift, and a mobile agent B that must move to the vicinity of and then
   circumnavigate A at a prescribed distance from A. In doing so, B can
   only measure its distance from A, and knows its own position in some
   reference frame. This paper considers this problem, which has
   applications to surveillance and orbit maintenance. In many of these
   applications it is difficult for B to directly sense the location of A,
   e.g. when all that B can sense is the intensity of a signal emitted by
   A. This intensity does, however provide a measure of the distance. We
   propose a nonlinear periodic continuous time control law that achieves
   the objective using this distance measurement. Fundamentally, a) B must
   exploit its motion to estimate the location of A, and b) use its best
   instantaneous estimate of where A resides, to move itself to achieve the
   circumnavigation objective. For a) we use an open loop algorithm
   formulated by us in an earlier paper. The key challenge tackled in this
   paper is to design a control law that closes the loop by marrrying the
   two goals. As long as the initial estimate of the source location is not
   coincident with the intial position of B, the algorithm is guaranteed to
   be exponentially convergent when A is stationary. Under the same
   condition, we establish that when A drifts with a sufficiently small,
   unknown velocity, B globally achieves its circumnavigation objective, to
   within a margin proportional to the drift velocity.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a rate-distortion optimization (RDO) scheme based on the
   structural similarity (SSIM) index, which was found to be a better
   indicator of perceived image quality than mean-squared error, but has
   not been fully exploited in the context of image and video coding. At
   the frame level, an adaptive Lagrange multiplier selection method is
   proposed based on a novel reduced-reference statistical SSIM estimation
   algorithm and a rate model that combines the side information with the
   entropy of the transformed residuals. At the macroblock level, the
   Lagrange multiplier is further adjusted based on an information
   theoretical approach that takes into account both the motion information
   content and perceptual uncertainty of visual speed perception. Finally,
   the mode for H.264/AVC coding is selected by the SSIM index and the
   adjusted Lagrange multiplier. Extensive experiments show that the
   proposed scheme can achieve significantly better rate-SSIM performance
   and provide better visual quality than conventional RDO coding schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Since its introduction in 2004, the structural similarity (SSIM) index
   has gained widespread popularity as a tool to assess the quality of
   images and to evaluate the performance of image processing algorithms
   and systems. There has been also a growing interest of using SSIM as an
   objective function in optimization problems in a variety of image
   processing applications. One major issue that could strongly impede the
   progress of such efforts is the lack of understanding of the
   mathematical properties of the SSIM measure. For example, some highly
   desirable properties such as convexity and triangular inequality that
   are possessed by the mean squared error may not hold. In this paper, we
   first construct a series of normalized and generalized (vector-valued)
   metrics based on the important ingredients of SSIM. We then show that
   such modified measures are valid distance metrics and have many useful
   properties, among which the most significant ones include
   quasi-convexity, a region of convexity around the minimizer, and
   distance preservation under orthogonal or unitary transformations. The
   groundwork laid here extends the potentials of SSIM in both theoretical
   development and practical applications. (1)}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple but effective strategy that aims to enhance the

   views (front, top, and side views). A fusion algorithm is then designed
   to merge the resulting multiple denoised videos into one, so that the
   visual quality of the fused video is improved. Extensive tests using a
   variety of base video-denoising algorithms show that the proposed PVF
   method leads to surprisingly significant and consistent gain in terms of
   both peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present controllers that enable mobile robots to
   persistently monitor or sweep a changing environment. The environment is
   modeled as a field that is defined over a finite set of locations. The
   field grows linearly at locations that are not within the range of a
   robot and decreases linearly at locations that are within range of a
   robot. We assume that the robots travel on given closed paths. The speed
   of each robot along its path is controlled to prevent the field from
   growing unbounded at any location. We consider the space of speed
   controllers that are parametrized by a finite set of basis functions.
   For a single robot, we develop a linear program that computes a speed
   controller in this space to keep the field bounded, if such a controller
   exists. Another linear program is derived to compute the speed
   controller that minimizes the maximum field value over the environment.
   We extend our linear program formulation to develop a multirobot
   controller that keeps the field bounded. We characterize, both
   theoretically and in simulation, the robustness of the controllers to
   modeling errors and to stochasticity in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{A new finite element (FE) specific failure criterion utilizing hardening
   rates to quantify bending stress is implemented into the MAT\_124
   material model in the commercial software LS-DYNA to simulate fracture
   of extruded AZ31 and cast AM60 magnesium alloy tubes. The simulations
   are performed by requiring element erosion of hexahedral solid elements
   in a three-dimensional (3D) FE model when the failure criterion is
   satisfied at any point in the simulation. Experimental stress-strain
   curves from tensile and compression tests of the materials are used as
   inputs in the model. The simulations reproduce the measured load
   displacement data as well as general features of the experimental
   failure modes of round and rectangular tubes undergoing axial crush
   tests. The model is applied to investigate the effects of a variety of
   design features, such as varying tube wall thickness, preformed bulges,
   alternate bands of Al and Mg alloys, and cladding Al on magnesium, on
   the macroscopic strain to failure. The results show that adding multiple
   preformed bulges to the tubes can increase the strain to failure and
   reduce the force required to cause deformation. Adding a single bulge
   concentrates the strain causing reduced macroscopic strain to failure.
   Placing sections of reduced wall thickness or brazing in sections of

Abstract = {{A new class of core-corona structured bifunctional catalyst (CCBC)
   consisting of lanthanum nickelate centers supporting nitrogen-doped
   carbon nanotubes (NCNT) has been developed for rechargeable metal-air
   battery application. The nanostructured design of the catalyst allows
   the core and corona to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. These materials displayed
   exemplary OER and ORR activity through half-cell testing, comparable to
   state of the art commercial lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3) and
   carbon-supported platinum (Pt/C), with added bifunctional capabilities
   allowing metal-air battery rechargeability. LaNiO3 and Pt/C are
   currently the most accepted benchmark electrocatalyst materials for the
   OER and ORR, respectively; thus with comparable activity toward both of
   these reactions, CCBC are presented as a novel, inexpensive catalyst
   component for the cathode of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Moreover,
   after full-range degradation testing (FDT) CCBC: retained excellent
   activity, retaining 3 and 13 times greater ORR and OER current upon
   comparison to state of the art Pt/C. Zinc-air battery performances of
   CCBC is in good agreement with the half-cell experiments with this
   bifunctional electrocatalyst displaying high activity and stability
   during battery discharge, charge, and cycling processes. Owing to its
   outstanding performance toward both the OER and ORR, comparable with the
   highest performing commercial catalysts to date for each of the
   respective reaction, coupled with high stability and rechargeability,
   CCBC is presented as a novel class of bifunctional catalyst material
   that is very applicable to future generation rechargeable metal-air
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a nonlinearly parameterized controller for the
   adaptive control of base-isolated buildings subjected to a set of
   near-fault earthquakes. The control scheme is based on discrete direct
   adaptive control, wherein the system response is minimized under
   parameter uncertainties. Stable tuning laws for the controller
   parameters are derived using the Lyapunov approach. The controller
   utilizes a linear combination of nonlinear basis functions, and
   estimates the desired control force online. The measurements that are
   necessary to generate the control force to reduce the system responses
   under earthquake excitations are developed based on the adaptive systems
   theory. The main novelty in this paper is to approximate the nonlinear
   control law using a nonlinearly parameterized neural network, without an
   explicit training phase. A perturbed model is used to initialize the
   controller parameters in order to simulate the uncertainty in the
   mathematical modeling that typically exists in representing civil
   structures. Performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated on a
   full-scale nonlinear three-dimensional (3-D) base-isolated benchmark
   structure. The lateral-torsion superstructure behavior and the bi-axial
   interaction of the nonlinear bearings are incorporated. The results show
   that the proposed controller scheme can achieve good response reductions
   for a wide range of near-fault earthquakes, without a corresponding
   increase in the superstructure response. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the delay-throughput analysis of a single-hop
   wireless network with n transmitter/receiver pairs. All channels are
   assumed to be block Rayleigh fading with shadowing, described by
   parameters (alpha, (omega) over bar), where alpha denotes the
   probability of shadowing and (omega) over bar represents the average
   cross-link gains. The analysis relies on the distributed on-off power
   allocation strategy (i.e., links with a direct channel gain above a
   certain threshold transmit at full power and the rest remain silent) for
   the deterministic and stochastic packet arrival processes. It is also
   assumed that each transmitter has a buffer size of one packet and
   dropping occurs once a packet arrives in the buffer while the previous
   packet has not been served. In the first part of the paper, we define a
   new notion of performance in the network, called effective throughput,
   which captures the effect of arrival process in the network throughput,
   and maximize it for different cases of packet arrival process. It is
   proved that the effective throughput of the network asymptotically
   scales as (log n)/(alpha) over cap, with (alpha) over cap, (alpha) over
   cap Delta = alpha(omega) over bar regardless of the packet arrival
   process. In the second part of the paper, we present the delay
   characteristics of the underlying network in terms of the packet
   dropping probability. We derive the sufficient conditions in the
   asymptotic case of n --> infinity such that the packet dropping
   probability tend to zero, while achieving the maximum effective
   throughput of the network. Finally, we study the trade-off between the
   effective throughput, delay, and packet dropping probability of the
   network for different packet arrival processes. In particular, we
   determine how much degradation will be enforced in the throughput by
   introducing the aforementioned constraints.}},

Abstract = {{An analog adaptive body bias (A-ABB) circuit is proposed in this paper.
   The A-ABB is used to compensate for die-to-die (D2D) and within-die

   regarding the speed, the dynamic power, and the leakage power. The A-ABB
   consists of threshold voltage estimation circuits and analog control of
   the body bias performed by on-chip amplifier circuits. Circuit level
   simulation results of a circuit block case study, extracted from a real
   microprocessor critical path, referring to an industrial
   hardware-calibrated 65-nm CMOS technology transistor model, are
   demonstrated. This study shows that the proposed A-ABB reduces the
   standard deviations of the frequency, the dynamic power and the leakage
   power by factors of 6.6x, 8.8x, and 3.3x, respectively, when both D2D
   and WID variations are considered. In addition, in this presented case
   study, initial total yields of 16.8\% and 5.2\% are improved to 99.9\%

   lower area overhead allowing it to be used at lower granularity level

Abstract = {{In this paper, the finite strain plastic deformation of AM30 magnesium
   alloy has been simulated using the crystal plasticity finite element
   method. The simulations have been carried out using a rate-dependent
   elastic-viscoplastic crystal plasticity constitutive model implemented
   in a user defined material subroutine (UMAT) in the commercial software
   LS-DYNA. The plastic deformation mechanisms accounted for in the model
   are the slip systems in the matrix (parent grain), extension twinning
   systems and the slip systems inside the extension twinned regions. The
   parameters of the constitutive model have been calibrated using the
   experimental data. The calibrated model has then been used to predict
   the deformation of AM30 magnesium alloy in bending and simple shear. For
   the bending strain path, the effects of texture on the strain
   accommodated by the deformation mechanisms and bending moment have been
   investigated. For simple shear, the effects of texture on the relative
   activity of deformation mechanisms, shear stress and texture evolution
   have been investigated. Also, the effect of twinning on shear stress and
   texture evolution has been studied. The numerical analyses predicted a
   more uniform strain distribution during bending and simple shear for

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanical properties of soft materials such as
   stress-strain behavior over a large deformation domain is essential for
   both mechanical and biological applications. Conventional measurement
   methods have limited access to these properties because of the
   difficulties in accurately measuring large deformations of soft
   materials. In this study, we optimized digital image correlation (DIC)
   method to measure the large-strain deformations by considering
   referencing scheme and frame rate. The optimized DIC was utilized to
   estimate strain in characterizing the stress-strain behavior of a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer as a model soft material. A series
   of comparative experimental studies and finite element analysis were
   performed; they indicated the advantages of optimized DIC over
   conventional methods such as robustness to slip, insensitivity to
   boundary conditions, and the ability to yield consistent and reliable
   results. These advantages enabled the optimized DIC to perform an
   in-depth analysis of the behavior of soft materials at large strain
   domain. An empirical constitutive equation to describe the large
   stress-strain behavior of PDMS was proposed and verified by finite
   element simulations that show excellent agreements with experimental

Abstract = {{The exciting thermomechanical behavior of NiTi shape memory alloys
   (SMAs) has sparked significant research effort seeking to exploit their
   exotic properties. The performance capabilities of conventional NiTi
   offerings are limited, however, by current fabrication technologies. In
   this study, a high power density laser source was implemented to locally
   alloy Cu into a conventional NiTi material. The effects of laser
   processing created a localized NiTiCu ternary material domain which
   possessed a set of unique thermomechanical properties. The combined
   active responses of the laser processed hybrid NiTi-NiTiCu SMA represent
   an enhanced material functionality, which permits a multi-stage
   thermomechanical recovery and allows for unprecedented novel
   applications to be realized.}},

Title = {{Blind identification of earthquake-excited structures}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A new method based on the popular second-order blind identification
   method, SOBI, is presented to estimate the modal properties of
   structures under non-stationary earthquake excitations. Since the
   proposed method is cast within the framework of blind source separation,
   the issues associated with model-order pre-selection and the use of
   stability charts in traditional system identification methods are not
   present. The SOBI method involves the joint diagonalization of multiple
   covariance matrices of measurements, which is rendered difficult in the
   presence of non-stationary excitations. This difficulty is overcome in
   the proposed method by a diagonalization procedure involving a new set
   of weighted covariance matrices. There are two main contributions in
   this paper. First, a diagonalization technique that involves the
   joint-approximate diagonalization of the proposed set of several
   time-lagged and suitably weighted covariance matrices is developed.
   Next, a parametric relationship between the key parameters of the
   proposed method and a suitably chosen non-stationary parameter of the
   response is developed to aid in the selection of the optimal parameters
   under non-stationary excitations. In order to demonstrate the results
   obtained using the proposed method, identification results from the UCLA
   Factor building using recorded responses from the Parkfield earthquake
   are utilized.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive micromodel to predict the electrochemical performance of
   porous composite LSM-YSZ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is
   developed. The random packing sphere model is used to estimate the
   cathode microstructural properties required for the micromodel. The
   micromodel developed takes into account the complex interdependency
   among the mass transport, electron and ion transports, and the
   electrochemical reaction, and can be used for optimization of the
   microstructure of porous LSM-YSZ composite cathodes. It is shown that
   the electrochemical performance of these cathodes depends on the
   microstructural variables of the cathode porosity, thickness, particle
   size ratio, and size and volume fraction of LSM particles. The effect of
   these microstructural variables on the cathode total resistance, as the
   objective function to achieve the optimum microstructure for the
   cathode, is studied through computer simulation. The results indicated
   that for a LSM-YSZ cathode operated at the average temperature of
   1073.15 K, bulk oxygen partial pressure of 0.21 atm, and total current
   density of 5000 Am-2, and constrained to the minimum value of 1 mu m for
   the size of LSM particles and 0.25 for the cathode porosity, the optimum
   microstructure is obtained at the particle size ratio of unity, LSM
   particle size of 1 mu m and volume fraction of 0.413, porosity of 0.25,
   and thickness of 60 mu m. The cathode total resistance corresponding to
   the cathode optimized is estimated to be 0.291 O cm2. (C) 2011 American

Abstract = {{This paper describes an integrated microchip system as an efficient and
   cost-effective solution involving Nanotechnology and Lab-on-a-Chip
   technology for the rapid detection of bacteria. The system is based on
   using surface-modified gold nanoparticles for efficient cell lysis
   followed by microchip PCR without having to remove the nanoparticles
   from the PCR solution. Poly(quaternary ammonium) modified gold
   nanoparticles are used to provide a novel and efficient cell lysis
   method without the need to go through time-consuming, expensive and
   complicated microfabrication processes as most of current cell lysis
   methods for Lab-on-a-Chip applications do. It also facilitates the
   integration of cell lysis and PCR by sharing the same reaction chamber
   as PCR uses. It is integrated with a prototype microchip PCR system
   consisting of a physical microchip PCR device and an automated
   temperature control mechanism. The research work explores solutions for
   the problem of PCR inhibition caused by gold nanoparticles as well as
   for the problem of non-specific PCR amplification in the integrated
   microchip system. It also explores the possibility of greatly reducing
   PCR cycling time to achieve the same result compared to the protocol for
   a regular PCR machine. The simplicity of the setup makes it easy to be
   integrated with other Lab-on-a-Chip functional modules to create
   customized solutions for target applications.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability and the performance of the M5P model tree machine
   learning technique is investigated in modeling of the stage-discharge
   problem for Peachtree Creek in Atlanta, Georgia. The stage-discharge
   relationship has an important bearing on the correct assessment of
   discharge. This technique is compared to three different algorithms of
   artificial neural network and conventional rating curve. It is shown
   that the model trees, being analogous to piecewise linear functions,
   have certain advantages over neural networks; they are more transparent
   and hence acceptable by decision makers, they are very fast in training,
   and they always converge. The accuracy of M5P trees is superior to
   neural network models and conventional model. It was found that M5P
   outperformed when fewer data events were available for model
   development. In other words, M5P has potential to be a useful and
   practical tool for cases where less measured data is available for
   modeling stage-discharge problem. This study has also showed high
   consistency between the training and testing phases of modeling when
   using M5P compared to neural network models and conventional method.
   Furthermore, a partition analysis has been performed. This analysis
   reveals that the results obtained using M5P model performed better than
   ANN for both the high flows and the low flows. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling and motion controller design for a
   linear motor driven T-type gantry and worktable. The worktable motion,
   which is referred to as the x-axis, is considered independently of the
   gantry and is controlled using a loop shaping filter. The gantry (or
   y-axis) is actuated by dual direct drive linear motors and is coupled to
   the worktable position, which determines its inertial characteristics. A
   94 Hz yaw mode is handled in the gantry control law using sensor and
   actuator averaging, and active vibration damping. The stability and
   robustness of the design is considered using multivariable frequency
   domain techniques. In the x-axis, a bandwidth of 130 Hz is achieved. The
   y-axis crossover frequency is 52 Hz, which is twice that of the
   crossover frequency that can be achieved using independent PID
   controllers (26 Hz).The performance of the proposed control scheme has
   been verified in step disturbance (i.e., rope snap) tests, as well as
   tracking and contouring experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction of cellulose to bio-oil under acidic, neutral
   and alkaline conditions}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{234-239}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass to bio-oil under alkaline or
   neutral conditions has been widely reported in literature. However,
   there has been limited data available in literature on comparing HTL of
   biomass to bio-oil under acidic, neutral, and alkaline in terms of
   chemical compositions and yields by using the same reaction conditions
   and reactor. Using cellulose as a feedstock we conducted the comparative
   studies for pH = 3,7 and 14 at temperatures of 275-320 degrees C with
   reaction residence times of 0-30 min. Results showed that the chemical
   compositions of the bio-oils were different for acidic, neutral and
   alkaline conditions. Under acidic and neutral conditions. the main
   composition of HTL bio-oil was 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF). Under
   alkaline conditions, the main compounds became C2-5 carboxylic acids.
   For bio-oil yields, it was observed that high temperatures and long
   residence times had negative effects, regardless of the pH levels.
   However, the corresponding reaction mechanisms are different. Under
   acidic conditions, the decrease in the bio-oil yields was mainly caused
   by polymerization of 5-HMF to solids. Under neutral conditions, the
   bio-oil yields decreased because 5-HMF was converted to both solid and
   gaseous products. Under alkaline conditions, the bio-oil decomposed to
   gases through the formation of short chain acids and aldehydes.
   Therefore, although they were all referred to as HTL bio-oil in
   literature, they were formed by different reaction pathways and had
   different properties due to their different chemical compositions. Given
   these differences, different strategies are recommended in this study to
   further improve HTL of biomass to bio-oil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Experimental measurements from a converted indirect injection diesel
   Kubota D905 engine fueled with a simulated biomass derived gas are
   compared with simulation results using a multizone homogeneous charge
   compression ignition (HCCI) engine model. Two different fuel blends were
   tested and each consisted of varying amounts of CH4, CO2, N-2, H-2, and
   CO to mimic the gaseous constituents of producer gas. The multizone
   model was originally developed as a 32 bit serial application for use
   with primary reference fuels (PRFs). However, for the purpose of this
   study, the model has been parallelized using Message Passing Interface
   (MPI) for Fortran and is executed in a 64 bit environment to further
   reduce computational time. Once calibration was complete, the numerical
   model showed good pressure trace matching with the experimental data
   across both fuel mixture compositions and various equivalence ratios.
   Correspondingly, heat release rate (HRR) curves showed good matching as
   well. Calibration settings from one engine operating point for a given
   fuel mixture were readily transferable to other operating points and the
   second fuel mixture. However, there were some discrepancies in
   predicting pressure traces when operating the model near the misfire
   limit of the engine due to cyclic variability, which exceeds the
   limitations of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with
   externally post-tensioned carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons
   was examined in an experimental and analytical study. Five
   unstrengthened and 13 strengthened reinforced concrete beams were tested
   under various fatigue load ranges until failure. The strengthened beams
   were post-tensioned with two external CFRP tendons on a double-harped
   profile. The results demonstrated that external post-tensioning
   significantly decreased the stresses in the internal reinforcement at
   all stages of loading, and hence extended the fatigue life of the
   strengthened beams. All beams failed due to the fatigue fracture of the
   internal steel reinforcing bars. The CFRP tendons demonstrated excellent
   fatigue performance, with no indication of distress at the deviated
   points or at the anchors. A fatigue model based on a strain-life
   approach was proposed to predict the fatigue life of the strengthened
   beams. The model allows the effect of strengthening on the fatigue life
   of the beams to be explicitly evaluated during the strengthening design

Abstract = {{Response variability is often positively correlated in pairs of
   similarly tuned neurons in the visual cortex. Many authors have
   considered correlated variability to prevent postsynaptic neurons from
   averaging across large groups of inputs to obtain reliable stimulus
   estimates. However, a simple average of variability ignores
   nonlinearities in cortical signal integration. This study shows that
   feedforward divisive normalization of a neuron's inputs effectively
   decorrelates their variability. Furthermore, we show that optimal linear
   estimates of a stimulus parameter that are based on normalized inputs
   are more accurate than those based on nonnormalized inputs, due partly
   to reduced correlations, and that these estimates improve with
   increasing population size up to several thousand neurons. This suggests
   that neurons may possess a simple mechanism for substantially
   decorrelating noise in their inputs. Further work is needed to reconcile
   this conclusion with past evidence that correlated noise impairs visual
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{As sensors are energy constrained devices, one challenge in wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) is to guarantee coverage and meanwhile maximize
   network lifetime. In this paper, we leverage prediction to solve this
   challenging problem, by exploiting temporal-spatial correlations among
   sensory data. The basic idea lies in that a sensor node can be turned
   off safely when its sensory information can be inferred through some
   prediction methods, like Bayesian inference. We adopt the concept of
   entropy in information theory to evaluate the information uncertainty
   about the region of interest (RoI). We formulate the problem as a
   minimum weight submodular set cover problem, which is known to be NP
   hard. To address this problem, an efficient centralized truncated greedy
   algorithm (TGA) is proposed. We prove the performance guarantee of TGA
   in terms of the ratio of aggregate weight obtained by TGA to that by the
   optimal algorithm. Considering the decentralization nature of WSNs, we
   further present a distributed version of TGA, denoted as DTGA, which can
   obtain the same solution as TGA. The implementation issues such as
   network connectivity and communication cost are extensively discussed.
   We perform real data experiments as well as simulations to demonstrate
   the advantage of DTGA over the only existing competing algorithm {[}1]
   and the impacts of different parameters associated with data
   correlations on the network lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{The excellent biocompatibility and corrosion properties of Pt alloys and
   316 low-carbon vacuum melted (LVM) stainless steel (SS) make them
   attractive for biomedical applications. With the increasing complexity
   of medical devices and in order to lower costs, the challenge of joining
   dissimilar materials arises. In this study, laser microwelding (LMW) of
   crossed Pt-10 pct Ir to 316 LVM SS wires was performed and the
   weldability of these materials was determined. The joint geometry,
   joining mechanism, joint breaking force (JBF), and fracture modes were
   investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and microtensile
   testing. It was shown that the mechanisms of joint formation
   transitioned from (1) brazing, (2) a combination of brazing and fusion
   welding, and (3) fusion welding with increasing pulsed laser energy. The
   joints demonstrated various tensile failure modes including (1)
   interfacial failure below a peak power of 0.24 kW, (2) partial
   interfacial failure that propagated into the Pt-Ir wire, (3) failure in
   the Pt-Ir wire, and (4) failure in the SS wire due to porosity and
   severe undercutting caused by overwelding. During this study, the
   optimal laser peak power range was identified to produce joints with
   good joint geometry and 90 pct of the tensile strength of the Pt-10 pct
   Ir wire.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing complexity of medical devices and with efforts to
   reduce manufacturing costs, challenges arise in joining dissimilar
   materials. In this study, the laser weldability of dissimilar joints
   between Pt-10 pct Ir and 316 low-carbon vacuum melted (LVM) stainless
   steel (SS) crossed wires was investigated by characterizing the weld
   geometry, joint strength, morphology of weld cross sections, and
   differences in joining behavior, depending on which material is subject
   to the incident laser beam. With the Pt-Ir alloy on top, a significant
   amount of porosity was observed on the surface of the welds as well as
   throughout the weld cross sections. This unique form of porosity is
   believed to be a result of preferential vaporization of 316 LVM SS
   alloying elements that become mixed with the molten Pt-10 pct Ir during
   welding. The joining mechanism documented in micrographs of
   cross-sectioned welds was found to transition from laser brazing to
   fusion welding. It is inferred that the orientation of the two
   dissimilar metals (i.e., which material is subject to the incident laser
   beam) plays an important role in weld quality of crossed-wire laser
   welds.}},

Abstract = {{A set of strain-controlled biaxial proportional and non-proportional
   tests were conducted on solid and tubular specimens of 30CrNiMo8HH
   steel. The effect of the phase angle on fatigue life was studied. This
   effect becomes noticeable when applying a 90 degrees out-of-phase
   loading, reducing the fatigue life by a factor up to 5. It has been
   shown that the material has no additional hardening due to out-of-phase
   loading. To account for this severe path dependency, a material
   dependent non-proportionality modification factor is proposed. This path
   dependent sensitivity factor is applied to six different fatigue
   parameters including maximum equivalent total strain, maximum equivalent
   stress, Smith-Watson-Topper, Fatemi-Socie, plastic strain energy density
   and total strain energy density to correlate the fatigue results. The
   predicted fatigue lives are compared with the experiments. The cyclic
   plasticity models of Mroz and Chaboche were successfully employed to
   model the cyclic behavior of 30CrNiM08HH steel. It has been shown that
   estimations based on the proposed non-proportionality modification
   factor agree well with the experimental results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Accuracy in the effective diffusion coefficient of the gas diffusion
   layer (GDL)/microporous layer (MPL) is important to accurately predict
   the mass transport limitations for high current density operation of
   polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. All the previous studies
   regarding mass transport limitations were limited to pure GDLs, and
   experimental analysis of the impact of the MPL on the overall diffusion
   in the porous GDL is still lacking. A modified Loschmidt cell with an
   oxygen-nitrogen mixture is used in this work to determine the effect of
   MPL on the effective diffusion coefficients. It is found that Knudsen
   effects play a dominant role in the diffusion through the MPL where pore
   diameters are less than 1 mu m. Experimental results show that the
   effective diffusion coefficient of the MPL is only about 21\% that of
   its GDL substrate and Knudsen diffusion accounts for 80\% of the
   effective diffusion coefficient of the GDL with MPL measured in this
   study. No existing correlations can correlate the effective diffusion
   coefficient with significant Knudsen contribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Linear sweep voltammetry and cathodic polarization experiments were
   conducted to investigate the effects of electrolyte composition and
   current/overpotential on Co-Ni alloy co-deposition in sulphate solutions
   and its anomalous behavior whereby Co is preferentially deposited over
   Ni. Ni deposition was shown to be inhibited in the presence of CoSO4 in
   solution, whereas the rate of Co deposition was not accelerated and, in
   fact, completely unaffected by the presence of NiSO4. The extent of
   anomalous behavior was found to be affected strongly by the CoSO4
   concentration, but was less pronounced when Co(II) reduction became mass
   transfer-controlled or the NiSO4 concentration exceeded the CoSO4
   concentration by at least one order of magnitude. Analysis of the linear
   scans and measurement of the deposition current efficiencies indicated
   that the onset of reactions occurred in the following order with
   increasing cathodic overpotential: H+ reduction, Ni(II) reduction,
   Co(II) reduction and H2O reduction. Boric acid was found to have little
   effect on alloy composition whenever deposition occurred to any
   significant extent. On the other hand, the presence of boric acid was
   required to attain acceptably high current efficiencies over a wide
   range of current densities. Moreover, effective Co-Ni deposition was not
   possible in the absence of boric acid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Temperature gradient focusing (TGF) is a counterflow gradient focusing
   technique, which utilizes a temperature gradient across a microchannel
   or capillary to separate analytes. With an appropriate buffer, the
   temperature gradient creates a gradient in both the electric field and
   electrophoretic velocity. Combined with a bulk counter flow, ionic
   species concentrate at a unique point where the total velocity sums to
   zero and separate from each other. Scanning TGF uses varying bulk flow
   so that a large number of analytes that have large differences in
   electrophoretic mobility can be sequentially focused and passed by a
   single detection point. Up to now, scanning TGF examples have been
   performed using a linear temperature gradient which has limitations in
   improving peak capacity and resolution at the same time. In this work,
   we develop a bilinear temperature gradient along the separation channel
   that improves both peak capacity and separation resolution
   simultaneously. The temperature profile along the channel consists of a
   very sharp gradient used to preconcentrate the sample followed by a
   shallow gradient that increases separation resolution. A specialized
   design is developed for the heaters to achieve the bilinear profile
   using both analytical and numerical modeling. The heaters are integrated
   onto a hybrid PDMS/glass chip fabricated using conventional sputtering
   and soft-lithography techniques. Separation performance is characterized
   by separating several different dyes and amino acids that have close
   electrophoretic mobilities. Experiments show a dramatic improvement in
   peak capacity and resolution in comparison to the standard linear
   temperature gradient.}},

   confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and the QAPEK-OH
   membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR). The thermal properties of the membranes were determined by
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). The ion-exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, mechanical
   properties and anion conductivity of the QAPEK-OH membranes were
   measured to evaluate their applicability in alkaline fuel cells at
   elevated temperature. The anionic conductivity of the QAPEK-OH membrane
   varied from 8 x 10(-4) to 1.1 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) over the temperature
   range 20-100 degrees C. The QAPEK-OH membrane showed excellent alkaline
   stability in 1 M KOH solution at 100 degrees C. The excellent
   temperature durability of QAPEK-OHs makes them promising membrane
   materials for alkaline fuel cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of carbon chain length and temperature were investigated on
   adsorption kinetics and surface tension of a group of slightly volatile,
   short carbon chain molecules: 1-octanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-butanol.
   Experiments were performed in a closed chamber where simultaneous
   adsorption from both sides of the vapor/liquid interface was considered.
   The dynamic (time dependent) and steady-state surface tensions were
   found to decrease with temperature ranging from 10 degrees C to 35
   degrees C. It was shown that, at the final steady-state, the effect of
   adsorption from the vapor phase was much more important than that from
   the liquid phase especially for short carbon chain molecules (e.g.,
   1-butanol). The modified Langmuir equation of state and modified kinetic
   transfer equation, which account for adsorption from both sides of a
   vapor/liquid interface, were used to model the experimental data of the
   steady-state and dynamic surface tension, respectively. Modeling results
   showed that the equilibrium constants and adsorption rate constants were
   increased with temperature and carbon chain length. The maximum surface
   concentration showed a decrease with temperature and an increase with
   carbon chain length. Some variations in the fitting parameters were
   observed in the dynamic modeling. These variations may be due to the
   experimental errors or the limitations of the proposed model. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Viking navigation from Norway to America in the northern latitudes
   remains a mystery for physicists, historians and archaeologists.
   Polarimetric methods using absorbing dichroic crystals as polarizers to
   detect a hidden Sun direction using the polarized skylight have led to
   controversies. Indeed, these techniques may lack in sensitivity,
   especially when the degree of polarization is low. Here, we demonstrate
   theoretically and experimentally that using the transparent common
   Iceland spar as a depolarizer, the Vikings could have performed a
   precise navigation under different conditions. Indeed, when simply
   rotated, such a birefringent crystal can completely depolarize, at the
   so-called isotropy point, any partially polarized state of light,
   allowing us to guess the direction of the Sun. By equalizing the
   intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary beams at the isotropy
   point, we show that the Sun direction can be determined easily, thanks
   to a simple sensitive differential two-image observation. A precision of
   a few degrees could be reached even under dark crepuscular conditions.
   The exciting recent discovery of such an Iceland spar in the Alderney
   Elizabethan ship that sank two centuries before the introduction of the
   polarization of light in optics may support the use of the calcite
   crystal for navigation purposes.}},

Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{An optimal control method was combined with commercial CFD software for
   the optimization of heat flux during a baking process. The objective
   function was defined in terms of the transient heat flux, the
   temperature and the humidity of the baking product. The optimal control
   was achieved by the conjugate gradient method. The minimum energy
   consumption for a desired final baking product temperature and humidity
   was estimated. This study confirmed the relationship between the heat
   flux and baking product quality attributes and showed that optimal
   control models represent reliable tools to support decision making for
   complex processes such as baking. The proposed optimal control approach
   is general and could be easily extended to other processes. Crown

Journal = {{PCI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the effect of the transverse reinforcement-its
   amount, spacing, and direction-on torsional strength in an effort to
   simplify the governing codes and provide general information on the
   behavior of spun-cast prestressed concrete poles under pure torsion. The
   rationale behind the typical code values for spacing and direction of
   the transverse reinforcement is not apparent. A total of 14 specimens
   were produced as part of a testing program. The testing program
   consisted of two groups of seven specimens with two different tip
   diameters: 6.5 in. (165 mm) and 8.3 in. (210 mm). Within each group the
   spacing and direction of the wound helical transverse reinforcement was
   varied. Each specimen was clamped at the butt end, and a
   counterclockwise torque load was applied at 2 ft (0.6 m) from the tip
   end. Applied torque and rotation of the tip were recorded using an
   inline load cell and electronic clinometers. The test concluded when the
   rotation reached approximately 13 degrees to 15 degrees or failure
   occurred. Experimental cracking torque values were compared with
   code-calculated theoretical values using current codes. Precracking and
   postcracking torque-twist responses were analyzed with elastic torsion
   and torsional compression field theory models. It was concluded that the
   primary function of the transverse reinforcement is to minimize the
   longitudinal precracking due to prestressing transfer forces. The
   prestressed concrete pole failure mode in torsion is brittle and sudden,
   and the transverse reinforcement provides no postcracking ductility.}},

   high bandwidth direct voltage control loop in both grid-connected and

Abstract = {{Pervious concrete pavement (PCP) has the potential to provide
   significant technical, economical, and environmental benefits. To better
   understand the beneficial impacts of PCP, its performance must be
   comprehensively evaluated and quantified. To evaluate the PCP
   performance, its pavement condition should be assessed. The primary aim
   of this research is to evaluate the PCP condition through incorporation
   of an adequate panel rating method. Two panel rating methods are
   evaluated for this purpose: visual digital inspection and in situ
   inspection. Field investigations are also conducted to record the
   surface distresses by describing their severity and density using the
   Ministry of Transportation of Ontario protocol. Finally, a model is
   developed and validated which relates mean panel rating (i.e., surface
   distress rating) to a pavement distress. It is concluded that the only
   significant variable (i.e., distress) in this model is raveling. DOI:

Journal = {{EPL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the human eye is able to detect the optical activity
   of chiral molecules and the Faraday effect, even under white-light
   viewing conditions, without the help of any polarizer. Indeed, we show
   that our eye acts as a differential analyzer and isolates the response
   in the blue part of the visible spectrum, thus avoiding the difficulties
   related to the inherent chromatic dispersion encountered in usual
   experiments performed under white-light conditions. Moreover the human
   eye enables to clearly distinguish between the fundamental reciprocal
   and non-reciprocal characteristics of the optical activity and the
   Faraday effect, respectively. Furthermore the human eye, without any
   specific optical dichroic axis in the retina, enables us to read, with
   the naked eye, hidden information encoded via different states of
   polarization, and suggests the possibility of direct detection of
   quantum entanglement effects. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2012}},

Abstract = {{Electrospinning is an easy and inexpensive process that produces
   continuous nanofibers through an electrically charged jet of polymer
   solution consisting of sufficiently long chain molecules. As reported in
   the literature, the entire electrospinning process is governed by the
   external electric field caused by the applied voltage between the
   electrodes and the induced electric field caused by free and induced
   charges on the fluid surface. Therefore, the electric field is the most
   critical parameter in electrospinning. In this work, a comprehensive
   analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of external and
   induced electric fields on the electrospinning process, which include
   the Taylor cone formation, the straight jet portion, and the unstable or
   whipping jet region. It was observed that all regions are highly
   influenced by the applied and induced electric fields, which results in
   a considerable variation in the morphology of the nanofibers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, downscaling models are developed using a Linear Multiple
   Regression (LMR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for obtaining
   projections of mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and
   Tmin) to lake-basin scale in an arid region in India. The effectiveness
   of these techniques is demonstrated through application to downscale the
   predictands for the Pichola lake region in Rajasthan State in India,
   which is considered to be a climatically sensitive region. The predictor
   variables are extracted from: (i) the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis dataset for the period 1948-2000; and (ii)
   the simulations from the third-generation Canadian Coupled Global
   Climate Model (CGCM3) for emission scenarios A1B, A2, B1, and COMMIT for
   the period 2001-2100. The scatter-plots and cross-correlations are used
   for verifying the reliability of the simulation of the predictor
   variables by the CGCM3 and to study the predictorpredictand
   relationships. The performance of the linear multiple regression and ANN
   models was evaluated based on several statistical performance
   indicators. The ANN-based models are found to be superior to LMR-based
   models and subsequently, the ANN-based model is applied to obtain future
   climate projections of the predictands. An increasing trend is observed
   for Tmax and Tmin for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios, whereas no trend is
   discerned with the COMMIT scenario by using predictors. Copyright (C)

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the thermal properties of the microporous layer (MPL) is
   critical for accurate thermal analysis and improving the performance of
   proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells operating at high current
   densities. In this study, the effective through-plane thermal
   conductivity and contact resistance of the MPL have been investigated.
   Gas diffusion layer (GDL) samples, coated with 5\%-wt. PTFE, with and
   without an MPL are measured using the guarded steady-state heat flow
   technique described in the ASTM standard E 1225-04. Thermal contact
   resistance of the MPL with the iron clamping surface was found to be
   negligible, owing to the high surface contact area. Effective thermal
   conductivity and thickness of the MPL remained constant for compression
   pressures up to 15 bar at 0.30 W/m degrees K and 55 mu m, respectively.
   The effective thermal conductivity of the GDL substrate containing
   5\%-wt. PTFE varied from 0.30 to 0.56 W/m degrees K as compression was
   increased from 4 to 15 bar. As a result, GDL containing MPL had a lower
   effective thermal conductivity at high compression than the GDL without
   MPL. At low compression, differences were negligible. The constant
   thickness of the MPL suggests that the porosity, as well as heat and
   mass transport properties, remain independent of the inhomogeneous
   compression by the bipolar plate. Despite the low effective thermal
   conductivity of the MPL, thermal performance of the,GDL can be improved
   by exploiting the excellent surface contact resistance of the MPL.

Abstract = {{Efficient and effective construction progress tracking is critical to
   construction management. Current manual tracking methods are time
   consuming and/or error prone. Three dimensional (3D) laser scanners are
   being investigated in the construction industry and have shown potential

   are still too complicated for processing scanned data. Methods have
   however been developed for the automated recognition of project 3D CAD
   model objects in site laser scans. A novel system is thus described
   herein that combines 3D object recognition technology with schedule
   information into a combined 4D object oriented progress tracking system.
   This system is tested on a comprehensive field database acquired during
   the construction of the Engineering V Building at the University of
   Waterloo. It demonstrates a degree of accuracy for automated progress

   microresonators and provide data for motional resistance computations.
   These results that are confirmed by electrical measurements show
   significantly low values of motional resistance of the
   electrodynamically driven microresonators. Compared to electrostatic
   transduction, the computed motional resistance associated with
   Lorentz-force transduction is multiple orders of magnitude lower.
   Furthermore, Lorentz-force driving of clamped-clamped micromechanical
   resonators to higher modes up to ninth mode is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Process variations significantly impact leakage power, a pivotal
   parameter in designing a power grid. Because of the strong relationship
   between temperature and leakage power, the variations also impose
   statistical behavior on the operating temperature. In addition, the
   metal resistivity of a power grid increases with temperature. Therefore,
   ignoring the interdependency between leakage and temperature can
   introduce large errors in the power grid design. In this paper, a power
   grid analysis is proposed considering a statistical thermal profile
   across the grid. In addition, an efficient verification method is
   provided that ensures the robustness of the power grid in the presence
   of variations. A reliable estimation of the statistical thermal profile
   at the architecture level makes it possible to address any voltage
   violation early in the design process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   cases of perfect CSI and no CSI at the transmitter side. We solve the
   outage probability minimization problem subject to a peak power
   constraint as well as a short-or long-term average sum power constraint.
   As a result, optimal power control strategies are presented for
   different scenarios under consideration. A sub-optimal yet
   low-complexity solution is further proposed under the short-term power
   constraint. Our results demonstrate that multi-hop relaying yields
   significant performance improvements which are particularly important

Abstract = {{In electroporation, applied electric field creates hydrophilic nanopores
   in a cell membrane that can serve as a pathway for inserting biological
   samples to the cell. It is highly desirable to understand the ionic
   transfer and fluid flow through the nanopores in order to control and
   improve the cell transfection. Because of submicron dimensions,
   conventional theories of electrokinetics may lose their applicability in
   such nanopores. In the current study, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
   equations along with modified Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity
   equation are solved in order to find electric potential, fluid flow, and
   ionic concentration through the nanopores. The results show that the
   electric potential, velocity field, and ionic concentration vary with
   the size of the nanopores and are different through the nanopores
   located at the front and backside of the cell membrane. However, on a
   given side of the cell membrane, angular position of nanopores has fewer
   influences on liquid flow and ionic transfer. By increasing the radius
   of the nanopores, the averaged velocity and ionic concentration through
   the nanopores are increased. It is also shown that, in the presence of
   electric pulse, electrokinetic effects (electroosmosis and
   electrophoresis) have significant influences on ionic mass transfer
   through the nanopores, while the effect of diffusion on ionic mass flux
   is negligible in comparison with electrokinetics. Increasing the radius
   of the nanopores intensifies the effect of convection (electroosmosis)
   in comparison with electrophoresis on ionic flux. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate microstructures, tensile and
   fatigue properties of weld-bonded (WB) magnesium-to-magnesium (Mg/Mg)
   similar joints and magnesium-to-steel (Mg/steel) dissimilar joints, in
   comparison with resistance spot welded (RSW) Mg/steel dissimilar joints.
   In the WB Mg/Mg joints, equiaxed dendritic and divorced eutectic
   structures formed in the fusion zone (FZ). In the dissimilar joints of
   RSW and WB Mg/steel, FZ appeared only at Mg side with equiaxed and
   columnar dendrites. At steel side no microstructure changed in the WB
   Mg/steel joints, while the microstructure in the RSW Mg/steel joints
   consisted of lath martensite, bainite, pearlite and retained austenite
   leading to an increased micro-hardness. The relatively low cooling rate
   suppressed the formation of shrinkage porosity but promoted the
   formation of MgZn2 and Mg7Zn3 in the WB Mg/steel joints. The added
   adhesive layer diminished stress concentration around the weld nugget.
   Both WB Mg/Mg and Mg/steel joints were significantly stronger than RSW
   Mg/steel joints in terms of the maximum tensile shear load and energy
   absorption, which also increased with increasing strain rate. Fatigue
   strength was three-fold higher for WB Mg/Mg and Mg/steel joints than for
   RSW Mg/steel joints. Fatigue failure in the RSW Mg/steel joints occurred
   from the heat-affected zone near the notch root at lower load levels,
   and in the mode of interfacial fracture at higher load levels, while it
   occurred in the Mg base metal at a maximum cyclic load up to similar to
   10 kN in both WB Mg/Mg and Mg/steel joints. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Urban gravel-bed stream channels in southern Ontario, Canada identified
   to be in a state of quasi-equilibrium have been studied over the past 15
   years and compared against rural gravel bed stream channels of the same
   hydrophysiographic region. Bankfull width and depth versus bankfull
   discharge were not found to increase as a function of increasing
   urbanization as has been found in many other studies. The observed
   annual frequency of bankfull discharge was typically less than a 1-year
   return period with many sites ranging between 2 and 18 bankfull events
   per year with higher intensity and shorter duration urban flood
   responses, which further identified significant limitations in using
   annual peak discharge methods for predicting morphological forming flows
   in urban watersheds.
   The cumulative volume of bankfull and larger flood events from the urban
   stream channels were very similar to the same annual event volumes in
   the rural comparison study reaches. Bed material supply was found to
   decrease with increasing urbanization and the reduction in bed material
   supply appears to be off-set by the smaller bankfull channel width,
   depth and access to floodplains during large flood events. Field
   evidence may also suggest a even greater reduction in channel width
   trajectory, relative to the rural setting, with expansive floodplains to
   maintain quasi-equilibrium conditions as bed material supply continues
   to decrease with increased anthropogenic activity. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In multiangle elastic light scattering (MAELS) experiments, the
   morphology of aerosolized particles is inferred by shining collimated
   radiation through the aerosol and then measuring the scattered light
   intensity over a set of angles. In the case of soot-laden-aerosols MAELS
   can, in principle, be used to recover the size distribution of soot
   aggregates, although this involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem.
   This paper presents a design-of-experiment methodology for identifying
   the set of angles that maximizes the information content of the angular
   scattering measurements, thereby minimizing the ill-posedness of the
   underlying inverse problem. While the optimized angles highlight the
   physical significance of the scattering regimes, they do not improve the
   accuracy of size distributions reconstructed from simulated experimental
   data. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Corrosion of steel reinforcement is a major concern for bridges
   throughout Canada, particularly where deicing salts are used.
   Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are not susceptible to corrosion,
   making them an attractive alternative to internal steel reinforcement
   for Canadian bridges. Due to the low stiffness of FRP materials,
   concrete members tend to have high deflections and large crack widths at
   service loads with serviceability limits governing their design. In
   addition, they tend to have lower shear capacities compared to similar
   steel-reinforced members. This study focuses on glass FRP (GFRP)
   reinforced slab strips cast with self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and
   post-tensioned with carbon FRP (CFRP) tendons to improve their
   serviceability, shear capacity, and deformability. The experimental
   results highlight the potential of an FRP reinforcement system for slab
   bridges combining passive GFRP reinforcement with prestressed CFRP
   tendons. The flexural performance of five FRP-reinforced slabs and one
   steel-reinforced control slab are compared to the design provisions of
   the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of zero-delay (encoding a
   single-source sample) robust joint source-channel coding over an
   additive white Gaussian noise channel. We propose a new scheme that,
   unlike previously known coding schemes, achieves the optimal scaling of
   the source signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) versus channel
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also, we propose a family of robust codes,
   which together maintain a bounded gap with the optimum SDR curve (in
   terms of decibel). To show the importance of this result, we derive some
   theoretical bounds on the asymptotic performance of a widely used class
   of delay-limited hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding schemes based on
   superposition of analog and digital components. We show that, unlike the
   delay-unlimited case, for this class of delay-limited HDA codes, the
   asymptotic performance loss is unbounded (in terms of decibels).
   Although the main focus of this paper is on uniform sources, it is also
   shown that the results are also valid for a more general class of
   well-behaved distributions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a downlink communication system in which a
   base station (BS) equipped with M antennas and power constraint P
   communicates with N users each equipped with K receive antennas. It is
   assumed that the users have perfect channel state information (CSI) of
   their own channels, while the BS only knows the partial CSI provided by
   the receivers via a feedback channel. We study the fundamental limits on
   the amount of feedback required at the BS to achieve the sum-rate
   capacity of the system (when BS has perfect CSI for all users) in the
   asymptotic case of N -> infinity, considering various signal to noise
   ratio (SNR) regimes. The main results of this paper can be expressed as
   follows. 1) In the fixed-SNR regime (where the SNR does not scale with
   N) and low-SNR regime (where the SNR is much smaller than 1/ln(N)), to
   achieve the (1 - epsilon)-portion of the sum-rate capacity, the total
   amount of feedback should scale at least with ln(epsilon(-1)). In the
   fixed-SNR regime, to reduce the gap between the achievable sum rate and
   the sum-rate capacity of the system (which is defined as the sum-rate
   gap) to zero, the amount of feedback should scale at least
   logarithmically with the sum-rate capacity, which is achievable by using
   the random beam-forming (RBF) scheme proposed by Sharif and Hassibi. In
   the low-SNR regime, we propose an opportunistic beam-forming (OBF)
   scheme, which is shown to be asymptotically feedback optimal. 2) In the
   high-SNR regime (where the SNR grows to infinity N -> infinity), the
   total amount of feedback depends on the number of receive antennas. In
   particular, to reduce the sum-rate gap to zero in the case of, K < M,
   the amount of feedback in the SNR regime of ln(P)/ln(N) > 1/M-1, should
   scale at least logarithmically with the SNR. In the case of K >= M, the
   amount of feedback does not need to scale with the SNR. Moreover, we
   show that RBF is asymptotically feedback optimal in the high-SNR regime.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, to achieve a vehicle user's privacy preservation while
   improving the key update efficiency of location-based services (LBSs) in
   vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), we propose a dynamic
   privacy-preserving key management scheme called DIKE. Specifically, in
   the proposed DIKE scheme, we first introduce a privacy-preserving
   authentication technique that not only provides the vehicle user's
   anonymous authentication but enables double-registration detection as
   well. We then present efficient LBS session key update procedures: 1) We
   divide the session of an LBS into several time slots so that each time
   slot holds a different session key; when no vehicle user departs from
   the service session, each joined user can use a one-way hash function to
   autonomously update the new session key for achieving forward secrecy.
   2) We also integrate a novel dynamic threshold technique in traditional
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V-2-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-2-I)
   communications to achieve the session key's backward secrecy, i.e., when
   a vehicle user departs from the service session, more than a threshold
   number of joined users can cooperatively update the new session key.
   Performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DIKE scheme in terms of low
   key update delay and fast key update ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic surveillance is an important topic in computer vision and
   intelligent transportation systems and has intensively been studied in
   the past decades. However, most of the state-of-the-art methods
   concentrate on daytime traffic monitoring. In this paper, we propose a
   nighttime traffic surveillance system, which consists of headlight
   detection, headlight tracking and pairing, and camera calibration and
   vehicle speed estimation. First, a vehicle headlight is detected using a
   reflection intensity map and a reflection suppressed map based on the
   analysis of the light attenuation model. Second, the headlight is
   tracked and paired by utilizing a simple yet effective bidirectional
   reasoning algorithm. Finally, the trajectories of the vehicle's
   headlight are employed to calibrate the surveillance camera and estimate
   the vehicle's speed. Experimental results on typical sequences show that
   the proposed method can robustly detect, track, and pair the vehicle
   headlight in night scenes. Extensive quantitative evaluations and
   related comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods.}},

   using hidden Markov models, so that the same model can be used for both
   motion recognition and motion generation. At the same time, the temporal
   relationship between motion primitives is learned via the construction
   of a motion primitive graph. The motion primitive graph can then be used
   to construct motions, consisting of sequences of motion primitives. The
   approach is implemented and tested during on-line observation and on the

Abstract = {{The design of Delayed Coking Unit of a refinery is a challenging
   project. This study highlights some of the design considerations in the
   delayed coking unit with an emphasis on process point of view and more
   specifically on the relief conditions of coke drums operating under an
   upset event which results in overpressure of coke drums.
   The results provided a practical and useful approach to control release
   of hot and heavy hydrocarbons to minimize their environmental impact.
   Blocked outlet conditions of normally open path of coke drum to the main
   fractionator is a critical issue in a refinery. Pressure safety valves
   calculations were carried out to address their dynamic behavior. It was
   assumed that the operating team will recognize the problem with sudden

Abstract = {{Distributed generation (DG) exists in distribution systems and is
   installed by either the utility or the customers. This paper proposes a
   novel utilization of the existing DG interface to not only control the
   active power flow, but also to mitigate unbalance, harmonics and voltage
   flicker, and manage the reactive power of the system. The proposed
   flexible distributed generation (FDG) is similar in functionality to
   FACTS, but works at the distribution level. Moreover, a novel recursive
   least square (RLS) structure is presented. The new structure is applied
   to multi-output (MO) systems for parameter tracking/estimation, and is
   called MO-RLS. It is dedicated to symmetrical components estimation. An
   innovative processing unit-based RLS is investigated to deal with
   unbalance, harmonics, and reactive power compensation. In addition, this
   paper portrays a technique for flicker mitigation based on the RLS
   algorithm for instantaneous tracking of the measured voltage envelope.
   One advantage of the proposed control system is its insensitivity to
   parameter variation, a necessity for distribution system applications.
   Simulations of the suggested FDG based control algorithm are conducted
   to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent past, subquadratic space complexity multipliers have been
   proposed for binary fields defined by irreducible trinomials and some
   specific pentanomials. For such multipliers, alternative irreducible
   polynomials can also be used, in particular, nearly all one polynomials
   (NAOPs) seem to be better than pentanomials. For improved efficiency,
   multiplication modulo an NAOP is performed via modulo a quadrinomial
   whose degree is one more than that of the original NAOP. In this paper,
   we present a Toeplitz matrix-vector product based approach for
   multiplication modulo a quadrinomial. We obtain a fully parallel
   multiplier with a subquadratic space complexity. The Toeplitz
   matrix-vector product-based approach is also interesting in the design
   of sequential multipliers. We present two such multipliers that process
   a two-bit digit every clock cycle. Field-programmable gate-array
   implementations of the proposed sequential as well as fully parallel
   multipliers for the field size of 163 are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{We leverage properties of the logic synthesis netlist to define both a
   new field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) logic element (function
   generator) architecture and an associated technology mapping algorithm
   that together provide improved logic density. We demonstrate that an
   ``extended{''} logic element with slightly modified K-input lookup
   tables (LUTs) achieves much of the benefit of an architecture with K +
   1-input LUTs, while consuming silicon area close to a K-LUT (a K-LUT
   requires half the area of a K + 1-LUT). We introduce the notion of
   ``non-inverting paths{''} in a circuit's AND-inverter graph (AIG) and
   show their utility in mapping into the proposed logic element
   architectures. We propose a general family of logic element
   architectures, and present results showing that they offer a variety of
   area/performance tradeoffs. One of our key results demonstrates that
   while circuits mapped to a traditional 5-LUT architecture need 15\% more
   LUTs and have 14\% more depth than a 6-LUT architecture, our extended
   5-LUT architecture requires only 7\% more LUTs and 5\% more depth than
   6-LUTs, on average. Nearly all of the depth reduction associated with
   moving from K-input to K + 1-input LUTs can be achieved with
   considerably less area using extended K-LUTs. We further show that 6-LUT
   optimal mapping depths can be achieved with a small fraction of the LUTs
   in hardware being 6-LUTs and the remainder being extended 5-LUTs,
   suggesting that a heterogeneous logic block architecture may prove to be
   advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{Locally isolated strains of a thermoalkalotolerant Streptomyces sp. and
   Aspergillus fumigatus were used for the in vitro biosynthesis of silver
   nanoparticles from AgNO3 solutions. An autolysed cell-free culture
   filtrate from each strain was used, indicating that the formation
   mechanism depends on intra-cellular components for both organisms, since
   culture broths had no significant nanoparticle formation potential.
   Nanoparticle formation was indicated by a change of the solution from
   colourless or light brown to dark brown after 24 h or more, and
   UV-visible spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the
   formation by both organisms. The initial formation kinetics were faster
   with Aspergillus, but formation continued for a longer period with
   Streptomyces, resulting in higher concentrations after 48 h.
   Transmission electron microscope images revealed well dispersed
   nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 15 to 45 nm from A. fumigatus,
   while those from Streptomyces sp. had a narrower size distribution of
   15-25 nm. The higher productivity and preferred narrower size
   distribution of Streptomyces, together with its well established

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Reductive amination via Schiff's base formation is a widely used
   reaction for laboratory and industrial applications ranging from protein
   immobilization to nanoparticle synthesis. One major limitation of this
   reaction is the slow kinetics and hence, it can take several days for
   the reaction to reach completion. Here we demonstrate that
   electromagnetic microwave can be used to accelerate the rate of
   reduction amination. To demonstrate proof of concept, we utilized the
   reductive amination between reducing end of dextran and primary amine
   from N-Boc-ethylenediamine as a model reaction. The reaction was
   conducted at room temperature to demonstrate that the enhancement was
   mainly due to electromagnetic effects of the microwave rather than
   thermal effects. We show that reductive amination reaction time was
   reduced from 72 h to 4 h using microwave irradiation. These results
   indicate non-thermal microwave effects to expedite reductive amination
   for synthesizing copolymers. The efficient conjugation of dextran using
   reductive amination provides an important tool for developing
   biocompatible copolymers using carbohydrates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Smart grid initiative is based on several pillars among which

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a distributed asynchronous clock
   synchronization (DCS) protocol for Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs).
   Different from existing clock synchronization protocols, the proposed
   DCS protocol can achieve global clock synchronization among mobile nodes
   within the network over asynchronous and intermittent connections with
   long delays. Convergence of the clock values can be reached by
   compensating for clock errors using mutual relative clock information
   that is propagated in the network by contacted nodes. The level of clock
   accuracy is depreciated with respect to time in order to account for
   long delays between contact opportunities. Mathematical analysis and
   simulation results for various network scenarios are presented to
   demonstrate the convergence and performance of the DCS protocol. It is
   shown that the DCS protocol can achieve faster clock convergence speed
   and, as a result, reduces energy cost by half for neighbor discovery.}},

Abstract = {{ZigBee, a unique communication standard designed for low-rate wireless
   personal area networks, has extremely low complexity, cost, and power
   consumption for wireless connectivity in inexpensive, portable, and
   mobile devices. Among the well-known ZigBee topologies, ZigBee
   cluster-tree is especially suitable for low-power and low-cost wireless
   sensor networks because it supports power saving operations and
   light-weight routing. In a constructed wireless sensor network, the
   information about some area of interest may require further
   investigation such that more traffic will be generated. However, the
   restricted routing of a ZigBee cluster-tree network may not be able to
   provide sufficient bandwidth for the increased traffic load, so the
   additional information may not be delivered successfully. In this paper,
   we present an adoptive-parent-based framework for a ZigBee cluster-tree
   network to increase bandwidth utilization without generating any extra
   message exchange. To optimize the throughput in the framework, we model
   the process as a vertex-constraint maximum flow problem, and develop a
   distributed algorithm that is fully compatible with the ZigBee standard.
   The optimality and convergence property of the algorithm are proved
   theoretically. Finally, the results of simulation experiments
   demonstrate the significant performance improvement achieved by the
   proposed framework and algorithm over existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by theories of sparse representation and compressed sensing,
   this paper presents a simple, novel, yet very powerful approach for
   texture classification based on random projection, suitable for large
   texture database applications. At the feature extraction stage, a small
   set of random features is extracted from local image patches. The random
   features are embedded into a bag-of-words model to perform texture
   classification; thus, learning and classification are carried out in a
   compressed domain. The proposed unconventional random feature extraction
   is simple, yet by leveraging the sparse nature of texture images, our
   approach outperforms traditional feature extraction methods which
   involve careful design and complex steps. We have conducted extensive
   experiments on each of the CUReT, the Brodatz, and the MSRC databases,
   comparing the proposed approach to four state-of-the-art texture
   classification methods: Patch, Patch-MRF, MR8, and LBP. We show that our
   approach leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy
   and reductions in feature dimensionality.}},

   sensitivity analysis of the temperature distribution for these groups of
   target nodes identifies the sensor location for each cluster that
   exhibits the highest sensitivity to variable inputs. A comparison of
   sensor locations identified by each clustering method with the
   sensitivity analysis is presented and is used to evaluate the optimal
   sensor location in terms of consistency in generating these sensor
   locations, the degree of sensitivity, the mutual interaction through
   principal component analysis, limiting the number of sensors, and the

   Over a 50 year lifespan, the operating energy and operating GWP of the

   embodied energy and embodied GWP differs by as much as 44\% and 35\%
   respectively. The roof alone accounts for around 50\% of the total
   embodied energy and GWP in these buildings, which is far greater than
   the contribution from any other individual building component. However,
   operating effects in these buildings account for around 90\% of the
   total effects and far outweigh any differences in embodied effects
   between the buildings. Therefore, the total energy and total GWP of
   these buildings only differs at most by 6\% and 7\% respectively over a

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are an extreme case of mobile ad hoc
   networks (MANETs). High speed and frequent network topology changes are
   the main characteristics of vehicular networks. These characteristics
   lead to special issues and challenges in the network design, especially
   at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we provide a
   comprehensive evaluation of mobility impact on the IEEE 802.11p MAC
   performance. The study evaluates basic performance metrics such as
   packet delivery ratio, throughput, and delay. An unfairness problem due
   to the relative speed is identified for both broadcast and unicast
   scenarios. We propose two dynamic contention window mechanisms to
   alleviate network performance degradation due to high mobility. The
   first scheme provides dynamic level of service priority via adaptation
   to the number of neighboring nodes, while the second scheme provides
   service priority based on node relative speed. Extensive simulation
   results demonstrate a significant impact of mobility on the IEEE 802.11p
   MAC performance, the unfairness problem in the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
   communications, and the effectiveness of the proposed MAC schemes. (C)

Abstract = {{The emerging IEEE 802.11p standard adopts the enhanced distributed

   to support quality-of-service (QoS) in the rapidly changing vehicular
   environment. While the IEEE 802.11 protocol family represents the
   dominant solutions for wireless local area networks, its QoS performance
   in terms of throughput and delay, in the highly mobile vehicular
   networks, is still unclear. To explore an in-depth understanding on this
   issue, in this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical model that
   takes into account both the QoS features of EDCA and the vehicle
   mobility (velocity and moving directions). Based on the model, we
   analyze the throughput performance and mean transmission delay of
   differentiated service traffic, and seek solutions to optimally adjust
   the parameters of EDCA towards the controllable QoS provision to
   vehicles. Analytical and simulation results are given to demonstrate the
   accuracy of the proposed model for varying EDCA parameters and vehicle

   order thermal deactivation mechanism that included reversible activation
   and deactivation with MAO. Interestingly, the polymerization order with
   respect to ethylene varied with ethylene concentration from first to
   second order. The trigger mechanism was shown to describe well the
   effect of ethylene concentration on polymer yield and polymerization
   kinetics. Low MAO concentration favored formation of polymer chains with
   unsaturated chain ends that in turn led to the production of polymers
   with higher long chain branch densities. It was also observed that CGC
   did not behave as a true single site catalyst at low MAO concentrations.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{63-72}},

Abstract = {{Co-Ni coatings have been deposited by galvanostatic direct current,
   unipolar pulse plating and bipolar pulse reverse plating in buffered
   additive-free sulfate solutions at pH 3 and analyzed for their alloy
   composition, deposition current efficiency and surface morphology. A
   main objective is to determine whether the use of pulse or pulse reverse
   plating call overcome the anomalous behavior of this system whereby
   cobalt preferentially deposits over nickel even from solutions
   containing more NiSO4 than CoSO4. This study focuses on the use of a
   plating solution having a NiSO4:CoSO4 molar ratio of 2:1 and another
   bath containing a large excess of NiSO4 over CoSO4. Experiments reveal
   that both pulse plating and pulse reverse plating are unable to
   significantly alleviate the anomalous behavior in either solution over
   the range of pulse frequencies, duty cycles and current amplitudes
   considered in this study, unlike that observed in previous studies when
   deposition is carried out in chloride-based solutions. On the other
   hand, significant improvement and better control of coating morphology
   over that achievable by direct current plating is possible using
   unipolar pulse plating in particular. Smoother and brighter deposits
   with finer-grained structures are obtained by increasing pulse duty
   cycle and frequency and decreasing cathodic pulse amplitude. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Areas with high landslide activity and diversity were encountered in the
   tropical Andes of Southern Ecuador under contrasting, semi-arid to
   perhumid climatic conditions. The objective of this study was to
   determine and compare geomorphic process rates of shallow landslides
   along this remarkable humidity gradient and subject to different types
   of human-made and natural environmental changes. Geomorphic work,
   geomorphic power and landslide mobilization rate (LMR) were therefore
   calculated for shallow landslides in two study areas with two separate
   geological or land use-related subareas each. While landslide ages were
   known in the perhumid Reserva Biologica San Francisco (RBSF) area, only
   an approximation of the frequency of critical landslide-triggering
   rainfall events was available for the semi-arid Masamanaca area.
   Landslide volumes were estimated by volume-area scaling. Generalized
   additive models (GAMs) were used as landslide susceptibility models in
   order to analyze the relative importance of topography, and to downscale
   LMR values to a fine spatial resolution. LMR in the perhumid RBSF area
   ranged from approximate to 2 mm yr(-1) in the natural part of this area
   with tropical mountain rainforests to approximate to 5 mm yr(-1) in the
   human-influenced part. The semi-arid Masamanaca area, though subject to
   greater estimation uncertainties, displayed LMR on the order of
   approximate to 0.4 to 4 mm yr(-1) for shallow landslides. The results
   provide a basis for the spatially differentiated assessment of landscape
   evolution and degradation in an area with a close relation between
   landslide activity, natural vegetation succession and human land use.

Abstract = {{Ordered arrays of silicon nanowires were fabricated by etching, and
   their bunching characteristics were parametrically studied by varying
   the diameter, the length, and the pitch. The diameter to length ratio
   was found to be critical for the nanowires to stand vertically without
   bunching. For a length of 650 nm, 40 nm and larger diameter nanowires
   were vertical, whereas for a length of 400 nm, 34 nm and larger diameter
   nanowires were vertical. Further, the phase change between the bunching
   and vertical nature of nanowires happens abruptly and was verified by
   finite element modeling of the deflections of the nanowire tips for
   different diameters. The detailed experimental study provides guidelines
   for silicon nanowire arrays being considered for different applications
   including solar cells, optical waveguides, and sensors. (C) 2012

   coreshell structured nanoparticles were prepared using a two-stage
   semibatch microemulsion polymerization system with PMMA and NBR as the
   core and shell, respectively. The Gemini surfactant 12-3-12 was used as
   the emulsifier and found to impose a pronounced influence on the
   formation of coreshell nanoparticles. The spherical morphology of
   coreshell nanoparticles was observed. It was found that there exists an
   optimal MMA addition amount, which can result in the minimized size of
   PMMA-NBR coreshell nanoparticles. The formation mechanism of the
   coreshell structure and the interaction between the core and shell
   domains was illustrated. The PMMA-NBR nanosize latex can be used as the
   substrate for the following direct latex hydrogenation catalyzed by
   Wilkinson's catalyst to prepare the PMMA-HNBR (hydrogenated NBR)
   coreshell nanoparticles. The hydrogenation rate is rapid. In the absence
   of any organic solvent, the PMMA-HNBR nanoparticles with a size of 30.6
   nm were obtained within 3 h using 0.9 wt \% Wilkinson's catalyst at 130
   degrees C under 1000 psi of H(2). This study provides a new perspective

Abstract = {{A new temperature performance record of 199.5 K for terahertz quantum
   cascade lasers is achieved by optimizing the lasing transition
   oscillator strength of the resonant phonon based three-well design. The

   the previous record (0.41) by Kumar et al. {[}Appl. Phys. Lett. 94,
   131105 (2009)]. The choice of tunneling barrier thicknesses was
   determined with a simplified density matrix model, which converged
   towards higher tunneling coupling strengths than previously explored and
   nearly perfect alignment of the states across the injection and
   extraction barriers at the design electric field. At 8 K, the device
   showed a threshold current density of 1 kA/cm(2), with a peak output
   power of similar to 38 mW, and lasing frequency blue-shifting from 2.6
   THz to 2.85 THz with increasing bias. The wavelength blue-shifted to
   3.22 THz closer to the maximum operating temperature of 199.5 K, which
   corresponds to similar to 1.28 (h) over bar omega/kappa(B). The voltage
   dependence of laser frequency is related to the Stark effect of two
   intersubband transitions and is compared with the simulated gain spectra
   obtained by a Monte Carlo approach. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Cross-layer interaction between TCP and CSMA/CA-based MAC in multihop
   wireless networks produces suboptimal network performance, including
   flow rate unfairness and starvation. Rate control mechanisms can

   mechanisms that enforce rate limits at traffic aggregation points,
   without modifying individual mesh routers or client devices. In this
   paper, we propose, design, and evaluate a framework of zero-overhead,
   feedback-driven centralized rate controllers. These controllers are
   implemented at gateway mesh routers. We use existing data traffic as
   capacity probes with a feedback-driven response to adapt to changes in
   network and traffic conditions. Using simulations and experiments on a
   testbed, we show an improvement in fairness by a factor of 2-3 over
   networks without any rate control. Further, our fairness metrics are
   within 2\% of those achieved by a centralized controller with an
   omniscient knowledge of network conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Flow and turbulence redistribution in a straight artificial pool}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain the occurrence of
   pools in gravel bed rivers. These hypotheses were developed without a
   hydrodynamic model of how open channel flow is affected by pools, and it
   is not clear why and when the flow phenomena they describe might occur.
   Laboratory experiments are warranted to improve our understanding of how
   a gradual convective deceleration and acceleration of the flow, without
   flow separation, redistributes flow and turbulence in an open channel.
   Experiments are conducted in a 1.5 m wide flume with a 0.25 m deep, 7.29
   m long straight pool, entry and exit slopes of 5 degrees, vertical side
   walls, and gravel sediment (D-50 = 9.9 mm). Three-dimensional velocity
   components are recorded at 50 Hz using Nortek Vectrinos. Velocity and
   Reynolds stress profiles in the channel centerline agree with previous
   results in nonuniform flow and include increased Reynolds stress during
   deceleration and high velocity near the bed during acceleration. Lateral
   flow convergence occurs where depth is increasing, which demonstrates
   that convergence is induced during flow deceleration and does not
   require a lateral flow constriction. Turbulence during deceleration is
   characterized by sweeps angled toward the sidewall of the channel, an
   effect that could lead to the formation of a nonuniform pool depth
   through lateral gradients in the deposition of mobile sediment. A
   conceptual model of pool hydrodynamics is proposed that includes
   increased turbulence, near-bed acceleration, and lateral flow
   convergence as linked aspects of convective deceleration and
   acceleration due to depth changes in the pool.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of sodium alanate (NaAlH4) with the nanometric Ni (n-Ni)
   additive were processed by controlled ball milling for 15 min in a
   magneto-mill and subsequently investigated by Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and volumetric hydrogen
   desorption in a Sieverts-type apparatus. The apparent activation energy
   of the decomposition of Na3AlH6, which is the decomposition product in
   the first dehydrogenation step of NaAlH4, is equal to similar to 140
   kJ/mol and similar to 101 kJ/mol for ball milled NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5
   wt\% n-Ni, respectively, as determined by the Kissinger method in DSC
   tests. The apparent activation energy for the decomposition of NaH,
   which is the decomposition product in the second dehydrogenation step of
   Na3AlH6, is estimated as equal to similar to 143 kJ/mol and similar to
   226 kJ/mol for ball milled NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5 wt\% n-Ni,
   respectively. It seems that the n-Ni additive accelerates the
   decomposition of Na3AlH6 but decelerates the decomposition of NaH.
   Volumetric desorption tests indicate a substantial enhancement of the
   rate of hydrogen desorption at 170 degrees C for the ball milled NaAlH4
   + 5 wt\% n-Ni nanocomposite as a result of the catalytic action of n-Ni.
   No reaction of n-Ni with the NaAlH4 matrix is observed during
   dehydrogenation at 170-280 degrees C. The n-Ni catalyst used in the
   present work compares very favorably with other catalytic additives
   reported in the literature (e.g., metal chlorides) which were used for
   the enhancement of dehydrogenation of NaAlH4.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach for texture classification,
   generalizing the well-known local binary pattern (LBP) approach. In the
   proposed approach, two different and complementary types of features
   (pixel intensities and differences) are extracted from local patches.
   The intensity-based features consider the intensity of the central pixel
   (CI) and those of its neighbors (NI); while for the difference-based
   feature, two components are computed: the radial-difference (RD) and the
   angular-difference (AD). Inspired by the LBP approach, two
   intensity-based descriptors CI-LBP and NI-LBP, and two difference-based
   descriptors RD-LBP and AD-LBP are developed. All four descriptors are in
   the same form as conventional LBP codes, so they can be readily combined
   to form joint histograms to represent textured images. The proposed
   approach is computationally very simple: it is totally training-free,
   there is no need to learn a texton dictionary, and no tuning of
   parameters. We have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging
   texture databases (Outex. CUReT and KTHTIPS2b). Outex results show
   significant improvements over the classical LBP approach, which clearly
   demonstrates the great power of the joint distributions of these
   proposed descriptors for gray-scale and rotation invariant texture
   classification. The proposed method produces the best classification
   results on KTHTIPS2b, and results comparable to the state-of-the-art on
   CUReT. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared Optical up-conversion devices are attracting more and more
   attentions for their greater capability to convert infrared light to
   visible light via optical-electrical-optical process, compared with
   other existing converting technology. The basic idea is to integrate an
   infrared photodetector with a light-emitting diode (LED) or an organic
   light-emitting device (OLED), connected in series. The infrared
   photo-generated electron hole pairs within the absorbing layer of
   photodetector are injected to the LED (or OLED), resulting in an
   increase in optical emission at a shorter wavelength and therefore
   achieving optical up conversion. This paper presents our research and
   development effort in realizing and perfecting such devices, and mainly
   focuses on the design, internal semiconductor physics, fabrications, and
   performances of different optical up-conversion device structures.
   Moreover, based on the analysis of experimental results, the paper
   explains the close relationship between internal coefficient and overall
   upconversion power efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A deep geologic repository (DGR) for low- and intermediate-level waste
   has been proposed by Ontario Power Generation for the Bruce nuclear site
   in the Municipality of Kincardine, Ontario, Canada. As envisioned, the
   proposed DGR would be constructed at a depth of about 680 m below ground
   surface within the argillaceous Ordovician limestone of the Cobourg
   Formation. Within the geologic setting of southern Ontario, the Bruce
   nuclear site is positioned along the eastern flank of the Michigan
   Basin. The regional-scale domain for the modeling undertaken in support
   of the DGR program encompasses an area of approximately 18 000 km2 and
   extends to the deepest points in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. The
   conceptual model for the ground water system was developed using data
   from the DGR site characterization program. Hydraulic parameters for the
   model hydrostratigraphic units were defined using data from the DGR site
   boreholes and from lab analyses of cores. Borehole data included
   hydraulic conductivities from straddle-packer hydraulic tests and
   pressure measurements from the Westbay MP38 and MP55 multilevel
   groundwater monitoring system. Data from this system indicate that units
   of the Salina and the Ordovician sediments are under-pressured relative
   to hydrostatic levels associated with ground surface at the DGR site.
   The Silurian Niagaran Group is slightly over-pressured while the
   Cambrian Formation sandstone is significantly over-pressured. The
   pressure distribution in the sedimentary rock of the Bruce site was
   analyzed using a hydromechanical model that assumed homogeneous loads
   and no lateral strain. Layer dependent specific storage coefficients and
   one-dimensional loading efficiencies were calculated based on testing of
   core samples. The impact of glaciation and deglaciation on the
   groundwater system was investigated in paleohydrogeologic scenarios. The
   model results indicated that basal meltwater does not penetrate
   vertically below the units of the Salina at the DGR site. A suite of
   paleohydrogeologic scenarios were investigated in this study. Based on
   these analyses, glaciation and deglaciation were unable to yield the
   abnormal pressure patterns observed in the DGR boreholes for the
   Ordovician formations. Models that included the presence of a gas phase
   were found to produce under-pressures that are similar to field
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and texture evolution during hot rolling (350 degrees
   C) and subsequent annealing are compared in Mg-2.9Y and Mg-2.9Zn (in
   wt\%) solid solution alloys. It is shown that Y in solid solution,
   unlike Zn, suppresses dynamic recrystallization. Nevertheless, the two
   alloys exhibit similar, strong basal textures. Upon isothermal annealing
   of the rolled material at 400 degrees C, the texture is weakened only in
   the Mg-2.9Y alloy. The texture weakening is attributed to static
   recrystallization in basal parent grains. During rolling of Mg-2.9Y,
   basal parent grains store a high amount of basal dislocations that are
   organized in a very fine substructure. Such a highly energetic
   configuration gives rise to fine recrystallized grains with a wide
   orientation spread during annealing. On the other hand, off-basal parent
   grains with c-axes close to the RD-TD plane develop coarser substructure
   accommodating prismatic slip during rolling. The energy stored in these
   grains is significantly lower than that in basal ones (similar to 20
   times smaller). Static recrystallization at off-basal parent grains
   leads to coarse new grains and involves rotations about c-axis. The
   texture weakening induced by static recrystallization in Mg-2.9Y was
   found to result in higher ductility and lower anisotropy when compared
   to Mg-2.9Zn. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Ti-Nb samples reveal the microstructure on a longitudinal section with
   significant change in the size of the dendrites across the sample.
   Quantitative phase-field simulations of directional solidification under
   local steady-state conditions extracted from the results of the finite
   element thermal model confirmed this behavior. Specifically, the
   phase-field simulations agree with the results of the analytical model
   of Hunt in predicting a minimum spacing value, which is due to the
   mutual effects of the increasing temperature gradient and decreasing
   solidification velocity towards the bottom of the microstructure. This
   work demonstrates the potential of coupling the phase-field method to
   complex heat transfer conditions necessary to simulate topologically
   complex microstructure morphologies present in laser powder deposition
   and other industrially relevant casting conditions. (C) 2011 Acta

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the microstructural change
   after laser welding and its effect on the tensile properties and strain
   hardening behavior of DP600 and DP980 dual-phase steels. Laser welding
   led to the formation of martensite and significant hardness rise in the
   fusion zone because of the fast cooling, but the presence of a soft zone
   in the heat-affected zone was caused by partial vanishing and tempering
   of the pre-existing martensite. The extent of softening was much larger
   in the DP980-welded joints than in the DP600-welded joints. Despite the
   reduction in ductility, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) remained
   almost unchanged, and the yield strength (YS) indeed increased stemming
   from the appearance of yield point phenomena after welding in the DP600
   steel. The DP980-welded joints showed lower YS and UTS than the base
   metal owing to the appearance of severe soft zone. The YS, UTS, and
   strain hardening exponent increased slightly with increasing strain
   rate. While the base metals had multi-stage strain hardening, the welded
   joints showed only stage III hardening. All the welded joints failed in
   the soft zone, and the fracture surfaces exhibited characteristic dimple
   fracture.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Catalytic oxidation of H-2/air mixtures in the slip regime is
   numerically simulated in order to assess the slip/jump effects in
   platinum-coated planar microchannels. A colocated finite-volume method
   is used to solve the governing equations. A concentration jump model
   derived from the kinetic theory of gases is employed to account for the
   concentration discontinuity at the reactive walls. A detailed surface
   reaction mechanism for hydrogen oxidation on Pt along with a
   multi-component species diffusion model are used to study the effects of
   concentration jump coupled with velocity slip and temperature jump on
   the walls. The slip/jump effects are studied under different operating
   conditions: wall temperature, channel height, inlet mass flux and
   surface accommodation coefficient are varied to examine their individual
   effects. The results suggest that the temperature discontinuity at the
   wall is the dominant term in the concentration jump boundary condition.
   The mass transfer characteristics of the reacting flow are least
   influenced by velocity slip while the temperature jump at the wall
   alters the mass transfer characteristics the most. The hydrogen
   oxidation rate on the catalytic wall is strongly affected by the
   rarefaction effects, especially in the entrance region. The results show
   that the thermal diffusion effect in calculating the diffusive mass flux
   of species has a considerable effect on the species distribution inside
   the channel and cannot be neglected. The effects of slip/jump boundary
   conditions can change significantly at different inlet fluxes and
   channel heights. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Antibiotic resistance profiles of representative wetland bacteria and
   faecal indicators following ciprofloxacin exposure in lab-scale
   constructed mesocosms}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{113-122}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin on the
   presentation and potential development of antibiotic resistance among
   selected faecal indicators (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp.) and
   the intrinsic bacterial community for a freshwater model ecosystem was
   investigated. Four parallel mesocosm wetlands planted with Phragmites
   oust rails were initially seeded with an activated sludge inoculum from
   a wastewater treatment plant and monitored over the course of 63 days.
   Two of the four mesocosms (CIP1 and CIP2) were initially exposed to a
   ciprofloxacin concentration of 2 mu g mL(-1) for a 5 day period, and two
   were considered controls (CON1 and CON2). Minimum inhibitory
   concentrations were determined for the culturable interstitial microbial
   community using ciprofloxacin concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 16 mu g
   mL(-1) and compared with total heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs). E.
   coli and Enterococcus spp. were enumerated and screened for
   antimicrobial resistance to twelve different antibiotics both before and
   after mesocosm ciprofloxacin exposure. Concentrations for total
   heterotrophs within the interstitial water were in the order of
   10(6)-10(8) CFU 100 mL(-1), while E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were
   present in lower concentrations, at 10(2)-10(3) CFU 100 mL(-1). All four
   mesocosms had the same minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2 mu
   g mL(-1) for total heterotrophic community during the first week of
   start-up (before ciprofloxacin exposure), followed by a sharp increase
   in ciprofloxacin exposed mesocosms on day 14 (after ciprofloxacin
   exposure), reaching a maximum MIC of 16 jig mL(-1). The resistance
   levels of interstitial heterotrophic counts determined by the agar
   dilution method peaked 7 days following the ciprofloxacin exposure, and
   decreased thereafter. A significant increase (p < 0.05) to the following
   antibiotics was observed among E. coli following ciprofloxacin exposure
   within mesocosm CIP2: ciprofloxacin (CIP), chloramphenicol (C),
   cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CRO), and doxycycline (D). These results
   illustrate the potential for a single antibiotic exposure event to
   create a noticeable increase in the antibiotic resistance profile, not
   only to the imposed antibiotic, but to other classes of antibiotics. The
   initial background levels of resistance among Enterococcus spp. were
   significantly higher than those observed among E. coli, exhibiting a
   combined average of 96\%, 96\%, and 100\% resistance to ciprofloxacin
   (CIP), linezolid (LZD), and streptomycin (S), respectively. Following
   the addition of ciprofloxacin, Enterococcus spp. retained high levels of
   resistance to ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and streptomycin, with a
   significant increase (p < 0.05) to vancomycin (VA), reaching 100\% on
   Day 63. The findings of this study suggest that the transient presence
   of an isolated exposure event of ciprofloxacin can impact the antibiotic
   resistance profiles among faecal indicators in lab-scale constructed
   mesocosms and has the potential to impact constructed wetland treatment
   systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Welding of single-crystal metallic nanowires is likely to have an
   important role in the bottom-up fabrication of nanodevices. The welding
   effects of free ends of two single-crystal gold nanowires (Au-Au) were
   demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations in this paper. The quantum
   corrected Sutton-Chen type many-body potential was used to model the
   metal-metal interactions. Metallic nanowires were first placed closely
   with head-to-head, head-to-side and side-to-side joining procedures. Two
   ends were successfully welded together to form a continuous nanowire by
   annealing at different temperatures. The welding effects of the
   different joining procedure with different temperatures were compared.
   Structures of the welded specimens were characterized by the common
   neighbor analysis technique. Variable atomic mobility, freedom and
   contacting angles may result in different bonding strengths in the three
   different configurations. The results showed that the joint structure
   welded at low temperature were similar to the cold welding without
   fusion meanwhile the molten phase was presented in the joint when
   processing at the high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is considered as the most effective
   and economic solution for voltage disturbances. This paper presents an
   energy optimized control scheme for a transformerless DVR. The DVR
   structure is based on a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter topology
   to eliminate the need of insertion transformers. The proposed control
   algorithm maintains a balanced load-side voltage even during the
   compensation of unbalanced disturbances with a minimum active power
   injection. Moreover, the proposed scheme maximizes the ride-though
   capability of the DVR during voltage sags. This feature is verified by
   using capacitors instead of dc sources as energy storage elements for
   the DVR. Furthermore, the proposed minimum energy scheme prevents the
   rise in the dc-side voltage of the inverter when compensating voltage
   swells. The performance of the proposed DVR system is evaluated for
   compensating different types of voltage disturbances. The results
   validate the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed system. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of material, geometry, length and position of the porous
   channels on energy transfer in air-filled enclosures carrying a
   compressible pulsating wave are investigated. The pulsating fluid motion
   is created by an acoustic driver in a resonant chamber. Three different
   porous materials (Corning Celcor, Reticulated Vitreous Carbon (RVC), and
   Mylar plastic), three different geometries (square, open foam, and
   circular cross-section), six different lengths, ``L{''} (varying between
   1 and 6.5 cm, L = 0.01-0.068 lambda, where lambda is the wavelength of
   the fundamental acoustic mode), and eight different positions (hot end
   of the channel, varying between 0.5 and 8 cm) of the channels from the
   pressure anti-node is experimentally measured. The surface temperature
   distribution on the channel wall and temperature difference generated
   across the channel walls are measured while energy flow along the
   channel walls is calculated analytically. The experimental results are
   compared with a 1-D numerical code and found excellent agreement. The
   material, geometry, length, and position of the porous channel strongly
   affect the energy interactions between the porous channel and the
   working fluid. The temperature difference generated across the porous
   RVC channel increases as the porosity increases form 20 to 80 PPI; but
   decreases if the porosity increases further. Corning Celcor shows
   improved temperature difference generated across the channel as the
   length of the channel increases; but then decreases if the length is
   further increased. The results of this study are applicable to the
   design of thermoacoustic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled release fertilizers (CRFs) are a branch of materials that are
   designed to improve the soil release kinetics of chemical fertilizers to
   address problems stemming losses from runoff or other factors. Current
   CRFs are used but only in a limited market due to relatively high costs
   and doubts about their abilities to result in higher yields and
   increased profitability for agricultural businesses. New technologies
   are emerging that promise to improve the efficacy of CRFs to add
   additional functionality and reduce cost to make CRFs a more viable
   alternative to traditional chemical fertilizer treatment. CRFs that
   offer ways of reducing air and water pollution from fertilizer
   treatments, improving the ability of plants to access required
   nutrients, improving water retention to increase drought resistance, and
   reducing the amount of fertilizer needed to provide maximum crop yields
   are under development. A wide variety of different strategies are being
   considered to tackle this problem, and each approach offers different
   advantages and drawbacks. Agricultural industries will soon be forced to
   move toward more efficient and sustainable practices to respond to
   increasing fertilizer cost and desire for sustainable growing practices.
   CRFs have the potential to solve many problems in agriculture and help
   enable this shift while maintaining profitability.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease. At present,
   the common method for diagnosis of CF is to detect the chloride
   concentration in sweat using ion-selective electrodes. However, the
   current sweat testing methods require a relatively large quantity of
   sweat sample, at least 25 mu L, which is very difficult to obtain,
   especially for newborns. This paper presents a new method and a new
   device for rapid detection of the chloride concentration from a small
   volume of solution. In this method, the chloride concentration is
   determined quantitatively by the fluorescence intensity of MQAE, a
   chloride ion fluorescent indicator. In this device, the sample is
   carried by a small piece of filter paper on a cover glass exposed to an
   UV LED light source. The resulting fluorescent signals are detected by a
   Si photodiode. Data acquisition and processing are accomplished by
   LabVIEW software in a PDA. Based on the Stern-Volmer relationship, the
   effects of different parameters on the fluorescence intensity were
   analyzed. The observed significant difference between 40 and 60 mM (the
   borderline of chloride concentration for CF) is discussed in this paper.
   The results show that detection can be completed within 10 s. The
   minimum detectable volume of the chloride solution is 1 mu L. The novel
   method and the device are of great potential for CF diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of a paper-immobilized antibody was investigated over a
   range of temperatures (40-140 degrees C) and relative humidities (RH,
   30-90\%) using both unmodified filter paper and the same paper
   impregnated with polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) as supports. Antibody
   stability decreased with increasing temperature, as expected, but also
   decreased with increasing RH. At 40 degrees C, the half-life was more
   than 10 days, with little dependence on RH. However, at 80 degrees C,
   the half-life varied from similar to 3 days at low RH to less than half
   an hour at 90\% RH, demonstrating that hydration of the antibody
   promotes unfolding. Antibody stability was not influenced by the PAE
   paper surface treatment. This work shows that antibodies are good
   candidates for development of bioactive paper as they have sufficient
   stability at high temperature to withstand printing and other
   roll-to-roll processing steps, and sufficient low temperature stability
   to allow long-term storage of bioactive paper materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes solutions for high nonlinearity and structural
   instability in electrostatically actuated MEMS capacitors. The proposed
   designs use the flexibility of the moving electrode and nonlinear
   structural stiffness to control the characteristic capacitance- voltage
   (C-V) response. The moving plate displacements are selectively
   constrained by mechanical stoppers to prevent sudden jumps in the
   capacitance and to eliminate the pull-in. A symmetric double-humped
   electrode shape is utilized which results in a fairly constant
   sensitivity in the C-V curve and therefore a linearized response. An
   analytical and a finite-element coupled-field model are developed to
   study the behavior of the proposed capacitors and to optimize their
   design for maximum linearity. The experimental results verify that the
   designs introduced in this paper improve the linearity of the C-V
   response and increase the maximum tunability by three times compared to
   conventional MEMS parallel-plate capacitors. At the same time, they also
   eliminate the pull-in hysteresis of the response.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Controversy persists regarding the presence and importance of
   hypoglossal nerve dysfunction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   Objectives: We assessed quantitative parameters related to motor unit
   potential (MUP) morphology derived from electromyographic (EMG) signals
   in patients with OSA versus control subjects and hypothesized that signs
   of neurogenic remodeling would be present in the patients with OSA.
   Methods: Participants underwent diagnostic sleep studies to obtain
   apnea-hypopnea indices. Muscle activity was detected with 50-mm
   concentric needle electrodes. The concentric needle was positioned at
   more than 10 independent sites per subject, after the local anatomy of
   the upper airway musculature was examined by ultrasonography. All
   activity was quantified with subjects awake, during supine eupneic
   breathing while wearing a nasal mask connected to a pneumotachograph.
   Genioglossus EMG signals were analyzed offline by automated software
   (DQEMG), which extracted motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) contributed
   by individual motor units from the composite EMG signals. Quantitative
   measurements of MUP templates, including duration, peak-to-peak
   amplitude, area, area-to-amplitude ratio, and size index, were compared
   between the untreated patients with OSA and healthy control subjects.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,655 MUPTs from patients with
   OSA (n = 17; AH I, 55 +/- 6/h) and control subjects (n = 14; AHI, 4 +/-
   1/h) were extracted from the genioglossus muscle EMG signals. MUP
   peak-to-peak amplitudes in the patients with OSA were not different
   compared with the control subjects (397.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 382.5 +/- 10.0 mu
   V). However, the MUPs of the patients with OSA were longer in duration
   (11.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.1 ms; P < 0.001) and had a larger size
   index (4.09 +/- 0.02 vs. 3.92 +/- 0.02; P < 0.001) compared with control
   subjects.
   Conclusions: These results confirm and quantify the extent and existence
   of structural neural remodeling in OSA.}},

Abstract = {{Scarcities in freshwater supply and increasingly stringent rules on
   wastewater discharges have emerged as major environmental concerns for
   petroleum refineries. Hence, this work attempts to develop an
   optimisation framework for refinery water network systems design and
   retrofit that integrates the complementary advantageous features of
   water pinch analysis (WPA). The framework explicitly incorporates water
   minimisation strategies by first postulating a superstructure
   representation that embeds all feasible flowsheet alternatives for
   implementing water reuse, regeneration and recycle (W3R) opportunities.
   Subsequently, a nonlinear programming (NLP) model is formulated based on
   the superstructure and computational experiments on a real-world case
   study are conducted using the GAMS/CONOPT3 modelling language platform.
   Post-optimality analysis on the numerical results are performed to
   achieve the desired water reuse quality, hence presenting a viable
   framework to aid decision-making in water network systems synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, radio resource allocation in a heterogeneous wireless
   access medium is studied. Mobile terminals (MTs) are assumed to have
   multi-homing capabilities. Both constant bit rate and variable bit rate
   services are considered. A novel algorithm is developed for the resource
   allocation. Unlike existing solutions in literature, the proposed
   algorithm is distributed in nature, such that each network base station
   / access point can perform its own resource allocation to support the
   MTs according to their service classes. The coordination among different
   available wireless access networks' base stations is established via the
   MT multiple radio interfaces in order to provide the required bandwidth
   to each MT. A priority mechanism is employed, so that each network gives
   a higher priority on its resources to its own subscribers as compared to
   other users. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural evolution of AZ31 magnesium alloy welds without and with
   the addition of titanium powders during resistance spot welding was
   studied using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fusion zone of AZ31
   magnesium alloy welds could be divided into columnar dendritic zone
   (CDZ) and equiaxed dendritic zone (EDZ). The well-developed CDZ in the
   vicinity of the fusion boundary was clearly restricted and the coarse
   EDZ in the central region was efficiently refined by adding titanium
   powders into the molten pool, compared with the as-received alloy welds.
   A microstructural analysis showed that these titanium particles of
   approximately 8 A mu m diameter acted as inoculants and promoted the
   nucleation of alpha-Mg grains and the formation of equiaxed dendritic
   grains during resistance spot welding. Tensile-shear testing was applied
   to evaluate the effect of titanium addition on the mechanical properties
   of welds. It was found that both strength and ductility of magnesium
   alloy welds were increased after the titanium addition. A TEM
   examination showed the existence of an orientation matching relationship
   between the added Ti particles and Mg matrix, i.e., {[}01 (1) over
   bar0](Mg)//{[}1 (2) over bar1 (3) over bar](Ti) and (0002)(Mg)//(10 (1)
   over bar0)(Ti) in some grains of Ti polycrystal particles. This local
   crystallographic matching could promote heterogeneous nucleation of the
   Mg matrix during welding. The diameter of the added Ti inoculant should
   be larger than 1.8 mu m to make it a potent inoculant.}},

Abstract = {{Self-adaptive software is a closed-loop system, since it continuously
   monitors its context (i.e. environment) and/or self (i.e. software
   entities) in order to adapt itself properly to changes. We believe that
   representing adaptation goals explicitly and tracing them at run-time
   are helpful in decision making for adaptation. While goal-driven models
   are used in requirements engineering, they have not been utilized
   systematically yet for run-time adaptation. To address this research
   gap, this article focuses on the deciding process in self-adaptive
   software, and proposes the Goal-Action-Attribute Model (GAAM). An action
   selection mechanism, based on cooperative decision making, is also
   proposed that uses GAAM to select the appropriate adaptation action(s).
   The emphasis is on building a light-weight and scalable run-time model
   which needs less design and tuning effort comparing with a typical
   rule-based approach. The GAAM and action selection mechanism are
   evaluated using a set of experiments on a simulated multi-tier
   enterprise application, and two sample ordinal and cardinal action
   preference lists. The evaluation is accomplished based on a systematic
   design of experiment and a detailed statistical analysis in order to
   investigate several research questions. The findings are promising,
   considering the obtained results, and other impacts of the approach on
   engineering self-adaptive software. Although, one case study is not
   enough to generalize the findings, and the proposed mechanism does not
   always outperform a typical rule-based approach, less effort,
   scalability, and flexibility of GAAM are remarkable. Copyright (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Processes involved in volatile organic sulfur compound (VOSC) generation
   and degradation in mesophilic and thermophilic digestion of methionine

   DMS were subsequently degraded to H2S. Mixed-second order kinetics were
   found to best fit the VOSC generation and conversion processes. The
   kinetic constants (average values) for MM generation and methylation and
   MM and DMS degradation were estimated to be 0.0032, 0.0047, 0.027, and
   0.013 l g(-1) h(-1) respectively at 35 degrees C and 0.0069, 0.0012,
   0.0083, 0.005 l g(-1) h(-1) respectively at 55 degrees C. More rapid MM
   release and slower VOSC decline at thermophilic temperature implied that

Abstract = {{This paper presents microelectromechanical system micromirrors with
   sidewall electrodes applied for use as a Confocal MACROscope for
   biomedical imaging. The MACROscope is a fluorescence and brightfield
   confocal laser scanning microscope with a very large field of view. In
   this paper, a microelectromechanical system mirror with sidewall
   electrodes replaces the galvo-scanner and XYZ-stage to improve the
   confocal MACROscope design and obtain an image. Two micromirror-based
   optical configurations are developed and tested to optimize the optical
   design through scanning angle, field of view and numerical aperture
   improvement. Meanwhile, the scanning frequency and control waveform of
   the micromirror are tested. Analysing the scan frequency and waveform
   becomes a key factor to optimize the micromirror-based confocal
   MACROscope. When the micromirror is integrated into the MACROscope and
   works at 40 Hz, the micromirror with open-loop control possesses good
   repeatability, so that the synchronization among the scanner, XYZ-stage
   and image acquisition can be realized. A laser scanning microscope
   system based on the micromirror with 2 mu m width torsion bars was built
   and a 2D image was obtained as well. This work forms the experimental
   basis for building a practical confocal MACROscope.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate thermal modeling of the direct-chill casting process relies
   nowadays on increasingly complex boundary conditions for the secondary
   cooling zone. A two-dimensional axisymmetric finite-element model of the
   direct-chill casting process was developed to quantify the importance of
   secondary cooling at the surface compared with internal heat conduction
   within the billet. Boiling water heat transfer at the surface was found
   to dominate and be the governing factor only when stable film boiling or
   water film ejection take place; all other cases were dominated by
   internal heat conduction. The influence of various parameters (casting
   speed, cooling water flow rate, and thermophysical properties of the
   cast material) on the occurrence of water film ejection was analyzed. An
   exponential relationship was found between the cooling water flow rate
   and the minimum casting speed at which water film ejection takes place.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion of lean H(2)/air mixtures in Pt-coated microchannels is
   investigated numerically in planar geometry. Examining the relative
   importance of hydrogen oxidation in the bulk gas as compared to surface
   reactions under different operating conditions is the main focus of the
   present work. A collocated finite-volume method is used to solve the
   governing equations. Detailed gas phase and surface reaction mechanisms
   along with a multi-component species diffusion model are used. In
   microchannels, due to effective heat and radical losses to the walls,
   the combustion characteristics are greatly influenced as the channel
   size is reduced. While catalytic walls help in sustaining gas phase
   reactions in very small channels by reducing heat losses to the walls
   owing to exothermic surface reactions, they also inhibit homogeneous
   reactions by extracting radicals due to typically high absorption rates
   of such species at the walls. Thus, the radical chain mechanism can be
   significantly altered by the presence of wall reactions, and the
   build-up of radical pools in the gas phase can be suppressed as a
   consequence. In the present work the effects of three key parameters,
   the channel height, the inlet mass flux and the equivalence ratio of the
   inlet mixture on the interaction between the gas phase and surface
   reactions are explored. In each case, the limiting values beyond which
   the gas-phase reactions become negligible compared to surface reactions
   are identified for lean hydrogen/air mixtures. (C) 2011 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Among the various asset management functions that support capital
   renewal decisions, both inspection and fund-allocation are very
   challenging in terms of time, cost, and technology. To support these
   functions, this article introduces two unique techniques that can be
   implemented, individually or combined, into any asset management system:
   (1) Focused-Inspection Technique (FIT); and (2) Multiple Optimization
   and Segmentation Technique (MOST). FIT improves inspection by
   incorporating an analysis of reactive-maintenance data to predict
   components conditions, thus saving the time and cost of indiscriminate
   inspections. The MOST technique, on the other hand, has a unique
   formulation for large-scale optimization involving thousands of assets
   simultaneously, thus maximizes the return of renewal dollars. The
   article provides a description of the MOST-FIT techniques and discusses
   their implementation in a prototype system that suits a large school
   board in North America. The proposed techniques are innovative and help
   organizations with large building assets improve the overall condition
   of their inventory with highest return on the limited renewal budget.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Normal basis has been widely used for the representation of binary field
   elements mainly due to its low-cost squaring operation. Optimal normal
   basis type II is a special class of normal basis exhibiting very low
   multiplication complexity and is considered as a safe choice for
   hardware implementation of cryptographic applications. In this paper,
   high-speed architectures for binary field multiplication using reordered
   normal basis are proposed, where reordered normal basis is referred to
   as a certain permutation of optimal normal basis type II. Complexity
   comparison shows that the proposed architectures are faster compared to
   previously presented architectures in the open literature using either
   an optimal normal basis type II or a reordered normal basis. One
   advantage of the new word-level architectures is that the critical path
   delay is a constant (not a function of word size). This enables the
   multipliers to operate at very high clock rates regardless of the field
   size or the number of words. Hardware implementation of some practical
   size multipliers for elliptic curve cryptography is also included.}},

Abstract = {{The pervasive adoption of IEEE 802.11 radios in the past decade has made
   possible for the easy Internet access from a vehicle, notably drive-thru
   Internet. Originally designed for the static indoor applications, the
   throughput performance of IEEE 802.11 in the outdoor vehicular
   environment is, however, still unclear especially when a large number of
   fast-moving users transmitting simultaneously. In this paper, we
   investigate the performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF in the highly mobile
   vehicular networks. We first propose a simple yet accurate analytical
   model to evaluate the throughput of DCF in the large scale drive-thru
   Internet scenario. Our model incorporates the high-node mobility with
   the modeling of DCF and unveils the impacts of mobility (characterized
   by node velocity and moving directions) on the resultant throughput.
   Based on the model, we show that the throughput of DCF will be reduced
   with increasing node velocity due to the mismatch between the MAC and
   the transient high-throughput connectivity of vehicles. We then propose
   several enhancement schemes to adaptively adjust the MAC in tune with
   the node mobility. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the
   accuracy of the developed analytical model and the effectiveness of the
   proposed enhancement schemes.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent advent of cloud computing, the concept of outsourcing
   computations, initiated by volunteer computing efforts, is being

   also share challenges, stemming from the lack of trust between
   outsourcers and workers. In this work, we propose a unifying trust
   framework, where correct participation is financially rewarded: neither
   participant is trusted, yet outsourced computations are efficiently
   verified and validly remunerated. We propose three solutions for this
   problem, relying on an offline bank to generate and redeem payments; the
   bank is oblivious to interactions between outsourcers and workers. We
   propose several attacks that can be launched against our framework and
   study the effectiveness of our solutions. We implemented our most secure
   solution and our experiments show that it is efficient: the bank can
   perform hundreds of payment transactions per second and the overheads
   imposed on outsourcers and workers are negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Unipolar pulse electrodeposition was used to prepare nickel
   hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) films on platinum substrates with controllable
   structure. The unipolar pulse waveforms consisted of an applied cathodic
   potential during the on-period and the open-circuit potential during the
   off-period. The effects of the pulse deposition parameters on the
   electrochemical properties of NiHCF films were investigated by potential
   cycling in K+-containing electrolytes. The morphology and composition of
   NiHCF films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The charge transfer and the
   stability of the film electrodes were also examined by cyclic
   voltammetry (CV). Experimental results show that the cathodic pulse
   potential is the primary factor influencing the composition of the NiHCF
   films. The structure of NiHCF films prepared with a pulse potential of
   0.7 V SCE appears close to that of the ``insoluble{''} form with a
   single reversible CV peak at lower voltage and a unit cell with a
   stoichiometry close to KNi4II {[}Fe-III(CN)(6)](3). These films exhibit
   good stability and high dynamics for charge transport. The application
   of more negative cathodic potential pulses produces less dense and
   robust NiHCF films, with a structure closer to the ``soluble{''} form
   and an approximate stoichiometry K8Ni4II{[}Fe-II(CN)(6)](4). (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This is the second part of a two-part study on the generation of

   presented our experimental observations of droplet formation and
   decomposed the process into three sequential stages defined as the lag,
   filling, and necking stages. Here we develop a model that describes the
   performance of microfluidic T-junction generators working in the
   squeezing to transition regimes where confinement of the droplet
   dominates the formation process. The model incorporates a detailed
   geometric description of the drop shape during the formation process
   combined with a force balance and necking criteria to define the droplet
   size, production rate, and spacing. The model inherently captures the
   influence of the intersection geometry, including the channel width
   ratio and height-to-width ratio, capillary number, and flow ratio, on
   the performance of the generator. The model is validated by comparing it
   to speed videos of the formation process for several T-junction
   geometries across a range of capillary numbers and viscosity ratios.}},

Title = {{Droplet formation in microfluidic T-junction generators operating in the
   transitional regime. I. Experimental observations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1, 2}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{This is the first part of a two-part study on the generation of droplets
   at a microfluidic T-junction operating in the transition regime where
   confinement of the droplet creates a large squeezing pressure that
   influences droplet formation. In this regime, the operation of the
   T-junction depends on the geometry of the intersection (height-to-width
   ratio, inlet width ratio), capillary number, flow ratio, and viscosity
   ratio of the two phases. Here in paper I we presented our experimental
   observations through the analysis of high-speed videos of the droplet
   formation process. Various parameters are tracked during the formation
   cycle such as the shape of the droplet (penetration depth and neck),
   interdroplet spacing, production rate, and flow of both phases across
   several T-junction designs and flow conditions. Generally, the formation
   process is defined by a two-stage model consisting of an initial filling
   stage followed by a necking stage. However, video evidence suggests the
   inclusion of a third stage, which we term the lag stage, at the
   beginning of the formation process that accounts for the retraction of
   the interface back into the injection channel after detachment. Based on
   the observations made in this paper, a model is developed to describe
   the formation process in paper II, which can be used to understand the
   design and operation of T-junction generators in the transition regime.}},

Title = {{Effect of cholineacetyltransferase activity and choline recycle ratio on

   acetylcholine neurocycle and their relation to Alzheimer's and
   Parkinson's diseases}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{This paper is an extension of the previous two papers (Mustafa et al.,
   2009a, b) on the modeling, simulation and analysis of bifurcation,
   dynamics, and chaotic characteristics of the acetylcholine (ACh)
   neurocycle. The effects of cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and
   choline recycle ratio as bifurcation parameters, on the system
   performance are studied through modifying the two-compartment model. It
   is found that as ChAT activity increases, ACh concentration in the model
   compartments increases continuously. The effect of choline recycle ratio
   shows that choline uptake represents the key role for providing choline
   as a substrate for ACh synthesis. It is found that the choline recycle
   ratio has a great influence on all state variables in both compartments.
   A detailed bifurcation and sensitive analyses over a wide range of ChAT
   activity and choline recycle ratio parameters are carried out in order
   to highlight the characteristics of ACh cholinergic system like
   non-linear dynamics and different solutions such as multiplicity of:
   stationery states as well as periodic and chaotic states. The relations
   between the results and the functions of ACh cholinergic neurons are
   investigated. A comparison between the results and other experimental
   and physiological measurements is performed. It is found that there is a
   good relation between cholinergic diseases such as Alzheimer's and
   Parkinson's diseases, and level of ACh in brains from one side and
   current results extracted from the disturbances in ChAT activity and
   choline recycle from the other side. It is found that choline recycled
   is the most critical factor in ACh processes in comparison with any of
   the following parameters: ChAT activity, as well as feed acetate and ACh
   concentrations. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{SSIM-inspired image restoration using sparse representation}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Recently, sparse representation based methods have proven to be
   successful towards solving image restoration problems. The objective of
   these methods is to use sparsity prior of the underlying signal in terms
   of some dictionary and achieve optimal performance in terms of
   mean-squared error, a metric that has been widely criticized in the
   literature due to its poor performance as a visual quality predictor. In
   this work, we make one of the first attempts to employ structural
   similarity (SSIM) index, a more accurate perceptual image measure, by
   incorporating it into the framework of sparse signal representation and
   approximation. Specifically, the proposed optimization problem solves
   for coefficients with minimum L-0 norm and maximum SSIM index value.
   Furthermore, a gradient descent algorithm is developed to achieve
   SSIM-optimal compromise in combining the input and sparse dictionary
   reconstructed images. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
   method by using image denoising and super-resolution methods as
   examples. Our experimental results show that the proposed SSIM-based
   sparse representation algorithm achieves better SSIM performance and
   better visual quality than the corresponding least square-based method.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Pages = {{99-105}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Tyrosinase could have many applications including biotransformation,
   bioremediation, and in biosensors. However, its application, especially
   at industrial scale, is seriously limited by its rapid inactivation. To
   increase mushroom tyrosinase (MT) stability, the enzyme was entrapped in
   different matrixes. Then, the structural and operational stability of
   the entrapped mushroom tyrosinase (EMT) were examined in
   one-phase-binary solutions (OPBS) obtained by mixing different amounts
   (0-100\%) of water-miscible solvents such as acetonitrile and 2-propanol
   with PBS. Experiments showed MT lost all of its activity upon entrapment
   in the classical sol-gels and hybrid silica sol-gels, but could retain
   up to 25\% of its activity in cross-linked polyacrylamide (CLP). These
   studies revealed while EMT in CLP was losing about 0.06\% of its
   structural stability per hour in PBS. OPBS containing 2-propanol (50 or
   75\%) did not affect the EMT structural stability and increased its
   cresolase activity up to 1.5 fold during 50 days storage at 4 degrees C.
   The aquaphilicity of CLP helps EMT to function normally in OPBS and
   using 2-propanol (50\% or more) in such media not only stopped EMT loss
   from the sieve structure of the CLP, but it was also beneficial to the
   more hydrophobic substrates. Using tyrosine as a substrate in OPBS
   containing 2-propanol (75\%), L-DOPA production reached 4.21 +/- 0.23 mu
   M/min(-1). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-105}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behavior of a class of
   delayed neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations and
   general mixed time-delays involving both time-varying delays and
   distributed delays. Due to the presence of time-varying delays and
   distributed delays, the step-by-step construction of local solutions
   cannot be applied. This difficulty can be overcome by constructing a
   sequence of solutions to delayed dynamical systems with high-slope
   activations and show that this sequence converges to a desired Filippov
   solution of the discontinuous delayed neural networks. We then derive
   two sets of sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability
   and convergence of the neural networks, in terms of linear matrix
   inequalities (LMIs) and M-matrix properties (equivalently, some
   diagonally dominant conditions), respectively. Convergence behavior of
   both the neuron state and the neuron output are discussed. The obtained
   results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural
   networks with Lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural
   networks with discontinuous neuron activations and only constant delays.

Abstract = {{Two biocompatible and biodegradable polyampholyte microgels, namely
   chitosan-carboxymethyl cellulose (CS-CMC) and chitosan-modified methyl
   cellulose (CS-ModMC) were synthesized by an inverse microemulsion
   technique. The CS-CMC microgel system was pH-responsive while the
   CS-ModMC system possessed both pH and thermo-responsive properties. For
   CS-CMC system, the number of -OCH2COOH and -NH2 groups was determined to
   be 1.5 and 1.1 meq/g of microgel, respectively. In the pH range of 4-9,
   the zeta potential values varied from +10 to -40 mV, while the
   hydrodynamic radius varied from 160 nm in the swollen state (acidic and
   basic pH) to 110 nm in the ``collapse{''} state (neutral pH).
   Furthermore, TEM micrographs confirmed the swelling/deswelling behaviour
   of CS-CMC microgel particles at acidic, neutral and basic conditions.
   For CS-ModMC system, the number of -OCH2COOH and -NH2 groups was
   determined to be 0.8 and 0.6 meq/g microgel, respectively. In the pH
   range of 4-9, the surface charge on the microgels varied from +25 to -60
   mV and the hydrodynamic radii were 190 nm at low pH, 80 nin at neutral
   pH, to 120 nm at a high pH. In vitro drug release studies confirmed that
   CS-CMC microgels could encapsulate and release a model drug, thus they
   could potentially be used as biocompatible and biodegradable drug

   one of its reactive power generation limits, VSIs are difficult to be
   predicted. Nevertheless, assigning a general critical value to VSIs
   could be considered. Thus, this paper proposes the analysis of such
   consideration by modeling and solving a Voltage-Stability-Constrained
   OPF (VSC-OPF) problem in the context of electricity markets. The Voltage
   Stability Constraint (VSC) was implemented by means of the Minimum
   Singular Value (MSV), which is based on the Singular Value Decomposition
   (SVD) of the power flow Jacobian matrix, and the Tangent Vector Norm
   (TVN), which is based on the Tangent Vector (TV) to the bifurcation
   manifold of the power flow equations. The consideration of assigning an
   absolute critical value to these VSIs was verified with a small 6-bus
   test system. Results show that such consideration is too conservative,
   which may lead to inadequate price signals in the context of VSC-OPFs
   applied to electricity market clearing.}},

Abstract = {{Point-of-use (POU) and point-of-entry (POE) drinking water treatment
   systems are gaining prominence, particularly from the point-of-view of
   technical appropriateness and consumer acceptance. They are becoming an
   increasingly viable alternative for small water treatment systems or in
   individual homes. However, sustainability concerns have been voiced in a
   number of studies investigating these devices. In this paper,
   sustainability is examined with respect to the fulfillment of treatment
   systems for a set of technical, economic, environmental and
   socio-cultural objectives. Consequently, the use of a hierarchy of
   sustainability indicators to compare various POU and POE water treatment
   alternatives is proposed. The indicators' definitions, as well as
   calculation and normalization methods are explained. The paper also
   presents a decision model that is capable of selecting the most
   sustainable treatment option. The model employs the analytical hierarchy
   process (AHP) to help in the analysis of indicators' relative importance
   with regard to sustainability and to develop the indicators and criteria
   weights required for aggregating a sustainability score. The generated
   sustainability scores essentially level the playing field when comparing
   POU and POE systems for technical and economic appropriateness for a
   particular water treatment case, in addition to incorporating more
   difficult to quantify system traits, such as environmental and
   socio-cultural sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive scheme for localization of a target from
   distance measurements and motion control of a mobile agent to pursue
   this target. First, a robust adaptive law is designed to generate
   location estimate of the target using distance measurements. Then,
   following the standard certainty equivalence approach, a motion control
   law is developed considering substitution of the estimate generated by
   the localization algorithm for the unknown location of the target.
   Noting that there is some incompatibility between the persistence of
   excitation requirements of the localization algorithm and the target
   pursuit goal of the motion control law, the base motion control law is
   designed to eliminate the effects of this incompatibility. Stability and
   convergence analysis for the overall adaptive control scheme is
   presented. The results are valid in both two and three dimensions of
   motion space.}},

Abstract = {{We study a graph-theoretic property known as robustness, which plays a
   key role in the behavior of certain classes of dynamics on networks
   (such as resilient consensus and contagion). This property is much
   stronger than other graph properties such as connectivity and minimum
   degree, in that one can construct graphs with high connectivity and
   minimum degree but low robustness. In this paper, we investigate the
   robustness of common random graph models for complex networks
   (Erdos-Renyi, geometric random, and preferential attachment graphs). We
   show that the notions of connectivity and robustness coincide on these
   random graph models: the properties share the same threshold function in
   the Erdos-Renyi model, cannot be very different in the geometric random
   graph model, and are equivalent in the preferential attachment model.
   This indicates that a variety of purely local diffusion dynamics will be
   effective at spreading information in such networks.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation laws in nature correspond to symmetries of related physical
   systems (Noether's theorem). Conservation of momentum, for instance, can
   be interpreted by the symmetric property of a certain motion variable
   known as the cyclic variable. If a symmetry-breaking force such as a
   dissipative force or the gravitational force, is applied to the cyclic
   variable, then the momentum is not conserved any longer in general. The
   main objective of this paper is to show that there exists a particular
   type of viscous damping-like force that breaks the symmetry but induces
   a new conserved quantity in place of the original momentum map. This new
   conserved quantity can be constructed by combining the time integral of
   a force linear in velocity and the original momentum map associated with
   the symmetry. In terms of stability theory of dynamical systems, it can
   be shown that the existence of the new conserved quantity implies that
   the corresponding motion variable possesses, as we define in this paper,
   the self recovery phenomenon. More specifically, the corresponding
   motion variable will be globally attractive to the initial condition of
   the variable. We discover that what is fundamental in this self recovery
   phenomenon is not the positivity of the coefficient of the force linear
   in the velocity, but certain properties of the time integral of the
   coefficient function, which can encompass a wide range of viscous
   damping forces. The self recovery effect and theoretical discoveries are
   demonstrated by simulation results using two examples: Elroy's beanie,
   and the torque-controlled inverted pendulum on a passive cart. The
   results in this paper will be useful in designing and controlling
   mechanical systems with underactuation.}},

   faster mass flow dynamics and their stability characteristics
   independently of the slower thermal dynamics in the system. An
   electrical circuit analogy is used to obtain a linearized state-space
   representation of the mass flow dynamics for two common architectures of
   ME-VCC systems. Using concepts from decentralized control theory, we
   provide conditions under which local static feedback controllers
   stabilize the overall closed-loop system with robustness to
   uncertainties in the coupling between subsystems. Our analysis
   characterizes the beneficial impact that discharge pressure regulating
   (DPR) valves have on the decentralized controller gains.}},

Abstract = {{The design of front-end circuits that interface with the capacitive

   transmit pulser and the receive amplifier were fabricated in a

   to generate a 30V pulse with a pulse width of less than 100ns, while
   driving a 12pF load. The receive amplifier is a single-stage opamp in a
   transimpedance configuration. Experimental results of both circuits
   working with the CMUT are presented. In addition, a novel phase
   measurement receiver circuit for CMUT is also presented. The circuit
   uses phase change to monitor the change in CMUT capacitance. It offers
   several advantages over the conventional solution. A behavioral model
   was developed to simulate the performance of the new receiver circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Previously two different amorphous selenium (a-Se) photodetector designs
   were proposed for indirect conversion medical imaging using polyimide
   (PI) as blocking contacts: a lateral comb structure where a PI layer
   covers both electrodes and a vertical structure where a PI layer is
   placed between the positively biased electrode and a-Se. These detectors
   have raised interest due to their simple structure, ease of fabrication,
   very low dark current at high electric fields, and high quantum
   efficiency.
   In this study we examine the transient behavior of these detectors for
   fluoroscopic or tomographic applications. The photo response to a short
   light pulse (10-100 mu s) is examined in both structures. The presence
   of charge accumulation at the PI/a-Se interface is investigated by
   observing the photo response of consecutive light pulses under different
   electric fields. This work demonstrates the promise of low-cost a-Se
   devices for use in indirect conversion large area digital medical X-ray
   imaging applications such as real-time fluoroscopy and computed
   tomography.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of numerical simulation using the finite element method
   (FEM), extrusion plant trials and experimental characterization was used
   to study microstructure changes, specifically geometric dynamic
   recrystallization, during the hot extrusion process for an AA3003
   aluminum alloy. Extrusion plant trials were conducted at the Rio Tinto
   Alcan Research and Development facility in Jonquiere, Quebec in order to
   measure load and temperature and obtain samples for microstructure
   analysis. A 2D FEM based on the commercial code DEFORM was developed for
   the thermo-mechanical simulation of the extrusion. Load and temperature
   predictions resulting from this model agree well with the measured
   values during the pilot plat trials. Using the FEM model, it was
   estimated that near the surface of the extrudate the thickness of the
   deformed grains drops below the subgrain size which may cause the
   deformed grains to pinch-off and geometric dynamic recrystallization.
   Optical microscopy observations show that in all unrecrystallized
   extrudates there is a transition from a fibrous to a granular structure
   near the surface that suggests the occurrence of Geometric Dynamic
   Recrystallization. The effect of extrusion conditions on grain thickness
   distribution was investigated using the FEM model.}},

Abstract = {{Using a rate dependent Taylor type crystal plasticity formulation, the
   limitations of Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) approach to numerically
   simulate the Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs) were studied. Three uniaxial
   stress-strain curves with three different post-necking hardening
   behaviors were generated using crystal plasticity formulation. These
   curves were constructed based on the real tension test data available
   for AA5754 aluminum. In the first one the true stress strain curve
   continued as saturated after the necking and in the other two the
   post-necking hardening behaviors experienced slopes larger than zero.
   The result showed that the stress-strain curves dictated different
   imperfections for the localized necking hence the FLDs generated by them
   were different. The predicted FLD resulted from the saturated hardening
   behavior was closer to the experimental data in the biaxial region.}},

Abstract = {{The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) associated with primary cooling
   during direct-chill casting of AA6111 aluminum alloy was investigated by
   conducting casting experiments with an instrumented mould. Mould

   heat flux between the ingot and the mould. Heat transfer coefficient
   profiles versus vertical position within the mould were obtained for
   casting speeds of 1.39 and 1.83 mm/s. Relatively low HTC values of 93 to
   576 W/m(2).K were attributed to the formation of an air gap between the
   ingot surface and the mould. The experimental heat transfer coefficients
   were compared to theoretical values predicted using a 3-dimensional CFD
   model of direct-chill casting with a simple one-dimensional
   density-based model of shell deformation, which calculates the air gap

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel mechanism to control and manipulate gain and
   beam direction of a microstrip patch antenna by partially covering it
   with a high refractive index superstrate. It has been shown by full-wave
   electromagnetic simulations that the main beam of the antenna can be
   tilted in a desired direction by placing the high dielectric superstrate
   at specified locations. To understand the beam deflection mechanism, the
   microstrip patch can be replaced by four magnetic current sources and
   plane-wave approximations can be applied. The beam deflection takes
   place as a result of phase imbalance between the electromagnetic
   radiations emitted from the four magnetic sources. By covering a quarter
   of the patch ( half of the radiation slot), the patch beam can be
   deflected in both E and H planes. Traditionally, the beam tilts are
   obtained by using phased arrays consisting of multiple antenna elements.
   This method is interesting in the sense that only one microstrip patch
   is used. Furthermore, the phase shifting networks are replaced by the
   superstrate cover.}},

   issues for e-healthcare applications in wireless body area networks. In
   this paper, we investigate the data transmission scheduling problem to
   utilize the sleep and opportunistic transmission for energy efficiency,
   while guaranteeing the worst-case delay for medical data transmission.
   To achieve sensor energy saving by exploiting propagation channel
   quality with a deterministic delay requirement poses challenges in
   developing a scheduling policy. We address this problem using a Lyapunov
   optimization formulation and propose a two-step scheduling algorithm. We
   prove that the algorithm can provide worst-case delay guarantee under
   certain conditions. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are
   presented to demonstrate the tradeoff between the transmission delay and

   Location Privacy-preserving (VSLP) packet forwarding protocol to improve
   the packet forwarding efficiency and at the same time protect receiver's
   location privacy. In VSLP, we first identify the social spot locations
   according to the user mobility information, and then build a Voronoi
   diagram based on the defined social spots. On the edge of Delaunay
   triangulation over the Voronoi diagram, we deploy multiple storage
   devices to help receivers to temporarily store the packets. With the
   security analysis, we show that the location privacy can be achieved.
   Using extensive simulations, we show that VSLP can enhance the packet
   forwarding efficiency with improved packet delivery ratio and reduced

   mobility (NEMO) protocol in order to support mobile network nodes (MNNs)

   certificate-less public key cryptography, a link-layer authentication
   and key agreement scheme, CL-AKA, is proposed. CL-AKA achieves mutual
   authentication between an MNN and a mobile router (MR) as well as
   creates a secure shared key between them. Unlike existing Wi-Fi security
   schemes, CL-AKA uses only one certificate verification to verify an MR
   to an MNN while implicitly verifying this MNN to the MR. Therefore, the
   proposed CL-AKA scheme has 23.76\% less computation overhead than that
   by EAP-based WPA2 protocol, less communication overhead than that by
   captive portal, and higher security level than that by dummy
   authentication scheme. In addition, performance evaluations demonstrate
   that CL-AKA consumes low energy, which makes it more appropriate for
   implementing in less-energy mobile handhelds such as PDAs and cell

Abstract = {{Active interference cancellation (AIC) is known to be a very effective
   technique for reducing the interference of OFDM sidelobes to primary
   licensed users in cognitive OFDM systems. However, AIC has some
   shortcomings such as high computational complexity and spectrum
   overshoot on the cancellation subcarriers. Spectrum overshoot is mainly
   caused due to unconstrained or unbalanced power allocation to the
   cancellation tones used in AIC. In this paper, we propose an improved
   AIC technique in which the problem of spectrum overshoot is tackled. We
   show that by a modification to the solution of the optimization problem
   involved in AIC, we can obtain a trade-off between the amount of
   spectrum overshoot and sidelobe suppression without increasing the
   system complexity. In particular, spectrum overshoot can be completely
   eliminated. Furthermore, simulations prove that with this modification,
   the peak spectral interference at the primary band is less than that of
   the AIC technique with a single power constraint.}},

   question whether additional spatial diversity or advanced receiver
   design at UE-2 is feasible for mitigating this interference. We
   investigate both the options and show that the rate of UE-2 gets
   significantly improved in both cases however hardware and RF design
   constraints may make the advanced receiver design solution preferable
   over spatial diversity solution.}},

Abstract = {{Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications is a promising technology to
   provide high data rates (multiGigabit) for indoor multimedia
   applications. However, indoor mmWave links are highly susceptible to
   blockage because of the limited ability to diffract around obstacles
   such as the human body and furniture. In order to realize high-rate
   reliable transmission, cooperative communication is utilized to tackle
   with the scenarios where LOS link of source node and destination node is
   blocked. Specifically, with directional antenna, we first select the
   node in the feasible region with best achievable rate of cooperative
   communication as the cooperative relay. Then, cooperative concurrent
   transmission scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem to
   maximize the transmission efficiency. A flip-based heuristic scheduling
   algorithm is proposed to obtain the real-time solution. Extensive
   simulations demonstrate that the proposed cooperative concurrent
   transmission scheduling (CCTS) scheme can significantly increase the
   transmission throughput and utilize network resource efficiently while
   maintaining network connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the impact of cooperative relaying used to create virtual
   multipoint-to-point links (as opposed to conventional multihop relaying)
   on the throughput optimal configuration of a wireless network. We
   achieve this by formulating a cross-layer framework for a joint routing
   and scheduling problem with cooperative relaying. We consider a general
   case, where cooperation is allowed between any pair of nodes in a given
   network. We optimally solve this formulation for max-min throughput in
   mesh-like networks of medium size and quantify gains for key performance
   metrics. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, cooperative
   relaying provides performance gains in a mid-size network surprisingly
   rarely. Moreover, if gains can be obtained, these gains are typically
   only marginal. We quantify these gains and provide engineering insights
   based on numerical results for 200 random realizations of a network with

Abstract = {{Multi-packet reception (MPR), in which a receiver can decode multiple
   simultaneous transmissions, significantly improves the uplink throughput
   of wireless local area networks (WLANs). However, the medium access
   control (MAC) layer must be redesigned to encourage, and not avoid,
   simultaneous transmissions. Asynchronous MPR MAC protocols, in which
   nodes independently access the channel so long as the number of ongoing
   transmissions is less than a threshold, are promising solutions for
   enabling MPR in IEEE 802.11-based WLANs. In this paper, we highlight the
   problem of acknowledgment (ACK) delays that arises in asynchronous MPR
   when multiple nodes transmit in succession without the channel becoming
   idle. We propose a novel asynchronous MAC protocol that reduces the ACK
   delays, increases throughput, and retains the distributed nature of the
   802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF). An accurate renewal
   theoretic fixed-point analysis that leads to general analytical
   expressions for the saturation throughput is also developed.}},

Abstract = {{For the future smart grid, decentralized inverter control is essential
   in distributed generation (DG) microgrids where a powerful central
   controller is unavailable for cost and reliability concerns. However,
   decentralized inverter control suffers from a limited system stability
   mainly because of the lack of communications among different inverters.
   In this paper, we investigate the stability enhancement of the droop
   based decentralized inverter control in microgrids. Specifically, we
   propose a power sharing based control strategy which incorporates the
   information provided by a wireless network to improve system stability.
   The wireless network is used to acquire the total real and reactive
   power generation of all DG units in a decentralized manner. Based on the
   desired power sharing of each DG unit and the acquired information of
   total generation, additional control terms are added to the traditional
   droop controller. We evaluate the performance of our proposed control
   strategy based on small-signal stability analysis. Extensive numerical
   results are presented to demonstrate the system stability.}},

Abstract = {{The paradigm of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) emerges as a
   promising approach to provide road safety, vehicle traffic management,
   and infotainment applications. Thus, it is important to develop a VANET
   medium access control (MAC) protocol that provides an efficient and
   reliable delivery of packets for diverse applications. Cooperative
   communication, on the other hand, can enhance the reliability of
   communication links in VANETs, thus mitigating wireless channel
   impairments due to a poor channel condition. Recently, a cooperative
   scheme for MAC in VANETs based on time-division multiple access,
   referred to as Cooperative ADHOC MAC (CAH-MAC), has been proposed {[}1].
   CAH-MAC is an efficient protocol capable of increasing the network
   throughput by reducing the wastage of time slots. In CAH-MAC,
   neighboring nodes cooperate by utilizing the unreserved time slots, for
   retransmission of a packet which failed to reach its target receiver due
   to a poor channel condition. In this paper, we study the reliability of
   CAH-MAC in terms of packet transmission delay (PTD) and packet dropping
   rate (PDR). Through mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we
   show that CAH-MAC provides reliable communication by decreasing the PTD
   and PDR as compared with existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular communications networks and the 802.11p/WAVE technology have
   become a fundamental platform for providing real-time access to safety
   and entertainment information in vehicular scenarios. In particular,
   IP-based infotainment applications are key to leverage the deployment
   costs of the 802.11p/WAVE network. However, the operation of IP in the
   standard 802.11p/WAVE and its throughput performance are still unclear,
   as the standard recommendations for the operation of IPv6 over WAVE are
   rather minimal. Consequently, this paper focuses on the provision of
   infrastructure-based IP communications in 802.11p/WAVE networks, and
   proposes the Vehicular IP in WAVE (VIP-WAVE) framework, which defines a
   new per-user assignment and mobility management of IPv6 addresses
   supported by Proxy Mobile IPv6 over WAVE, and exploits relay-aided
   communications to improve the network performance along roads with
   different levels of infrastructure presence. Extensive simulations are

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as a promising solution to
   spectrum under-utilization and congestion. Supporting quality of service
   (QoS)-aware services over CRNs is always challenging due to the random
   spectrum availability. In this work, we consider a single channel CRN
   with centralized control, operating over a time-slotted primary network,
   accessing the channel at the spectrum holes without interfering with
   primary users. The central controller transmits elastic data traffic to
   the secondary users (SUs). The service response time is an important QoS
   parameter for elastic data traffic, defined as the duration from the
   instant that an SU requests a data file from the central controller
   until it completes the reception. We analyze the response time under the
   shortest processing time (SPT) first service discipline, and compare it
   with the processor sharing (PS) service discipline. We show that the SPT
   service discipline outperforms the PS service discipline in medium and
   heavy traffic load conditions. The response time analysis can be used
   for call admission control to ensure service satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{Sufficient and necessary conditions for reliable lossless communication
   of two correlated sources over cIasses of phase asynchronous cognitive
   interference channels are derived. Namely, we consider interference
   channels in which one of the encoders, i.e., the secondary or cognitive
   user, is causally or non-causally aware of the other's message.
   Moreover, as a practical constraint, we assume the transmitters are not
   aware of the phase shirts introduced by channels. We show that, for both
   cIasses of causal and noncausal cooperation, under strong interference
   conditions, separate source and channel coding is optimal for reliable
   communication of both users. Also, we derive necessary and sufficient
   conditions for reliable communication of the cognitive radio
   transmission while the primary is able to maintain the same information
   rate it could reliably send in the absence of the secondary. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first work to find fundamental limits of

   stations, and interference from neighboring cells. Fractional Frequency
   Reuse (FFR) is a technique to counteract these effects. Typically, the
   proposed FFR technique partitions a cell into a reuse 1 area, centered
   near the base-station and a reuse 3 area, located near the edges of the
   cell, with reuse 3 regions scheduled to minimize interference from
   neighboring cells. Unfortunately, virtually all analysis of FFR has been
   done under a perfect hexagonal lattice cellular grid, while no practical
   deployment has this degree of symmetry. In this paper we revisit the
   analysis of FFR for non-ideal cellular grids for cases with fading. We
   find that while for some non-ideal grids, a combination of reuse 1 and 3
   is indeed optimal, for many others a combination of reuse 1 and 4
   provide better performance. Thus, we conclude that for practical
   cellular layouts, the optimal re-use pattern for the edge of the cells
   is not necessarily 3 as commonly assumed, but is topology dependent.}},

Abstract = {{This research is motivated by the need for control of flexural
   vibrations of lightweight plates. It addresses application of the level
   set method in optimal control of vibrations in plate-like structures.
   One of the most commonly practiced methods in control of vibration is to
   apply constrained layer damping patches to the surface of a structure.
   In order to consider the weight efficiency of the structure, the best
   shape and locations of the patches should be determined to achieve the
   optimum vibration suppression with lowest amount of damping patch. A
   novel topology optimization approach is proposed that is capable of
   finding the optimum shape and locations of the patches simultaneously. A
   2D cantilever plate, undergoing flexural vibrations, will be considered.
   The optimal damping set will be found in the structure, such that the
   lowest modal energy in the fundamental vibration mode of the system is
   achieved. The proposed level set topology optimization method shows
   capability of determining the optimum damping set in structures
   accurately.}},

   magnesium alloy in the roll bite. An important parameter in controlling
   the TRC process is the set-back distance; the distance between the
   nozzle entry to the kissing point of the rolls. There are two approaches
   to increase the set-back: 1) increasing the entry thickness and 2)
   decreasing the final strip thickness. In this study the effect of
   set-back distance and casting speed on the thermo-mechanical behavior of
   the strip during TRC has been studied. The thermo-mechanical behavior of
   the strip has a significant effect on the final quality as defect

Abstract = {{A low aspect ratio dual-step cylinder is comprised of two cylinders of
   different diameters (D and d). The large diameter cylinder (D) with low
   aspect ratio (L/D) is attached to the mid-span of a small diameter
   cylinder (d). This geometry is relevant to many engineering
   applications, e.g., finned-tube heat exchangers, underwater cables, and
   cylindrical support structures. The present study investigates the
   effect of Reynolds number (Re-D) and L/D on dual step cylinder wake
   development for 1050 <= Re-D <= 2100, D/d = 2, and 0.2 <= L/D <= 3.
   Experiments have been performed in a water flume facility utilizing flow
   visualization, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), and Particle Image
   Velocimetry (PIV). The results show that vortex shedding occurs from the
   large and small diameter cylinders at distinct frequencies for L/D >= 1
   \& Re-D = 2100 and L/D >= 2 \& Re-D = 1050. At these higher aspect
   ratios investigated, large cylinder vortices predominantly form closed
   vortex loops in the wake and small cylinder vortices form half-loop
   vortex connections. In contrast, at lower aspect ratios, vortex shedding
   from the large cylinder ceases, with the dominant frequency
   centred-activity in the large cylinder wake attributed to the passage of
   vortex filaments connecting small cylinder vortices. The presence of the
   large cylinder distorts the vortex filaments causing cyclic vortex
   dislocations accompanied by the formation of half-loop vortex
   connections. Increasing LID decreases the frequency of occurrence of
   vortex dislocations and increases the dominant frequency in the large
   cylinder wake. The results also show that the Reynolds number has a
   substantial effect on wake vortex shedding frequency, which is more
   profound than that expected for a uniform cylinder.}},

   electrostatic actuation methods fail to drive an electrostatic actuator
   beyond its pull-in point. Although the resonant drive circuit is able to
   extend the operation range of an electrostatic actuator further at a
   much lower input voltage, an electrostatic actuator coupled with the
   resonant drive circuit also undergoes pull-in in the presence of high
   parasitic capacitance compared to the circuit's quality factor. To
   improve its robustness to high parasitic capacitance, we design a
   variable gain amplifier that reduces voltage gain as an electrostatic
   actuator moves towards its bottom electrode: the increase in the
   impedance of the resonant drive circuit reduces voltage gain of a
   variable gain amplifier through its positive feedback loop, while its
   negative feedback stabilizes its operation.}},

Abstract = {{In multiangle elastic light scattering (MAELS) experiments, the
   morphology of aerosolized particles is inferred by shining collimated
   radiation through the aerosol and then measuring the scattered light
   intensity over a set of angles. In the case of soot-laden aerosols MAELS
   can be used to recover, among other things, the size distribution of
   soot aggregates. This involves solving an ill-posed set of equations,
   however. While previous work focused on regularizing the inverse problem
   using Bayesian priors, this paper presents a design-ofexperiment
   methodology for identifying the set of measurement angles that minimizes
   its ill-posedness. The inverse problem produced by the optimal angle set
   requires less regularization and is less sensitive to noise, compared
   with two other measurement angle sets commonly used to carry out MAELS
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Hot forming die quenching (HFDQ) is an emerging process in which sheet
   metal is successively stamped at high temperature and quenched by the
   cold tool. The microstructure and mechanical properties of ultra high
   strength steel parts formed by the HFDQ process are a function of the
   cooling rate achieved during the quenching step. Optimal energy
   absorption for crash performance can be obtained by a local reduction of
   the cooling rate in order to form softer, more ductile phases such as
   bainite. Accurate characterization of the heat transfer coefficient
   (HTC) between the sheet metal and the cold tool is required to evaluate
   the cooling rate and the resulting mechanical properties. Experiments
   were conducted in which Usibor 1500P (R) boron steel blanks were
   austenitized at 900 degrees C then quenched by stamping between flat
   tool steel dies. The HTC was calculated using an inverse heat conduction
   analysis for the die and a lumped capacitance approach for the blank.
   The heat transfer coefficients measured during the approach phase were
   found to be significantly, lower than the values predicted by
   semi-empirical models based on thermal conduction through the air gap.}},

Abstract = {{Sizing aerosolized nanoparticles through time-resolved laser-induced
   incandescence (TiRe-LII) requires an accurate model of the heat
   conduction from the laser-energized particle to the surrounding gas.
   Under transition regime conditions this is often done using Fuchs'
   boundary-sphere method, which requires the analyst to specify the
   thickness of a collisionless layer surrounding the particle,
   representing the Knudsen layer. Traditionally the boundary layer
   thickness is set to the mean free path of the gas at the boundary
   temperature, but recently some TiRe-LII practitioners have adopted a
   more complex treatment that accounts for particle curvature and
   directional distribution of gas molecules. This paper presents a
   critical reassessment of this approach; while this modification is more
   representative of the true Knudsen layer thickness, it does not improve
   the accuracy of heat conduction rates estimated using Fuchs' boundary
   sphere methods under conditions prevailing in most TiRe-LII experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Vital components of inflatable antenna structures in light-weight
   satellites, Kapton (c) membranes, are prone to wrinkling due to high
   thermal gradients experienced in space; resulting in a decrease in
   performance. Simple, robust and compact actuators are required for
   automated removal of localized wrinkling in these membranes. Leveraging
   the large force and small displacement of Macro-Fibre Composites (MFCs)
   by mimicking the mechanics of the ciliary muscle in the human optical
   system, an actuator was designed and experimentally tested in the
   control of localized wrinkling of Kapton (c) in tension. Three
   configurations were built and tested utilizing M-5887-P1 MFC units. The
   force-displacement relationships were determined through testing. The
   control logic and circuit were developed. The actuator proved successful
   in local membrane wrinkling experiments. It was shown that by leveraging
   the high force and low displacement of MFCs a reliable actuator can be
   developed to effectively eliminate localized wrinkles in Kapton (c)

Abstract = {{Vibration energy harvesting devices have been widely used to power many
   electronic self-sustainable devices. Most traditional linear energy
   harvesters exploit the phenomenon of resonance to produce electric
   power. Nonlinear energy harvesters however present more interesting
   alternatives and have demonstrated capabilities to harvest power over a
   wider range of frequencies due to characteristics such as bifurcation.
   The aim of this study is to introduce an alternative design to nonlinear
   electromagnetic energy harvesting devices to improve the power
   production of the unit. The configuration presented in the current work
   has more degrees of freedom compared to some previously designed
   devices, and has demonstrated higher power efficiency over a wider range
   of frequencies. The power outputs for both previous and current designs
   are compared and validated against their experimental values. Finally,
   the validated numerical model is used to find the optimal design to
   produce the maximum power.}},

Abstract = {{While time-resolved laser-induced incandescence is most often used to
   characterize the size and concentration of aerosolized carbonaceous
   particles, it has recently been applied to aerosols containing metal
   nanoparticles. This calculation requires the thermal accommodation
   coefficient, however, which is often difficult to determine
   experimentally. This paper presents a molecular dynamics investigation
   of the thermal accommodation coefficient between laser-energized nickel
   nanoparticles immersed in argon, and the underlying the gas-surface
   scattering physics. The predicted interaction between gas molecules and
   the laser-energized surface depends strongly on the potential between
   the gas molecule and a surface atom: a Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential
   derived using the Lorentz-Berthelot combination rules overestimates the
   potential well due to a bond-order effect in the nickel, resulting in
   strong trapping-desorption and near-perfect thermal accommodation. A
   Morse potential with parameters obtained directly from ab initio free
   energies predicts a relatively brief interaction between the gas
   molecule and nickel surface, on the other hand, and a lower thermal
   accommodation coefficient similar to experimentally-derived values for
   laser-energized iron nanoparticles in argon reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamics of a micro-machined structure with three
   parallel cantilevers is investigated. The cantilevers are electrically
   charged and apply electrostatic force to each other. The governing
   equations of motion are derived using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and
   considering structural modal damping. The stability condition of the
   beams for various electric charges is also studied. In addition, the
   equations of motion are integrated to obtain the response of the beams
   in time-domain for a range of initial conditions. This response is used
   to study the behavior of the beams at the stability margin. The end
   application of the structure under investigation is in the device
   characterization. The dynamic stability condition and time-domain
   responses are used to investigate the reliability of the
   characterization. Once translated back to physical quantities, these
   results can be used for improving the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic actuation has opened a new horizon in biological/biomedical
   applications. A novel magnetic actuation platform has been developed at
   Maglev Microrobotics Laboratory, University of Waterloo. In the previous

   This technique can be used only in transparent environment. In this
   paper, for applications in an enclosed environment, which may not be
   transparent, a novel position estimation method was proposed. The
   proposed method uses hall sensors, mounted on the disk pole-piece. The
   hall sensors' optimal installation position has been investigated, and a
   function which relates hall sensors' output and the position of robot
   was derived. Based on this function, position control of horizontal axis
   using hall sensors in place of laser sensor can be achieved. Usability
   of two dimensional controls in horizontal axis without laser sensors
   will be experimentally validated as future work of this research.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum sharing is a promising approach to reusing the
   underutilized radio spectrum in a cognitive radio system (CRS).
   Potential available spectrum for CRS can be from multiple primary radio
   systems (PRSs) with different spectrum prices, and secondary users (SUs)
   with heterogenous usage modes, interference punishments and service
   types. Choosing which primary network to access for SU brings the
   network selection problem. This scenario generates new opportunities for
   CRS to improve the system performance by exploiting heterogenous
   characteristics of PRSs. In this paper, we first use continuous time
   Markov chain (CTMC) model to describe the network selection problem and
   derive the performance metrics. Then we intuitively propose Random and
   Greedy network selection strategies under this framework. Motivated by
   the drawbacks of those strategies, we categorize the service types of SU
   into Real-Time Services (RTS) and Non-Real-Time Services (NRTS) and
   propose an optimal network selection algorithm to maximize performance
   metrics based on policy iterations. Lastly, the performance of the
   proposed designs is compared and evaluated through simulation and
   numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{In CANDU reactors, the feeder pipe system supplies the primary coolant
   from the reactor core to steam generator. The flow-accelerated corrosion
   (FAC) of the extrados of the first bend of the outlet feeder is a life
   limiting factor. Therefore, accurate prediction of FAC rate is needed to
   determine the scope of inspection and replacement of feeder pipes during
   an outage. To estimate the FAC rate, the initial wall thickness of the
   extrados of the bend is required. However, initial wall thickness is not
   known precisely, because the bending of pipe during installation causes
   the thinning of extrados section. Another difficult is the sizing error
   or noise in the wall thickness measurements introduced by the inspection
   probes.
   The objective of this paper is to develop a sound probabilistic method
   for the FAC rate estimation considering uncertainties in the initial
   wall thickness of bend and the sizing error (or noise). A Bayesian model
   is developed and applied to predict the end of life of the outlet bend
   on a risk-informed basis. A practical case study is presented to
   illustrate the use of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a task based pose optimization method for modular mobile
   manipulators. The modular mobile manipulators are designed and
   prototyped by researchers at University of Waterloo. The intended
   application of the modular mobile manipulator is to assist urban search
   and rescue in unstructured environments. A single mobile manipulator
   with limited capability cannot achieve complex tasks in this
   application. When several modular mobile manipulators are linked to one
   another, they can perform complex tasks through decentralized
   collaboration. The focus of this research is to develop and simulate a
   task based pose optimization algorithm for several mobile robots linked
   by dexterous arms. A genetic algorithm is a bio-inspired optimization
   technique that mimics the process of evolution. In nature, many living
   organisms, such as ants and birds use genetic algorithms to forge for
   food and achieve complex tasks. The advantages of the genetic algorithm
   are its simplicity and effectiveness. The proposed genetic algorithm in
   this research optimizes the manipulability measure of the onboard
   mechanical manipulator arms. To verify the proposed task based pose
   optimization algorithm, a formation of three mobile manipulators
   serially connected through their onboard mechanical manipulators is
   considered in this research. The control architecture is organized into
   a three level hierarchy. On the top level, a human operator sends
   guiding commands to the lead module in the formation through a wireless
   communication channel. The median level control aims at optimizing the
   manipulator pose. The base level control is established with the
   input-output linearization. To add realistic considerations into the
   simulation environment, fractal terrains are generated with the popular
   Diamond-Square algorithm. The inclination angle of each mobile
   manipulator on the terrain is estimated through a four-point
   terrain-matching algorithm. The simulation is completed in MATLAB.
   Repetitive simulations are pursued in this research to confirm the
   simplicity and effectiveness of our approach to control machines that
   interact with the natural environment. The simulation program
   established in this research serves as a test environment for the task
   based pose optimization of modular mobile manipulators. The major
   contributions of this research are the optimization algorithm and the
   novel hardware design for the specified tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed pressure is the most common flow boundary condition used in
   micro channel flow simulations. In the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
   (DSMC) method, boundary pressure is controlled by the number flux of the
   simulating molecules which enter the domain through the boundary. This
   number flux, in the conventional DSMC algorithm, is calculated
   iteratively using sampled values of velocity and number density and an
   expression derived from the Maxwell distribution function. This
   procedure does not work well for low speed flows where the role of the
   molecules entering from the flow boundaries becomes important. The
   statistical scatter of the DSMC results is generally known to be the
   main reason; however, the Maxwell distribution used in the pressure
   boundary treatment is valid just for equilibrium conditions.
   Accordingly, current implementations of the DSMC pressure boundary
   treatment are limited to boundaries with sufficiently small variations
   of flow variables. This is not, however, the case for many practical
   cases in which high gradients of the flow variables close to the
   boundaries lead to considerable non-equilibrium effects. In this study,
   therefore, an expression for the inward number flux of species is
   derived using the Chapman-Enskog velocity distribution to improve the
   pressure boundary condition in dealing with gradients of the flow
   properties close to the boundary. The resulting algorithm is then used
   for modeling a micro-channel binary gas mixture flow with prescribed
   pressure boundary conditions. The results are compared to those obtained
   from the conventional DSMC simulations using the Maxwell distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Being the only imaging modality capable of delineating the anatomical
   structure of the white matter, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
   (dMRI) is currently believed to provide a long-awaited means for early
   diagnosis of various neurological conditions as well as for
   interrogating the brain connectivity. Despite substantial advances in
   practical use of dMRI, a solid mathematical platform for modelling and
   treating dMRI signals still seems to be missing. Accordingly, in this
   paper, we show how a Hilbert space of L-2 -valued mappings u : X -> L-2
   (S-2), with X being a subset of R-3 and L-2 (S-2) being the set of
   squared-integrable functions supported on the unit sphere S-2, provides
   a natural setting for a specific example of dMRI, known as high-angular
   resolution diffusion imaging. The proposed formalism is also shown to
   provide a basis for image processing schemes such as total variation
   minimization. Finally, we discuss a way to amalgamate the proposed
   models with the tools of compressed sensing to achieve a
   close-to-perfect recovery of diffusion signals from a minimal number of
   their discrete measurements. The main outcomes of this paper are
   supported by a series of experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Medical imaging devices often capture the raw data with high precision,
   producing high dynamic range (HDR) images. To visualize HDR images on
   regular displays, there has been an increasing number of tone mapping
   algorithms developed in recent years that convert HDR to low dynamic
   range (LDR) images. To visualize HDR medical images, a so-called
   ``windowing{''} procedure is typically employed by which the structural
   details within the intensity region of interest is mapped to the dynamic
   range of regular displays. Linear mapping is the most straightforward
   windowing operator, but may not be the optimal mapping function in terms
   of structure preserving. Here we propose a framework to adaptively find
   the optimal windowing function for different images. Specifically, a
   recently developed structural fidelity measure for tone mapped images is
   employed to adaptively optimize the windowing function, so as to achieve
   the best structural fidelity with respect to the original HDR image.
   Experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
   adaptive windowing method.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloys such as Nitinol, which is a group of NiTi alloys
   composed of nearly equiatomic nickel and titanium, finds increasing
   applications in many industries because of its unique properties
   including the shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity. In past work
   simple linear actuators have been developed using Nitinol wire which are
   actuated and controlled using resistive heating. However, traditional
   Nitinol materials are batch processed and a monolithic component only
   possesses a single set of transformation temperatures, limiting the
   functionality of the actuator. In this work a linear actuator processed
   using the novel multiple memory material processing technology is
   presented showing multiple transformations and dynamic actuation by
   resistive heating. This dynamically controlled actuation greatly
   improves the functionality of the Nitinol actuator allowing for the
   realization of new applications and improved control methods. The
   different transformation temperatures embedded in the monolithic wire
   actuator following processing are identified using thermo-analytical
   analysis and the dynamic application of load and displacement are
   presented using a custom test set-up.}},

Abstract = {{Effective and efficient objective video quality assessment (VQA) methods
   are highly desirable in modern visual communication systems for
   performance evaluation, quality control and resource allocation
   purposes. Simple VQA algorithms may be developed by direct extensions of
   still image quality assessment (IQA) approaches on a frame-by-frame
   basis. Advanced VQA methods take into account the temporal correlation
   and motion information contained in video signals but often lead to
   significantly increased computational complexity. Here we use a
   different approach to examine a video signal by considering it as a
   three-dimensional (3D) volume image. Specifically, we propose a 3D
   structural similarity (3D-SSIM) approach, which first creates a 3D
   quality map by applying SSIM evaluations within local 3D blocks, and
   then use local information content and local distortion based weighting
   methods to pool the quality map into a single quality measure. The
   resulting 3D-SSIM algorithm is computationally efficient and
   demonstrates highly competitive performance in comparison with
   state-of-the-art VQA algorithms when tested using four publicly
   available video quality databases(1).}},
