Abstract = {{Context: Service availability is an important quality factor that
   distinguishes between providers. High availability is achieved when the
   service is available at least 99.999\% of the time. The Service
   Availability Forum has defined several middleware services, among them
   the Availability Management Framework (AMF) aims at ensuring the high
   availability of services provided by applications under its control. AMF
   requires a configuration. The design of an AMF configuration is complex
   and error prone. For improving the quality of such configurations, an
   automated generation technique has been proposed in the literature.
   However, this technique may generate several configurations among which
   some may not meet the required level of availability. Therefore, the
   generated configurations are evaluated using availability analysis tools
   to select an appropriate one for deployment.
   Objective: Instead of generating configurations, analyze them and select
   one that meets the required level of availability if any, we target
   directly configurations that are estimated to satisfy the required level
   of availability.
   Method: We investigated the different aspects/attributes of an AMF
   configuration that may affect service recovery when a failure happens to
   come up with configuration design patterns and integrate them into an
   enhanced configuration generation technique.
   Results: A set of configuration design patterns and two lightweight
   methods for availability estimation have been defined. These
   configuration design patterns and analysis methods are embedded into an
   enhanced configuration generation technique to target only the
   configurations that are estimated to satisfy the required level of
   availability or the configuration that is the closest to the required
   level of availability when it is not possible to meet the requirements.
   Conclusion: We conclude it is possible to target directly the best
   configurations in terms of estimated availability using configuration
   design patterns and estimation methods. The enhanced configuration
   generation technique is less resource and time consuming than related
   approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The undesirable properties of natural rubber (NR) can be improved via
   hydrogenation and graft copolymerization. Hydrogenated NR (HNR) latex
   was prepared via diimide reduction and then grafted with styrene (ST) or
   ST/methyl methacrylate (MMA) to form poly(ST)-graft-HNR (poly(ST)-g-HNR,
   GHNRS) or poly(ST-co-MMA)-g-HNR (GHNRSM), respectively. For the grafting
   of ST monomer onto HNR particles, the \%monomer conversion and
   \%grafting efficiency (\%GE) were monitored as functions of
   \%hydrogenation, monomer and initiator concentrations, temperature, and
   time. Under the optimum condition (HNR with 54.3\% hydrogenation; 100
   phr of ST, 1 phr of initiator at 50 degrees C for 8 h), maximum
   \%conversion and \%GE of 44.6\% and 36.9\%, respectively, were achieved.
   Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the HNR grafted with ST or
   ST/MMA had higher decomposition temperature than an ungrafted one. When
   these graft products were blended at 10\% (w/w) with
   acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resin, the GHNRS/ABS and
   GHNRSM/ABS composites exhibited the higher flexural strength and heat
   aging tolerance compared to the ungrafted HNR/ABS composite. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) also showed the higher degree of homogeneity
   at the fractural surface, supporting the higher compatibility between
   the ABS and the GHNRS or GHNRSM phases in the blends. (C) 2014 Society

Title = {{CIT: A credit-based incentive tariff scheme with fraud-traceability for

Abstract = {{The growing peak-hour power demand has invoked an urgency to increase
   the peak-hour supply. Although smart grid has been envisioned as the
   next generation power system due to its two-way communication of
   information and power, the peak-hour power shortage problem still
   exists. In this paper, we propose a credit-based incentive tariff (CIT)
   scheme with fraud-traceability for smart grid. Specifically, the CIT
   encourages retail customers to sell the power generated by their
   renewable resources back to the grid during peak hours via giving
   additional incentive rate to them based on their credits. If a fraud is
   detected during the power transaction, the malicious customer's identity
   can be traced out and his or her credit can be correspondingly reduced.
   The security analysis shows that the CIT resists various security
   threats and makes the incentive tariff fair and more secure. The
   performance evaluation demonstrates that the CIT can dramatically
   increase the peak-hour supply and reduce the peak-to-average power
   demand ratio by up to 7\%. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research is to enhance the physical and
   morphological properties of coarse recycled concrete aggregate (CRCA) by
   combining different types of treatment methods. Heat treatments included
   various temperatures (250 degrees C, 350 degrees C, 500 degrees C and
   750 degrees C). Presoaking method involved the use of strong acid HCl
   and weak acid C2H4O2, whereas short mechanical treatment included the
   utilization of a Micro-Deval device. In order to investigate the surface
   morphology and chemical composition for both treated and untreated CRCA,
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyzer
   (EDAX) analyses were also conducted. The obtained results indicated that
   the combination of heat treatment at 350 degrees C and short mechanical
   treatment led the best performance for enhancing physical properties,
   with more than 27\% lowering of water absorption. The use of weak acid
   treatment is an effective, safe and more preferable may than strong
   acid. Heat treatment appears to have negative effects when used at
   higher temperatures (500 degrees C and 750 degrees C). A large
   microstructure enhancement was obtained that particularly includes
   increased density, increased surface homogeneity and a reduced Ca/Si
   ratio. Physical properties of CRCA including porosity and water
   absorption are strongly related to the durability characteristics in
   terms of resistance to freezing and thawing and resistance to abrasion
   loss under impact of heat treatment. Mineralogical characteristics in
   terms of Ca/Si ratio are strongly correlated with durable and mechanical
   properties including abrasion loss and adhered mortar loss under
   influence of heat treatment. Crown Copyright (c) 2016 Published by

Title = {{Reliability of mechanisms with periodic random modal frequencies using
   an extreme value-based approach}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{65-77}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Resonance in a dynamic system is to be avoided since it often leads to
   impaired performance, over-stressing, fatigue fracture and adverse human
   reactions. Thus, it is necessary to know the modal frequencies and
   ensure they do not coincide with any applied periodic loadings. For a
   rotating planar mechanism, the coefficients in the mass and stiffness
   matrices are periodically varying, and if the underlying geometry and
   material properties are treated as random variables then the modal
   frequencies are both position-dependent and probabilistic. The avoidance
   of resonance is now a complex problem. Herein, free vibration analysis
   helps determine ranges of modal frequencies that in turn, identify the
   running speeds of the mechanism to be avoided. This paper presents an
   efficient and accurate sample based approach to determine probabilistic
   minimum and maximum extremes of the fundamental frequencies and the
   angular positions of their occurrence. Then, given critical lower and
   upper frequency constraints it is straightforward to determine
   reliability in terms of probability of exceedance. The novelty of the
   proposed approach is that the original expensive and implicit
   mechanistic model is replaced by an explicit meta-model that captures
   the tolerances of the design variables over the entire range of angular
   positions: position-dependent eigenvalues can be found easily and
   quickly. Extreme value statistics of the modal frequencies and
   extreme-value statistics of the angular positions are readily computed
   through MCS. Limit-state surfaces that connect the frequencies to the
   design variables may be easily constructed. Error analysis identifies
   three errors and the paper presents ways to control them so the
   methodology can be sufficiently accurate. A numerical example of a
   flexible four-bar linkage shows the proposed methodology has engineering
   applications. The impact of the proposed methodology is two-fold: it
   presents a safe-side analysis based on free vibration methods to assess
   and manage the uncertainty in the range of modal frequencies, and, it
   provides a launching platform for timely design optimization. (C) 2016

Title = {{Co-extrusion process to produce Al-Mg eutectic clad magnesium products
   at elevated temperatures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{175-183}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel and effective method to co-extrude metallic alloys is described
   using a direct extrusion method. This co-extrusion method was used to
   experimentally produce Al-Mg eutectic clad rods of magnesium using a
   laboratory scale extruder at the University of Waterloo. In addition a
   mathematical model of the co-extrusion process using DEFORM 2D was
   developed to gain insight and a scientific understanding of the material
   flow and metallurgical reactions that occurred between the aluminum and
   magnesium during the co-extrusion process. The co-extrusion method
   involved, filling a feeder pocket of the extrusion die with a disc of
   one material (Al), whereas the billet material had a different
   composition (magnesium). As the ram pushes the billet into the die, it
   punches through the disc and the resulting extrudate is clad in a
   eutectic alloy of the disc and billet material. An added benefit to this
   process is that with the choice of the correct material compositions and
   process conditions, the extrusion loads can be substantially lowered as
   a eutectic composition is formed between the billet and disc materials
   such that the interface becomes molten at the extrusion temperatures
   while the parent billet and disc remain solid. This greatly aids in the
   formation of a high quality interface with respect to bonding between
   the eutectic clad layer and core material of the extrudate. Subsequent
   extrusions done using the die with an already punched disc in the feeder
   pocket (a donut) were also able to be clad and showed significantly
   lower loads (similar to 30\% difference in peak load) during extrusion
   as compared to billet materials that were extruded with an empty die
   feeder pocket. In this research, extrusion trials were performed with a
   magnesium billet and aluminum disc at 350 degrees C (below the Al-Mg
   eutectic point) and 450 degrees C (about the Al-Mg eutectic point). At
   350 degrees C, no significant cladding of the aluminum on the core Mg
   alloy occurred, but at 450 degrees C, the co-extrusion process was
   successful with an Al-Mg eutectic clad rod of magnesium being produced.
   Subsequent co-extrusion trials were also done using the Al-donut in the
   feeder pocket of the die and also resulted in significantly lower loads
   and an Al-Mg eutectic clad extrudate. The integrity of the interface was
   examined and deemed to be of high quality based on visual and
   microscopic examinations. Both the Finite Element Method (FEM)
   simulation using DEFORM 2D and extrusion load measurements showed a
   significant drop in extrusion pressure using this co-extrusion process.

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{149-159}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Direct combustion of fossils is a low efficiency process that leads to
   excessive carbon dioxide emissions. Highly efficient and clean
   combustion processes can be achieved by the use of hydrogen as fuel.
   Hydrogen can be produced by steam reforming of methane which is a highly
   endothermic process. Heat required for such endothermic process can be
   achieved by the use of solar energy. The literature indicates that solar
   reforming is restricted to high temperature generating solar
   technologies like solar towers and dishes due to the high heat demand of
   the reforming process. A novel idea of using solar parabolic troughs in
   conjunction with a membrane reformer has been developed which allows low
   temperature operation of the process due to the equilibrium shift
   effect. Molten salt heated in the solar parabolic trough facility (up to
   similar to 600 degrees C) provides heat needed for the endothermic
   reforming reactions. In this review, we provide critical assessment of
   the latest published developments in solar reforming technologies. We
   focus on reactor design concepts employed to couple the heat
   requirements of methane reforming process with concentrated solar power.
   The emphasis is novel, alternative routes which have potential of
   commercialization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Performance prediction is a critical step towards the acceptance of a
   new pavement structure. This is true for both conventional and
   innovative designs; however, it is particularly important for innovative
   designs that attempt to redefine pavement design practices. One such
   innovative design concept is the solar road panel; a road panel with a
   transparent surface that generates electricity through embedded solar
   cells. Despite the work completed by multiple organisations towards the
   development of this concept, questions exist about the viability of
   these panels as a structural pavement surface. This paper investigates
   these questions through a finite element modelling approach that
   assesses a prototype panel's performance on a variety of structural
   bases. Overall, this paper finds that it is possible to design a solar
   road panel to withstand traffic loading and that a concrete structural
   base allows for substantial optimisation to the analysed prototype
   design.}},

Abstract = {{A fault-tolerant quantum repeater or quantum computer using solid-state
   spin-based quantum bits will likely require a physical implementation
   with many spins arranged in a grid. Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs)
   have been established as attractive candidates for building spin-based
   quantum information processing devices, but such QDs are randomly
   positioned, which makes them unsuitable for constructing large-scale
   processors. Recent efforts have shown that QDs embedded in nanowires can
   be deterministically positioned in regular arrays, can store single
   charges, and have excellent optical properties, but so far there have
   been no demonstrations of spin qubit operations using nanowire QDs. Here
   we demonstrate optical pumping of individual spins trapped in
   site-controlled nanowire QDs, resulting in high-fidelity spin-qubit
   initialization. This represents the next step towards establishing spins
   in nanowire QDs as quantum memories suitable for use in a large-scale,
   fault-tolerant quantum computer or repeater based on all-optical control
   of the spin qubits.}},

Abstract = {{The future of urban energy systems relies on the transition to ``smart
   energy networks{''} which incorporate energy storage with renewable
   energy sources such as wind and solar. Hydrogen provides a desirable
   energy vector for both energy storage and exchange of energy between
   energy hubs within a smart energy network. This paper aims to develop a
   generic mathematical model for the optimal energy management of future
   communities where hydrogen is used as an energy vector. An energy hub is
   a novel concept that systematically and holistically considers the
   energy requirements of both mobility and stationary loads. In order to
   perform optimization studies, the minimization of capital cost of
   hydrogen refueling stations and operation and maintenance cost of all
   energy hubs within the network are considered. The modeling and
   optimization are undertaken and carried out in the General Algebraic
   Modeling Software (GAMS). The case study considers four energy hubs
   consisting of a commercial building, school, residential complex, as
   well as hydrogen refueling stations. The study investigates the optimal
   operation of different energy conversion and storage technologies in
   order to meet the demand of energy. The results showed that the optimum
   size of electrolyser and hydrogen tank for supplying the hydrogen demand
   in the energy hub network is two 290-kW electrolysers and four 30-kg
   tanks, respectively. The average daily strike price of electricity by
   which the electrolyser operates is \$0.036 per kWh and will not operate
   when the average hourly Ontario electricity price is higher than \$0.13
   per kWh. The levelized cost of hydrogen produced by hydrogen refueling
   station is estimated to be \$6.74 per kg. Moreover, the optimal
   operation of energy conversion and energy storage technologies within
   each hub and the optimal interaction between energy hubs with in the
   network are also investigated. In addition, it is shown that distributed
   hydrogen generation is more preferable than H-2 delivery in
   environmental and economic comparison. (C) 2015 Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Power-to-Gas is an energy storage and transportation technology which is
   useful for the development of the `smart grid', including the
   integration of intermittent renewable energy sources through the

   As hydrogen is an energy vector, converting the power into gaseous
   hydrogen is considered to be an effective energy storage alternative.
   Previous studies attempt to qualitatively compare energy storage
   technologies considering criteria such as market maturity, efficiency,
   and cost, and include energy storage systems such as electrochemical
   batteries, pumped hydro or compressed air energy storage systems. In
   this work an Analytical Hierarchy Process is applied to compare
   Power-to-Gas with other energy storage technologies in applications
   ranging from, residential load shifting to bulk energy storage and
   utility-scale frequency support. The authors find that Power-to-Gas is

Abstract = {{Power-to-Gas systems provide a versatile and effective form of energy
   storage. By utilizing renewable and off-peak electricity to create
   hydrogen through electrolysis, an alternative energy vector is created
   which can be utilized for grid management and energy transportation
   through the natural gas infrastructure. The rapid response of
   electrolysers has been proven to be able to match fluctuating demand
   signals means that they are not only useful for creating hydrogen for
   energy storage but can also provide important ancillary power services.
   As the largest market for hydrogen current is in the refining of
   petroleum, it makes sense that creating hydrogen through electrolysis
   provides an opportunity to purchase electricity at low cost while
   reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from using the
   current steam methane reformation (SMR) approach for the production of
   the needed hydrogen. It is shown through MatLAB simulations that by
   using known electrical costs and hydrogen pricing or credit rates,
   reasonable payback periods and internal rates of return are attainable
   when the cost value of the hydrogen energy is compared to renewable
   ethanol costs, or when the production of the hydrogen considers
   cap-and-trade carbon emissions revenues. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{One of the key challenges in developing quantum networks is to generate
   single photons with high brightness, purity, and long temporal
   coherence. Semiconductor quantum dots potentially satisfy these
   requirements; however, due to imperfections in the surrounding material,
   the coherence generally degrades with increasing excitation power
   yielding a broader emission spectrum. Here we overcome this
   power-broadening regime and demonstrate an enhanced coherence at exciton
   saturation where the detected count rates are highest. We detect
   single-photon count rates of 460 000 counts per second under pulsed
   laser excitation while maintaining a single-photon purity greater than
   99\%. Importantly, the enhanced coherence is attained with quantum dots
   in ultraclean wurtzite InP nanowires, where the surrounding charge traps
   are filled by exciting above the wurtzite InP nanowire band gap. By
   raising the excitation intensity, the number of possible charge
   configurations in the quantum dot environment is reduced, resulting in a
   narrower emission spectrum. Via Monte Carlo simulations we explain the
   observed narrowing of the emission spectrum with increasing power.
   Cooling down the sample to 300 mK, we further enhance the single-photon
   coherence twofold as compared to operation at 4.5 K, resulting in a
   homogeneous coherence time, T-2, of 1.2 ns, and two-photon interference
   visibility as high as 83\% under strong temporal postselection (similar
   to 5\% without temporal postselection).}},

   m-phenylenediamine and 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl chloride by interfacial
   polymerization on the surface of a polysulfone substrate, and graphene
   oxide was embedded into the membrane during membrane formation to
   improve the membrane performance. The desalination performance of the
   membranes was evaluated in terms of water flux and salt rejection, along
   with a baseline membrane containing no graphene oxide. The membrane
   morphology and surface properties were also studied using contact angle
   measurements, FT-IR, XRD and SEM. Incorporating a small amount of
   graphene oxide into the membrane was shown to improve the water flux,
   mechanical stability, and chlorine and fouling resistances of the
   membrane. At 15 bar, a water flux of 29.6 L/m(2).h and a salt rejection
   of >= 97\% were obtained for a saline solution (2000 ppm of NaCl) when
   the amine reactant contained 100 ppm of graphene oxide during membrane
   fabrication. The membranes were found to be stable in acidic and
   alkaline solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Silica nanoparticles doped aqueous electrolytes have been prepared and
   implemented for the first time in rechargeable hybrid aqueous battery
   systems (ReHABs). The batteries were assembled from a cathode containing
   LiMn2O4 - a lithium intercalation compound, a zinc metal foil anode and
   a sulfate electrolyte containing Zn2+ and Li+ ions. Silica nanoparticles
   were doped into the liquid electrolyte with the initial aim to create a
   silica containing gel electrolyte. However, the 5\% and 10\% SiO2 doped
   electrolytes were viscous and could be easily absorbed in the Absorbed
   Glass Mat (AGM) separator and the whole system (doped electrolyte + AGM)
   immobilized after a few minutes. The AGM loaded with silica doped
   electrolytes remained wet after storage for weeks under ambient
   condition thanks to the water retention ability of nanoscale silica
   particles. The doped silica nanoparticles restrained deposition of zinc
   dendritic crystals, and reduced float charge current and self-discharge.
   The ReHABs assembled from the silica nanoparticles doped electrolytes
   provided high specific discharge capacity, up to 140 mAh (g LiMn2O4)(-1)
   at 0.2 C, and the cyclability of such systems was significantly enhanced
   compared to the ReHABs assembled from conventional electrolytes. X-ray
   Diffraction revealed that the anode of the batteries using SiO2 doped
   electrolytes were protected since only the XRD peaks of Zn were detected
   after the batteries were running 700 cycles of charge and discharge. (C)

Abstract = {{A rechargeable hybrid aqueous battery (ReHAB) containing NASICON-type
   M3V2(PO4)(3) (M = Li, Na) as the cathodes and Zinc metal as the anode,
   working in Li2SO4-ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte, has been studied. Both of
   Li3V2(PO4)(3) and Na3V2(PO4)(3) cathodes can be reversibly
   charge/discharge with the initial discharge capacity of 128 mAh g(-1)
   and 96 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, respectively, with high up to 84\% of capacity
   retention ratio after 200 cycles. The electrochemical assisted ex-XRD
   confirm that Li3V2(PO4)(3) and Na3V2(PO4)(3) are relative stable in
   aqueous electrolyte, and Na3V2(PO4)(3) showed more complicated
   electrochemical mechanism due to the co-insertion of Li+ and Na+. The
   effect of pH of aqueous electrolyte and the dendrite of Zn on the
   cycling performance of as designed MVP/Zn ReHABs were investigated, and
   weak acidic aqueous electrolyte with pH around 4.0-4.5 was optimized.
   The float current test confirmed that the designed batteries are stable
   in aqueous electrolytes. The MVP//Zn ReHABs could be a potential
   candidate for future rechargeable aqueous battery due to their high
   safety, fast dynamic speed and adaptable electrochemical window.
   Moreover, this hybrid battery broadens the scope of battery material
   research from single-ion-involving to double-ions-involving rechargeable
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The retention behavior of cobalt(II) by nanofiltration from ammoniacal
   solutions used for the simultaneous absorption of SO2/NOx, was
   investigated. The cobalt(II) rejections in aqueous ammoniacal solutions
   were higher than 99\% by the membrane with alkaline stability and a
   molecular weight cut-off of similar to 200 Da. The presence of small and
   mobile NH4+ in the feed solution improved the cobalt(II) retention. It
   was found that NH4NO3 had little effect on the permeation flux or
   cobalt(II) rejection while (NH4)(2)SO4 lowered both. The effects of
   initial cobalt(II) concentration (0.006-0.03 mol/L) in the feed on
   cobalt(II) rejection depended on the compositions of the solution. An
   increase in transmembrane pressure (0.4-0.8 MPa) led to higher
   cobalt(II) rejections for all solutions. Cobalt precipitates were
   generated during the filtration process due to the loss of chelating
   agent NH3 center dot H2O. The decline in permeation flux and cobalt (II)
   rejection could be recovered by effective cleaning. Adding NH3 center
   dot H2O during the filtration process could prevent the formation of
   cobalt precipitates so as to avoid deterioration in the membrane
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel solvent-free tribo-electrostatic separation technique for the

   a multiple linear regression model. The influence of process parameters
   on the protein content and protein separation efficiency of the
   resulting protein-enriched fractions was evaluated. Air flow rate, plate
   voltage, and tribo-charger tube length were found to have a significant
   impact on the protein content and separation efficiency. Although plate
   angle had no significant impact on the protein content, interactions
   with air flow rate, plate voltage and tribo-charger tube length were
   found to have a significant influence on the protein separation
   efficiency. The optimal values of air flow rate, tribo-charger length,
   plate voltage and plate angle were found to be 7 LPM, 240 cm, -6.5 kV
   and 20 degrees, respectively. The protein-enriched fraction produced at
   the optimum conditions had a protein content of 38.1\% accounting for
   50.4\% of the total protein. Good agreement was observed between the
   experimental and predicted values. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   efficient markerless genome editing in Clostridium}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Application of CRISPR-Cas9 systems has revolutionized genome editing
   across all domains of life. Here we report implementation of the
   heterologous Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system in Clostridium pasteurianum for
   markerless genome editing. Since 74\% of species harbor CRISPR-Cas loci
   in Clostridium, we also explored the prospect of co-opting host-encoded
   CRISPR-Cas machinery for genome editing. Motivation for this work was
   bolstered from the observation that plasmids expressing heterologous
   cas9 result in poor transformation of Clostridium. To address this
   barrier and establish proof-of-concept, we focus on characterization and
   exploitation of the C. pasteurianum Type I-B CRISPR-Cas system. In
   silico spacer analysis and in vivo interference assays revealed three
   protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences required for site-specific
   nucleolytic attack. Introduction of a synthetic CRISPR array and cpaAIR
   gene deletion template yielded an editing efficiency of 100\%. In
   contrast, the heterologous Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system generated only
   25\% of the total yield of edited cells, suggesting that native
   machinery provides a superior foundation for genome editing by
   precluding expression of cas9 in trans. To broaden our approach, we also
   identified putative PAM sequences in three key species of Clostridium.
   This is the first report of genome editing through harnessing native
   CRISPR-Cas machinery in Clostridium.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) algorithms reported in the
   literature had often assumed that state measurements are available to
   all subsystems at all time instants. However, this assumption is not
   valid in the presence of loss of communication or data. Then designing
   for such losses within DMPC becomes critical to overall performance and
   stability of the system. In this work communication loss was considered
   for robust DMPC by using within each subsystem an observer, which
   continuously and recursively estimates states' bounds for all the plant
   states. These state bounds are then posed as extra constraints within a
   Linear Matrix Inequalities' formulation that is used to calculate the
   control actions based on the minimization of an upper bound on robust
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   study of different adsorbent designs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1445}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Purification of virus-like particles (VLPs) in bind-and-elute mode has
   reached a bottleneck. Negative chromatography has emerged as the
   alternative solution; however, benchmark of negative chromatography
   media and their respective optimized conditions are absent. Hence, this
   study was carried out to compare the performance of different negative
   chromatography media for the purification of hepatitis B VLPs (HB-VLPs)
   from clarified Escherichia coli feedstock. The modified anion exchange
   media, core-shell adsorbents (InertShell and InertLayer 1000) and
   polymer grafted adsorbents (SQ) were compared. The results of
   chromatography from packed bed column of core-shell adsorbents showed
   that there is a trade-off between the purity and recovery of HB-VLPs in
   the flowthrough fraction due to the shell thickness. Atomic force
   microscopic analysis revealed funnel-shaped pore channels in the shell
   layer which may contribute to the entrapment of HB-VLPs. A longer
   residence time at a lower feed flow rate (0.5 ml/min) improved slightly
   the HB-VLPs purity in all modified adsorbents, but the recovery in
   InertShell reduced substantially. The preheat-treatment is not
   recommended for the negative chromatography as the thermal-induced
   co-aggregation of HCPs and HB-VLPs would flow along with HB-VLPs and
   thus reduced the HB-VLPs purity in the flowthrough. Further reduction in
   the feedstock concentration enhanced the purity of HB-VLPs especially in
   InertLayer 1000 but reduced substantially the recovery of HB-VLPs. In
   general, the polymer grafted adsorbent, SQ, performed better than the
   core-shell adsorbents in handling a higher feedstock concentration. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the issue of master-slave synchronization
   for chaotic Lur'e systems (CLSs) with time-varying-delay feedback
   control. A novel integral inequality is developed by employing two
   adjustable parameters, which encompasses the celebrated Wirtinger's
   integral inequality and Jensen's inequality as two special cases. By
   constructing an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) taking
   fully the information time-varying-delay range into account, less
   conservative delay-dependent synchronization criteria are established in
   the form of linear matrix inequalities (LIMs). Besides, the desired
   controller gain can be achieved by introducing new nonlinear function
   conditions, which have not been proposed so far. Finally, a numerical
   example of typical Chua's circuit is presented to show the improvements
   over the existing criteria and the effectiveness of the design approach.

Abstract = {{Dual-task (DT) gait involves walking while simultaneously performing an
   attention-demanding task and can be used to identify impaired gait or
   executive function in older adults. Advancment is needed in techniques
   that quantify the influence of dual tasking to improve predictive and
   diagnostic potential. This study investigated the viability of wearable
   sensor measures to identify DT gait changes in older adults and
   distinguish between elderly fallers and non-fallers. A convenience
   sample of 100 older individuals (75.5 +/- 6.7 years; 76 non-fallers, 24
   fallers based on 6 month retrospective fall occurrence) walked 7.62 m
   under single-task (ST) and DT conditions while wearing pressure-sensing
   insoles and tri-axial accelerometers at the head, pelvis, and left and
   right shanks. Differences between ST and DT gait were identified for
   temporal measures, acceleration descriptive statistics, Fast Fourier
   Transform (FFT) quartiles, ratio of even to odd harmonics, center of
   pressure (CoP) stance path coefficient of variation, and deviations to
   expected CoP stance path. Increased posterior CoP stance path
   deviations, increased coefficient of variation, decreased FFT quartiles,
   and decreased ratio of even to odd harmonics suggested increased DT gait
   variability. Decreased gait velocity and decreased acceleration standard
   deviations (SD) at the pelvis and shanks could represent compensatory
   gait strategies that maintain stability. Differences in acceleration
   between fallers and non-fallers in head posterior SD and pelvis AP ratio
   of even to odd harmonics during ST, and pelvis vertical maximum Lyapunov
   exponent during DT gait were identified. Wearable-sensor-based DT gait
   assessments could be used in point-of-care environments to identify gait
   deficits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a hybrid quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QIEA)
   is proposed to automatically design regularised ensemble extreme
   learning machines (EELMs). Quantum evolutionary computing is a
   relatively recent spot-lighted concept which takes advantage from both
   the evolutionary and quantum computing laws. In general, QIEAs have been
   proven to be really powerful for optimising complex engineering tasks.
   The fascinating trait of observation operator in QIEA enables us to
   transform the quantum bits to both the binary and continuous spaces.
   Here, the authors present a mix continuous/binary version of QIEA, to
   find out whether it is suited for designing regularised EELMs. Indeed,
   the design process of EELM is conducted at two different levels, i.e.
   hyper and low levels. At the low level, some novel criteria are
   presented in the form of penalty functions to enable the optimiser
   searching for parsimonious, compact and accurate regularised extreme
   learning machines, as individual components of the ensemble. At the
   hyper-level, the non-negative least square error optimisation technique
   is utilised to deterministically find the most eligible components for
   designing the ensemble. Through extensive numerical experiments, the
   authors demonstrate that the proposed method is really efficient for the
   automated design of EELM identifiers.}},

Abstract = {{We present an experimental route to engineer the exciton energies of
   single quantum dots in nanowires. By integrating the nanowires onto a
   piezoelectric crystal, we controllably apply strain fields to the
   nanowire quantum dots. Consequently, the exciton energy of a single
   quantum dot in the nanowire is shifted by several meVs without degrading
   its optical intensity and single-photon purity. Second-order
   autocorrelation measurements are performed at different strain fields on
   the same nanowire quantum dot. The suppressed multi-photon events at
   zero time delay clearly verify that the quantum nature of single-photon
   emission is well preserved under external strain fields. The work
   presented here could facilitate on-chip optical quantum information
   processing with the nanowire based single photon emitters. Published by

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals with grafted binary polymer brushes (CNC-BPB),
   poly(oligoethylene glycol) methacrylate (POEGMA) and poly(methacrylic
   acid) (PMAA), were prepared by cerium-mediated polymerization in aqueous
   solution. The physical properties of CNC-BPB can be controlled by
   external triggers, such as temperature and pH, which can be utilized to
   stabilize and destabilize oil-water emulsions. By virtue of the
   modifications, these bifunctionalized CNCs diffused to the oil-water
   interface and stabilized the oil droplets at high pHs. When the pH was
   lowered to 2, strong hydrogen bonding between POEGMA and PMAA chains
   grafted on the CNC induced the coalescence of the emulsion droplets,
   resulting in the phase separation of oil and water. For emulsions
   stabilized by CNC-POEGMA and free PMAA mixtures, instantaneous
   coalescence was not observed at low pHs. Successive
   stabilization-destabilization over 5 cycles was demonstrated by
   modulating the pH with the addition of acid or base without any loss in
   efficiency. This work demonstrates that functional sustainable
   nanomaterials can be used for small scale oil water separations,
   particularly for oil droplet transportation and harvesting of lipophilic

Abstract = {{In this paper, a wideband RF power amplifier (PA) linearization
   technique based on the addition of a linearization amplifier (LA) is
   proposed. The technique is suitable for low-powered and low-cost small
   cell and fifth-generation (5G) large-scale multi-antenna PA designs
   since its power and cost overhead does not increase with the input
   signal bandwidth and because they are scalable with the power range and
   cost of the PA. In-depth analysis of the proposed technique is provided
   and its linearization improvement mechanisms are described. As a proof
   of concept, a prototype LA was designed and fabricated to linearize a
   broadband 6-W class-AB PA with a center frequency of 850 MHz. When
   stimulated by a wideband 40-MHz signal, the PA's adjacent channel
   leakage ratio (ACLR) was improved by up to 13 dB after the addition of
   the LA. This enabled the PA to achieve an ACLR of about -45 dBc without
   the use of any other linearization techniques. Furthermore, significant
   ACLR improvements were observed for even signals with wider bandwidths

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks operating in the license-free spectrum suffer
   from uncontrolled interference as those spectrum bands become
   increasingly crowded. The emerging cognitive radio sensor networks
   (CRSNs) provide a promising solution to address this challenge by
   enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed channels.
   However, since sensor nodes have to consume considerable energy to
   support CR functionalities, such as channel sensing and switching, the
   opportunistic channel accessing should be carefully devised for
   improving the energy efficiency in CRSN. To this end, we investigate the
   dynamic channel accessing problem to improve the energy efficiency for a
   clustered CRSN. Under the primary users' protection requirement, we
   study the resource allocation issues to maximize the energy efficiency
   of utilizing a licensed channel for intra-cluster and inter-cluster data
   transmission, respectively. Moreover, with the consideration of the
   energy consumption in channel sensing and switching, we further
   determine the condition when sensor nodes should sense and switch to a
   licensed channel for improving the energy efficiency, according to the
   packet loss rate of the license-free channel. In addition, two dynamic
   channel accessing schemes are proposed to identify the channel sensing
   and switching sequences for intra-cluster and inter-cluster data
   transmission, respectively. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
   that the proposed channel accessing schemes can significantly reduce the
   energy consumption in CRSNs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the performance of cooperative
   communication in decentralized wireless networks under unsaturated
   traffic conditions with randomly positioned single-hop
   source-destination pairs and relays, where interference is the main
   performance-limiting factor. The traffic unsaturation and concurrent
   cooperative transmissions introduce a correlation between the interferer
   density and the packet retransmission probability, and a correlation of
   interference power in both space and time domains, which complicate the
   interference characterization. Based on queueing theory and stochastic
   geometry, the stationary interferer density is derived by solving a
   fixed-point equation, which is proved to have a unique solution.
   According to the relay selection scheme, we characterize the correlation
   of interference power in two consecutive time-slots by identifying the
   densities of source and relay retransmissions. Based on the interferer
   density and interference correlation, we derive the outage probability
   and average packet delay of the cooperative scheme, while taking into
   account the dynamic traffic arrivals, interference correlation, relay
   selection scheme, and spatial node distribution. The performance
   analysis is validated by extensive simulations. The analytical results
   provide useful insights on cooperative communication in large-scale

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are vulnerable to selective forwarding
   attacks that can maliciously drop a subset of forwarding packets to
   degrade network performance and jeopardize the information integrity.
   Meanwhile, due to the unstable wireless channel in WSNs, the packet loss
   rate during the communication of sensor nodes may be high and vary from
   time to time. It poses a great challenge to distinguish the malicious
   drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware
   reputation system with adaptive detection threshold (CRS-A) to detect
   selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. The CRS-A evaluates the data
   forwarding behaviors of sensor nodes, according to the deviation of the
   monitored packet loss and the estimated normal loss. To optimize the
   detection accuracy of CRS-A, we theoretically derive the optimal
   threshold for forwarding evaluation, which is adaptive to the
   time-varied channel condition and the estimated attack probabilities of
   compromised nodes. Furthermore, an attack-tolerant data forwarding
   scheme is developed to collaborate with CRS-A for stimulating the
   forwarding cooperation of compromised nodes and improving the data
   delivery ratio of the network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
   that CRS-A can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and
   identify the compromised sensor nodes, while the attack-tolerant data
   forwarding scheme can significantly improve the data delivery ratio of
   the network.}},

Abstract = {{CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) can allow conventional fuels for
   electricity generation to be used while achieving deep reductions in GHG
   ( Greenhouse Gas) emissions at the cost, though, of reduced efficiency
   and capacity relative to an electricity system without CCS. It has been
   proposed that the deployment of generating units with CCS that are
   flexible-in particular, that can moderate their CO2 recovery in response
   to market conditions-would mitigate some of the disbenefit associated
   with the technology. This paper uses the short-term resource scheduling
   approach to assess the value of flexible generating units with CCS
   (Carbon Capture and Storage); generating unit part-load performance,
   variability of CO2 recovery, and detailed operation of an electricity
   system including transmission and reliability constraints are considered
   simultaneously. A parametric study of the performance of a coal-fired
   generating unit with CCS is undertaken using an Aspen Plus steady-state
   model and a reduced-order model representing the Pareto optimal frontier
   of the unit is developed using regression analysis. The base economic
   dispatch underlying the electricity system simulator is extended to
   accommodate flexible generating units with CCS. The flexible generating
   unit with CCS is added to the IEEE RTS'96 (Institute of Electrical and
   Electronics Engineers One-Area Reliability Test System-1996) and the
   operation of the modified IEEE RTS'96 is simulated for one week. The
   results are contrasted with results taken from Alin et al, (2015) for
   the base IEEE RTS'96 and an IEEE RTS'96 with ``fixed{''} CCS.
   ``Flexible{''} CCS is effective at reducing GHG emissions, though to a
   slightly lesser extent than was observed via ``fixed{''} CCS. However,
   with GHG regulation in place, flexibility markedly increases the net
   energy benefit of the generating unit with CCS and this was achieved not
   through adjustment of CO2 recovery in order to moderate output but,
   rather, by increasing the generating unit's ability to successfully
   compete to provide reserve power. Performance metrics that do not
   consider the impact of GHG mitigation options on energy benefit may not
   correctly rank GHG mitigation options. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Post-combustion CO2 capture plants that employ amine-based solvents are
   regarded as the most feasible strategy to reduce the CO2 emission from
   coal-fired power plants. This study presents a dynamic flexibility
   analysis of a post-combustion CO2 capture process using model predictive
   control (MPC). The critical operating conditions in the plant's main
   load (flue gas flowrate) were initially identified in open-loop and
   closed-loop. Insights from this analysis have shown that oscillatory
   changes with high frequency content in the load are particularly harmful
   for this process in closed-loop. Taking this insight into account, a
   simultaneous scheduling and control framework was developed to identify
   optimal operating policies under critical operating conditions in the
   flue gas flowrate. The results obtained from this framework were
   compared against a conventional sequential control and scheduling
   approach. The results show that the proposed integrated framework
   specifies more economically attractive policies than those obtained from
   the sequential approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To visualize in vivo and quantify the thickness of the
   posterior corneal layers: the acellular pre-Descemet's layer (PDL),
   Descemet's membrane (DM), and endothelium (END) in healthy subjects,
   using ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography (UHR-OCT).
   METHODS. A research-grade, 800-nm UHR-OCT system with 0.95-mu m axial
   resolution in corneal tissue was used to image in vivo the posterior
   cornea in healthy subjects. The system offers approximately 98 dB
   sensitivity for 680 mu W optical power incident on the cornea and 34,000
   A-scans/s image acquisition rate. This study comprised 20 healthy
   subjects, aged 20 to 60 years. The thickness of the PDL, DM, and END
   layers was measured both with a custom, automatic segmentation algorithm
   and manually.
   RESULTS. The boundaries and structure of the posterior corneal layers
   were clearly visible in the UHR-OCT images. The average thickness was
   measured to be 6.6 +/- 1.4 mu m (PDL), 10.4 +/- 2.9 mu m (DM), and 4.8
   +/- 0.4 mu m (END), which agrees well with published data from ex vivo
   studies. Both the END and DM thickness showed minor spatial variations,
   whereas the PDL showed up to 2x thickness change for different locations
   on the same cross-sectional corneal image or over the entire imaged
   region of the cornea.
   CONCLUSIONS. Our data indicate that all three layers of the posterior
   cornea can be clearly visualized in vivo and their thicknesses measured
   precisely with UHR-OCT. Although the PDL thickness showed large spatial
   variations, the thickness of the DM and END layers was consistent over
   the entire imaged region of the cornea.}},

Title = {{Polymeric Biodegradable Stent Insertion in the Esophagus}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Esophageal stent insertion has been used as a well-accepted and
   effective alternative to manage and improve the quality of life for
   patients diagnosed with esophageal diseases and disorders. Current
   stents are either permanent or temporary and are fabricated from either
   metal or plastic. The partially covered self-expanding metal stent
   (SEMS) has a firm anchoring effect and prevent stent migration, however,
   the hyperplastic tissue reaction cause stent restenosis and make it
   difficult to remove. A fully covered SEMS and self-expanding plastic
   stent (SEPS) reduced reactive hyperplasia but has a high migration rate.
   The main advantage that polymeric biodegradable stents (BDSs) have over
   metal or plastic stents is that removal is not require and reduce the
   need for repeated stent insertion. But the slightly lower radial force
   of BDS may be its main shortcoming and a post-implant problem. Thus,
   strengthening support of BDS is a content of the research in the future.
   BDSs are often temporarily effective in esophageal stricture to relieve
   dysphagia. In the future, it can be expect that biodegradable
   drug-eluting stents (DES) will be available to treat benign esophageal
   stricture, perforations or leaks with additional use as palliative
   modalities for treating malignant esophageal stricture, as the bridge to
   surgery or to maintain luminal patency during neoadjuvant
   chemoradiation.}},

Abstract = {{With small cell base stations (SBSs) densely deployed in addition to
   conventional macro base stations (MBSs), the heterogeneous cellular
   network (HCN) architecture can effectively boost network capacity. To
   support the huge power demand of HCNs, renewable energy harvesting
   technologies can be leveraged. In this paper, we aim to make efficient
   use of the harvested energy for on-grid power saving while satisfying
   the quality of service (QoS) requirement. To this end, energy-aware
   traffic offloading schemes are proposed, whereby user associations,
   ON-OFF states of SBSs, and power control are jointly optimized according
   to the statistical information of energy arrival and traffic load.
   Specifically, for the single SBS case, the power saving gain achieved by
   activating the SBS is derived in closed form, based on which the SBS
   activation condition and optimal traffic offloading amount are obtained.
   Furthermore, a two-stage energy-aware traffic offloading (TEATO) scheme
   is proposed for the multiple-SBS case, considering various operating
   characteristics of SBSs with different power sources. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve more than 50\% power
   saving gain for typical daily traffic and solar energy profiles,
   compared with the conventional traffic offloading schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the network utility maximization (NUM) problem in
   static-routing rechargeable sensor networks (RSNs) with the link and
   battery capacity constraints. The NUM problem is very challenging as
   these two constraints are typically coupling in RSNs, which cannot be
   directly tackled. Existing works either do not fully consider the two
   coupled constraints together, or heuristically remove the temporally
   coupled part, both of which are not practical, and will also degrade the
   network performance. In this paper, we attempt to jointly optimize the
   sampling rate and battery level by carefully tackling the
   spatiotemporally coupled link and battery capacity constraints. To this
   end, we first decouple the original problem equivalently into separable
   subproblems by means of dual decomposition. Then, we propose a
   distributed algorithm in the context of joint rate and battery control,
   called decouple spatiotemporally-coupled constraint (DSCC), which can
   converge to the globally optimal solution. Numerical results, based on
   the real solar data, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm always
   achieves higher network utility than existing approaches. In addition,
   the impact of link/battery capacity and initial battery level on the
   network utility is further investigated.}},

Abstract = {{For a two-way relay network (TWRN) with three nodes, we discuss the
   performance optimization of digital network coding (DNC) and physical
   network coding (PNC) schemes under the energy harvesting (EH)
   constraints and peak power constraints. We also consider the energy
   transfer between nodes, which is referred to as energy co-operation. To
   find the maximal achievable performance, we first consider the case of
   offline scheduling, formulate the corresponding optimization problems,
   find the optimal solutions, as well as present some useful theoretical
   properties on optimality. Then we move to the online scheduling, and
   propose both dynamic programming and some intuitive policies to approach
   the performance of its offline counterpart. Numerical results show that
   PNC outperforms DNC due to the higher spectrum efficiency and the
   intrinsic coding gains, under the same conditions. Furthermore, it is
   observed that if the relay harvests much more energy and shares it with
   the two source nodes, DNC with energy co-operation scheme has the
   potential to perform comparable to or even better than PNC without
   energy co-operation scheme, which validates the importance of energy
   co-operation in contemporary communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of reduced-order vocal fold models into clinically useful
   tools for subject-specific diagnosis and treatment hinges upon
   successfully and accurately representing an individual patient in the
   modeling framework. This, in turn, requires inference of model
   parameters from clinical measurements in order to tune a model to the
   given individual. Bayesian analysis is a powerful tool for estimating
   model parameter probabilities based upon a set of observed data. In this
   work, a Bayesian particle filter sampling technique capable of
   estimating time-varying model parameters, as occur in complex vocal
   gestures, is introduced. The technique is compared with time-invariant
   Bayesian estimation and least squares methods for determining both
   stationary and non-stationary parameters. The current technique
   accurately estimates the time-varying unknown model parameter and
   maintains tight credibility bounds. The credibility bounds are
   particularly relevant from a clinical perspective, as they provide
   insight into the confidence a clinician should have in the model
   predictions. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is a promising technology for
   next generation communication systems. This communication paradigm
   facilitates ubiquitous communications with full mechanical automation,
   where a large number of intelligent devices connected by wired/wireless
   links, interact with each other without direct human intervention. As a
   result, M2M communication finds applications in wide areas such as smart
   grids, e-healthcare, home area networks, intelligent transportation
   systems, environmental monitoring, smart cities, and industrial
   automation. However, distinctive features in M2M communications form
   different challenges from those in human-to-human communications. These
   challenges need to be addressed, or otherwise it is not easy for this
   paradigm to gain trust of people. To understand M2M communications
   deeply, this paper presents a comprehensive review of M2M communication
   technology in terms of its system model architecture proposed by
   different standards developing organizations. This mainly includes 3GPP,
   ETSI, and oneM2M. Further, we have investigated distinctive features of
   various M2M applications and their supporting attributes, the M2M data
   traffic and their characterization, various M2M standardization bodies
   and their unique tasks, and potential M2M communication challenges and
   their proposed state-of-the-art solutions, followed by future research

Journal = {{STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Lap splices are a common construction method for joining steel rebars in
   reinforced concrete beams because of their simplicity and low cost. The
   bond strength between the concrete and reinforcing bars in a splice is
   crucial to many aspects of the behaviour of a reinforced concrete
   member. Fatigue flexural loading imposes severe demands on the strength
   and ductility of the lap splice region in reinforced concrete structures
   and can lead to a brittle and sudden failure of the member. This paper
   investigates the effect of different concrete covers on the fatigue bond
   strength of reinforcing concrete beams containing a lap splice under a
   fatigue loads. It includes tests of twenty two beams divided into two
   groups. Each group has beams with 30 mm and 50 mm clear side and bottom
   concrete covers. The variables that were addressed where the concrete
   cover, the presence or absence of GFRP sheet wrapping, the type of
   loading (monotonic or fatigue) and the fatigue load ranges. The test
   results showed that an increase in the concrete cover led to an increase
   in the bond strength under both monotonic and fatigue loading for both
   the unwrapped and GFRP wrapped beams. Also, the GFRP sheets increased
   both the fatigue strength and the deflection for both the 30 mm and the
   50 mm concrete covers. (C) 2016 The Institution of Structural Engineers.

Abstract = {{While traditional application of quantitative microbial risk assessment
   (QMRA) models usually stops at analyzing the microbial risk under
   typical operating conditions, this paper proposes the use of
   scenario-based risk assessment to predict the impact of potential
   challenges on the expected risk. This study used a QMRA model developed
   by Health Canada to compare 14 scenarios created to assess the increase
   in risk due to potential treatment failures and unexpected variations in
   water quality and operating parameters of a water treatment plant. Under
   regular operating conditions, the annual risk of illness was found to be
   substantially lower than the acceptable limit. Scenario-based QMRA was
   shown to be useful in demonstrating which hypothetical treatment
   failures would be the most critical, resulting in an increased risk of
   illness. The analysis demonstrated that scenarios incorporating
   considerable failure in treatment processes resulted in risk levels
   surpassing the acceptable limit. This reiterates the importance of
   robust treatment processes and the multi-barrier approach voiced in
   drinking water safety studies. Knowing the probability of failure, and
   the risk involved, allows designers and operators to make effective
   plans for response to treatment failures and/or recovery actions
   involving potential exposures. This ensures the appropriate allocation
   of financial and human resources.}},

Title = {{Ignition of wood under time-varying radiant exposures}},
Journal = {{FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{131-144}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many studies have utilized a small-scale experimental apparatus such as
   the cone calorimeter to investigate the piloted ignition of wood exposed
   to constant levels of incident heat flux; however, there is a deficiency
   of similar studies related to the non-piloted ignition of wood exposed
   to time-varying heat fluxes which might represent more realistic fire
   exposures. In this study, a method was established for producing
   well-controlled, time-varying exposures using the conical radiant heater
   of a cone calorimeter. Experiments were conducted in which the incident
   flux, time to non-piloted ignition, and back-surface temperature of
   spruce wood were measured. Measured data were used in combination with a
   numerical heat transfer model to compute the time-dependent temperature
   distribution through each specimen, and thereby deduce the surface
   temperature at ignition. From the 30 specimens tested, the average
   surface temperature for non-piloted ignition of wood was determined to
   be 521 +/- 10 degrees C. From this surface temperature range, the heat
   transfer model was used to predict the range of time over which
   non-piloted ignition was likely to occur for a given time-varying
   exposure. This procedure was found to produce excellent predictions of
   ignition time for the time-varying exposures considered in this study.
   In addition, several existing ignition models were considered, and their
   suitability for predicting the non piloted ignition of wood was
   assessed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MICROFLUIDICS AND NANOFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the Janus droplet is an oil droplet covered with aluminum
   oxide nanoparticles on one side of the droplet surface under applied DC
   electrical field. The vortices around Janus droplets fixed on a
   horizontal surface were studied in this paper. A numerical model was set
   up to simulate the vortices around the Janus droplet in electric field.
   The simulation results illustrate that the electric field determines the
   strength of the vortices around a fixed Janus droplet, and the surface
   coverage of the positively charged nanoparticles on a Janus droplet
   affects the size and location of the vortices. The numerically predicted
   results were further validated experimentally by visualizing the
   vortices around Janus droplets in an externally applied DC electric
   field. Furthermore, as the Janus droplets are generated in electric
   field, the surface coverage by the nanoparticles depends on the strength
   of the electric field; therefore, the effect of the electric field on
   the nanoparticle covered surface area of a Janus droplet and the
   vortices was analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Using cloud computing, individuals can store their data on remote
   servers and allow data access to public users through the cloud servers.
   As the outsourced data are likely to contain sensitive privacy
   information, they are typically encrypted before uploaded to the cloud.
   This, however, significantly limits the usability of outsourced data due
   to the difficulty of searching over the encrypted data. In this paper,
   we address this issue by developing the fine-grained multi-keyword
   search schemes over encrypted cloud data. Our original contributions are
   three-fold. First, we introduce the relevance scores and preference
   factors upon keywords which enable the precise keyword search and
   personalized user experience. Second, we develop a practical and very
   efficient multi-keyword search scheme. The proposed scheme can support
   complicated logic search the mixed ``AND{''}, ``OR{''} and ``NO{''}
   operations of keywords. Third, we further employ the classified
   sub-dictionaries technique to achieve better efficiency on index
   building, trapdoor generating and query. Lastly, we analyze the security
   of the proposed schemes in terms of confidentiality of documents,
   privacy protection of index and trapdoor, and unlinkability of trapdoor.
   Through extensive experiments using the real-world dataset, we validate
   the performance of the proposed schemes. Both the security analysis and
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve
   the same security level comparing to the existing ones and better
   performance in terms of functionality, query complexity and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced (LTE-A) networks have recently
   introduced a data packet forwarding scheme between evolved node Bs
   (eNBs) to reduce the signaling overhead and the delay incurred in the
   data path switching scheme, which is a baseline handover scheme in
   LTE/LTE-A networks. Even with the data packet forwarding scheme, if the
   length of the forwarding chain is set inappropriately, the data packet
   forwarding scheme suffers from the degraded throughput. To attain the
   optimal handover performance in terms of throughput and delay and reduce
   the signaling overhead, we propose an optimized and distributed data
   packet forwarding scheme where the optimal length of the forwarding
   chain is obtained by a Markov decision process (MDP). In addition, a
   low-complexity value iteration algorithm is devised to solve the
   optimality equation of MDP in a more practical manner. Real trace-driven
   evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme determines the
   optimal length of the forwarding chain adaptively to the applications'
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and reduces the signaling overhead
   and delay while achieving higher throughput in diverse environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper (Part I and Part II), we investigate the optimal dynamic
   mode selection and resource allocation to minimize the average
   end-to-end delay under a dropping probability constraint for an
   orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) cellular network
   with device-to-device (D2D) communications. Different from the previous
   studies, which mostly focus on an infinite-backlog traffic model, we
   consider dynamic data arrival with nonsaturated buffers and formulate
   the resource control problem in D2D communications into an
   infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process
   (CMDP) in Part I. The CMDP characterizes the dynamic interference
   between D2D links and cellular links based on their varying backlogged
   states, the dynamic route selection, and the coupled interactions
   between uplink and downlink resource allocations. We propose the general
   form of the optimal policy. In particular, it is proved that the optimal
   delay, respective of all feasible randomized policies, is attained by
   either a deterministic policy or a simple mixed policy, which randomizes
   between two deterministic policies. Therefore, the determination of an
   optimal randomized policy essentially becomes the determination of one
   or two deterministic policies, which can be obtained by an equivalent
   Bellman's equation with reduced state space. Simulation results show
   that the optimal policy based on the CMDP model outperforms the
   conventional channel-state-information-only scheme and the
   throughput-optimal scheme in stability sense.}},

Abstract = {{In Part I of this paper ({''}Delay-Optimal Dynamic Mode Selection and

   allocation for an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
   cellular network with device-to-device (D2D) communications to minimize
   the average end-to-end delay performance under the dropping probability
   constraint. We formulated the optimal resource control problem into an
   infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process
   (CMDP), and the optimal control policy derived in Part I using the
   brute-force offline value iteration algorithm based on the reduced-state
   equivalent Bellman equation still faces the well-known
   curse-of-dimensionality problem, which limits its practical application
   in realistic scenarios with multiple D2D users and cellular users. In
   Part II of this paper, we use linear value approximation techniques to
   further reduce the state space. Moreover, an online stochastic learning
   algorithm with two timescales is applied to update the value functions
   and Lagrangian multipliers (LMs) based on the real-time observations of
   channel state information (CSI) and queue state information (QSI). The
   combined online stochastic learning solution converges almost surely to
   a global optimal solution under some realistic conditions. Simulation
   results show that the proposed approach achieves nearly the same
   performance as the offline value iteration algorithm and outperforms the
   conventional CSI-only scheme and through-put-optimal scheme in a

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the cost-effectiveness of a Wi-Fi solution
   for vehicular Internet access. We define the cost-effectiveness as the
   cost saving by deploying and operating a low-cost Wi-Fi infrastructure
   instead of a costly benchmark cellular network. To characterize the
   service quality of Wi-Fi deployment, we also define the normalized
   service delay (NSD), which is the service time to fulfill a data
   application via the Wi-Fi network normalized by that via the cellular
   network. To derive the service time, we analyze the average throughput
   capacity of a generic vehicle in the Wi-Fi network and the average
   down-link capacity in the cellular network. In particular, we propose
   deploying Wi-Fi access point (AP) at signalized intersection and study
   the fundamental influence of traffic signals (which yield an interrupted
   vehicle traffic) on Wi-Fi access. Then, we examine the tradeoff between
   cost-effectiveness and NSD by identifying interplays between
   controllable (e.g., the density of Wi-Fi deployment and user's
   satisfaction) and uncontrollable parameters (e.g., vehicle traffic
   statistics). Our results are very useful for network operators to make
   strategic planning of Wi-Fi deployment for vehicular Internet Access.}},

Abstract = {{In general, an access point (AP) in wireless local area networks (WLANs)
   can be easily congested since all related data traffic goes through it.
   To satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement for its customers, a
   protocol-independent redundancy elimination (RE) technique can
   effectively mitigate the congestion at the AP by reducing redundant data
   traffic. In this paper, we propose an overhearing-aided RE (OARE) scheme
   for multirate WLANs by leveraging the broadcast nature of a wireless
   medium. In OARE, the AP estimates overhearing probabilities of partially
   sliced chunks from an incoming packet for a destination mobile terminal
   by considering an adaptive modulation and coding technique. Then, the
   original packet is encoded by means of RE to minimize its transfer time
   to the destination, depending on the estimated overhearing
   probabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that OARE can
   reduce the packet transfer time by 7.8\%-23.2\%, compared with non-RE
   (or nonencoded) transmissions.}},

Abstract = {{When learning about a single topic in natural reading environments,
   readers are confronted with multiple sources varying in the type and
   amount of information. In this situation, readers are free to adaptively
   respond to the constraints of the environment (e.g., through selection
   of resources and time allocation for study), but there may be costs of
   exploring and switching between sources (e.g., disruption of attention,
   opportunity costs for study). From an ecological perspective, such
   properties of the environment are expected to influence learning
   strategies. In the current study, we used a novel reading paradigm to
   investigate age differences in the effects of information richness
   (i.e., sentence elaboration) and costs of switching between texts (i.e.,
   time delay) on selection of sources and study time allocation.
   Consistent with the ecological view, participants progressed from less
   informative to more informative texts. Furthermore, increased switch
   cost led to a tendency to allocate more effort to easier materials and
   to greater persistence in reading, which in turn, led to better memory
   in both immediate and delayed recall. Older adults showed larger effects
   of switch cost, such that the age difference in delayed recall was
   eliminated in the high switch cost condition. Based on an ecological
   paradigm of reading that affords choice and self-regulation, our study
   provided evidence for preservation with age in the ability to adapt to
   changing learning environments so as to improve performance.}},

Abstract = {{The Sharm El-Sheikh area is one of the most attractive touristic resorts
   in Egypt and in the world in general. The Sharm El-Shiekh area is
   located at the arid region of the South Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Water
   desalination is considered the main freshwater supply for hotels and
   resorts. Scarcity of rainfall during the last decades, high pumping
   rates, disposal of reject brine water back into the aquifer, and
   seawater intrusion have resulted in the degradation of groundwater
   quality in the main aquifer. Water chemistry, stable isotopes, Seawater
   Mixing Index (SWMI), and factorial analyses were utilized to determine
   the main recharge and salinization sources as well as to estimate the
   mixing ratios between different end members affecting groundwater
   salinity in the aquifer. The groundwater of the Miocene aquifer is
   classified into two groups: group I represents 10 \% of the total
   samples, has a moderately high saline groundwater, and is mostly
   affected by seawater intrusion. Group II represents 90 \% of the total
   samples and has a high groundwater salinity due to the anthropological
   impact of the reject brine saline water deeper into the Miocene aquifer.
   The main groundwater recharge comes from the western watershed mountain
   and the elevated plateau while the seawater and reject brine are
   considering the main sources for groundwater salinization. The mixing
   ratios between groundwater recharge, seawater, and reject brine water
   were calculated using water chemistry and isotopes. The calculated
   mixing ratios of group I range between 25 and 84 \% recharge groundwater
   to 75 and 16 \% seawater, respectively, in groundwater located close to
   the western watershed mountain indicating further extension of seawater
   intrusion. However, the mixing percentages of group II range between 21
   and 88 \% reject brine water to 79 and 12 \% seawater, respectively, in
   groundwater located close to the desalination plants. The outcomes and
   conclusion of this study highlight the importance of groundwater
   management to limit further groundwater deterioration of the Miocene
   groundwater aquifer and limit seawater intrusion along the coast.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous nitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal was
   achieved in a single-sludge continuous flow bioreactor. The upright

   bacteria of the Saprospiraceae class may have been responsible for the
   successful nutrient removal in this bioreactor. The successive
   anoxic-aerobic stages of the bioreactor with upright alignment along
   with a 60 L BF created a unique ecosystem for the growth of nitrifier,
   denitrifiers, phosphorus accumulating organisms and denitrifying
   phosphorus accumulating organisms. Furthermore, total nitrogen to
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio and total phosphorus to COD ratio of
   0.6 and 0.034, respectively, confirmed the comparative advantages of
   this advanced nutrient removal process relative to both sequencing batch
   reactors and activated sludge processes. The process yielded 95\%

Abstract = {{To expand the chemical and molecular diversity of biotransformation
   using whole-cell biocatalysts, we genetically engineered a pathway in
   Escherichia coli for heterologous production of butanone, an important
   commodity ketone. First, a 1-propanol-producing E. coli host strain with
   its sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) operon being activated was used to
   increase the pool of propionyl-coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA). Subsequently,
   molecular heterofusion of propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA was conducted to
   yield 3-ketovaleryl-CoA via a CoA-dependent elongation pathway. Lastly,
   3-ketovaleryl-CoA was channeled into the clostridial acetone formation
   pathway for thioester hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation to form
   butanone. Biochemical, genetic, and metabolic factors affecting relative
   levels of ketogenesis, acidogenesis, and alcohologenesis under selected
   fermentative culture conditions were investigated. Using the engineered
   E. coli strain for batch cultivation with 30 g liter(-1) glycerol as the
   carbon source, we achieved coproduction of 1.3 g liter(-1) butanone and
   2.9 g liter(-1) acetone. The results suggest that approximately 42\% of
   spent glycerol was utilized for ketone biosynthesis, and thus they
   demonstrate potential industrial applicability of this microbial
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{Waterborne illness related to the consumption of contaminated or
   inadequately treated water is a global public health concern. Although
   the magnitude of drinking water-related illnesses in developed countries
   is lower than that observed in developing regions of the world, drinking
   water is still responsible for a proportion of all cases of acute
   gastrointestinal illness (AGI) in Canada. The estimated burden of
   endemic AGI in Canada is 20.5 million cases annually - this estimate
   accounts for under-reporting and under-diagnosis. About 4 million of
   these cases are domestically acquired and foodborne, yet the proportion
   of waterborne cases is unknown. There is evidence that individuals
   served by private systems and small community systems may be more at
   risk of waterborne illness than those served by municipal drinking water
   systems in Canada. However, little is known regarding the contribution
   of these systems to the overall drinking water-related AGI burden in
   Canada. Private water supplies serve an estimated 12\% of the Canadian
   population, or similar to 4.1 million people. An estimated 1.4 million
   (4.1\%) people in Canada are served by small groundwater (2.6\%) and
   surface water (1.5\%) supplies. The objective of this research is to
   estimate the number of AGI cases attributable to water consumption from
   these supplies in Canada using a quantitative microbial risk assessment
   (QMRA) approach. This provides a framework for others to develop burden
   of waterborne illness estimates for small water supplies. A
   multi-pathogen QMRA of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter, E. coli
   O157 and norovirus, chosen as index waterborne pathogens, for various
   source water and treatment combinations was performed. It is estimated
   that 103 230 AGI cases per year are due to the presence of these five
   pathogens in drinking water from private and small community water
   systems in Canada. In addition to providing a mechanism to assess the
   potential burden of AGI attributed to small systems and private well
   water in Canada, this research supports the use of QMRA as an effective
   source attribution tool when there is a lack of randomized controlled
   trial data to evaluate the public health risk of an exposure source.
   QMRA is also a powerful tool for identifying existing knowledge gaps on
   the national scale to inform future surveillance and research efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Driver inattentiveness constitutes the main cause of road accidents,
   which makes it a major factor in road safety. In this paper, we propose
   a comprehensive framework to address the road safety problem by tackling
   it from a high-level information fusion standpoint, considering
   vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) as the deployment platform. The
   proposed framework relies on the multientity Bayesian networks (MEBNs),
   which exploit the expressiveness of first-order logic for semantic
   relations, and the strength of the Bayesian networks in handling
   uncertainty. First, the entities that influence the inattention
   phenomenon, as well as both their causal and semantic relationships, are
   identified. Next, an MEBN-based high-level information fusion framework
   is proposed through which entities, situations, and their relationships
   in specific contexts are modeled using MEBN fragments. Furthermore, MEBN
   inference is used to assess the situations of interest by estimating
   their states. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework,
   a collision warning system simulator has been developed, which evaluates
   the likelihood of a vehicle being in a near-collision situation using a
   wide variety of local and global information sources available in
   various VANET environments. If the threat of being in a near-collision
   situation is determined to be high, then the driver is warned
   accordingly. Our experimental results for two distinct single-vehicle
   and multivehicle categories of driving scenarios, as well as a novel
   hybrid MEBN inference, demonstrate the capability of the proposed
   framework to efficiently achieve situation and threat assessment on the
   road.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient location-aware clone
   detection protocol in densely deployed WSNs, which can guarantee
   successful clone attack detection and maintain satisfactory network
   lifetime. Specifically, we exploit the location information of sensors
   and randomly select witnesses located in a ring area to verify the
   legitimacy of sensors and to report detected clone attacks. The ring
   structure facilitates energy-efficient data forwarding along the path
   towards the witnesses and the sink. We theoretically prove that the
   proposed protocol can achieve 100 percent clone detection probability
   with trustful witnesses. We further extend the work by studying the
   clone detection performance with untrustful witnesses and show that the
   clone detection probability still approaches 98 percent when 10 percent
   of witnesses are compromised. Moreover, in most existing clone detection
   protocols with random witness selection scheme, the required buffer
   storage of sensors is usually dependent on the node density, i.e.,
   O(root n), while in our proposed protocol, the required buffer storage
   of sensors is independent of n but a function of the hop length of the
   network radius h, i.e., O(h). Extensive simulations demonstrate that our
   proposed protocol can achieve long network lifetime by effectively
   distributing the traffic load across the network.}},

Abstract = {{Cosserat (micropolar, asymmetric) elasticity can better predict the
   mechanical behavior of the materials with a characteristic length scale
   than the classical theory of elasticity. However, the area of fracture
   modelling in a Cosserat medium is not widely presented in the
   literature. The simulation of cracks in a Cosserat medium using the
   eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is presented in this paper. The
   proper crack tip enrichment of the translational and microrotational
   fields is important for the robustness and efficiency of the
   XFEM/Cosserat model. Using the example of an edge crack of the Mode I in
   this paper, we have shown that the values of the J-integral for the
   Cosserat solid are higher than those for the equivalent classical
   elastic solid. The difference becomes significant for the cases of
   materials with strong micropolar properties. The dependence of the
   fracture behavior of the crack of different sizes on the Cosserat
   elastic constants was found to be significant. Therefore, it is
   recommended that the special tip enrichment is considered for the
   microrotational field, and a careful analysis of the material parameters
   is performed in order to model fracture in a Cosserat medium.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor nanowires are nanoscale structures holding promise in many
   fields such as optoelectronics, quantum computing, and thermoelectrics.
   Nanowires are usually grown vertically on (111)-oriented substrates,

   grow and to control impurity doping of (100) nanowires is crucial for
   integration. Here, we discuss doping of single-crystalline < 100 >
   nanowires, and the structural and optoelectronic properties of p-n
   junctions based on < 100 > InP nanowires. We describe a novel approach
   to achieve low resistance electrical contacts to nanowires via a gradual
   interface based on p-doped InAsP. As a first demonstration in
   optoelectronic devices, we realize a single nanowire light emitting
   diode in a < 100 >-oriented InP nanowire p-n junction. To obtain high
   vertical yield, which is necessary for future applications, we
   investigate the effect of the introduction of dopants on the nanowire

Abstract = {{One of the most important mandates of physical joint simulators is to
   provide test results that allow the implant manufacturer to anticipate
   and perhaps avoid clinical wear problems with their new products. This
   is best done before market release. This study gives four steps to
   follow in conducting such wear simulator testing. Two major examples
   involving hip wear simulators are discussed in which attempts had been
   made to predict clinical wear performance prior to market release. The
   second one, involving the DePuy ASR implant systems, is chosen for more
   extensive treatment by making it an illustrative example to explore
   whether wear simulator testing can anticipate clinical wear problems. It
   is concluded that hip wear simulator testing did provide data in the
   academic literature that indicated some risk of clinical wear problems
   prior to market release of the ASR implant systems. This supports the
   idea that physical joint simulators have an important role in the
   pre-market testing of new joint replacement implants.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a clinically accepted surgical
   procedure; however, its long-term wear performance is not known. The
   purpose of this work is to review wear simulator testing of reverse
   total shoulder arthroplasty, to develop a wear simulator protocol for
   reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, and to test it by performing a
   pilot study. The review of wear simulator testing in the literature
   revealed considerable variation in protocols. A combination of our own
   cadaveric testing and those of other research groups helped in
   determining the magnitude and direction of joint loading for the
   development of the present protocol. A MATCO orbital-bearing simulator
   was adapted using custom fixtures to simulate a circumduction motion of
   the shoulder under mildly adverse conditions, and a pilot study gave
   wear rates within the wide range found in the literature. Arguments were
   presented in support of the currently developed protocol, but it was
   also suggested that, rather than rely on one protocol, a series of
   simulator wear protocols should be developed to fully test the implant

Abstract = {{Due to technology scaling, the design of the conventional-type
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which uses an operational amplifier
   as one of its building blocks, becomes more difficult. In this brief,
   new techniques to design time-based ADC (TADC), which uses a
   voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), are proposed. The VCO is followed
   by a time-to-digital converter, implemented in a Sigma Delta
   architecture. A novel architecture, using a multibit, nonlinear internal
   quantizer and a feedback digital-to-time converter, implemented by using
   phase interpolation, is employed to compensate the nonlinear transfer
   curve of the VCO. Dynamic element matching and calibration are used to
   improve the robustness of the TADC against mismatch. The TADC uses an
   implicit sample and hold that relaxes the bounds on input frequency. A
   TADC implemented in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology achieves a measured
   signal-to-noise + distortion ratio of 60.2 dB and a dynamic range of 11
   b for a bandwidth of 2 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an outage analysis for a two-user parallel Gaussian
   interference channel consisting of two sub-channels. Each sub-channel is
   modeled as a two-user Gaussian interference channel with quasi-static
   and flat fading. Both users employ single-layer Gaussian code-books and
   maintain a statistical correlation. between the signals transmitted over
   the underlying sub-channels. When joint decoding (JD) is performed at
   the receivers, setting rho = 0 minimizes the outage probability,
   regardless of the value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown,
   however, that if the receivers treat interference as noise (TIN) or
   cancel interference (CI), the value of optimum. approaches 1 as SNR goes
   to infinity. Motivated by these observations, we let. = 0 under JD and.
   = 1 under TIN and CI and compute the outage probability in finite SNR,
   assuming that the direct and crossover channel coefficients are
   independent zero-mean complex Gaussian random variables with possibly
   different variances. In the asymptote of large SNR and assuming the
   transmission rate per user is r log snr, it is shown that the outage
   probability scales like snr(-(1-r)) under both TIN and CI, while it
   vanishes at least as fast as snr(-min\{2-r, 4(1-r)\}) log snr under JD.
   This paper is concluded by extending some of the results to a two-user
   parallel Gaussian interference channel with an arbitrary number of
   sub-channels.}},

Abstract = {{With the ever-increasing demands on multimedia applications, cloud
   computing, due to its economical but powerful resources, is becoming a
   natural platform to process, store, and share multimedia contents.
   However, the employment of cloud computing also brings new security and
   privacy issues as few public cloud servers can be fully trusted by
   users. In this paper, we focus on how to securely share video contents
   to a certain group of people during a particular time period in
   cloud-based multimedia systems, and propose a cryptographic approach, a
   provably secure time-domain attribute-based access control (TAAC)
   scheme, to secure the cloud-based video content sharing. Specifically,
   we first propose a provably secure time-domain attribute-based
   encryption scheme by embedding the time into both the ciphertexts and
   the keys, such that only users who hold sufficient attributes in a
   specific time slot can decrypt the video contents. We also propose an
   efficient attribute updating method to achieve the dynamic change of
   users' attributes, including granting new attributes, revoking previous
   attributes, and regranting previously revoked attributes. We further
   discuss on how to control those video contents that can be commonly
   accessed in multiple time slots and how to make special queries on video
   contents generated in previous time slots. The security analysis and
   performance evaluation show that TAAC is provably secure in generic
   group model and efficient in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new formulation for the optimum reconfiguration of
   islanded microgrid (IMG) systems. The reconfiguration problem is casted
   as a multi-objective optimization problem, in order to: 1) minimize the
   IMG fuel consumption in the operational planning horizon for which
   islanded operation is planned; 2) ensure the IMG capability to feed the
   maximum possible demand by enhancing its voltage instability proximity
   index taken over all the states at which the islanded system may reside;
   and 3) minimize the relevant switching operation costs. The proposed
   problem formulation takes into consideration the system's operational
   constraints in all operating conditions based on the consideration of
   the uncertainty associated with renewable resources output power and
   load variability. Moreover, the proposed formulation accounts for droop
   controlled IMG special operational characteristics as well as the
   availability/unavailability of a supervisory microgrid central
   controller (MGCC). The formulated problem is solved using non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). MATLAB environment has been used
   to test and validate the proposed problem formulation. The results show
   that the implementation of appropriate IMG reconfiguration problem
   formulations will enhance the performance of IMG systems and facilitate
   a successful integration of the microgrid concept in distribution
   networks.}},

Title = {{Algorithm for Determining the Criticality of Documents within a
   Construction Information System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{During a construction project, it is important to ensure that accurate
   and pertinent knowledge is delivered on time to appropriate personnel.
   The criticality of documents exchanged or referred to by various
   parties, evolves over the course of the project life cycle. Determining
   the criticality of documents at different stages of the project can aid
   companies with managing the flow of information in an organized manner,
   while providing for the detection of potentially disruptive, erroneous
   material that could result in delays and costs. Therefore, it is crucial
   to determine documents that have the potential to disrupt a process, so
   that they may be prevented from entering or interfering with the active
   flow of information in a project. Electronic product and process
   management (EPPM) systems provide the capability to establish and map
   information flow between different parties in a construction project.
   Analyzing an EPPM system may yield information about the criticality of
   certain documents within an activity, as well as isolate characteristics
   peculiar to documents, which can assist in risk mitigation. A
   methodology is proposed to identify such critical documents. Four
   factors were identified based upon metadata, structure, and historical
   data recorded for documents within an EPPM system to determine the
   criticality of documents over a construction project life cycle. The
   factors and a combined score were calculated for a model project
   scenario-based simulation within a full-scale EPPM system and
   anticipated problematic documents were identified. It was therefore
   functionally demonstrated that determining critical construction
   documents via document metadata and access history records is feasible
   and may contribute to both industry and the academic body of knowledge
   for document classification. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Volume = {{536}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Accurate projection of global warming on the probabilistic behavior of
   hydro-climate variables is one of the main challenges in climate change
   impact assessment studies. Due to the complexity of climate associated
   processes, different sources of uncertainty influence the projected
   behavior of hydro climate variables in regression-based statistical
   downscaling procedures. The current study presents a comprehensive
   methodology to improve the predictive power of the procedure to provide
   improved projections. It does this by minimizing the uncertainty sources
   arising from the high-dimensionality of atmospheric predictors, the
   complex and nonlinear relationships between hydro-climate predictands
   and atmospheric predictors, as well as the biases that exist in climate
   model simulations. To address the impact of the high dimensional feature
   spaces, a supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm is
   presented that is able to capture the nonlinear variability among
   projectors through extracting a sequence of principal components that
   have maximal dependency with the target hydro-climate variables. Two
   soft-computing nonlinear machine-learning methods, Support Vector
   Regression (SVR) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), are engaged to
   capture the nonlinear relationships between predictand and atmospheric
   predictors. To correct the spatial and temporal biases over multiple
   time scales in the GCM predictands, the Multivariate Recursive Nesting
   Bias Correction (MRNBC) approach is used. The results demonstrate that
   this combined approach significantly improves the downscaling procedure
   in terms of precipitation projection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dental burs are used extensively in dentistry to mechanically prepare
   tooth structures for restorations (fillings), yet little has been
   reported on the bur debris left behind in the teeth, and whether it
   poses potential health risks to patients. Here it is aimed to image
   dental bur debris under dental fillings, and allude to the potential
   health hazards that can be caused by this debris when left in direct
   contact with the biological surroundings, specifically when the debris
   is made of a non-biocompatible material. Non-destructive micro-computed
   tomography using the BioMedical Imaging \& Therapy facility 05ID-2
   beamline at the Canadian Light Source was pursued at 50 keV and at a
   pixel size of 4 mm to image dental bur fragments under a composite resin
   dental filling. The bur's cutting edges that produced the fragment were
   also chemically analyzed. The technique revealed dental bur fragments of
   different sizes in different locations on the floor of the prepared
   surface of the teeth and under the filling, which places them in direct
   contact with the dentinal tubules and the dentinal fluid circulating
   within them. Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental analysis of the
   dental bur edges revealed that the fragments are made of tungsten

Abstract = {{The design of water distribution networks (WDNs) is a complex nonlinear
   problem that has been solved using optimization techniques attempting to
   find near-globally optimal solutions. This paper demonstrates that
   relying on engineering judgment, with very limited use of optimization,
   can generate reasonable quality approximations of the Pareto front of
   multiobjective WDN design problems without intensive computational
   requirements. First the results of the implementation of a previous
   implementation of the engineering judgment approach to the Battle of
   Background Leakage Assessment for Water Networks (BBLAWN) design
   competition is summarized. Additionally, a simplified version of the
   BBLAWN problem is solved using both the engineering judgment approach
   and a multiobjective optimization algorithm and the corresponding Pareto
   fronts are compared. Relative to other BBLAWN solutions, the engineering
   judgment solution produced a high-quality result with a very small
   computational budget and was able to identify a more realistic number of
   changes in the WDN (similar to 10\% of the network) compared with BBLAWN
   teams relying on global optimization algorithms. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{We experimentally compared the reflectance between ordered and

   modes. For similar diameters, the resonance peaks for the ordered
   nanowires at a spacing of 400 nm was at a shorter wavelength than the
   disordered nanowires, consistent to the excitation of photonic crystal
   modes. Furthermore, the resonant wavelength didn't shift while changing
   the density of the disordered nanowires, whereas there was a significant
   shift observed in the ordered ones. At an ordered spacing of 800 nm, the
   resonance wavelength approached that of the disordered structures,
   indicating that the ordered structures were starting to behave like
   individual waveguides. To our knowledge, this is the first direct
   experimental observation of photonic crystal modes in vertical periodic

Abstract = {{The effect of an Al-Si coating on the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of fiber laser-welded, press-hardened steel is examined in
   the present work. It is shown that mixing of the Al-Si coating
   significantly modified the fusion zone microstructure, which was found
   to be a combination of martensite and delta ferrite in both the welded
   as-received and hot-stamped conditions. In contrast, a uniform
   distribution of alpha ferrite and martensite was observed when the
   as-received sheet was welded then hot stamped. The ferrite phase was
   found to be rich in Al and Si, which retarded the kinetics of martensite
   formation, increasing the ferrite fraction after hot stamping of the
   welded coupon. Micro- and nano-scale hardness measurements on ferrite
   suggest it is a softer phase compared to martensite; therefore, inducing
   strain localization and premature fracture during tensile tests
   occurred. The strength of all-welded joints was found to be dependent on
   ferrite phase fractions, since this promoted premature fracture, and
   deteriorated joint strength and ductility.}},

Title = {{An optimal power management system for a regenerative auxiliary power
   system for delivery refrigerator trucks}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{748-756}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Engine idling of refrigerator trucks during loading and unloading
   contributes to greenhouse gas emissions due to their increased fuel
   consumption. This paper proposes a new anti-idling system that uses two
   sources of power, battery and engine-driven generator, to run the
   compressor of the refrigeration system. Therefore, idling can be
   eliminated because the engine is turned OFF and the battery supplies
   auxiliary power when the vehicle is stopped for loading or unloading.
   This system also takes advantage of regenerative braking for increased
   fuel savings. The power management of this system needs to satisfy two
   requirements: it must minimize fuel consumption in the whole cycle and
   must ensure that the battery has enough energy for powering the
   refrigeration system when the engine is OFF. To meet these objectives, a
   two-level controller is proposed. In the higher level of this
   controller, a fast dynamic programming technique that utilizes extracted
   statistical features of drive and duty cycles of a refrigerator truck is
   used to find suboptimal values of the initial and final SOC of any two
   consecutive loading/unloading stops. The lower level of the controller
   employs an adaptive equivalent fuel consumption minimization (A-ECMS) to
   determine the split ratio of auxiliary power between the generator and
   battery for each segment with initial and final SOC obtained by the
   high-level controller. The simulation results confirm that this new
   system can eliminate idling of refrigerator trucks and reduce their fuel
   consumption noticeably such that the cost of replacing components is
   recouped in a short period of time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, polyetherimide-graphene composites (PEI/G) were prepared

   Various loadings of graphene were incorporated in the polyetherimide

   loading on corrosion inhibition and the long-term performance of the

   that PEI/G nanocomposites provide advanced corrosion inhibition of
   copper. This conclusion was supported by the results of various
   electrochemical techniques such as Tafel polarization and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition to corrosion
   protection, the long-term performance of the coatings was confirmed by
   testing the adhesion of PEI/G composites to copper substrates before

Abstract = {{The authors have investigated various photonic processing for various
   energy devices on flexible substrates with nanoinks. For printable
   electronics, different conducting nanoinks are developed, including
   silver nanowires, silver nanoplates, Cu-Ag core-shell nanoparticles,
   graphene oxide, and graphene. The authors showed that these inks are
   enabling for direct writing of antenna on paper for radio frequency (RF)
   energy harvesting, potentially for wireless charging application. For
   curing printed nanoinks and nanopastes, the authors compared four kinds
   of methods: chemical activated self-sintering, thermal sintering,
   photonic sintering with flash light, and athermal sintering with
   ultrafast fiber laser irradiation. The authors also developed an
   innovative and facile approach to fabricate supercapacitors on flexible
   substrates with femtosecond laser writing and photonic reduction.
   Aureduced graphene oxide nanocomposite is used for electrical electrodes
   and collectors. Unlike previous studies, collectors are fabricated
   through conventional photolithography gold electrodes is directly
   written by femtosecond laser reduction of Au ions. The authors found
   that gold nanoparticles can be well sintered on the surface of reduced
   graphene. The reduced graphene also work as glues to bridge the
   electrical interconnection. The measured conductivity of Au/reduced
   graphene reaches 10\% of that of bulk gold. By optimizing an
   interdigital structure, the areal capacitor is achieved as 1.5 mF/cm(2).

Abstract = {{Wake vortex shedding topology of a cylinder undergoing vortex-induced
   vibrations (VIV) is investigated experimentally. Vibration measurements
   and flow visualization are utilized to study the connection between the
   cylinder response and the wake topology. The experiments were performed
   for two different orientations of the elliptic trajectories relative to
   the incoming flow at a fixed Reynolds number, moment of inertia ratio,
   mass ratio, and reduced velocity. Similar to the classical 2P regime,
   two counter-rotating vortex pairs are produced per oscillating cycle for
   both cases of elliptic trajectories examined here. However, significant
   changes in wake vortex dynamics are observed along the cylinder span.
   These changes include merging of vortices, which leads to shedding
   patterns similar to 2S and P+S modes downstream of the vortex formation
   region. The observed changes in vortex dynamics are accompanied by
   splitting of spanwise vortex filament and are attributed primarily to
   the changes in the local amplitude of vibrations along the span of the
   pivoted cylinder. It is shown that, being dependent on both the local
   amplitude of vibrations and vortex dynamics, the observed wake topology
   cannot be captured by the classical map of shedding regimes developed
   for VIV of one degree-of-freedom (DOF) cylinders.}},

   or exposing the coating to HCl vapors for a brief period < 30 min, the
   conductivity of the coating could be improved dramatically, reaching a
   conductivity as high as similar to 3.8 x 10(4) S/cm. To investigate the
   mechanism, different solutions (acid, alkali and salts) were tested. The
   results indicated that both the Cl- and H+ ions were responsible for the
   increased conductivity, likely by partially replacing or removing the
   lubricant layers coated on the silver flakes. Furthermore, we applied
   this method to fabricate flexible electrical circuits by embedding
   silver patterns in plastic sheets or polydimethylsiloxane elastomers.
   The resultant circuits were conductive and bendable without losing
   conductivity, showing a good potential application in soft electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The electric assist control strategy is one of the well-known methods
   for managing the power sources of hybrid electric vehicles. Because of
   the dependence of the electric assist control strategy approach on its
   parameters, optimization of this strategy can improve its performance,
   which results in lower fuel consumption and lower emission levels.
   However, one of the main concerns about optimization of this strategy is
   its dependence on the driving behaviour. This paper aims to propose a
   new control strategy based on the electric assist control strategy with
   a smaller number of control parameters and less dependence on the
   driving behaviour. This strategy is usable only for vehicles equipped
   with a continuously variable transmission. In this strategy, the
   engine's operating point is determined by considering its best point in
   terms of the fuel consumption and the emissions, and also the
   high-efficiency region of the powertrain. After optimization of the
   proposed strategy and the electric assist control strategy approach, the
   methods are compared. It is shown that the proposed strategy provides a
   better performance in terms of the fuel consumption and the emissions
   during all the considered driving cycles. Moreover, it is demonstrated
   that the performance of the proposed strategy has less dependence on the
   driving-cycle pattern because fewer parameters are used than in the
   electric assist control strategy. This feature makes the devised control
   strategy desirable for real-world conditions where the vehicle undergoes
   various driving patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a general
   technique that allows for precise and highly sensitive measurements.
   These measurements may provide a complete and accurate thermodynamic
   description of association processes in complex systems such as
   colloidal mixtures.
   Scope of the review: This review will address uses of ITC for studies of
   surfactant aggregation to form micelles, with emphasis on the
   thermodynamic studies of homologous surfactant series. We will also
   review studies on surfactant association with polymers of different
   molecular characteristics and with colloidal particles.
   General significance: ITC studies on the association of different
   homologous series of surfactants provide quantitative information on
   independent contribution from their apolar hydrocarbon chains and polar
   headgroups to the different thermodynamic functions associated with
   micellization (Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy). Studies on
   surfactant association to polymers by ITC provide a comprehensive
   description of the association process, including examples in which
   particular features revealed by ITC were elucidated by using ancillary
   techniques such as light or X-ray scattering measurements. Examples of
   uses of ITC to follow surfactant association to biomolecules such as
   proteins or DNA, or nanoparticles are also highlighted. Finally, recent
   theoretical models that were proposed to analyze ITC data in terms of
   binding/association processes are discussed.
   Major conclusions: This review stresses the importance of using direct
   calorimetric measurements to obtain and report accurate thermodynamic
   data, even in complex systems. These data, whenever possible, should be
   confirmed and associated with other ancillary techniques that allow
   elucidation of the nature of the transformations detected by
   calorimetric results, providing a complete description of the process
   under scrutiny. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled

Title = {{Function approximation in inhibitory networks}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{95-106}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In performance-optimized artificial neural networks, such as
   convolutional networks, each neuron makes excitatory connections with
   some of its targets and inhibitory connections with others. In contrast,
   physiological neurons are typically either excitatory or inhibitory, not
   both. This is a puzzle, because it seems to constrain computation, and
   because there are several counter-examples that suggest that it may not
   be a physiological necessity. Parisien et al. (2008) showed that any
   mixture of excitatory and inhibitory functional connections could be
   realized by a purely excitatory projection in parallel with a
   two-synapse projection through an inhibitory population. They showed
   that this works well with ratios of excitatory and inhibitory neurons
   that are realistic for the neocortex, suggesting that perhaps the cortex
   efficiently works around this apparent computational constraint.
   Extending this work, we show here that mixed excitatory and inhibitory
   functional connections can also be realized in networks that are
   dominated by inhibition, such as those of the basal ganglia. Further, we
   show that the function-approximation capacity of such connections is
   comparable to that of idealized mixed-weight connections. We also study
   whether such connections are viable in recurrent networks, and find that
   such recurrent networks can flexibly exhibit a wide range of dynamics.
   These results offer a new perspective on computation in the basal
   ganglia, and also perhaps on inhibitory networks within the cortex. (C)

Abstract = {{Considering the special place of aromatic diazo compounds in

   solvents. The chromophores of the cross-linkers are stable in protic and
   some certain aprotic solvents and remain stable after cross-linking. The
   chemical structure of this class allows one to have a cross-linker with
   tuned chemical reactivity and solubility with post-linking
   applicability. The cross-linkers are obtained from reactions with simple
   chemistry in high yields and are able to participate in radical and

Abstract = {{A physics-based multi-scale progressive damage model was developed for

   Computational micromechanics was coupled within a continuum damage

   sub-critical damage evolution and stiffness degradation of the blade

   multi-scale nature of damage in rotor blades. The quasi-static and
   fatigue simulation results demonstrate the ability of the model to
   predict the evolution of damage in the critical regions of the blade
   structure, which is an important contribution and essential for
   increasing the accuracy of damage tolerance analyses and for
   certification of composite structures. A parametric study of blade

Abstract = {{This paper studies some HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) models with
   switching parameters and pulse control. By taking into account of the
   effects of reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) drugs, protease
   inhibitor (PI) drugs and the variable transmission rate, we propose a
   new HIV model with switching parameters and derive a general threshold
   value that measures the persistence of the disease. Furthermore, pulse
   vaccination is applied to the HIV model and some novel threshold
   conditions are established to ensure the existence and stability of the
   periodic infection-free solution. In contrast to the standard HIV
   models, it is shown that our proposed models are more practical and
   useful. Moreover, pulse vaccination strategies are proven to be more
   effective in determining whether or not the disease is eradicated.
   Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of
   the obtained results, and future research directions are suggested. (C)

Abstract = {{Driving safety is among the most important factors in the design of next
   generation vehicles as an integral component of Intelligent
   Transportation Systems. Crash avoidance and reduction of potential
   subsequent fatalities require timely delivery of sensitive and pertinent
   safety information for the drivers. Hence, the driver can become aware
   of the current driving situation, and can consequently, take appropriate
   decisions to avoid potentially imminent hazards. In this paper, we
   propose a comprehensive survey on situation awareness within the context
   of connected vehicles and Internet of Cars (also called here as
   connected cars). We provide context for the Internet of Cars and
   highlight its major features. Furthermore, situation awareness in the
   Internet of Cars is explored through presenting an in-depth discussion
   on its different components. Various aspects of high and low level
   information fusions are described within this context. Besides, major
   methods/models in situation awareness are linked to the main aspects of
   each component, and an overall comparison between them is reported.
   Moreover, on-the-road safety frameworks incorporating situation
   awareness are highlighted. Finally, the challenging issues and the
   emerging trends that shall be faced by the research community are
   addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the problem of designing stochastic sampled-data
   controller for master-slave synchronization of chaotic Lure systems
   (CLSs) via a novel approach. Specially, first, we assume that the
   occurrence probabilities of the sampling intervals are fixed constants
   and satisfy a Bernoulli distribution. In order to take full advantage of
   the sawtooth structure characteristics of the sampling input delay, we
   construct a newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) based
   on the extended Wirtinger inequality. Second, by using a novel
   free-matrix-based integral inequality (FMBII) including well-known
   integral inequalities as special cases, an exponentially mean-square
   synchronization criterion is proposed for analyzing the corresponding
   synchronization error system. Third, the desired estimator gain can be
   designed in terms of the solution to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
   which can be solved effectively by using available software. Finally,
   three numerical simulation examples of Chua's circuit and neural network
   are given to illustrate the effectiveness and superiorities of the
   proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It has been reported that both chemical and physical surface
   patterns influence cellular behaviors, such as cell alignment and
   elongation. However, it still remains unclear how actin filament and
   microtubules (MTs) differentially respond to these patterns.
   Results: We examined the effects of chemical and physical patterns on
   cell elongation and alignment by observing actin filament and MTs of
   retinal pigment epithelium-1(RPE-1) cells, which were cultured on either
   fibronectin (FN)-line pattern (line width and spacing: 1 mu m) or
   FN-coated 1 mu m gratings with two different depths (0.35 or 1 mu m). On
   the surface with either FN-line pattern or micrograting structure, the
   cell aspect ratios were at least two times higher than those on the
   surface with no pattern. Cell elongation on the gratings depended on the
   depth of the gratings. Cell elongation and alignment on both FN-line
   pattern and 1 mu m gratings with 0.35 mu m depth were perturbed either
   by inhibition of actin polymerization or MT depletion, while cell
   elongation and alignment on 1 mu m gratings with 1 mu m depth were
   perturbed only by MT depletion.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the contribution of actin
   filaments and MTs to the elongation and alignment of epithelial cells on
   microgratings depends on the groove depth of these gratings.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two modes of hybrid anaerobic digestion (AD) bioreactor
   with built-in BESs (electrodes installed in liquid phase (R1) and sludge
   phase (R2)) were tested for identifying the effect of electrodes
   position on azo dye wastewater treatment. Alizarin yellow R (AYR) was
   used as a model dye. Decolorization efficiency of R1 was 90.41 +/-
   6.20\% at influent loading rate of 800 g-AYR/ m(3).d, which was 39\%
   higher than that of R2. The contribution of bioelectrochemical reduction
   to AYR decolorization (16.23 +/- 1.86\% for R1 versus 22.24 +/- 2.14\%
   for R2) implied that although azo dye was mainly removed in sludge zone,
   BES further improved the effluent quality, especially for R1 where
   electrodes were installed in liquid phase. The microbial communities in
   the electrode biofilms (dominant by Enterobacter) and sludge (dominant
   by Enterococcus) were well distinguished in R1, but they were similar in
   R2. These results suggest that electrodes installed in liquid phase in
   the anaerobic hybrid system are more efficient than that in sludge phase
   for azo dye removal, which give great inspirations for the application
   of AD-BES hybrid process for various refractory wastewaters treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Ceramic surface patterning is a promising method to reduce the residual
   stress of ceramic-metal joints, since it needs no complex multiple
   interlayer and is cost effective. However, literature shows that surface
   patterns previously examined for ceramic-metal brazing were at a
   millimeter scale, which limits the application and the degree of
   enhancement. In this study, femtosecond laser ablation was used to
   fabricate microscale periodic surface patterns (grooves) on ceramic
   surfaces. No defects or damage were induced during the ablation. The
   groove dimension was tunable by controlling ablation parameters. High
   temperature vacuum brazing of 304 stainless steel to the Al2O3 ceramic
   with surface grooves was performed using a commercial AgCuTi brazing
   filler metal. With properly designed surface grooves, the average joint
   strength was 66 MPa, 2.75 times of that of the flat-interface joints.
   Finite Element Analysis models combined with fracture path examination
   indicated that the redistribution of residual stress induced by periodic
   surface pattern accounted for the joint strength enhancement. (C) 2016

   air and water cooling forms MA, while furnace cooling does not. The
   increase in cooling rate decreases carbon diffusion to promote MA during
   air or water cooling. Faster cooling using water results in a change of
   MA morphology from slender to blocky. Both water and air cooled samples
   exhibit poor impact toughness in comparison to furnace cooling, with
   lower Charpy impact toughness occurring with a high percentage of blocky
   MA following water quenching. It is shown that MA deteriorates toughness

Abstract = {{The paper investigates resource allocation via power control for
   inter-cell interference (ICI) mitigation in an orthogonal frequency
   division multiple access-based cellular network. The proposed scheme is
   featured by a novel subcarrier assignment mechanism at a central

   power control scheme. We formulate the system optimization task into a
   constrained optimization problem for maximizing accepted users'
   requirements. To improve the computation efficiency, a fast yet
   effective heuristic approach is introduced for divide and conquer.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Thin films of long and short symmetric AB diblock copolymers are
   examined using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). We focus on hard
   confining walls with a preference for the A component, such that the
   lamellar domains orient parallel to the film with an even number nu of
   monolayers. For neat melts, confinement causes the lamellar period, D,
   to deviate from its bulk value, D-b, in order to be commensurate with
   the film thickness, i.e., L =nu D/2. For blends, however, the melt also
   has the option of macrophase separating into nu((l)) large and nu((s))
   small monolayers so as to provide a better fit, where L = nu
   D-(l)((l))/2 + nu D-(s)((s))/2. In addition to performing full SCFT
   calculations of the entire film, we develop a semi-analytical
   calculation for the coexistence of thick and thin monolayers that helps
   explain the complicated interplay between miscibility and
   commensurability.}},

Title = {{GLARM: Group-based lightweight authentication scheme for
   resource-constrained machine to machine communications}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{66-81}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Supporting a massive number of machine to machine (M2M) devices has been
   considered as an essential requirement in M2M communications. Meanwhile,
   cyber security is of paramount importance in M2M; if M2M devices cannot
   securely access the networks through efficient authentication, all
   applications involving M2M cannot be widely accepted. One of research
   challenges in M2M is group authentication since a large number of M2M
   devices accessing the network simultaneously will cause a severe
   authentication signaling congestion. To solve this problem, as well as
   reduce authentication overhead of the previous schemes based on public
   key cryptosystems, we propose a novel lightweight group authentication
   scheme for resource-constrained M2M (GLARM) under the 3GPP network
   architecture, which consists of two protocols that can achieve efficient
   and secure group authentication in the 3GPP access case and non-3GPP
   access case, respectively. GLARM can not only authenticate all M2M
   devices simultaneously, but also minimize the authentication overhead.
   The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the
   security goals, and prevent the various security threats. In addition,
   performance evaluation demonstrates its efficiency in terms of
   computation complexity and communication overhead. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Pages = {{4401-4412}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that media surface roughness enhances particle
   deposition numerous, but inconsistent, examples of this effect have been
   reported. Here, a new mathematical framework describing the effects of
   hydrodynamics and interaction forces on particle deposition on rough
   spherical collectors in absence of an energy barrier was developed and
   validated. In addition to quantifying DLVO force, the model includes
   improved descriptions of flow field profiles and hydrodynamic
   retardation functions. This work demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects
   can significantly alter particle deposition relative to expectations
   when only the DLVO force is considered. Moreover, the combined effects
   of hydrodynamics and interaction forces on particle deposition on rough,
   spherical media are not additive, but synergistic. Notably, the
   developed model's particle deposition predictions are in closer
   agreement with experimental observations than those from current models,
   demonstrating the importance of inclusion of roughness impacts in
   particle deposition description/simulation. Consideration of
   hydrodynamic contributions to particle deposition may help to explain
   discrepancies between model-based expectations and experimental outcomes
   and improve descriptions of particle deposition during physicochemical
   filtration in systems with nonsmooth collector surfaces.}},

   different CANDU reactor units. The proposed weighted least squares (WLS)
   regression model is linear in time as a function of flux and
   temperature, with a temperature-dependent variance function. The model
   predicts the shape of the observed diametral creep profiles very well,

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate a new optical platform by integrating
   hydrogenated amorphous silicon nanowire arrays with thin films deposited
   on transparent substrates like glass. A 535 nm thick thin. film is
   anisotropically etched to fabricate vertical nanowire. arrays of 100 nm
   diameter arranged in a square lattice. Adjusting the nanowire length,
   and consequently the thin. film thickness permits the optical properties
   of this configuration to be tuned for either transmission filter
   response or enhanced broadband absorption. Vivid structural colors are
   also achieved in reflection and transmission. The optical properties of
   the platform are investigated for three different etch depths.
   Transmission filter response is achieved for a configuration with.
   nanowires on glass. without any thin film. Alternatively, integrating
   thin. film with nanowires increases the absorption efficiency by similar
   to 97\% compared to the thin film starting layer and by similar to 78\%
   over nanowires on glass. The ability to tune the optical response of

   classification in older adults and identified the optimal sensor type,
   location, combination, and modelling method; for walking with and
   without a cognitive load task. A convenience sample of 100 older
   individuals (75.5 +/- 6.7 years; 76 non-fallers, 24 fallers based on 6
   month retrospective fall occurrence) walked 7.62 m under single-task and
   dual-task conditions while wearing pressure-sensing insoles and
   tri-axial accelerometers at the head, pelvis, and left and right shanks.
   Participants also completed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence
   scale, Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors
   questionnaire, six minute walk test, and ranked their fear of falling.
   Fall risk classification models were assessed for all sensor
   combinations and three model types: multi-layer perceptron neural
   network, naive Bayesian, and support vector machine. The best performing
   model was a multi-layer perceptron neural network with input parameters
   from pressure-sensing insoles and head, pelvis, and left shank
   accelerometers (accuracy = 84\%, F1 score = 0.600, MCC score = 0.521).
   Head sensor-based models had the best performance of the single-sensor
   models for single-task gait assessment. Single-task gait assessment
   models outperformed models based on dual-task walking or clinical
   assessment data. Support vector machines and neural networks were the
   best modelling technique for fall risk classification. Fall risk
   classification models developed for point-of-care environments should be
   developed using support vector machines and neural networks, with a
   multi-sensor single-task gait assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Most hot forming die quenching (HFDQ) lines use roller hearth furnaces
   to austenitize ultra high strength steel blanks. This paper describes an
   alternative heating technology in which Usibor (R) 1500P blanks are
   austenitized by bringing them into contact with an electrically-heated
   monolith. In a laboratory-scale prototype, Usibor (R) 1500P coupons
   austenitize in less than 30 s; subsequent material characterization
   confirms that a fully martensitic structure is formed, and that the
   hardness and yield strength are comparable to furnace-treated samples.
   Like many steels used in HFDQ, Usibor (R) 1500P has a protective coating
   to prevent oxidation and decarburization of the coupons within the
   furnace. Preliminary tests found that the coating adheres to the
   monolith, which impedes coupon transfer. Five interchangeable striking
   surfaces were assessed to see if they were less prone to adhering to the
   molten Al-Si coating. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Vertical Silicon Nanowire Arrays}},
Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We propose to use high-order diffraction spots from 2-D silicon nanowire
   (NW) arrays for refractive index sensing based on spatial changes in the
   diffractive spots position. The NW arrays act both as a refractive index
   sensor and as dispersive elements, eliminating the need for external
   spectrometers for the measurement of refractive index changes. The setup
   uses a simple laser diode source and a low-cost camera and results in
   higher sensitivity to environmental refractive index changes, as
   compared with previously demonstrated colorimetric sensors. The
   sensitivity is greater for higher order diffraction spots, as compared
   with the lower order ones due to a larger dispersion angle change at
   higher orders. We also demonstrate that the observed diffraction angle
   and efficiency of the diffractive orders depend on a number of factors,
   such as excitation wavelength, NW diameters, pitch, and surrounding
   medium index. The simple solution of using diffraction spot
   displacements on a 2-D detector array would provide a novel means of
   sensing refractive index changes in the surrounding medium of NWs
   without the burden of complicated spectral analysis.}},

   Critical Analysis}},

Abstract = {{Background: Wearable activity trackers are promising as interventions
   that offer guidance and support for increasing physical activity and
   health-focused tracking. Most adults do not meet their recommended daily
   activity guidelines, and wearable fitness trackers are increasingly
   cited as having great potential to improve the physical activity levels
   of adults.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to use the Coventry,
   Aberdeen, and London-Refined (CALO-RE) taxonomy to examine if the design
   of wearable activity trackers incorporates behavior change techniques
   (BCTs). A secondary objective was to critically analyze whether the BCTs
   present relate to known drivers of behavior change, such as
   self-efficacy, with the intention of extending applicability to older
   adults in addition to the overall population.
   Methods: Wearing each device for a period of 1 week, two independent
   raters used CALO-RE taxonomy to code the BCTs of the seven wearable
   activity trackers available in Canada as of March 2014. These included
   Fitbit Flex, Misfit Shine, Withings Pulse, Jawbone UP24, Spark Activity
   Tracker by SparkPeople, Nike+ FuelBand SE, and Polar Loop. We calculated
   interrater reliability using Cohen's kappa. Results: The average number
   of BCTs identified was 16.3/40. Withings Pulse had the highest number of
   BCTs and Misfit Shine had the lowest. Most techniques centered around
   self-monitoring and self-regulation, all of which have been associated
   with improved physical activity in older adults. Techniques related to
   planning and providing instructions were scarce.
   Conclusions: Overall, wearable activity trackers contain several BCTs
   that have been shown to increase physical activity in older adults.
   Although more research and development must be done to fully understand
   the potential of wearables as health interventions, the current wearable
   trackers offer significant potential with regard to BCTs relevant to
   uptake by all populations, including older adults.}},

Abstract = {{The functions defined on finite fields with high nonlinearity are
   important primitives in cryptography. They are used as the substitution
   boxes in many block ciphers. To avoid the differential and linear
   attacks on the ciphers, the Sboxes must have low differential uniformity
   and high nonlinearity. In this paper, we generalize the notions of the
   differential uniformity and nonlinearity, which are called the t-th
   differential uniformity and the diversity of the nonlinearity, to
   measure the nonlinear property of the functions. We show that the Sboxes
   endorsed by ZUC, SNOW 3G and some lightweight block ciphers have poor
   performances under these new criteria. The properties and
   characterizations of these new notions are presented. Another
   contribution of this paper is to study the nonlinearity of the functions
   with the form F = f circle a, where f is from F-2(k) to F-2(n) and a is
   a linear surjection from F-2(n) to F-2(m). The motivation of this study
   is that such a substitution-permutation composition structure is widely
   used in the design of modern ciphers, which is to bring the confusion
   and diffusion to the ciphers. We determine the nonlinearity of F for the
   linear function a with certain property. Using this result, we compute
   the diversity of the nonlinearity for F and f. It is found that the
   former value is greatly amplified, which weakens the ciphers against the
   linear attack.}},

Abstract = {{Conformance with standard corporate and institutional processes and
   industry best practices are sought because of regulatory requirements
   and evidence that best practices lead to improved project performance.
   Automated workflow engine enabled Industry Foundation Processes (IFP)
   are introduced in this paper that facilitate process conformance through
   structural transparency, foundation process inheritance, and automated
   conformance checking. While IFP processes can be customized to suit
   particular project or corporate conditions, they need to conform to a
   standard core structure and thus behavior. This has been achieved
   through defining specific workflow inheritance rules and developing an
   automated structural process conformance checking algorithm. The
   algorithm has been developed based on graph theory fundamentals using a
   first-order logic language, which compares two workflows and detects the
   conformance of a customized one with its associated IFP. The developed
   algorithm has been functionally tested and validated with different
   structural settings of workflows with a number of critical cases. Its
   functionality has been demonstrated in this paper with an example of the
   commonly used process of RFI (Request for Information). A new construct
   is thus contributed that can help improve process conformance to
   industry best practices particularly in the architectural, engineering,
   and construction industry, leading to improved project conformance. (C)

Abstract = {{The influence of droplet size on exergy destruction rate in flow of
   highly concentrated oil-in-water emulsions was investigated
   experimentally in a cone and plate geometry. The oil concentration was
   fixed at 74.5\% by volume. At this dispersed-phase (oil) concentration,
   two different droplet size emulsions were prepared: fine and coarse
   emulsions. The fine and coarse emulsions were mixed in different
   proportions to vary the droplet size distribution. Although the
   dispersed and matrix phases of the emulsions were Newtonian in nature,
   the emulsions exhibited a non-Newtonian (shear-thinning) behavior due to
   the high droplet concentration. The shear stress-shear rate data of the
   emulsions could be described adequately by a power law model. At low
   shear rates, the exergy destruction rate per unit volume of emulsion
   exhibited a minimum at a fine emulsion proportion of 35\%. The results
   from the cone and plate geometry were used to simulate exergy loss in
   pipeline flow of emulsions. The pumping of emulsions becomes more
   efficient thermodynamically upon mixing of fine and coarse emulsions
   provided that the flow regime is maintained to be laminar and that the
   Reynolds number is kept at a low to moderate value. In the turbulent
   regime, the exergy loss generally increases upon mixing the fine and
   coarse emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{Entropy generation, and hence exergy destruction, in adiabatic flow of
   unstable and surfactant-stabilized emulsions was investigated
   experimentally in different diameter pipes. Four types of emulsion
   systems are investigated covering a broad range of the dispersed-phase
   concentration: (a) unstable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions without
   surfactant; (b) surfactant-stabilized O/W emulsions; (c) unstable
   water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions without surfactant; and (d)
   surfactant-stabilized W/O emulsions. The entropy generation rate per
   unit pipe length is affected by the type of the emulsion as well as its
   stability. Unstable emulsions without any surfactant present at the
   interface generate less entropy in the turbulent regime as compared with
   the surfactant-stabilized emulsions of the same viscosity and density.
   The effect of surfactant is particularly severe in the case of W/O
   emulsions. In the turbulent regime, the rate of entropy generation in
   unstable W/O emulsions is much lower in comparison with that observed in
   the stable W/O emulsions. A significant delay in the transition from
   laminar to turbulent regime is also observed in the case of unstable W/O
   emulsion. Finally, the analysis and simulation results are presented on
   non-adiabatic pipeline flow of emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the achievable rate and power allocation to improve
   the uplink (UL) spectrum efficiency in a Long-Term Evolution Advanced
   (LTE-A) cooperative cellular network with the deployment of Type-II
   in-band decode-and-forward (DF) relay stations (RSs). The physical-layer
   UL transmission technology is based on single-carrier frequency-division
   multiple access (SC-FDMA) with frequency-domain equalization (FDE).
   Different from the downlink (DL) orthogonal FDMA system, signals on all
   subcarriers in the SC-FDMA system are transmitted sequentially rather
   than in parallel; thus, the user's achievable rate is not simply the
   summation of the rates on all allocated subcarriers. Moreover, each user
   equipment (UE) device has its own transmission power constraint instead
   of a total power constraint at the base station in the DL case.
   Therefore, the UL resource allocation problem in the LTE-A system is
   more challenging. To this end, we first derive the achievable rates of
   the SC-FDMA system with two commonly used FDE techniques, namely,
   zero-forcing (ZF) equalization and minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)
   equalization, based on the joint superposition coding for cooperative
   relaying. We then propose optimal power allocation schemes among
   subcarriers at both the UE and RS to maximize the overall throughput of
   the system. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate
   that our proposed power allocation schemes can drastically improve
   system throughput.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous framework to deliver smart
   grid (SG) data cost effectively. The data generated by distributed SG
   loads, and generation units should be delivered to the utility control
   center (UCC) within the tolerated delay, which is crucial for SG
   applications. To this end, a heterogeneous communication framework is
   proposed, where the cellular network (CN) provides ubiquitous yet
   expensive data transmission, and vehicle-assisted device-to-device (D2D)
   communications are leveraged to offload the CN by delivering the
   delay-tolerant SG data in a store-carry-forward fashion with low cost.
   To improve the offloading and cost performance of the proposed
   framework, we put effort in the following aspects: 1) optimal forwarding
   schemes to optimally select vehicles to carry and forward the data; and
   2) mode selection and dynamic resource allocation to maximize the amount
   of data delivered by D2D communications, reduce the cost of SG data
   delivery, and guarantee the fairness among SG users. Simulation results
   are given to validate proposed approaches and demonstrate that the
   proposed framework is efficient in saving cost for the utility and
   offloading the CN.}},

Abstract = {{To improve casting and product yields of Fusion (TM) cast
   AA3003-core/AA4045-clad laminate ingots, a fundamental understanding of
   the wetting and interface formation process between the oxidized AA3003
   cast surface and the AA4045 melt is required. In this study, a
   laboratory scale analog/immersion test was developed which mimics the
   wetting and interface formation process that occurs during Fusion (TM)
   casting. The effects of reheating and remelting of the AA3003 cast
   surface, the degree of surface oxidation present during initial contact
   of the two alloys, and the atmospheric conditions (air or argon) on
   interface formation when dipped into an AA4045 melt were examined.
   Results indicated that in an argon atmosphere, wetting and dissolution
   of the solid, oxidized AA3003 samples by liquid AA4045 occurred at
   temperatures both above and below the measured onset of AA3003
   remelting. AA3003/AA4045 interfaces were similar to those produced
   during Fusion (TM) casting, with a thin layer of AA4045 forming an
   oxide-free, metallurgical interface to the AA3003 after immersion. The
   AA3003 surface oxides were not an impediment to wetting and bond
   formation. Mg surface segregation was observed on the oxidized AA3003
   surfaces and may play a role to help penetrate the oxide layer. For
   tests conducted in air, wetting of the sample by AA4045 liquid was
   generally poor regardless of temperature. (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nondestructive Testing (NDT) assessment of materials' health condition
   is useful for classifying healthy from unhealthy structures or detecting
   flaws in metallic or dielectric structures. Performing structural health
   testing for coated/uncoated metallic or dielectric materials with the
   same testing equipment requires a testing method that can work on
   metallics and dielectrics such as microwave testing. Reducing complexity
   and expenses associated with current diagnostic practices of microwave
   NDT of structural health requires an effective and intelligent approach
   based on feature selection and classification techniques of machine
   learning. Current microwave NDT methods in general based on measuring
   variation in the S-matrix over the entire operating frequency ranges of
   the sensors. For instance, assessing the health of metallic structures
   using a microwave sensor depends on the reflection or/and transmission
   coefficient measurements as a function of the sweeping frequencies of
   the operating band. The aim of this work is reducing sweeping
   frequencies using machine learning feature selection techniques. By
   treating sweeping frequencies as features, the number of top important
   features can be identified, then only the most influential features
   (frequencies) are considered when building the microwave NDT equipment.
   The proposed method of reducing sweeping frequencies was validated
   experimentally using a waveguide sensor and a metallic plate with
   different cracks. Among the investigated feature selection techniques
   are information gain, gain ratio, relief, chi-squared. The effectiveness
   of the selected features were validated through performance evaluations
   of various classification models; namely, Nearest Neighbor, Neural
   Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Results showed good
   crack classification accuracy rates after employing feature selection
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The use of dechlorinating chemicals for removal of chlorine from spent
   membrane cleaning solutions was investigated. Addition of calcium
   thiosulfate resulted in a decrease in pH at low dosages of calcium
   thiosulfate, but when higher dosages were used, the pH was not affected.
   Other dechlorinating agents (sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, and
   ascorbic acid) generated smaller pH declines than calcium thiosulfate.
   The declines in pH were observed after the dechlorination reaction was
   effectively complete and pH did not appear to influence the rate of
   dechlorination. The rate of dechlorination in spent cleaning solution
   was slower than that observed in clean water. Dechlorination with
   calcium thiosulfate resulted in the lowest half-life and reaction time.
   At lower doses (less than 565 mg/L), it was not possible to discriminate
   between the different dechlorinating agents. The times required for
   dechlorination were more sensitive to increases in dechlorination
   chemical dose at lower doses.}},

Abstract = {{A major step toward fully integrated quantum optics is the deterministic
   incorporation of high quality single photon sources in on-chip optical
   circuits. We show a novel hybrid approach in which preselected III-V

   high optical quality after integration as verified by measuring a low
   multiphoton probability of 0.07 +/- 0.07 and emission line width as
   narrow as 3.45 +/- 0.48 GHz. Our approach allows for optimum alignment
   of the quantum dot light emission to the fundamental waveguide mode
   resulting in very high coupling efficiencies. We estimate a coupling
   efficiency of 24.3 +/- 1.7\% from the studied single-photon source to
   the photonic channel and further show by finite-difference time-domain
   simulations that for an optimized choice of material and design the

Abstract = {{Network lifetime is a crucial performance metric to evaluate
   data-gathering wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where battery-powered
   sensor nodes periodically sense the environment and forward collected
   samples to a sink node. In this paper, we propose an analytic model to
   estimate the entire network lifetime from network initialization until
   it is completely disabled, and determine the boundary of energy hole in
   a data-gathering WSN. Specifically, we theoretically estimate the
   traffic load, energy consumption, and lifetime of sensor nodes during
   the entire network lifetime. Furthermore, we investigate the temporal
   and spatial evolution of energy hole and apply our analytical results to
   WSN routing in order to balance the energy consumption and improve the
   network lifetime. Extensive simulation results are provided to
   demonstrate the validity of the proposed analytic model in estimating
   the network lifetime and energy hole evolution process.}},

   Resistance: High-Friction Aggregate and PG Plus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of the fatigue resistance of surface hot-mix asphalt
   (HMA) mixes is evaluated for three primary design variables. Aggregate
   type, binder type, and binder content as well as their interaction have
   been quantified with respect to their effects on HMA fatigue life,
   rutting resistance, and stiffness. The objective was to optimize the
   design by extending fatigue performance while reducing the confounded
   negative effect on rutting resistance. Two aggregate types were used in
   the evaluation. Two binders of the performance grading (PG) 64-28 were
   also employed: a modified binder that meets national specifications and
   an unmodified binder at two binder levels (optimum and optimum plus
   0.5\%). Aggregate texture was compared visually using high-resolution
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The results showed that the
   value of modifying the binder to produce softer mixes can be compromised
   when a high-friction aggregate is used due to the irregular shape of the
   texture, which produces stiffer mixes. A slight adjustment to the amount
   of binder (+0.5\%) can decrease this effect. Superior HMA fatigue
   performance was exhibited by the regular 12.5 aggregate and the modified
   binder at the optimum binder content plus the additional 0.5\%. This
   conclusion was reached through the integration of the positive effects
   of the investigated variables, which revealed only an insignificant
   reversible impact on rutting resistance. The findings of this study can
   therefore be considered a guide for designing HMA with superior fatigue
   performance for use in pavement design.}},

Abstract = {{An MPPT approach combining model-based and heuristic techniques has
   recently appeared in the literature for accelerating the tracking speed
   of the maximum power point (MPP) of PV systems. Despite the improved
   tracking speed, it requires an accurate temperature measurement that
   increases the cost and complexity of the implementation in comparison to
   the nonmodel-based maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). This paper
   proposes an MPPT method, which eliminates the need for temperature
   measurement. The proposed approach relies on a new set of equations
   capable of estimating the PV module temperature through utilizing the
   current and voltage measurements. It combines the well-known heuristic
   P\&O and model-based techniques to ensure an accurate and high speed
   tracking. The proposed method also uniquely adopts a recently developed
   simple nontranscendental PV model featuring reduced computational time
   to reduce the computational complexity of the implementation. The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified using real-time
   simulation and experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a new formulation for refraction from flat
   electrically thin lenses and reflectors comprised of inhomogeneous
   material. Inhomogeneous electrically thin flat lenses and reflectors
   cannot make use of the Snell law since this classical formulation works
   solely at interfaces of planar homogeneous media. The refraction of a
   perpendicularly incident plane wave at a planar interface is physically
   explained through the phase advance of the rays within the medium. The
   Huygens principle is then used to construct the refracted wavefront. The
   formulation is validated using numerical full wave simulation for
   several examples where the refractive angle is predicted with good
   accuracy. Furthermore, the formulation gives a physical insight of the
   phenomenon of refraction from electrically thin inhomogeneous media. (C)

Abstract = {{Since their development, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been used

   the uptake mechanisms of CPPs and the delivery details are still
   unclear. Understanding the mechanisms of cellular internalization of

   the present study, we evaluated the internalization process of a
   previously designed CPP, STR-KV, complexed with small interference RNA
   (siRNA) targeting at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
   (GAPDH) gene. Using heparin treatment and chemical endocytic inhibitors,
   we elucidated that the electrostatic interaction of STR-KV/siRNA complex
   with heparin sulfate proteoglycans at the cell membrane surface
   triggered the energy-independent uptake of the majority of the
   complexes, which most likely through a direct translocation pathway. The
   intracellular trafficking and internalization kinetics observed by
   confocal microscopy also confirmed that the complex was uptaken through
   a nonendocytic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Transport infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts
   as it is designed for long operational lives, and both episodic and
   seasonal conditions contribute to deterioration, disruption and unsafe
   incidents. There are some examples of adaptation in transportation
   design, but many communities do not have the capacity to incorporate
   climate change considerations into infrastructure planning and
   management. Researchers worked closely with the City of Prince George,
   in Central British Columbia, Canada, to build on existing work and
   explore how the City could plan, design, and maintain roads and other
   structures to account for climate change. A local steering committee was
   formed, and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics. Two
   focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during
   a workshop with practitioners, researchers, consultants and other
   representatives. The workshop precipitated an investigation of projected
   impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety, and plans
   to explore alternative paving techniques. Outcomes of the case study
   provide insights regarding climate change and local transportation
   infrastructure, including: how researchers can engage with local experts
   to explore adaptation; issues local governments perceive as important;
   and barriers communities face as they attempt to address
   vulnerabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nano-scale particle size on the performance of Li4Ti5O12
   (LTO) electrode is investigated by computational simulation. Newman
   pseudo-2D (P2D) model is utilized to characterize the performance of LTO
   electrode. However, unlike previous P2D lithium ion battery (LIB)
   models, the model design adjustable parameters are set based on the
   experimental data obtained from monodispersed active electrode
   particles. This allows the model to accurately reflect real battery
   performance. The model provides the optimum nano-particle size for a
   specific application, which eliminates the performance loss due to the

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of graduated
   compression socks (GCS) on enhancing muscle blood flow and oxygenation
   during exercise and recovery in healthy subjects.
   Twelve healthy volunteers completed a protocol involving baseline,
   exercise, and recovery periods with and without GCS. Each test was
   repeated twice to assess repeatability of the results. The applied sock
   pressure was measured prior to experimentation using a custom pressure
   sensing system, and modified as necessary using tensor bandages to
   control the applied load. During each of the experimental phases, blood
   velocity in the popliteal artery, calf muscle tissue oxygenation, muscle
   activity, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, and applied
   pressure from the sock were measured. Popliteal artery diameter was
   measured during baseline and recovery periods.
   The GCS significantly reduced deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) in the leg during
   baseline (HHb, p = 0.001) and total blood volume and HHb in the leg
   during exercise (total hemoglobin, p = 0.01; HHb, p = 0.02). However,
   there were no differences in leg muscle blood flow velocity or any other
   variables with and without GCS at baseline, exercise, or recovery.
   Interestingly, it was found that the local applied sock pressure was
   very sensitive to the sock application process and, furthermore, the
   pressure varied considerably during exercise.
   No significant changes were observed in measures reflecting oxygen
   delivery for healthy subjects using GCS during exercise and recovery.
   Applied sock pressure was carefully controlled, thus eliminating the
   sock application process as a variable.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are committed to bring the
   industry automation into the era of Industry 4.0 by providing the
   ubiquitous perception to improve the production efficiency. However, the
   proliferation of wireless devices in industrial applications makes the
   spectrum sharing in limited industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)
   band a challenging problem. In this paper, it is concerned with the
   intrinsic impact of the evenness of spectrum usage on the spectrum
   sharing performance in terms of channel accessing probability, spectrum
   utilization, and fairness of spectrum usage. In order to explore the
   explicit relationship between the evenness and spectrum sharing
   performance, a new concept of equilibrium is first defined to represent
   the achievable best evenness of spectrum usage. Then, a set of rules
   called local equilibrium-guided autonomous channel switching
   (LEQ-AutoCS) is devised, with which each accessed sensor autonomously
   equalizes the local channel occupations within its range of spectrum
   sensing without overhead on exchanging the sensors' spectrum sensing
   reports. It is further proved that the equilibrium can be achieved by
   this concessive manner. Theoretical analysis and experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed LEQ-AutoCS rules provide higher
   utilization and fairness of spectrum usage comparing to the existing
   spectrum access approaches. Moreover, it is shown that LEQ-AutoCS rules
   assist the system to reduce the spectrum access delay to 1/2 of
   CSMA-based systems and 1/50 of TDMA-based systems, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology to determine the position of a
   magnetically guided robot (MGR) in horizontal planes using magnetic flux
   sensors. This position determination methodology can be used
   independently as well as in collaboration with optical sensors in the
   case of the optical blockage. A combination of linear Hall-effect
   sensors (two sensors for each axis of motion) was employed to measure
   the magnetic flux in the MGR's working space. A configuration of several
   electromagnets was used as a source of magnetic field, and an analytical
   model of the system is developed. The MGR's position was determined
   based on the polynomial relation between the Hall-effect sensors' output
   and the location of the minimum magnetic potential energy point in
   horizontal planes. Using the cross-validation method, it was found that
   a fourth-order polynomial model could accurately predict the MGR's
   position. Experiments were conducted on a horizontal plane to validate
   the performance of position estimation using the magnetic flux sensing
   method. The accuracy of the position determination method was 0.4-mm
   root-mean-square errors in both the x- and y-direction over 8 x 8 mm(2)
   working area. This paper also experimentally validates a combined
   optical-magnetic position determination technique for the motion control
   of a magnetically guided robot in optical blockage conditions as unknown
   environment that can be used as a promising replacement of X-ray and
   ultrasound techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) combines experimental testing with
   numerical simulation. It provides an alternative method to evaluate the
   performance of structures subjected to dynamic loading such as
   earthquake or wind. During RTHS, a numerical integration algorithm is
   employed to directly solve the equation of motion and generate command
   displacements for the experimental test structure online. This paper
   presents an improved explicit numerical integration method for RTHS
   based on discrete state space formulation. The improved integration
   method utilizes an extrapolation-based prediction procedure for command
   displacement by applying a zero-order hold. The predicted command
   displacement is then used to compute the final command displacement by
   applying a first-order hold. Both the stability and the accuracy of the
   proposed integration method are investigated using control theory and
   numerical and experimental simulations. The proposed method demonstrates
   improved performance compared with other integration methods. The
   robustness and feasibility of the proposed method were verified through
   experimental RTHS on two different computational platforms including a
   National Instruments system and a dSPACE embedded controller. The
   proposed method may also be implemented on other platforms containing an
   xPC target and MATLAB environment. By placing the algorithm on the
   dSPACE system, any dynamically rated actuator with a controller that can
   receive analog signal may be used for RTHS. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Computational models of cell-cell mechanical interactions typically
   simulate sorting and certain other motions well, but as demands on these
   models continue to grow, discrepancies between the cell shapes, contact
   angles and behaviours they predict and those that occur in real cells
   have come under increased scrutiny. To investigate whether these
   discrepancies are a direct result of the straight cell-cell edges
   generally assumed in these models, we developed a finite element model
   that approximates cell boundaries using polylines with an arbitrary
   number of segments. We then compared the predictions of otherwise
   identical polyline and monoline (straight-edge) models in a variety of
   scenarios, including annealing, single- and multi-cell engulfment,
   sorting, and two forms of mixing-invasion and checkerboard pattern
   formation. Keeping cell-cell edges straight influences cell motion, cell
   shape, contact angle, and boundary length, especially in cases where one
   cell type is pulled between or around cells of a different type, as in
   engulfment or invasion. These differences arise because monoline cells
   have restricted deformation modes. Polyline cells do not face these
   restrictions, and with as few as three segments per edge yielded
   realistic edge shapes and contact angle errors one-tenth of those
   produced by monoline models, making them considerably more suitable for
   situations where angles and shapes matter, such as validation of
   cellular force-inference techniques. The findings suggest that
   non-straight cell edges are important both in modelling and in nature.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Operational wind turbines are exposed to dynamic inflow conditions
   because of, for instance, atmospheric turbulence and wind shear. In
   order to understand the resulting three-dimensional and transient
   aerodynamics effects at a site, a 10m stall-regulated upwind two-bladed
   wind turbine was instrumented for a novel digital tuft flow
   visualization study. High definition video of a tufted blade was
   acquired during wind turbine operation in the field, and a novel digital
   image processing algorithm calculated the blade stall directly from the
   video. After processing O(10(5)) sequential images, the algorithm
   achieved a -5\% bias error compared with previous manual analysis
   methods. With increasing wind speed (5m/s to 20m/s) the fraction of
   tufts exhibiting stalled flow increased from 5\% to 40\% on the outboard
   40\% of the blade. The independently measured instantaneous turbine
   power production correlates highly with the stall fraction. Some
   azimuthal variation in the stall fraction associated with dynamic stall
   induced by vertical wind shear was seen with a maximum in the 45-90
   degrees azimuthal location. The high detail, quantitative image
   processing method demonstrated good agreement with the expected
   behaviour for a stall-regulated wind turbine and revealed azimuthal
   variation because of shear-induced dynamic stall. The amount of reliable
   blade stall data to be obtained from digital tuft visualization has
   hereby been vastly increased. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling wind generation for use in reliability assessment requires a
   large database of historical wind speeds so that the stochastic nature
   of the wind at a particular site can be accurately captured. The
   alternative is to use reliable stochastic simulation techniques that can
   replicate the desired synthetic wind power time series. This paper
   proposes an assessment framework that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) method to enable the inclusion of wind farm modeling in
   conventional techniques for evaluating generation adequacy. The
   synthetic wind power time series based on the MCMC model has been
   verified against measured results based on consideration of statistical
   factors. The model presented in this paper has also been applied on the
   well-known Roy Billiton Test System (RBTS). As a further demonstration
   of the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the reliability
   indices obtained using the MCMC model have been compared with those
   produced by the ARMA model, which is often used in reliability studies.
   The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for
   incorporating wind power into generation adequacy evaluation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Two complementary approaches for identifying potential resolutions to a

   valuable strategic insights as to how it can be resolved. More
   specifically, the controversy over the Energy East Pipeline for shipping
   bitumen from the Alberta oil sands for refining in Central and Eastern
   Canada as well as shipping overseas is investigated using the usual
   definitions for stability as well as the metarational tree methodology
   in which policies can be taken into account. As demonstrated by the case
   study, enhanced strategic insights can be garnered when the metarational
   tree approach is utilised for exploring conflict resolution within the
   confines of existing policy. The metarational tree procedure constitutes
   a useful expansion of the overall Graph Model for Conflict Resolution

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (PVA) is a widely used material for
   biomedical devices, yet there is a need to enhance its biological
   functionality for in vitro and in vivo vascular application.
   Significance of surface topography in modulating cellular behaviour is
   increasingly evident. However, hydrogel patterning remains challenging.
   Using a casting method, planar PVA were patterned with micro-sized
   features. To achieve higher patterning resolution, nanoimprint
   lithography with high pressure and temperature was used. In vitro
   experiment showed enhanced human endothelial cell (EC) density and
   adhesion on patterned PVA. Additional chemical modification via nitrogen
   gas plasma on patterned PVA further improved EC density and adhesion.
   Only EC monolayer grown on plasma modified PVA with 2 mu m gratings and
   1.8 mu m concave lens exhibited expression of vascular endothelial
   cadherin, indicating EC functionality. Patterning of the luminal surface
   of tubular hydrogels is not widely explored. The study presents the
   first method for simultaneous tubular molding and luminal surface
   patterning of hydrogel. PVA graft with 2 mu m gratings showed patency
   and endothelialization, while unpatterned grafts were occluded after 20
   days in rat aorta. The reproducible, high yield and high-fidelity
   methods enable planar and tubular patterning of PVA and other hydrogels
   to be used for biomedical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Deck screen design parameters e.g. material of construction, deck angle
   of inclination, the feed throughputs, and physicochemical properties of
   the particles, are critical factors to consider in solids
   classification. Two significant and easily manipulated parameters that
   greatly affect screen performance are the feed rate and design geometry
   configuration. In this work we apply statistical analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) and nonlinear least squares optimization with parameter
   estimation concepts, first, to assess the significance of the two
   factors and, second to formulate flow prediction models that optimize
   the feed rate and classification efficiency. Experiments were conducted
   on a prototype screen of 556.28 cm(2) effective area, (1380 cm(2) total
   area). For glass beads of sizes 0.75, 1, 2, and 3 mm, with 16 feed
   batches of 10 g to 160 g, and six inclination angles 5, 10, 12.5, 15,
   17.5, and 20 degrees, a maximum efficiency of 66.7\% was achieved with a
   screen loading of 86.5 g, and an inclination angle of 17.5 degrees.
   These results were then subjected to nonlinear least squares
   optimization, which showed that a maximum efficiency of 93.2\% can be
   achieved at batch loading as low as 36 g. There was a favorable
   performance at the range of angles 12.5 <=theta <= 17.5 degrees, but
   poor performance outside this range. The screening efficiency did not
   respond significantly to changes in screen loading, although loading had
   a significant effect on the screening capacity. Confirmation tests
   conducted at selected optimum parameters achieved a maximum efficiency
   of 72\% (at 12.5 degrees with 49.6 g batch load), and a maximum rate of
   27 g/s at 17.5 degrees with 104 g. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a small-scale standalone wind energy conversion system
   composed of a squirrel-cage induction generator, a buck converter and a
   current-source inverter is proposed, as an attractive renewable energy
   solution for off-grid communities. Geared squirrel-cage induction
   generators are well-known for their robustness, simplicity, light weight
   and low cost. Current-source inverters, even though mainly used in
   medium-voltage, high power applications, and proposed for megawatt-level
   grid-connected wind energy conversion systems, offer potential benefits
   in small-scale off-grid wind energy conversion systems that are yet to
   be investigated and evaluated against those of commonly-used
   voltage-source inverters. In the proposed system, the generator's shaft
   speed is controlled by a buck converter to extract maximum available
   wind power in normal mode of operation, and the wind power is dumped
   when it is not possible to absorb maximum available power by the storage
   system and the load. A novel scheme for integration of a battery energy
   storage system is proposed and an effective power management algorithm
   is employed to maintain the supply-demand power balance through direct
   control of dc-link current. A systematic approach for the dc-link
   inductor design is presented. The feasibility of the proposed system and
   its performance under variable wind and load conditions are analyzed and
   demonstrated through simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Conventional plant protein production methods involve the use of
   solvents, concentrated acids and alkali that can result in protein
   denaturation and loss of solubility, thereby reducing the quality and
   functionality of protein ingredients. A novel solvent-free
   tribo-electrostatic separation approach was developed for the production
   of high quality plant protein powders using navy bean flour as a model
   system. The process consisted of a fluidized bed flour reservoir,
   tribo-charging unit, and a separating device. Using this approach the
   protein content of the original navy bean flour was increased from
   25.4\% to 47.0\% in the final protein-enriched fraction collected from
   the bottom section of the plate in the separator. A wide variety of
   tribo-charging tubes with different sizes, shapes, and materials were
   tested to evaluate their efficiency. Protein recovery by this approach
   was higher than other solvent-free separation approaches and could be
   improved by further optimization of the flow rate and design

Abstract = {{The cell membrane is a major barrier for drug transport. Given that many
   cancer drugs must passively cross the cell membrane, understanding drug
   membrane interactions is crucial. We used fluorescence-activated cell
   sorting to investigate how cholesterol influences the transport of the
   cancer drugs ellipticine and pirarubicin across cell membranes. We
   showed that cholesterol depletion helped pirarubicin cross the membranes
   of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and Chinese hamster ovary cells. In
   contrast, the uptake of ellipticine was not strongly influenced by
   cholesterol depletion. To study the microscopic origins of these
   observations, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed.
   Doxorubicin (similar in structure to pirarubicin) and ellipticine were
   simulated in model membranes of POPC and POPC with 40 mol \%
   cholesterol. Atomistic free energy calculations for the translocation of
   a single ellipticine and doxorubicin across the lipid bilayers
   qualitatively matched the experiment results. The free energy barrier
   for doxorubicin crossing the bilayer was strongly increased when
   cholesterol was present, while for ellipticine the barrier remained
   similar with and without cholesterol. Molecular dynamics simulations
   showed that the different hydrogen-bonding propensities of the two drugs
   are likely the major factor for the different behaviors. The qualitative
   agreement between cell experiments and atomistic computer simulations
   illustrates the potential to link observed biological phenomena and
   single molecule mechanisms of actions. Our results suggest that the
   traditional understanding of drug permeation and the influence of
   cholesterol on the small molecule transport is naive and needs to be
   re-examined.}},

Title = {{A Novel Percutaneous Electrode Implant for Improving Robustness in
   Advanced Myoelectric Control}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Despite several decades of research, electrically powered hand and arm
   prostheses are still controlled with very simple algorithms that process
   the surface electromyogram (EMG) of remnant muscles to achieve control
   of one prosthetic function at a time. More advanced machine learning
   methods have shown promising results under laboratory conditions.
   However, limited robustness has largely prevented the transfer of these
   laboratory advances to clinical applications. In this paper, we
   introduce a novel percutaneous EMG electrode to be implanted chronically
   with the aim of improving the reliability of EMG detection in
   myoelectric control. The proposed electrode requires a minimally
   invasive procedure for its implantation, similar to a cosmetic
   micro-dermal implant. Moreover, being percutaneous, it does not require
   power and data telemetry modules. Four of these electrodes were
   chronically implanted in the forearm of an able-bodied human volunteer
   for testing their characteristics. The implants showed significantly
   lower impedance and greater robustness against mechanical interference
   than traditional surface EMG electrodes used for myoelectric control.
   Moreover, the EMG signals detected by the proposed systems allowed more
   stable control performance across sessions in different days than that
   achieved with classic EMG electrodes. In conclusion, the proposed
   implants may be a promising interface for clinically available
   prostheses.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on n-type hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited on single-crystal silicon
   (c-Si) wafers was studied by electrical and optical methods. Deposition
   of a-Si:H films by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was
   optimized for high deposition rate and maximum film uniformity. RTA
   processed films were characterized by spreading resistance profiling
   (SRP), Hall effect, spectroscopic ellipsometry, defect etching, and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the films
   processed between 600 degrees C and 1000 degrees C were highly
   crystalline and that the defect density in the films diminished with
   increasing thermal budget. Junctions formed by the RTA processed n-type
   a-Si:H films on p-type c-Si wafers were tested for device applicability.
   It was established that these films can be used as the emitter layer in
   n(+) p photovoltaic (PV) devices with over 14\% conversion efficiency.

Abstract = {{Nanoporous silicon (NPSi) has received significant attention for its
   potential to contribute to a large number of applications, but has not
   yet been extensively implemented because of the inability of current
   state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques to. achieve sufficiently
   small pore size, high aspect ratio, and process scalability. In this
   work we describe the fabrication of NPSi via-a modified metal-assisted
   chemical etching (MACE) process in which silica-shell gold nanopartide
   (SiO2-AuNP) monolayers self-assemble from solution onto a silicon
   substrate. Exposure to the MACE-etchant solution results in the rapid
   consumption of the SiO2 spacer shell, leaving well-spaced arrays of bare
   AuNPs on the substrate surface. Particles then begin to catalyze the
   etching of nanopore arrays-without interruption, resulting in the
   formation of highly anisotropic individual pores. The excellent
   directionality of pore formation is thought to be promoted by the
   homogeneous interparticle spacing of the gold core nanocatalysts which
   allow for even hole injection and subsequent etching along preferred
   crystallographic orientations. Electron microscopy and image analysis
   confirm the ability of the developed technique to produce
   micrometer-scale arrays of sub 10 nm nanopores with narrow size
   distributions and aspect ratios of over 100:1. By introducing a scalable
   process for obtaining high aspect ratio pores-in a novel size regime,
   this. work opens the door to `implementation of NPSi in numerous devices
   and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud storage has been gaining tremendous popularity among individuals
   and corporations because of its low maintenance cost and on-demand
   services for the clients. To improve the availability and the
   reliability of critical data, storing multiple replicas on multiple
   servers is a commonly used strategy. Currently, several provable data
   possession (PDP) protocols for multiple replicas of dynamic data have
   been proposed to ensure the integrity of outsourced multi-copy data, but
   the efficiency of these protocols on verifying multiple replicas one by
   one is not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a provable multiple
   replication data possession protocol with full dynamics, named MR-DPDP.
   In MR-DPDP, we utilize a novel authenticated data structure called
   Merkle hash tree with rank to support both full dynamic data updates and
   efficient integrity verification. In addition, our construction with RSA
   signature can support both variable-sized file blocks and public
   verification. Through security proof and performance evaluation, we
   demonstrate that MR-DPDP not only is sound but also incurs less
   communication overhead when updating data blocks as well as verifying a
   proof of the integrity of multiple replicas. Copyright (c) 2015 John

   This inverse TMR is attributed to the oxidation of the FeCo/MgO

   highlights the importance of interfacial properties on tunneling

Abstract = {{Space radiation brings uneven damages to cells. The detection of the
   distribution of cell damage plays a very important role in radiation
   medicine and the related research. In this paper, a new hand-held
   microfluidic flow cytometer was developed to evaluate the degree of
   radiation damage of cells. The device we propose overcomes the
   shortcomings (e.g., large volume and high cost) of commercial flow
   cytometers and can evaluate the radiation damage of cells accurately and
   quickly with potential for onsite applications. The distribution of
   radiation-damaged cells is analyzed by a simultaneous detection of
   immunofluorescence intensity of gamma-H2AX and resistance pulse sensor
   (RPS) signal. The gamma-H2AX fluorescence intensity provides information
   of the degree of radiation damage in cells. The ratio of the number of
   cells with gamma-H2AX fluorescence signals to the total numbers of cells
   detected by RPS indicates the percentage of the cells that are damaged
   by radiation. The comparison experiment between the developed hand-held
   microfluidic flow cytometer and a commercial confocal microscope
   indicates a consistent and comparable detection performance.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-functionalized graphene materials have been demonstrated as
   promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),
   owning to their respectable activity and,excellent stability in alkaline
   electrolyte. However, they exhibit unacceptable catalytic activity in
   acid medium. Here, a hierarchically porous Co-N functionalized graphene
   aerogel is prepared as an efficient catalyst for the ORR in acid
   electrolyte. In the preparation process, polyaniline (PANI) is
   introduced as a pore-forming agent to aid in the self-assembly of
   graphene species into a porous aerogel networks, and a nitrogen
   precursor to induce in situ nitrogen doping. Therefore, a Co-N decorated
   graphene aerogel framework with a large surface area (485 m(2) g(-1))
   and an abundance of meso/macropores is effectively formed after heat
   treatment. Such highly desired structures can not only expose sufficient
   active sites for the ORR but also guarantee the fast mass transfer in
   the catalytic process, which provides significant catalytic activity
   with positive onset and half wave potentials, low hydrogen peroxide
   yield, high resistance to methanol crossover, and remarkable stability
   that is comparable to commercial Pt/C in acid medium.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},

Abstract = {{Superconducting qubits arrays have become one of the most promising
   architectures for the practical implementation of universal quantum
   computing with quantum error correction codes. Here we propose a
   defect-tolerant surface code topology which is resistant to sparse
   fabrication defects. The topology is equivalent to a disk folded into N
   layers. A physically defective qubit can be replaced with a working
   physical qubit within the same unit cell from a different layer. Thereby
   sparse fabrication errors can be collected into one sacrificial layer
   and isolated from the working layers by turning off their controllable
   couplers. We propose two schemes to realize this robust topology. One is
   to use flux qubits, and the other is based on Xmon qubits. A modified
   quantum circuit for the stabilization cycle of the Xmon qubits scheme is
   developed. We calculate and compare the per-operation error thresholds
   for these two schemes and find that the error threshold for the modified
   quantum circuit is close to that for the original stabilization cycle. A
   possible way to implement the intersecting connections between different
   Xmon qubits on the circuit level is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{We report experiments on superconducting flux qubits in a circuit
   quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup. Two qubits, independently biased
   and controlled, are coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator.
   Dispersive qubit state readout reaches a maximum contrast of 72\%. We
   measure energy relaxation times at the symmetry point of 5 and 10 mu s,
   corresponding to 7 and 20 mu s when relaxation through the resonator due
   to Purcell effect is subtracted out, and levels of flux noise of 2.6 and
   2.7 mu Phi(0)/root Hz at 1 Hz for the two qubits. We discuss the origin
   of decoherence in the measured devices. The strong coupling between the
   qubits and the cavity leads to a large, cavity-mediated, qubit-qubit
   coupling. This coupling, which is characterized spectroscopically,
   reaches 38 MHz. These results demonstrate the potential of cQED as a
   platform for fundamental investigations of decoherence and quantum
   dynamics of flux qubits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the possibility of estimating 3D lower limb

   represented by Fourier series. A least square approach based on the
   minimization of the difference between the measured and estimated 3D
   linear accelerations and angular velocities was used to solve the
   related analytical problem. The approach was validated on ten healthy
   young volunteers (ten trials each), comparing the proposed approach with
   the measurements collected through a stereophotogrammetric system. The
   average root mean square differences between the estimated joint angles
   and those reconstructed with the stereophotogrammetric system were
   inferior than 3.2 degrees with correlation coefficients higher than

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{262-273}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the tensile flow behaviour of AA5182-O sheet was
   experimentally obtained in different material directions (RD, DD, and
   TD) at strain rates ranging from 0.001 to 1000 s(-1) and predicted by
   means of both phenomenological models and neural networks (NNs).
   Constants in Johnson-Cook (JC), Khan-Huang-Liang (KHL), and modified
   Voce were calculated using genetic algorithm (GA) and linear regression
   analysis and used to simulate the uniaxial tension tests. Two types of
   feed-forward back-propagation neural networks were also trained and
   validated to predict the rheological behaviour of the alloy without the
   limitations of a mathematical function. The weights and bias values of
   each network were then used to simulate uniaxial tensile deformation.
   Subsequently, the results were compared with experimental flow curves
   and accuracy parameters were calculated. It was found that the modified
   Voce constitutive equation was able to predict the flow behaviour of
   AA5182-O with better accuracy than JC and KHL models. Also, the NN was
   found to be the most accurate method of predicting the anisotropic
   rate-dependant behaviour of AA5182-O. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is advantageous as a sterilization
   technique in the biopharmaceutical industry since it is capable of
   targeting non-enveloped viruses that are typically challenging to
   destroy, as well as smaller viruses that can be difficult to remove via
   conventional separation techniques. In this work, we investigated the
   influence of oxygen in the media during UV irradiation and characterized
   the effect on chemical composition using NMR and LC-MS, as well as the
   ability of the irradiated media to support cell culture. Chemically
   defined Chinese hamster ovary cell growth media was irradiated at high
   fluences in a continuous-flow UV reactor. UV-irradiation caused the
   depletion of pyridoxamine, pyridoxine, pyruvate, riboflavin, tryptophan,
   and tyrosine; and accumulation of acetate, formate, kynurenine,
   lumichrome, and sarcosine. Pyridoxamine was the only compound to undergo
   complete degradation within the fluences considered; complete depletion
   of pyridoxamine was observed at 200 mJ/cm(2). Although in both
   oxygen-and nitrogen-saturated media, the cell culture performance was
   affected at fluences above 200 mJ/cm(2), there was less of an impact on
   cell culture performance in the nitrogen-saturated media. Based on these
   results, minimization of oxygen in cell culture media prior to UV
   treatment is recommended to minimize the negative impact on sensitive
   media.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are well known as an efficient energy
   storage solution for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However,
   performance and state of health of these batteries strictly depends on
   the usage scenario including operating temperature, power demand
   profile, and control strategy imposed by the battery management system.
   Also, in PHEVs equipped with electric climate control systems, climate
   control loads are imposed as additional loads on the battery, which
   results in a reduced all-electric range (AER) and increased battery
   capacity degradation. In this paper, vehicle AER, and fuel economy and
   life degradation of an aftermarket LiFePO4 Li-ion battery cell are
   studied for a PHEV under several usage scenarios. Each scenario consists
   of a series and parallel PHEV powertrain layout developed in Autonomie
   software, climate condition, that is, hot and cold weather, and a daily
   driving and charging profile. For simulations, models of battery
   performance, heat generation, and degradation developed based on
   experimental results are integrated with a thermal vehicle cabin model.
   Impact of climate control loads and battery thermal preconditioning are
   incorporated in the simulations. It is observed that climate control
   loads significantly affect the AER (up to 20\%), fuel economy (up to
   65\%), and battery degradation (up to 25\%). On the other hand, thermal
   preconditioning could be used to reduce these impacts. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the thermal modeling and validation of temperature
   rise in a prismatic lithium ion battery with LiFePO4 (also known as LFP)
   cathode material. The developed model represents the main thermal
   phenomena in the cell in terms of temperature distribution. A neural
   network approach is used for the model development. The proposed model
   is validated with the experimental data collected in terms of
   temperature and voltage profiles. In addition to this, the surface
   temperature distributions on the principal surface of the battery are
   studied under various discharge/charge profiles with varying boundary
   conditions (BCs) and average surface temperature distributions. For
   this, the different discharge rates of 2C and 4C and different boundary
   conditions (cooling/operating/bath temperature of 5 degrees C, 15
   degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) are selected. The results of
   this study show that the increased discharge rates result in increased
   surface temperature distributions on the principal surface of the
   battery. Furthermore, it is observed that changing the operating or
   boundary conditions considerably affect the surface temperature
   distributions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The urgent need to meet increasingly tight environmental regulations and
   new fuel economy requirements has motivated system science researchers
   and automotive engineers to take advantage of emerging computational
   techniques to further advance hybrid electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicle (PHEV) designs. In particular, research has focused on
   vehicle powertrain system design optimization, to reduce the fuel
   consumption and total energy cost while improving the vehicle's driving
   performance. In this work, two different natural optimization machines,
   namely the synchronous self-learning Pareto strategy and the elitism
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, are implemented for component
   sizing of a specific power-split PHEV platform with a Toyota plug-in
   Prius as the baseline vehicle. To do this, a high-fidelity model of the
   Toyota plug-in Prius is employed for the numerical experiments using the
   Autonomie simulation software. Based on the simulation results, it is
   demonstrated that Pareto-based algorithms can successfully optimize the
   design parameters of the vehicle powertrain.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present a semiclassical theory of the linear and nonlinear optical
   response of graphene. The emphasis is placed on the nonlinear optical
   response of graphene from the standpoint of the underlying chiral
   symmetry. The Bloch quasiparticles in the low-energy limit around the
   degeneracy points are dominantly chiral. It is shown that this chiral
   behavior in conjunction with scale invariance in graphene around the
   Dirac points results in the strong nonlinear optical response. Explicit
   expressions for the linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors are
   derived based on semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs). The linear terms
   agree with the result of Kubo formulation. The three main additive
   mechanisms contribute in the nonlinear optical response of graphene:
   pure intraband, pure interband and the interplay between them. For each
   contribution, an explicit response function is derived. The Kerr-type
   nonlinearity of graphene is then numerically studied and it is
   demonstrated that the nonlinear refractive index of graphene can be
   tuned and enhanced by applying a gate voltage. It is also discussed that
   a strong Kerr nonlinearity can be achieved in a gated graphene
   monolayer. However, this nonlinearity is accompanied with a significant
   amount of absorption loss.}},

   transients and response time of the wire to current pulse excitations.
   The second technique, employs impacts delivered by a solenoid actuator
   to perform modal analysis on bonding wire and obtain their natural
   frequencies. Steady-state experimental techniques are also developed to
   obtain the mode shapes, nodal points, and frequency-response curves of
   bonding wire under thermal (current) excitation.
   These techniques are deployed to study the response of 300 mu m diameter
   Aluminum and Aluminum coated Copper bonding wires to DC and AC currents.
   The experimental results are interpreted and verified by comparing them
   to numerical results obtained from finite element analysis. This study
   experimentally measures and reports, for the first time, the second and
   fourth in-plane and the second out-of-plane bending mode shapes of
   bonding wire. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Strategic insights into the previous conflict between the Elsipogtog
   First Nation and the New Brunswick (NB) Provincial Government are
   presented using a formal conflict resolution technique. The conflict
   surrounds the prospect of widespread hydraulic fracturing in NB, one of
   Canada's Maritime provinces on the east coast of the country. The
   hydraulic fracturing technique, used for mining natural gas trapped in
   shale rock formations, has recently received much attention. The process
   is strongly opposed by some groups, including the Elsipogtog First
   Nation, primarily due to the potential environmental impacts associated
   with the technique. Through the application of the Graph Model for
   Conflict Resolution, it is found that the status quo at the time of the
   conflict was the most likely outcome in this conflict. The previous
   Conservative New Brunswick government had a great deal of power in this
   conflict and it had demonstrated its intention to develop the shale gas
   in the province in the face of much civil unrest. It is discovered,
   however, that there is a potential resolution to the conflict that will
   appease the residents of NB, if a moratorium is issued concerning
   hydraulic fracturing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A time-varying risk analysis is proposed for an adaptive design
   framework in nonstationary conditions arising from climate change. A
   Bayesian, dynamic conditional copula is developed for modeling the
   time-varying dependence structure between mixed continuous and discrete
   multiattributes of multidimensional hydrometeorological phenomena. Joint
   Bayesian inference is carried out to fit the marginals and copula in an
   illustrative example using an adaptive, Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) sampler. Posterior mean estimates and credible intervals are
   provided for the model parameters and the Deviance Information Criterion
   (DIC) is used to select the model that best captures different forms of
   nonstationarity over time. This study also introduces a fully Bayesian,
   time-varying joint return period for multivariate time-dependent risk
   analysis in nonstationary environments. The results demonstrate that the
   nature and the risk of extreme-climate multidimensional processes are
   changed over time under the impact of climate change, and accordingly
   the long-term decision making strategies should be updated based on the
   anomalies of the nonstationary environment.}},

Abstract = {{Due to special features, modules comprising asymmetric hollow fiber
   membranes are widely used in various industrial gas separation
   processes. Accordingly, numerous mathematical models have been proposed
   for predicting and analyzing the performance. However, majority of the
   proposed models for this purpose assume that membrane permeance remains
   constant upon changes in temperature and pressure. In this study, a
   mathematical model is proposed by taking into account non-ideal effects
   including changes in pressure and temperature in both sides of hollow
   fibers, concentration polarization and Joule-Thomson effects. Finite
   element method is employed to solve the governing equations and model is
   validated using experimental data. The effect of temperature and
   pressure dependency of permeance and separation performance of hollow
   fiber membranemodules is investigated in the case of CO2/CH4. The effect
   of temperature and pressure dependence of membrane permeance is studied
   by using type Arrhenius type and partial immobilization equations to
   understand which form of the equations fits experimental data best.
   Findings reveal that the prediction of membrane performance for CO2/CH4
   separation is highly related to pressure and temperature; the models
   considering temperature and pressure dependence of membrane permeance
   match experimental data with higher accuracy. Also, results suggest that
   partial immobilization model represents a better prediction to the
   experimental data than Arrhenius type equation.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow fiber membrane permeators used in the separation industry are
   proven as preferred modules representing various benefits and advantages
   to gas separation processes. In the present study, a mathematical model
   is proposed to predict the separation performance of natural gas using
   hollow fiber membrane modules. The model is used to perform sensitivity
   analysis to distinguish which process parameters influence the most and
   are necessary to be assessed appropriately. In this model, SRK equation
   was used to justify the nonideal behavior of gas mixtures and
   Joule-Thomson equation was employed to take into account the changes in
   the temperature due to permeation. Also, the changes in temperature
   along shell side was calculated via thermodynamic principles. In the
   proposed mathematical model, the temperature dependence of membrane
   permeance is justified by the Arrhenius-type equation. Furthermore, a
   surface mole fraction parameter is introduced to consider the effect of
   accumulation of less permeable component adjacent to the membrane
   surface in the feed side. The model is validated using experimental
   data. Central Composite Designs are used to gain response surface model.
   For this, fiber inner diameter, active fiber length, module diameter and
   number of fibers in the module are taken as the input variables related
   to the physical geometries. Results show that the number as well as the
   length of the fibers have the most influence on the membrane
   performance. The maximum mole fraction of CO2 in the permeate stream is
   observed for low number of fibers and fibers having smaller active
   lengths. Also results indicate that at constant active fiber length,
   increasing the number of fibers decreases the permeate mole fraction of
   CO2. The findings demonstrate the importance of considering appropriate
   physical geometries for designing hollow fiber membrane permeators for
   practical gas separation applications.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to determine the optimal electrode size of sediment
   microbial fuel cells (SMFCs). Four SMFCs presented a proportional
   increase in the current to the electrode size of the MFCs at day16. From
   the I-V curves of the SMFCs, four plots of current versus electrode size
   (I-E-size plots) were obtained, which displayed high R-2 values ranging
   from 0.980 to 0.994. At day47, however, V-I curves deviated in one of
   the four MFCs, such that the I-E-size plots obtained from the I-V curves
   were inappropriate for estimating the electrode size. We found that the
   curves of overvoltage against the current density (-j curves) were
   comparable in the SMFCs, suggesting that the overvoltage is inversely
   proportional to the electrode size of the MFCs. The I-E-size plots
   corrected by using the -j curves had high R-2 values of over 0.978,
   indicating that the -j curves can be used for estimating the electrode
   size when the working voltage to current density ratio is different in

Abstract = {{The wide range of performance characteristics of storage technologies
   motivates the use of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) that combines
   the best features of multiple technologies. However, HESS design is
   complex, in that it involves the choice of storage technologies, the
   sizing of each storage element, and deciding when to charge and
   discharge each underlying storage element (operating strategy). We
   formulate the problem of jointly optimizing the sizing and the operating
   strategy of an HESS that can be used for a large class of applications
   and storage technologies. Instead of a single set of storage element
   sizes, our approach determines the Pareto-optimal frontier of the sizes
   of the storage elements along with the corresponding optimal operating
   strategy. Thus, as long as the performance objective of a storage
   application (such as an off-grid microgrid) can be expressed as a linear
   combination of the underlying storage sizes, the optimal vector of
   storage sizes falls somewhere on this frontier. We present two case
   studies to illustrate our approach, demonstrating that a single storage
   technology is sometimes inadequate to meet application requirements,
   unlike an HESS designed using our approach. We also find simple,
   near-optimal, and practical operating strategies for these case studies,
   which allows us to gain several new engineering insights.}},

Abstract = {{Networks that lack continuous end-to-end connections among their nodes
   due to node mobility, constrained power sources, or limited data storage
   space are called DTNs. To overcome the intermittent connectivity, DTN
   nodes store and carry the data packets they receive until they come into
   communication range of each other. In addition, they spread multiple
   copies of the same packet on the network to increase the delivery
   probability. In recent years, several routing protocols have been
   developed specifically for DTNs. These protocols vary in the number of
   copies they spread and the information they use to guide the packets to
   their destinations. There have been some reviews of those protocols, but
   no performance comparison has been conducted. In this article, we study
   four well-known DTN routing protocols: EPIDEMIC, Spray-and-Wait,
   PROPHET, and MAXPROP. We introduce a procedural form to present the
   protocols. We measure the performance of the protocols in terms of
   packet delivery, delivery cost, and average packet delay. We compare the
   protocols' performance together with the results of optimal routing
   using real-life scenarios of vehicles and pedestrians roaming in a city.
   We conduct several simulation experiments to show the impact of changing
   buffer capacity, packet lifetime, packet generation rate, and number of
   nodes on the performance metrics. The article is concluded by providing
   guidelines to develop an efficient DTN routing protocol. To the best of
   our knowledge, this work is the first to provide a detailed performance
   comparison among the diverse collection of DTN routing protocols.}},

Abstract = {{A multicriteria decision-making methodology is proposed for decision

   weights for evaluation criteria needed to evaluate design alternatives.
   A decision-maker classification is proposed based on the roles they play
   during the decision process. In order to accomplish this, in the first
   step, stakeholders' categorization is made, and their corresponding
   weights are determined representing their stake in decision. In the next
   step, each stakeholders' preference over the criteria set is determined,
   which leads to the ordinal rankings of the criteria for each
   stakeholder. In the following step, the stakeholders' criteria ordinal
   rankings are transformed into cardinal weights using the different
   decreasing utility functions. Thus, obtained final criteria weights are
   used for evaluation of the alternative design solutions. Optimality
   check measures are devised to select the appropriate decreasing utility
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed arithmetic coding (DAC) is an effective technique for
   implementing Slepian-Wolf coding (SWC). It has been shown that a DAC
   code partitions source space into unequal-size codebooks, so that the
   overall performance of DAC codes depends on the cardinality and
   structure of these codebooks. The problem of DAC codebook cardinality
   has been solved by the so-called codebook cardinality spectrum (CCS).
   This paper extends the previous work on CCS by studying the problem of
   DAC codebook structure. We define Hamming distance spectrum (HDS) to
   describe DAC codebook structure and propose a mathematical method to
   calculate the HDS of DAC codes. The theoretical analyses are verified by
   experimental results.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{1057-1068}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes multiagent supervisory control for precise power
   management in isolated dc microgrids. Two power management aspects are
   considered: 1) equal power sharing, which is realized via a proposed
   distributed equal power sharing algorithm; and 2) optimal power
   dispatch, which is achieved through a proposed distributed equal
   incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional
   advantage of the ability to restore the average system voltage to its
   nominal value. The proposed algorithms are based on the application of
   the average consensus theory along with voltage sensitivity analysis.
   Each distributed generation (DG) unit exchanges information with its
   neighbors, thus locally updating its no-load voltage setting to achieve
   the supervisory control objectives. The incorporation of DG droop-based
   control renders the proposed algorithms fully distributed with a reduced
   number of agents. The stability of the proposed algorithms is addressed,
   as well as the convergence of the proposed DEIC algorithm. Real-time
   OPAL-RT simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop application.}},

Title = {{Mobility-Aware Uplink Interference Model for 5G Heterogeneous Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{2231-2244}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To meet the surging demand for throughput, 5G cellular networks need to
   be more heterogeneous and much denser, by deploying more and more small
   cells. In particular, the number of users in each small cell can change
   dramatically due to users' mobility, resulting in random and time
   varying uplink interference. This paper considers the uplink
   interference in a 5G heterogeneous network, which is jointly covered by
   one macro cell and several small cells. Based on the Levy flight moving
   model, a mobility-aware interference model is proposed to characterize
   the uplink interference from macro cell users to small cell users. In
   this model, the total uplink interference is characterized by its moment
   generating function, for both closed subscriber group (CSG) and open
   subscriber group (CSG) femto cells. In addition, the proposed
   interference model is a function of basic step length, which is a key
   velocity parameter of Levy flights. It is shown by both theoretical
   analysis and simulation results that the proposed interference model
   provides a flexible way of evaluating the system performance in terms of
   success probability and average rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an empirical study aiming at identifying the main
   differences between different logistic regression models and collision
   data aggregation methods that are commonly applied in road safety
   literature for modeling collision severity. In particular, the research
   compares three popular multilevel logistic models (i.e., sequential
   binary logit models, ordered logit models, and multinomial logit models)
   as well as three data aggregation methods (i.e., occupant based, vehicle
   based, and collision based). Six years of collision data (2001-2006)
   from 31 highway routes from across the province of Ontario, Canada were
   used for this analysis. It was found that a multilevel multinomial logit
   model has the best fit to the data than the other two models while the
   results obtained from occupant-based data are more reliable than those
   from vehicle-and collision-based data. More importantly, while generally
   consistent in terms of factors that were found to be significant between
   different models and data aggregation methods, the effect size of each
   factor differ substantially, which could have significant implications
   for evaluating the effects of different safety-related policies and
   countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the inherent ill-posed nature of chemical species tomography
   (CST) problems, additional information based on the presumed species
   distribution must be introduced into the reconstruction procedure. The
   role that this prior information plays in tomographic reconstruction
   differs depending on whether the CST problem is discrete ill-posed or
   rank-deficient. The former case arises mainly in laboratory studies
   involving small scale problems with high degrees of optical access and
   often a stationary flow field, while the later occurs when the number
   and arrangement of measurements are limited by the size and/or the
   optical access afforded by the containing geometry. This paper
   elucidates the difference between these two types of CST problems, and
   reviews various ways that prior information can be used to enhance
   reconstruction accuracy of CST experiments on turbulent flows. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This article introduces a flexible Bayesian semiparametric approach to
   analyzing crash data that are of hierarchical or multilevel nature. We
   extend the traditional varying intercept (random effects) multilevel
   model by relaxing its standard parametric distributional assumption.
   While accounting for unobserved cross-group heterogeneity in the data
   through intercept, the proposed method allows identifying latent
   subpopulations (and consequently outliers) in data based on a Dirichlet
   process mixture. It also allows estimating the number of latent
   subpopulations using an elegant mathematical structure instead of
   prespecifying this number arbitrarily as in conventional latent class or
   finite mixture models. In this paper, we evaluate our method on two
   recent railway grade crossing crash datasets, at province and
   municipality levels, from Canada for the years 2008-2013. We use
   cross-validation predictive densities and pseudo-Bayes factor for
   Bayesian model selection. While confirming the need for a multilevel
   modeling approach for both datasets, the results reveal the inadequacy
   of the standard parametric assumption in the varying intercept model for
   the municipality-level dataset. In fact, our proposed method is shown to
   improve model fitting significantly for the latter data. In a fully
   probabilistic framework, we also identify the expected number of latent
   clusters that share similar unidentified features among Canadian
   provinces and municipalities. It is possible thus to further investigate
   the reasons for such similarities and dissimilarities. This can have
   important policy implications for various safety management programs.

Abstract = {{The subthreshold region of operation in digital CMOS circuits provides a
   suitable low-power solution for many applications that need tremendously
   low-energy operation. However, this advantage comes at the cost of
   speed, so enhancing the speed of subthreshold circuits can expand their
   application spectrum. This paper presents the optimum pMOS-to-nMOS width
   ratio that leads to the maximum frequency of operation in the
   subthreshold region with no extra energy cost. The optimum pMOS-to-nMOS
   width ratio is obtained and compared through three approaches: 1)
   finding the maximum current-over-capacitance ratio of a biased
   transistor; 2) deriving an analytical expression by minimizing the delay
   of an inverter; and 3) simulating different CMOS logic gates in the
   subthreshold region. Simulation results illustrate that in the
   subthreshold region, the frequency attains its maximum at the optimum
   pMOS-to-nMOS width ratio independent of the supply voltage. Using this
   optimum value in designing a carry-look-ahead adder improves the
   propagation delay, energy consumption, and energy-delay product by up to
   33\%, 36\%, and 57\%, receptively, compared with when the conventional
   pMOS-to-nMOS width ratio (in the superthreshold region) is used. We
   verified our analytical model by performing circuit simulations in four
   CMOS technologies (TSMC 180 nm, IBM 130 nm, TSMC 90 nm, and ST 65 nm).}},

Abstract = {{Model-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques have been
   developed recently to improve the dynamic and steady-state performance
   of MPPT. Although they are successfully implemented in homogeneous
   photovoltaic (PV) systems, there is still no model-based MPPT for
   partially shaded PV systems, mainly because the available models are
   complex and time consuming. This paper develops a fast modeling approach
   for partially shaded PV systems. By utilizing three developed rules that
   govern the formation of power peaks in partially shaded PV systems, the
   proposed approach can quickly find the power peaks of these systems
   without simulating the entire power curve. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach in finding the power peaks of PV systems quickly and
   accurately is verified using MATLAB-Simulink and real-time simulator in
   hardware in the loop application. Moreover, a model-based MPPT is
   developed utilizing the proposed modeling method. The developed MPPT
   successfully improves the dynamic performance of power extraction,
   guarantees the operation on the global maximum power peak, and
   eliminates oscillating steady-state power losses.}},

Title = {{A Multi-Hop Broadcast Protocol for Emergency Message Dissemination in
   Urban Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks}},

Abstract = {{In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), multi-hop wireless broadcast has
   been considered a promising technology to support safety-related
   applications that have strict quality-of-service (QoS) requirements such
   as low latency, high reliability, scalability, etc. However, in the
   urban transportation environment, the efficiency of multi-hop broadcast
   is critically challenged by complex road structure, severe channel
   contention, message redundancy, etc. In this paper, we propose an urban
   multi-hop broadcast protocol (UMBP) to disseminate emergency messages.
   To lower emergency message transmission delay and reduce message
   redundancy, UMBP includes a novel forwarding node selection scheme that
   utilizes iterative partition, mini-slot, and black-burst to quickly
   select remote neighboring nodes, and a single forwarding node is
   successfully chosen by the asynchronous contention among them. Then,
   bidirectional broadcast, multi-directional broadcast, and directional
   broadcast are designed according to the positions of the emergency
   message senders. Specifically, at the first hop, bidirectional broadcast
   or multi-directional broadcast conducts the forwarding node selection
   scheme in different directions simultaneously, and a single forwarding
   node is successfully chosen in each direction. Then, directional
   broadcast is adopted at each hop in the message propagation direction
   until the emergency message reaches an intersection area where
   multi-directional broadcast is performed again, which finally enables
   the emergency message to cover the target area seamlessly. Analysis and
   simulation results show that the proposed UMBP significantly improves
   the performance of multi-hop broadcast in terms of one-hop delay,
   message propagation speed, and message reception rate.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, a proof-of-concept of novel hybrid rechargeable battery based on
   electrochemical reactions of both nickel-zinc and zinc-air batteries is
   demonstrated using NiO/Ni(OH)(2) nanoflakes self-assembled into
   mesoporous spheres as the active electrode material. The hybrid battery
   operates on two sets of fundamentally different battery reactions
   combined at the cell level, unlike in other hybrid systems where
   batteries of different reactions are simply connected through an
   external circuitry. As a result of combining nickel-zinc and zinc-air
   reactions, the hybrid battery demonstrates both remarkably high power
   density (volumetric, 14 000 W L-1; gravimetric, 2700 W kg(-1)) and
   energy density of 980 W h kg(-1), significantly outperforming the
   performances of a conventional zinc-air battery. Furthermore, the hybrid
   battery demonstrates excellent charge rate capability up to 10 times
   faster than the rate of discharge without any capacity and voltage
   degradations, which makes it highly suited for large-scale applications
   such as electric vehicle propulsion and smart-grid energy storage.}},

Title = {{Automatic Realignment of Defective Assemblies Using an Inverse

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Alignment and plumbness of construction assemblies is a challenging and
   fundamental problem because it relies on manual solutions to the
   underlying geometric feedback control problems inherent in practices
   such as pipefitting and steel structures erection. Where defective
   components and segments are not well controlled, the errors propagate in
   larger components and therefore cause more severe challenges and large
   costs consequently. This paper presents a framework for automatic and
   systematic development of realignment actions required to achieve a
   desired state by employing and combining two theories:
   (1)three-dimensional (3D) imaging that enables the identification of the
   as-built status and then quantification of incurred discrepancies as a
   feedback signal by comparing the captured as-built status with the
   designed state existing in the building information model (BIM), and
   (2)an inverse kinematics analogy that results in the calculation of
   required changes in the degrees of freedom defined where manipulations
   and changes can be applied. Experimental results show that the framework
   can generate the required actions for achieving a desired state
   systematically and with a high level of accuracy. (C) 2015 American

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An option prioritization technique is developed to efficiently elicit
   the preferences, both unknown and crisp, of decision makers (DMs) in
   strategic conflicts. In the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, each DM
   has one or more options, each of which may be selected or not. A state,
   or possible scenario, is formed when all DMs make an option selection.
   The software GMCR II contains an option prioritization procedure that
   makes it easy for a modeller to enter a DM's crisp preference ordering
   over the states using prioritized statements describing the DM's
   preferred option combinations. This procedure is extended by adding two
   new logical connectives that describe uncertainty of preference. For
   each DM, a range of possible scores for each feasible state can then be
   calculated, facilitating the determination of a preference ordering
   containing uncertainty by comparing and ranking scores. To demonstrate
   how this new methodology can be used to represent unknown preferences in
   a real-world decision problem, it is applied to a Canadian dispute over
   proposed water exports.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study how energy-efficient routing at the network
   layer can be coordinated with sleep scheduling at the link layer to
   increase network-wide energy efficiency in wireless ad hoc networks. We
   identify a trade-off between the reduced transmit power at senders with
   multi-receiver diversity and the increased receive power at forwarders
   with coordinated sleep scheduling. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive
   study of how coordinated sleep scheduling affects the energy-efficient
   routing performance based on a 2-D gird topology and time division
   multiple access (TDMA) medium access control (MAC). Simulation results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated routing and sleep
   scheduling, significant impact of coordinated sleep scheduling on the
   energy-efficient routing performance, and relationship between
   networking conditions (in terms of the traffic load and node density)
   and overall system performance achieved by different energy-efficient

Abstract = {{In a previous analysis of 2300 mRNAs via whole-mount fluorescent in situ
   hybridization in cellularizing Drosophila embryos, we found that 70\% of
   the transcripts exhibited some form of subcellular localization. To see
   whether this prevalence is unique to early Drosophila embryos, we
   examined similar to 8000 transcripts over the full course of
   embryogenesis and similar to 800 transcripts in late third instar larval
   tissues. The numbers and varieties of new subcellular localization
   patterns are both striking and revealing. In the much larger cells of
   the third instar larva, virtually all transcripts observed showed
   subcellular localization in at least one tissue. We also examined the
   prevalence and variety of localization mechanisms for >100 long
   noncoding RNAs. All of these were also found to be expressed and
   subcellularly localized. Thus, subcellular RNA localization appears to
   be the norm rather than the exception for both coding and noncoding
   RNAs. These results, which have been annotated and made available on a
   recompiled database, provide a rich and unique resource for functional
   gene analyses, some examples of which are provided.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale platform has been developed to model lithium ion battery
   (LIB) electrodes based on the real microstructure morphology. This
   multiscale framework consists of a microscale level where the electrode
   microstructure architecture is modeled and a macroscale level where
   discharge/charge is simulated. The coupling between two scales are
   performed in real time unlike using common surrogate based models for
   microscale. For microscale geometry 3D microstructure is reconstructed
   based on the nano-scale X-ray computed tomography data replacing typical
   computer generated microstructure. It is shown that this model can
   predict the experimental performance of LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode at
   different discharge rates more accurate than the conventional homogenous
   models. The approach employed in this study provides valuable insight
   into the spatial distribution of lithium -ion inside the real
   microstructure of LIB electrodes. The inhomogenous microstructure of LFP
   causes a wider range of physical and electrochemical properties in
   microscale compared to homogenous models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effects of microstructure, sample dimensions, and cross-sectional
   geometry on the deformation characteristics of electroplated
   nanocrystalline copper sub-micron pillars are investigated.
   Nanocrystalline copper pillars were produced with four types of
   geometry-solid core, hollow, c-shaped, and x-shaped-with outer diameters
   of similar to 1000 or 220 nm and three different average grain sizes
   (between 5.1 and 49.3 nm). Flow stress results from uniaxial compression
   tests of 1000- and 220-nm-outer-diameter pillars, with average grain
   sizes in the range between similar to 32 and 50 nm, revealed there are
   no observable strength dependences with the pillar cross-sectional
   geometries. This suggests that they behave with bulk-like character:
   mechanical properties independent of size and sample geometry. All of
   the pillar specimens examined exhibit an increase in mechanical strength
   with reduction of grain sizes, but soften as the crystalline dimensions
   are smaller than 10 to 20 nm threshold limits. Interestingly, pillars
   with outer diameters of 220 nm are distinctively softer than the
   1000-nm-diameter samples when their grain size is at and below this
   threshold limit. These results indicate a strength specimen size effect
   exists for such fine grain copper pillars. (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Abstract = {{Local binary patterns (LBP) are considered among the most
   computationally efficient high-performance texture features. However,
   the LBP method is very sensitive to image noise and is unable to capture
   macrostructure information. To best address these disadvantages, in this
   paper, we introduce a novel descriptor for texture classification, the
   median robust extended LBP (MRELBP). Different from the traditional LBP
   and many LBP variants, MRELBP compares regional image medians rather
   than raw image intensities. A multiscale LBP type descriptor is computed
   by efficiently comparing image medians over a novel sampling scheme,
   which can capture both microstructure and macrostructure texture
   information. A comprehensive evaluation on benchmark data sets reveals
   MRELBP's high performance-robust to gray scale variations, rotation
   changes and noise-but at a low computational cost. MRELBP produces the
   best classification scores of 99.82\%, 99.38\%, and 99.77\% on three
   popular Outex test suites. More importantly, MRELBP is shown to be
   highly robust to image noise, including Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur,
   salt-and-pepper noise, and random pixel corruption.}},

Abstract = {{Global increases in the occurrence of large, severe wildfires in
   forested watersheds threaten drinking water supplies and aquatic
   ecology. Wildfire effects on water quality, particularly nutrient levels
   and forms, can be significant. The longevity and downstream propagation
   of these effects as well as the geochemical mechanisms regulating them
   remain largely undocumented at larger river basin scales. Here,
   phosphorus (P) speciation and sorption behavior of suspended sediment
   were examined in two river basins impacted by a severe wildfire in
   southern Alberta, Canada. Fine-grained suspended sediments (<125m) were
   sampled continuously during ice-free conditions over a two-year period
   (2009-2010), 6 and 7years after the wildfire. Suspended sediment samples
   were collected from upstream reference (unburned) river reaches,
   multiple tributaries within the burned areas, and from reaches
   downstream of the burned areas, in the Crowsnest and Castle River
   basins. Total particulate phosphorus (TPP) and particulate phosphorus
   forms (nonapatite inorganic P, apatite P, organic P), and the
   equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) of suspended sediment were
   assessed. Concentrations of TPP and the EPC0 were significantly higher
   downstream of wildfire-impacted areas compared to reference (unburned)
   upstream river reaches. Sediments from the burned tributary inputs
   contained higher levels of bioavailable particulate P (NAIP) - these
   effects were also observed downstream at larger river basin scales. The
   release of bioavailable P from postfire, P-enriched fine sediment is a
   key mechanism causing these effects in gravel-bed rivers at larger basin
   scales. Wildfire-associated increases in NAIP and the EPC0 persisted 6
   and 7years after wildfire. Accordingly, this work demonstrated that fine
   sediment in gravel-bed rivers is a significant, long-term source of
   in-stream bioavailable P that contributes to a legacy of wildfire
   impacts on downstream water quality, aquatic ecology, and drinking water
   treatability.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a constitutive framework based on a rate-dependent
   crystal plasticity theory is employed to simulate localized deformation
   phenomena in hexagonal closed-packed (HCP) metals such as magnesium. A
   new and simplified method to account for deformation twinning is
   proposed. The new framework allows the twinned zones and the parent
   matrix to rotate independently. This is an extension of an earlier model
   presented by Levesque et al. (2010). Simulations are performed on AM30
   and AZ31B magnesium alloys using the new crystal plasticity model where
   crystallographic slip and deformation twinning are the principal
   deformation mechanisms. Different simulations such as tension,
   compression, and forming limit diagram (FLD) calculations are performed
   to compare the results of the new formulation with the conventional
   method presented earlier. In addition, the effect of the material
   texture on formability using the new formulation is assessed. It is
   shown that the new framework leads to different forming limit diagrams
   (FLDs) and the FLD resulted from the new framework predicts higher
   formability. It is understood that, the new formulation accommodates
   higher slip activity and more realistic twin-parent interactions. (C)

Abstract = {{Topographic mapping in planetary environments relies on accurate
   three-dimensional (3D) scan registration methods. However, most global
   registration algorithms relying on features such as fast point feature
   histograms and Harris-3D show poor alignment accuracy in these settings
   due to the poor structure of the Mars-like terrain, and the
   variable-resolution, occluded, sparse range data that are difficult to
   register without some a priori knowledge of the environment. In this
   paper, we propose an alternative approach to 3D scan registration using
   the curvelet transform that performs multiresolution geometric analysis
   to obtain a set of coefficients indexed by scale (coarsest to finest),
   angle, and spatial position. Features are detected in the curvelet
   domain to take advantage of the directional selectivity of the
   transform. A descriptor is computed for each feature by calculating the
   3D spatial histogram of the image gradients, and nearest-neighbor-based
   matching is used to calculate the feature correspondences.
   Correspondence rejection using random sample consensus identifies
   inliers, and a locally optimal singular value decomposition-based
   estimation of the rigid-body transformation aligns the laser scans given
   the reprojected correspondences in the metric space. Experimental
   results on a publicly available dataset of a planetary analogue indoor
   facility, as well as simulated and real-world scans from Neptec Design
   Group's IVIGMS 3D laser rangefinder at the outdoor CSA Mars yard,
   demonstrate improved performance over existing methods in the
   challenging sparse Mars-like terrain.}},

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation programs are essential for efficiently managing large
   networks of infrastructure assets and sustaining their safety and
   operability. While numerous studies in the literature have focused on
   various aspects of infrastructure rehabilitation, limited efforts have
   investigated the overall dynamics of the process. The research presented
   in this paper, therefore, takes a holistic view to investigate the
   dynamics that affect rehabilitation decisions and the long-term
   performance of an infrastructure network. First, the interactions among
   the main parameters related to asset deterioration, rehabilitation
   actions, and cost accumulation have been analyzed using causal loop
   diagrams (CLDs). Afterward, a system dynamics (SD) model has been
   developed based on the CLDs and the underlying mathematical relations
   among the various parameters. The SD model was then tested on a network
   of 1,000 assets over a 50-year plan, considering a range of
   rehabilitation policies regarding budgets, possible rehabilitation
   actions, and fund allocation options. The model proved to be a practical
   and effective tool for quick assessment of the long-term impact of
   rehabilitation policies on infrastructure performance and costs. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Gusset plate connections with single-angle steel members are commonly
   used in power transmission towers. However, little research has been
   carried out with regard to the compressive behavior and design of gusset
   plates connected with single-angle members. Due to the complexity of the
   connections and load eccentricity, it is difficult to predict the
   compressive strength of the gusset plates. In this study, two full-scale
   experimental tests and a numerical parametric study were conducted to
   investigate the compressive behavior of such gusset plate connections.
   In the tests, the buckling failure mode and lateral-torsional
   deformation were observed. Finite-element (FE) models were then
   established and validated through comparison against the test results.
   In the parametric study, the effects of gusset plate thickness, unbraced
   length, distance to bending line, and load on the adjacent bracing
   member were examined. On the basis of the findings of this study and
   currently available design methods, two design methods were proposed for
   predicting the compressive strength of gusset plates connected with
   single-angle members. Good agreements were observed between the FE and
   design results in terms of the compressive strength and it was found
   that one method based on plate buckling gave a better prediction of the
   strength of gusset plates connected with single-angle members than the
   other based on effective column. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Insights into charge balance and its limitations in simplified
   phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices}},
Journal = {{ORGANIC ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Simplified phosphorescent organic light-emitting device (PHOLED), which
   utilizes only two organic layers, showed record-high efficiency when
   first introduced. It is quite surprising that this device can have such
   high efficiency without the use of complex carrier and exciton
   confinement layers that are common in the state-of-the-art PHOLEDs
   nowadays. Therefore, it is important to understand how good charge
   balance is in simplified PHOLED and why. In this work, we study the
   effects of altering charge balance in simplified PHOLED through means of
   changing layer thickness in the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron
   transport layer (ETL) as well as intentionally doping hole and electron
   traps in the HTL and ETL, respectively, on device efficiency. The
   results show that when using high carrier mobility charge transport
   materials, changing layer thickness does not impact charge balance
   appreciably. On the other hand, introducing charge traps in a thin layer
   within the HTL or ETL can, in comparison, influence charge balance more
   significantly, and proves to be a more effective approach for studying
   the factors limiting charge balance in these devices. The results reveal
   that simplified PHOLEDs are generally hole-rich, and that the leakage of
   electrons to the counter electrode is also a major mechanism behind the
   poor charge balance and efficiency loss in these devices. In order to
   optimize charge balance in simplified PHOLED, it is important to reduce
   hole transport in the device so that e-h ratio can be brought closer to
   unity, as well as eliminate electron leakage. Finally, we show that by
   simply using an electron blocking HTL, the efficiency of the device can
   be enhanced by as much as 25\%, representing the highest reported for
   simplified PHOLEDs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eshelby's solution is the analytical method that can derive the elastic
   field within and around an ellipsoidal inclusion embedded in a matrix.
   Since breast tumor can be regarded as an elastic inclusion with
   different elastic properties from those of surrounding matrix when the
   deformation is small, we applied Eshelby's solution to predict the
   stress and strain fields in the breast containing a suspicious lesion.
   The results were used to investigate the effectiveness of strain ratio
   (SR) from elastography in representing modulus ratio (MR) that may be
   the meaningful indicator of the malignancy of the lesion. This study
   showed that SR significantly underestimates MR and is varied with the
   shape and the modulus of the lesion. Based on the results from Eshelby's
   solution and finite element analysis (FEA), we proposed a surface
   regression model as a polynomial function that can predict the MR of the
   lesion to the matrix. The model has been applied to gelatin-based
   phantoms and clinical ultrasound images of human breasts containing
   different types of lesions. The results suggest the potential of the
   proposed method to improve the diagnostic performance of breast cancer
   using elastography.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-swirl nozzles are widely used in applications such as
   combustion, painting, air-conditioning, and fire suppression.
   Understanding the effects of nozzle geometry and inlet flow conditions
   on liquid film thickness, discharge coefficient and spray angle is very
   important in nozzle design. The nozzle-internal flow is two-phase with a
   secondary flow which makes its detailed analysis rather complex. In the
   current work, the flow field inside a pressure-swirl nozzle is studied
   theoretically. Using the integral momentum method, the growth of the
   boundary layer from the nozzle entry to the orifice exit is investigated
   and the velocity through the boundary layer and the main body of the
   swirling liquid is calculated. A numerical modeling and a series of
   experiments have also been performed to validate the theoretical
   results. The effect of various geometrical parameters is studied and
   results are compared for viscous and inviscid cases. In addition, the
   condition in which the centrifugal force of the swirling flow overcomes
   the viscous force and induces an air core is predicted. The theoretical
   analysis discussed in this paper provides better criteria for the design
   and the performance analysis of nozzles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Geometrical discontinuities such as notches need to be carefully
   analysed by engineers because of the stress concentration generated by
   them. Notches become even more important when the component is
   subjected, in service, to very severe conditions, such as
   high-temperature fatigue and imposed viscoplastic behaviour such as
   creep. The knowledge of strains and stresses in such stress
   concentration zones is essential for an efficient and safe design
   process. The aim of the paper is to present an improvement and extension
   of the existing notch-tip creep stress-strain analysis method developed
   by Nunez and Glinka, validated for U-notches only, to a wide variety of
   blunt V-notches. The key in obtaining the extension to blunt V-notches
   is the substitution of the Creager-Paris equations with the more
   generalized Lazzarin-Tovo solution, allowing a unified approach to the
   evaluation of linear elastic stress fields in the neighbourhood of both
   cracks and notches. Numerous examples have been analysed to date, and
   the stress fields obtained according to the proposed method were
   compared with appropriate finite element data, resulting in a very good
   agreement. In view of the promising results discussed in the paper,
   authors are considering possible further extension to sharp V-notches

   periodic limb motion. The CPG model produces the motion based on a
   simple descending command-the desired frequency of motion. Furthermore,
   the CPG model is implemented by a spiking neuron model; as a result of
   the stochasticity in the neuron activities, the motion exhibits a
   certain level of variation similar to real human motion. Finally,
   because of the simple structure of the CPG model, it can generate the
   sophisticated muscle excitation commands much faster than
   optimization-based methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the mechanisms of energy loss in parallel connection of
   microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is explored using two MFC units producing
   different open circuit voltage (OCV) and current. In open circuit mode,
   non-Faradaic current flows in low OCV unit, implying energy loss caused
   by different OCVs in parallelly stacked MFCs. In a stacked MFC in
   parallel under close circuit mode, it is confirmed that energy loss
   occurs until the working voltage in high OCV unit becomes identical to
   the other unit having low OCV. This result indicates that different
   voltage between individual MFC units can cause energy loss due to both
   non-Faradic and Faradaic current that flow from high voltage unit to low
   voltage unit even in parallelly stacked MFCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An ensemble of mixture density neural networks is used for short-term
   wind speed and power forecasting. Predicted wind speeds obtained from a
   numerical weather prediction model are used as the input data for the
   mixture density network, whose outputs are the mixture density
   parameters (used to represent the probability density function of the
   uncertain output or target variable). All mixture density neural
   networks in an ensemble are assumed to have a three-layer architecture,
   with each architecture having different numbers of nodes in the hidden
   layer. Because a mixture of Gaussian distributions is used to
   approximate the conditional distribution of the target random variable
   (either wind speed or wind turbine power), the uncertainties arising
   from both the model structure and model output can be completely
   quantified. In consequence, rigorous confidence intervals reflecting
   these sources of uncertainty in the prediction can be obtained and used
   to assess the performance for the wind speed and wind turbine power
   forecasting. An application of the proposed approach to a data set of
   the measured wind speed and power from an operational wind turbine in a
   wind farm in Taiwan is used to test the methodology. The results of this
   application demonstrate that the proposed methodology works well for the
   multi-step ahead wind speed and power forecasting. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel pixel-wise moire-wavelength refinement technique was developed
   for system calibration in single-frame digital phase-shifting 3D shape
   measurement. The method requires projection of only a single binary grid
   and capture of a single image frame. Phase-shifted images are generated
   by digitally phase-shifting a synthetic grid superimposed on the
   captured frame. The grid patterns are removed from the generated images
   by wavelet-Fourier transform to extract moire patterns, from which phase
   and surface height are computed. A wavelength-height function, computed
   during system calibration, accounts for moire-wavelength variation over
   calibration depth in phase-to-height mapping. Novel pixel-wise
   wavelength and height (depth) refinement, using this function, improved
   measurement accuracy compared to measurement using a single global
   wavelength across all pixels. The method was demonstrated in measurement
   of a flat plate, hemispherical object, and manikin head. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of thermal load and shear force on
   the buckling of nanobeams. Higher-order shear deformation beam theories
   are implemented and their predictions of the critical buckling load and
   post-buckled configurations are compared to those of Euler-Bernoulli and
   Timoshenko beam theories. The nonlocal Eringen elasticity model is
   adopted to account a size-dependence at the nano-scale. Analytical
   closed form solutions for critical buckling loads and post-buckling
   configurations are derived for proposed beam theories. This would be
   helpful for those who work in the mechanical analysis of nanobeams
   especially experimentalists working in the field. Results show that
   thermal load has a more significant impact on the buckling behavior of
   simply-supported beams (S-S) than it has on clamped-clamped (C-C) beams.
   However, the nonlocal effect has more impact on C-C beams that it does
   on S-S beams. Moreover, it was found that the predictions obtained from
   Timoshenko beam theory are identical to those obtained using all
   higher-order shear deformation theories, suggesting that Timoshenko beam
   theory is sufficient to analyze buckling in nanobeams.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental question in computational neuroscience is how to connect a
   network of spiking neurons to produce desired macroscopic or mean field
   dynamics. One possible approach is through the Neural Engineering
   Framework (NEF). The NEF approach requires quantities called decoders
   which are solved through an optimization problem requiring large matrix
   inversion. Here, we show how a decoder can be obtained analytically for
   type I and certain type II firing rates as a function of the
   heterogeneity of its associated neuron. These decoders generate
   approximants for functions that converge to the desired function in
   mean-squared error like 1/N, where N is the number of neurons in the
   network. We refer to these decoders as scale-invariant decoders due to
   their structure. These decoders generate weights for a network of
   neurons through the NEF formula for weights. These weights force the
   spiking network to have arbitrary and prescribed mean field dynamics.
   The weights generated with scale-invariant decoders all lie on low
   dimensional hypersurfaces asymptotically. We demonstrate the
   applicability of these scale-invariant decoders and weight surfaces by
   constructing networks of spiking theta neurons that replicate the
   dynamics of various well known dynamical systems such as the neural
   integrator, Van der Pol system and the Lorenz system. As these decoders
   are analytically determined and non-unique, the weights are also
   analytically determined and non-unique. We discuss the implications for
   measured weights of neuronal networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with detection and classification of intermittent
   stochastic faults by combining a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)
   representation with either Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian estimators.
   The gPC is used to propagate stochastic changes in an input variable to
   measured quantities from which the fault is to be inferred. The fault
   detection and classification problem is formulated as an inverse problem
   of identifying the unknown input based on the Maximum Likelihood of fit
   between predicted and measured output variables, or on a Bayesian
   inference based estimator which recursively updates the gPC
   coefficients. Simulation studies compare the proposed methods with a
   particle filter (PF) to estimate the value of an unknown feed mass
   fraction of a chemical process. The proposed method is shown to be
   significantly more efficient in terms of computational effort and less
   sensitive to user defined tuning parameters than a PF.}},

Title = {{Motor Unit Characteristics after Targeted Muscle Reinnervation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a surgical procedure used to
   redirect nerves originally controlling muscles of the amputated limb
   into remaining muscles above the amputation, to treat phantom limb pain
   and facilitate prosthetic control. While this procedure effectively
   establishes robust prosthetic control, there is little knowledge on the
   behavior and characteristics of the reinnervated motor units. In this
   study we compared the m. pectoralis of five TMR patients to nine
   able-bodied controls with respect to motor unit action potential (MUAP)
   characteristics. We recorded and decomposed high-density surface EMG
   signals into individual spike trains of motor unit action potentials. In
   the TMR patients the MUAP surface area normalized to the electrode grid
   surface (0.25 +/- 0.17 and 0.81 +/- 0.46, p < 0.001) and the MUAP
   duration (10.92 +/- 3.89 ms and 14.03 +/- 3.91 ms, p < 0.01) were
   smaller for the TMR group than for the controls. The mean MUAP amplitude
   (0.19 +/- 0.11 mV and 0.14 +/- 0.06 mV, p = 0.07) was not significantly
   different between the two groups. Finally, we observed that MUAP surface
   representation in TMR generally overlapped, and the surface occupied by
   motor units corresponding to only one motor task was on average smaller
   than 12\% of the electrode surface. These results suggest that smaller
   MUAP surface areas in TMR patients do not necessarily facilitate
   prosthetic control due to a high degree of overlap between these areas,
   and a neural information-based control could lead to improved
   performance. Based on the results we also infer that the size of the
   motor units after reinnervation is influenced by the size of the
   innervating motor neuron.}},

Abstract = {{The facile solution-processability of methyl ammonium lead halide
   (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskites has catalyzed the development of inexpensive,
   hybrid perovskite-based optoelectronics. It is apparent, though, that
   solution processed CH3NH3PbI3 films possess local emission
   heterogeneities, stemming from electronic disorder in the material.
   Herein we investigate the spatially resolved emission properties of
   CH3NH3PbI3 thin films through detailed emission intensity versus
   excitation intensity measurements. These studies enable us to establish
   the existence of nonuniform trap density variations wherein regions of
   CH3NH3PbI3 films exhibit effective free carrier recombination while
   others exhibit emission dynamics strongly influenced by the presence of
   trap states. Such trap density variations lead to spatially varying
   emission quantum yields and correspondingly impact the performance of
   both methylammonium lead halide perovskite solar cells and other hybrid
   perovskite-based devices. Of additional note is that the observed
   spatial extent of the optical disorder extends over length scales
   greater than that of underlying crystalline domains, suggesting the
   existence of other factors, beyond grain boundary-related nonradiative
   recombination channels, which lead to significant intrafilm optical
   heterogeneities.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of corrosion on the structural behaviour of reinforced
   concrete (RC) beams without stirrups was experimentally investigated. A
   total of seven medium-scale RC beams without stirrups were constructed.
   The beams measured 150mm wide, 250mm deep and 1700mm long. The test
   variables included: three different longitudinal reinforcement ratios
   (0.91\%, 1.21\%, and 1.82\%) and two different corrosion levels (3\% and
   10\%). Four beams were subjected to artificial corrosion whereas three
   beams acted as control un-corroded. Following the corrosion phase, all
   beams were tested to failure in three point bending. Corrosion crack
   widths and cracking patterns were recorded at different stages of
   corrosion. The effect of different longitudinal reinforcement ratios on
   the rate of corrosion was observed. Test results revealed that the beams
   with higher reinforcement ratios experienced slower corrosion rate
   compared to beams with lower reinforcement ratios. All control beams
   failed in shear whereas corroded beams failed in bond. There was a
   significant reduction in the load carrying capacity of the corroded
   beams without stirrups compared to the control beams.}},

Title = {{Fluorescence microscopy image noise reduction using a
   stochastically-connected random field model}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Fluorescence microscopy is an essential part of a biologist's toolkit,
   allowing assaying of many parameters like subcellular localization of
   proteins, changes in cytoskeletal dynamics, protein-protein
   interactions, and the concentration of specific cellular ions. A
   fundamental challenge with using fluorescence microscopy is the presence
   of noise. This study introduces a novel approach to reducing noise in
   fluorescence microscopy images. The noise reduction problem is posed as
   a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem, and solved using a novel
   random field model called stochastically-connected random field (SRF),
   which combines random graph and field theory. Experimental results using
   synthetic and real fluorescence microscopy data show the proposed
   approach achieving strong noise reduction performance when compared to
   several other noise reduction algorithms, using quantitative metrics.
   The proposed SRF approach was able to achieve strong performance in
   terms of signal-to-noise ratio in the synthetic results, high signal to
   noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio in the real fluorescence
   microscopy data results, and was able to maintain cell structure and
   subtle details while reducing background and intra-cellular noise.}},

Title = {{Cell contractility arising from topography and shear flow determines
   human mesenchymal stem cell fate}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Extracellular matrix (ECM) of the human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)
   influences intracellular tension and is known to regulate stem cell
   fate. However, little is known about the physiological conditions in the
   bone marrow, where external forces such as fluid shear stress, apart
   from the physical characteristics of the ECM, influence stem cell
   response. Here, we hypothesize that substrate topography and fluid shear
   stress alter the cellular contractile forces, influence the genetic
   expression of the stem cells and hence alter their lineage. When fluid
   shear stress was applied, human MSCs with higher contractility (seeded
   on 1 mu m wells) underwent osteogenesis, whereas those with lower
   contractility (seeded on 2 mu m gratings) remained multipotent. Compared
   to human MSCs seeded on gratings, those seeded on wells exhibited
   altered alignment and an increase in the area and number of focal
   adhesions. When actomyosin contractility was inhibited, human MSCs did
   not exhibit differentiation, regardless of the topographical feature
   they were being cultured on. We conclude that the stresses generated by
   the applied fluid flow impinge on cell contractility to drive the stem
   cell differentiation via the contractility of the stem cells.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the polarization at oxygen electrode of a rechargeable lithium
   oxygen battery, Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFN9721) perovskite oxide
   was prepared and applied as a bi-functional electro-catalyst for oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Lithium
   oxygen battery with an oxygen electrode composed of 80\% Ketjen Black
   (KB) and 20\% BCFN9721 delivered a discharge voltage plateau of 2.63 V,
   which is the highest among different composition ratios of KB and
   BCFN9721 in the oxygen electrodes. Adding 20\% BCFN9721 into KB could
   effectively reduce the polarization and achieve better bi-functional
   activities for the electrochemical reactions at positive electrode,
   especially for the OER. The lithium oxygen battery using BCFN9721
   perovskite oxide as the electro-catalyst could run stably for 24
   discharge/charge cycles with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh
   g(electrode)(-1). The charge polarization could be significantly reduced
   by BCFN9721 catalyst, thus alleviating the formation of undesired
   discharge products caused by the corrosion of carbon and decomposition
   of the electrolyte. Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta perovskite oxide can be
   a promising bi-functional electro-catalyst for the oxygen electrode of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically and numerically studied the band structure and spin
   transport of electrons subject to a superlattice structure where
   magnetic semiconductor layers lie between normal semiconductor layers to
   form periodic spin-filter tunnel barriers. In this alternately deposited
   superlattice structure, due to the induced periodicity of the envelope
   wavefunctions, there are additional allowed and forbidden energy regions
   established, i.e. forming minibands that are far narrower than the
   conventional conduction bands. The number and thickness of the stacked
   potential profiles can finely tune these minibands. The spin dependent
   potential barriers also induce spin splitting at the bottom of each
   miniband, which generates strongly spin-dependent miniband conduction.
   Most strikingly, the lowest lying miniband is 100\% spin-polarized
   mimicking a half-metallic behavior on this conduction channel. The total
   transmission electron current carries thus near-perfectly polarized spin
   currents when the superlattice falls into suitable miniband conduction
   regime. This half-metallic miniband enhanced spin-filtering capability
   paves the way to generate highly polarized spin current without
   incurring exponentially increased device impedance, as usually happens
   when only a single spin-filter barrier is applied.}},

Abstract = {{Dissimilar joining of aluminum (AA5052) to magnesium (AZ31) alloys was
   investigated in the current study by resistance spot welding. The
   formation of Al-Mg intermetallic compounds was successfully prevented
   and strong Al/Mg resistance spot welded joints were achieved by
   inserting a Sn-coated steel interlayer between the two base metals
   before welding. The tensile shear strength was as high as 88\% of the
   reported value of the Mg/Mg joints. The failure during mechanical
   loading occurred inside the Al fusion zone away from the Al/steel
   interface. It follows that the thin Al-Fe reaction layer formed at the
   Al/steel interface did not significantly affect the tensile strength of
   the joints. The significant reduction of voids, due to the high boiling
   temperature of Sn and also long downslope time, may also contribute to
   the relatively strong Al/steel interfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{140}},

Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of stochastic nonlinear model
   predictive control (NMPC) to a thin film deposition process in the
   presence of model-plant mismatch while ensuring constraints at a
   specific probability limit. To capture the multiscale nature of the
   process, the evolution of the thin film is modelled using nonlinear
   partial differential equations (PDEs) embedded with lattice-based
   kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. To provide a computationally
   tractable closed-form expression for online predictive control
   applications, model identification is performed using data collected
   from the multiscale deposition model. The closed-form model predicts the
   expected value and the variance of the thin film properties based on the
   substrate temperature during the deposition process. The parameters of
   the closed-form model are determined offline employing power series
   expansion (PSE). The closed-form model allows the reformulation of
   probabilistic constraints into their corresponding deterministic
   expressions thus enabling the design of a computationally tractable
   stochastic NMPC. To show the effectiveness of the approach, a shrinking
   horizon stochastic NMPC framework is devised to minimize the final
   surface roughness while complying with actuator constraints and a
   probabilistic constraint on the final film thickness. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recently, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has been used as a stay-in-place
   (SIP) formwork because of its lower cost compared to other materials,
   durability, and ease to assemble. The PVC SIP formwork used here
   consists of interconnected elements; panels and connectors that serve as
   permanent formwork for the concrete walls. In this paper, the behaviour
   of the PVC encased reinforced concrete walls tested under eccentric
   compression loading was investigated. The variables were the type of the
   specimen (PVC encased or control), the longitudinal reinforcement ratio
   (0.65\% or 1.3\%) and the eccentricity of the applied load. The PVC
   encased wall specimens showed superior performance, more ductile and
   higher capacity when compared to the control wall specimens. An
   analytical model was developed to predict the ultimate load capacity of
   the specimens taking into consideration the effect of the PVC on the
   load carrying capacity of the walls. The calculated and experimental
   peak loads were in good agreement. (C) 2015 The Institution of

Abstract = {{The use of stay-in-place (SIP) formwork has become an increasingly
   popular tool for concrete structures, providing advantages in
   construction scheduling and labor reduction. Previous research suggests
   that PVC provides an enhancement to reinforced concrete strength and
   ductility. The research herein outlines tests on reinforced concrete
   walls with a compressive strength of 25 MPa, utilizing two types of PVC
   panels: flat or hollow, in order to further understand the polymer's
   contribution to flexural resistance. Variables studied included concrete
   core thickness (152 mm, 178 mm, and 203 mm), reinforcing ratio (3-10 M
   bars or 3-15 M bars), and panel type (hollow or flat). The walls were
   tested in four point bending. Walls failed due to steel yielding
   followed by concrete crushing, PVC buckling, and/or PVC rupture
   depending on the reinforcement ratio and panel type. The hollow panel
   encased specimens also experienced slip of the panels on the tensile
   face. The PVC encasement enhanced the yield load, ultimate load,
   ductility, and toughness of the concrete walls. Concrete cores were
   taken from the tested PVC encased specimens and compressive strength was
   found to be the same as the control walls. (C) 2015 The Institution of

Abstract = {{As the practices of transportation engineering and planning evolve from
   ``data poor{''} to ``data rich{''}, methods to automate the translation
   of data to information become increasingly important. A major field of
   study is the automatic identification of travel modes from passively
   collected GPS data. In previous work, the authors have developed a
   robust modal classification system using an optimized combination of
   statistical inference techniques. One problem that remains very
   difficult is the correct identification of transit travel, particularly
   when the system is operating in mixed traffic. This type of operation
   generates a wide range of values for many travel parameters (average
   speed, maximum speed, and acceleration for example) which have similar
   characteristics to other urban modes. In this paper, we supplement the
   previous research to improve the identification of transit trips. The
   method employed evaluates the likelihood that GPS travel data belong to
   transit by comparing the location and pattern of zero-travel speeds
   (stopping) to the presence of transit stops and signalized
   intersections. These comparisons are done in a GIS. The consideration of
   the spatial attributes of GPS data vastly improves the accuracy of
   transit travel prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A robust stress analysis method for fatigue life prediction of welded
   structures}},
Journal = {{WELDING IN THE WORLD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{299-314}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the case of structural weldments, the procedure for estimating
   fatigue life requires information concerning geometry of the object,
   loads, and material. Detailed knowledge of stress fields in the critical
   regions of weldments is used to determine the fatigue life. The main
   theme of the research discussed in this paper is to provide details of
   the methodology which has been developed to determine the peak stress
   and associated non-linear through-thickness stress distribution at the
   critical weld toe crack plane by using only the geometry-dependent
   stress concentration factors along with appropriate unique reference
   stress calculated in an efficient manner, e.g., without modeling
   geometrical weld toe details. The peak stress at the weld toe can be
   subsequently used for estimating the fatigue crack initiation life. The
   non-linear through-thickness stress distribution and the weight function
   method can be used for the determination of stress intensity factors and
   for the analysis of subsequent fatigue crack growth. Accurate peak
   stress estimation requires 3D fine mesh finite element (FE) models,
   accounting for the micro-geometrical features, such as the weld toe
   angle and weld toe radius. Such models are computationally expensive and
   therefore impractical. On the other hand, stresses at the sharp weld
   corners obtained from 3D coarse FE meshes are inaccurate and cannot be
   used directly for fatigue life estimations. This paper describes a
   robust, sufficiently accurate, and efficient stress analysis method for
   fatigue life estimation of welded structures based on 3D FE coarse mesh
   models. Another objective is to establish a methodology which is capable
   of accounting for the actual variability of stress concentration factors
   at welds, welding defects such as misalignment, and incomplete
   penetration resulting from the manufacturing process. The methodology
   described in the paper has been validated by analyzing several weldments
   of varying geometrical and load configurations. The proposed methodology
   not only reduces conservative fatigue design of welded structures but
   also leads to significant savings concerning modeling and computation
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Measuring responses to a more unstable walking environment
   at the point-of-care may reveal clinically relevant strategies,
   particularly for rehabilitation. This study determined if temporal
   measures, center of pressure-derived measures, and force impulse
   measures can quantify responses to surface instability and correlate
   with clinical balance and mobility measures.
   Methods: Thirty-one unilateral amputees, 11 transfemoral and 20
   transtibial, walked on level and soft ground while wearing
   pressure-sensing insoles. Foot-strike and foot-off center of pressure,
   center of pressure path, temporal, and force impulse variables were
   derived from F-Scan pressure-sensing insoles.
   Findings: Significant differences (P < 0.05) between level and soft
   ground were found for temporal and center of pressure path measures.
   Twenty regression models (R-2 <= 0.840), which related
   plantar-pressure-derived measures with clinical scores, consisted of
   nine variables. Stride time was in eight models; posterior deviations
   per stride in six models; mean CoP path velocity in five models; and
   anterior-posterior center of pressure path coefficient of variation,
   percent double-support time, and percent stance in four models.
   Interpretation: Center of pressure-derived parameters, particularly
   temporal and center of pressure path measures, can differentiate between
   level and soft ground walking for transfemoral and transtibial amputees.
   Center of pressure-derived parameters correlated with clinical measures
   of mobility and balance, explaining up to 84.0\% of the variability. The
   number of posterior deviations per stride, mean CoP path velocity stride
   time, anterior-posterior center of pressure path coefficient of
   variation, percent double-support time, and percent stance were
   frequently related to clinical balance and mobility measures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Memory bandwidth in modern multi-core platforms is highly variable for
   many reasons and it is a big challenge in designing real-time systems as
   applications are increasingly becoming more memory intensive. In this
   work, we proposed, designed, and implemented an efficient memory
   bandwidth reservation system, that we call MemGuard. MemGuard separates
   memory bandwidth in two parts: guaranteed and best effort. It provides
   bandwidth reservation for the guaranteed bandwidth for temporal
   isolation, with efficient reclaiming to maximally utilize the reserved
   bandwidth. It further improves performance by exploiting the best effort
   bandwidth after satisfying each core's reserved bandwidth. MemGuard is
   evaluated with SPEC2006 benchmarks on a real hardware platform, and the
   results demonstrate that it is able to provide memory performance
   isolation with minimal impact on overall throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Multicore architecture brings a significant challenge in designing
   critical real-time systems because of timing variability caused by
   concurrent accesses to shared memory. We propose a memory bandwidth
   regulated system architecture and a novel analysis method to address
   this challenge. In the proposed architecture, each core's memory access
   rate is regulated in a globally coordinated manner. The architecture
   allows system designers to control the system to satisfy desired
   real-time performance. The proposed analysis method provides a way to
   calculate worst case response time of each real-time task independently
   from other activities on other cores; it only depends on the task under
   analysis, the assigned bandwidth, and the number of cores in the system.
   We believe this independence is critical to enable modular certification
   of critical real-time systems. We implement the proposed system model on
   the gem5 architecture simulator. We evaluate the proposed analysis
   method by comparing the computed runtime with the measured runtime on
   the modified simulator. We show that the analysis method provides
   reasonable upper-bounds based on the SPEC2006 benchmark suite.}},

Abstract = {{DP980 steels were butt -welded by fiber laser welding. The
   microstructures, microhardness distribution, and tensile behavior of the
   joint were investigated. The results showed that the fusion zone (FZ)
   consisted of fully martensite with higher hardness compared to the base
   metal (BM). A softened zone (20 HV0.2 drop) was produced in
   heat-affected zone due to martensite tempering during the laser welding.
   The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of the laser
   -welded joint were not degraded compared to BM with the existence of
   softened zone. The UTS and YS of the welded joint increased with the
   increase of tensile strain rate. The work hardening exponents of the BM
   and welded joint showed weak positive strain rate dependence. The
   deformation of softened zone was restrained by the hardened FZ during
   loading, resulting in a higher work hardening rate of softened zone than
   that of BM. The failure of welded joint occurred in the BM instead of
   softened zone. The fracture surfaces of the joint exhibited typical
   ductile fracture over strain rate from 0.0001 to 0.1 s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, temperature contours are presented for a prismatic
   lithium-ion battery at 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C discharge rates and different
   boundary conditions (cooling/operating/bath temperature) of 5 degrees C,
   15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. The active (water cooling)
   cooling system is designed and developed based on a prismatic
   lithium-ion battery using dual cold plates. The battery discharges at
   constant current rates of 20 Amp, 40 Amp, 60 Amp, and 80 Amp, and the
   experimental temperature contours are then plotted between the beginning
   and end of discharge cycle. The results show that a higher temperature
   distribution is observed over the entire surface of the battery for 4C
   at 35 degrees C and a lower temperature distribution is noted for IC at
   5 degrees C. Furthermore, it is observed that increased discharge rates
   between 1 C and 4C and increased boundary conditions (BCs) between 5
   degrees C and 35 degrees C result in increased temperature contour of
   the battery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient fundamental approach for three-dimensional modeling of
   LiFePO4 (LFP) battery pouch cells is presented in this paper. First, the
   standard Newman pseudo two-dimensional (P2D) model is compared with two
   simplified approaches developed by the authors: a simplified
   electrochemical multi-particle (SEMP) model, and a homogenous pseudo
   two-dimensional (HP2D) model. It is shown that the SEMP and HP2D models
   can predict the operating voltage of LFP half-cells with less than 2.5\%
   and 1.5\% maximum error, respectively, when compared to the P2D model.
   It is also shown that the simulation time of these two simplified models
   are one order of magnitude less than the P2D model, hence, they are then
   used for three-dimensional modeling of the LFP half-cell. Multiple
   one-dimensional SEMP models are combined, as a first approach, to form a
   three-dimensional battery model. It is explained that although this
   method is adequate for predicting the electrochemical current generation
   distribution, it may introduce errors in heat generation calculations
   since it does not consider the electrolyte concentration and potential
   gradient parallel to the current collectors. Therefore, using the HP2D
   model, an optimized method is proposed that combines the speed and
   simplicity of the first approach with three-dimensional simulation of
   the electrolyte. It is shown that this method is able to predict the
   mentioned gradients that contribute to the battery heat generation. (C)

   Oversaturation of dissolved methane in permeate appears to have been

   tests. After calibration of biokinetic coefficients, PetWin 4 (EnviroSim
   Canada) was found to effectively simulate the concentrations of
   particulate COD, readily biodegradable COD and acetic acid over a range
   of SRTs and HRTs. The calibrated saturation coefficients for hydrolysis
   and aceticlastic methanogenesis processes were comparable to those
   reported in literature. The saturation coefficient of fermentation was
   significantly lower than those reported in literature. The simulated
   methane mass flows were consistently higher than the measured values
   which was consistent with the lack of COD mass balance closure and was
   attributed to reduction of sulfate and oversaturation of the permeate
   with respect to Henry's Law.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This experimental study focuses on the near wake development of a dual
   step cylinder geometry consisting of a long base cylinder of diameter d
   to which a larger diameter (D) cylinder of length L is attached
   coaxially at mid-span. The experiments cover a range of Reynolds
   numbers, 2000 <= Re-D <= 5000, diameter ratios, 1.33 <= D/d <= 2.0 and
   large cylinder aspect ratios, 0.5 <= L/D <= 5 using Tomographic particle
   image velocimetry. Distinct changes in wake topology are observed
   varying the above parameters. Supporting previous experimental studies
   on the same geometry involving flow visualization and planar
   measurements, four distinct flow regimes are identified to which a
   distinct three-dimensional wake topology can be associated. The
   vortex-dominated wake dynamical behaviour is investigated with Proper
   Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and conditional averaging of
   three-dimensional velocity fields is used to exemplify the different
   shedding regimes. The conditionally averaged flow fields are shown to
   quantitatively resolve flow features equivalent to those obtained from a
   reduced order model consisting of the first ten to twenty POD modes,
   identifying the dominant vortex shedding cells and their interactions.

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral endmembers are the spectra of pure materials that are
   responsible for generating the mixed pixels in hyperspectral images
   (HSIs). Hyperspectral endmember extraction (HEE) is essentially an
   inverse problem, where the unknown endmembers are inferred from the
   spectral measurements. Efficient extraction of endmembers in HSI relies
   on a well-defined generative model that captures key factors in HSI
   generation process, such as the clustering effect in the spatial domain
   and the noise heterogeneity effect in the spectral domain. This paper
   presents a weighted fuzzy purified-means (WFP-means) clustering model
   for HEE, where the endmembers are modeled as mean vectors of individual
   classes, and the fractional contributions of individual endmembers,
   called abundances, are treated as soft class membership. Accordingly, an
   endmember is estimated as the weighted mean of purified pixels in HSI,
   while the abundances are estimated as the nonnegative regression
   coefficients. In contrast to a mixed pixel that consists of multiple
   endmembers, a ``purified pixel{''} is due to a single endmember. The
   introduction of the concept of ``purified pixels{''} into the fuzzy
   clustering model leads to an elegant optimization scheme. Moreover, the
   proposed model accounts for the noise variance heterogeneity issue,
   which is essential for achieving unbiased abundance estimation. The
   proposed method is tested on both simulated and real HSI, in comparison
   with several other HEE methods. The results demonstrate that the
   proposed method compares favorably with respect to the referenced
   methods in terms of both endmember and abundance estimation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of bond geometry on bond strength and reliability is studied
   for 25-mu m gold wire bonds on standard CMOS aluminum pads. An
   accelerated method for parameter optimization is used to produce ball
   bonds with optimized shear strength (SS) and bond geometry. Ball bonds
   have a diameter of 56.5 mu m with a bond height of 12, 16, and 20 mu m
   representing the low, medium, and high bonds, respectively. Low height
   bonds achieve 126.1 MPa strength and endure up to 41.9\% ultrasound (US)
   before deformation begins, whereas high bonds achieve 109.8 MPa strength
   and withstand a maximum of 39.8\% US. Low bonds achieve higher strengths
   possibly due to the higher level of US that can be used. Bond
   reliability is assessed in high-temperature storage tests using a shear
   test (a destructive method) and piezoresistive stress sensors (a
   nondestructive method). The bonds are aged at 200 degrees C for similar
   to 500 h. Quantifying the reliability performance using shear test
   results found to be difficult due to poor time resolution. However, from
   features in the stress sensor signals, a characteristic time (t(c)) is
   derived during aging. The tc value indicates the time it takes for the
   bonds to severely degrade due to intermetallics and crack formation. The
   tc values for low, medium, and high bonds were found to be 199.9 +/-
   8.7, 225.9 +/- 9.5, and 231.9 +/- 6.8 h, respectively. The result that
   suggests ball bonds with higher heights are more reliable than the bonds
   with lower heights for a constant ball bond diameter. This result is
   corroborated by the SS before and after aging being the same for the
   high bonds, whereas SS dropped by 3\% for the low bonds. The
   nondestructive method was demonstrated to have an estimated time
   resolution better than 10 h, which allows for precise comparisons of the
   reliability of various processes.}},

Abstract = {{Base station operation consumes a lot of energy, a considerable amount
   of which can be saved by switching off base stations during low user
   demand (for example, at night). Base station switching (BSS) can result
   in loss in coverage if not performed properly. We show that coverage is
   closely related to scheduling via power management and that the
   bottleneck is typically the uplink. To save energy, we propose a set of
   BSS patterns, at a global system-level, that have the potential to
   provide full coverage if the appropriate schedulers are used. We further
   show that the existing benchmark uplink scheduling schemes do not
   provide full coverage when BSS is used in urban as well as rural
   macro-cell environments (the downlink benchmark scheduling scheme
   provides full coverage only for some of the BSS patterns). Hence, we
   propose novel scheduling schemes for both uplink and downlink that
   realistically model interference, ensure full coverage, and provide good
   energy-performance trade-offs for the proposed BSS patterns. We also
   present a low complexity high performance heuristic for the proposed
   uplink scheduler. Finally, we show the presented models and results can
   be used to quantify, offline, the energy-performance trade-offs under
   different operating scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the scenario of wireless multicast with a single
   transmitter and multiple relays that jointly deliver successively
   refined (or multiresolution) sources to multiple receivers. An
   asynchronous cooperative joint source-channel coding (JSCC) protocol is
   proposed, aimed at mitigating the complexity and difficulty in signal
   synchronization in multicast. Taking end-to-end mean square error
   distortion (EED) as the quality of service (QoS) measure, the problems
   of JSCC transmission are formulated to minimize the total power
   consumption where both relay selection and power allocation at the base
   station (BS) and all the relays are jointly determined. To solve the
   formulated problem that is nonetheless nonlinear in nature, a two-step
   iterative algorithm is investigated for power allocations at all
   transmitters, where a sequential quadratic programming method is
   developed to find a strict local minimum. To reduce the computation
   complexity, a heuristic algorithm for relay selection is presented. Case
   studies are conducted to verify the proposed formulations and solution
   methods. We will demonstrate the advantages of using the proposed

Title = {{Voltage collapse in complex power grids}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A large-scale power grid's ability to transfer energy from producers to
   consumers is constrained by both the network structure and the nonlinear
   physics of power flow. Violations of these constraints have been
   observed to result in voltage collapse blackouts, where nodal voltages
   slowly decline before precipitously falling. However, methods to test
   for voltage collapse are dominantly simulation-based, offering little
   theoretical insight into how grid structure influences stability
   margins. For a simplified power flow model, here we derive a closed-form
   condition under which a power network is safe from voltage collapse. The
   condition combines the complex structure of the network with the
   reactive power demands of loads to produce a node-by-node measure of
   grid stress, a prediction of the largest nodal voltage deviation, and an
   estimate of the distance to collapse. We extensively test our
   predictions on large-scale systems, highlighting how our condition can
   be leveraged to increase grid stability margins.}},

Abstract = {{Reusable antibacterial non-leaching monolithic columns polymerized in
   microfluidic channels designed for on-chip cell lysis applications were
   obtained by the photoinitiated free radical copolymerization of
   diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC) and ethylene glycol diacrylate
   (EGDA) in the presence of a porogenic solvent. The microfluidic channels
   were fabricated in cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (X-PMMA)
   substrates by laser micromachining. The monolithic columns have the
   ability to inhibit the growth of, kill and efficiently lyse
   Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus (Schroeter) (ATCC 4698) and Kocuria
   rosea (ATCC 186), and Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida (ATCC
   12633) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218) by mechanically shearing the
   bacterial membrane when forcing the cells to pass through the narrow
   pores of the monolithic column, and simultaneously disintegrating the
   cell membrane by physical contact with the antibacterial surface of the
   column. Cell lysis was confirmed by off-chip PCR without the need for
   further purification. The influence of the cross-linking monomer on
   bacterial growth inhibition, leaching, lysis efficiency of the
   monolithic column and its mechanical stability within the microfluidic
   channel were investigated and analyzed for three different cross-linking
   monomers: ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDA), ethylene glycol
   dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and 1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate (1,6-HDDMA).
   Furthermore, the bonding efficiency of two X-PMMA substrates with
   different cross-linking levels was studied. The monolithic columns were
   shown to be stable, non-leaching, and reusable for over 30 lysis cycles
   without significant performance degradation or DNA carryover when they
   were back-flushed between lysis cycles.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{164}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{For the first time, a double conditioned CSE formulation including two
   mixture fractions is applied to model two Delft-Jet-in-Hot-Coflow (DJHC)
   flames in Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The objective is to further
   determine the ability of CSE to accurately predict the flame
   characteristics seen in the Dutch natural gas DJHC flames in the context
   of LES. Tabulated detailed chemistry and radiation are included. Good
   agreement with experimental data is found for the turbulent flow field
   and temperature statistics. Some discrepancies are noted near the
   centreline due to inaccuracies in the coflow entrainment. For both
   flames, the radial velocity component is shown to be more difficult to
   predict accurately. Possible sources of discrepancy are the sub grid
   scale model and the inlet turbulence conditions. The predicted lift-off
   heights are lower than the experimental values. However, the trend of
   increasing lift-off height with increasing Reynolds number is properly
   captured when the same fuel composition is considered in the experiments
   and LES-CSE. The lift-off height predictions may be improved by adding a
   third conditioning variable that would reflect the effect of straining
   or changing the chemistry tabulation using different chemical progress
   variables. Qualitatively, the present simulations correctly predict
   flame stabilization due to the formation of ignition kernels. Further
   improvements may be obtained by including temperature fluctuations at
   the coflow inlet, a dynamic Smagorinsky model and higher order numerical
   schemes. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{666-675}},

Abstract = {{A novel method of sheathless particle focusing by induced charge
   electrokinetic flow in a microchannel is presented in this paper. By
   placing a pair of metal plates on the opposite walls of the channel and
   applying an electrical field, particle focusing is achieved due to the
   two pairs of vortex that constrain the flow of the particle solution. As
   an example, the trajectories of particles under different electrical
   fields with only one metal plate on one side channel wall were
   numerically simulated and experimentally validated. Other flow focusing
   effects, such as the focused width ratio (focused width/channel width)
   and length ratio (focused length/half-length of metal plate) of the
   sample solution, were also numerically studied. The results show that
   the particle firstly passes through the gaps between the upstream
   vortices and the channel walls. Afterwards, the particle is focused to
   pass through the gap between the two downstream vortices that determine
   the focused particle position. Numerical simulations show that the
   focused particle stream becomes thin with the increases in the applied
   electrical field and the length of the metal plates. As regards to the
   focused length ratio of the focused stream, however, it slightly
   increases with the increase in the applied electrical field and almost
   keeps constant with the increase in the length of the metal plate. The
   size of the focused sample solution, therefore, can be easily adjusted
   by controlling the applied electrical field and the sizes of the metal
   plates.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal warm and hot deformation behavior of as-cast ZEK100
   (Mg-1.2Zn-0.25Zr-0.17Nd, in wt.\%) magnesium alloy was studied using the
   Gleeble(A (R)) 3500 thermal-mechanical simulation testing system. The
   study was conducted over a wide range of temperatures (100 A degrees
   C-500 A degrees C) and strain rates (5.0 x 10(-4) s(-1)-1.0 x 10 s(-1)),
   for a low true strain regime (i.e. 0.2) associated with general
   deformation level during twin roll casting process. For the range of
   studied strain, steady state flow stress was obtained at low strain
   rates (5.0 x 10(-4) and 1.0 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and high deformation
   temperatures (350, 400 and 450 A degrees C). At medium strain rates of
   1.0 x 10(-2) and 1.0 x 10(-1) s(-1), steady state flow stress was
   observed for deformation temperatures of 400-450 A degrees C and 450 A
   degrees C, respectively. In the rest of conditions, strain hardening was
   the dominant deformation mechanism. A modified Ludwig equation was
   successfully used to develop constitutive model for the ZEK100. The
   model was validated by compression of material under continuous cooling
   or an abrupt change in the strain rate conditions. Deformed
   microstructure was consisted of twinning at low temperature deformation;
   while, at higher temperatures discrete regions of discontinuous dynamic
   recrystallization (by bulging at serrated boundaries) were observed. The
   former is associated with the strain hardening observed in the stress
   strain curves while the latter is the main reason of steady state flow
   stress. Strain hardening sensitivity and strain rate sensitivity
   exponents were also correlated to the deformed microstructure of the
   alloy.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive and rigorous analysis is presented for the study of
   terahertz photomixing process in a biased graphene layer, when two
   obliquely incident waves are used as primary excitation. The
   second-order nonlinearity tensor of graphene associated with the
   difference frequency generation (DFG) is calculated to evaluate the
   amount of induced terahertz current density. In this analysis, we are
   calculating the significant contribution of the photon drag effect to
   the DFG and consequently to the terahertz wave generation. We also
   examine the effect of DC current biasing on the DFG as the Fermi energy
   level of graphene changes. Our results show that the DFG in graphene can
   be enhanced by at least two orders of magnitude when the Fermi energy
   level of graphene becomes equal to the energy of incident photon. This
   paper provides more insight into the contributing factors in the DFG
   process and allows the realization of more optimal graphene-based

Abstract = {{We provide bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of grounded Laplacian
   matrices (which are obtained by removing certain rows and columns of the
   Laplacian matrix of a given graph). The gap between our upper and lower
   bounds depends on the ratio of the smallest and largest components of
   the eigen-vector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the
   grounded Laplacian. We provide a graph-theoretic bound on this ratio,
   and subsequently obtain a tight characterization of the smallest
   eigenvalue for certain classes of graphs. Specifically, for weighted
   Erdos-Renyi random graphs, we show that when a (sufficiently small) set
   S of rows and columns is removed from the Laplacian, and the probability
   p of adding an edge is sufficiently large, the smallest eigenvalue of
   the grounded Laplacian asymptotically almost surely approaches
   mu(w)vertical bar S vertical bar p, where mu(w) is the mean edge weight.
   We also show that for weighted random d-regular graphs with a single row

   the number of nodes in the network. Our bounds have applications to the

Abstract = {{Unsupervised feature extraction from hyperspectral images (HSIs) relies
   on efficient data representation. However, classical data representation
   techniques, e.g., principal component analysis and independent component
   analysis, do not reflect the intrinsic characteristics of HSI, and as
   such, they are less efficient for producing discriminative features. To
   address this issue, we have developed an intrinsic representation (IR)
   approach to support HSI classification. Based on the linear spectral
   mixture model, the IR approach explains the underlying physical factors
   that are responsible for generating HSI. Moreover, it addresses other
   important characteristics of HSI, i.e., the noise variance heterogeneity
   effect in the spectral domain and the spatial correlation effect in
   image domain. The IR model is solved iteratively by alternating the
   estimation of IR coefficients given IR bases and the update of IR bases
   given the coefficients. The resulting IR coefficients are
   discriminative, compact, and noise resistant, thereby constituting
   powerful features for improved HSI classification. The experiments on
   both simulated and real HSI demonstrate that the features extracted by
   the IR model are more capable of boosting the classification performance
   than the other referenced techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Topography and surface slope variations affect perceived scattering
   polarization state of imaged targets in polarimetric synthetic aperture
   radar (PolSAR) applications. Accurate modeling of such effects can be
   used for both polarimetric data correction (e.g., better target
   classification) and topographic feature extraction. A framework is
   established in this paper to model target topography based on analytic
   relation between surface slopes and PolSAR data and imagery products
   (polarization orientation angle rotation, in particular). The developed
   formalism provides both forward, i.e., polarization rotation from
   topography, and inverse, i.e., terrain slopes from PolSAR data,
   solutions. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging scenario or mode
   is assumed to be general with arbitrary parameters (e.g., squint angle)
   and includes multi-SAR sensors for target terrain modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the significant improvement of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cell catalyst activities, a cost-effective and stable membrane electrode
   assembly is still lacking, which greatly inhibits the commercialization
   of this efficient and environmental friendly technology in stationary
   and transportation applications. The main reason is that the engineering
   of different components of an electrode, such as catalytically active
   metals, electron transport and reactant diffusion paths in a compatible
   way is very challenging. Here we show the design and preparation of a
   monolithic fuel cell electrode with a compatible wire on wire structure
   that mimics the configuration of a pine tree. We developed a procedure
   to make a flexible carbon thin film composed of porous nanofibers with a
   thickness of similar to 100 nm and centimeter scale lengths. Platinum
   nanowires (ca. 3 nm diameter) were deposited on these microscale carbon
   nanofiber films, resulting in a hierarchical structure. The platinum
   nanowires were then decorated with a porous bismuth coating to modulate
   the atomic structure and induce catalytic activity toward formic acid
   electrooxidation. The end result is a monolithic structure used as a
   fuel cell electrode that combines microscale diffusive pathways and
   nanoscale catalyst structures. Prepared by a process that is readily
   scalable, this design strategy offers a new way to tailor catalytic
   functions at a system level. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Differentially 4-uniform permutations on F-22k with high nonlinearity
   are chosen as Substitution boxes in many block ciphers and some stream
   ciphers. Recently, Qu et al. (IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 59(7), 4675-4686,
   2013) introduced a class of functions, which are called preferred
   functions, to construct a lot of infinite families of such permutations.
   In this paper, we propose a particular type of Boolean functions to
   characterize the preferred functions. On the one hand, such Boolean
   functions can be determined by solving linear equations, and they give
   rise to a huge number of differentially 4-uniform permutations over
   F-22k. Hence they may provide more choices for the design of
   Substitution boxes. On the other hand, by investigating the number of
   these Boolean functions, we show that the number of CCZ-inequivalent
   differentially 4-uniform permutations over F-22k grows exponentially
   when k increases, which gives a positive answer to an open problem
   proposed in Qu et al.(IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 59(7), 4675-4686, 2013).}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic separation of fluorescently end-labeled DNA after a PCR
   serves as a gold standard in genetic diagnostics. Because of their size
   and cost, instruments for this type of analysis have had limited market

   changed through a higher level of system integration and lower
   instrument costs that can be realized through the use of LEDs for
   excitation and photodiodes for detectionif they provide sufficient
   sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate an optimized microchip electrophoresis
   instrument using polymeric fluidic chips with fluorescence detection of
   end-labeled DNA with a LOD of 0.15 nM of Alexa Fluor 532. This
   represents orders of magnitude improvement over previously reported
   instruments of this type. We demonstrate the system with an
   electrophoretic separation of two PCR products and their respective
   primers. We believe that this is the first LED-induced fluorescence
   microchip electrophoresis system with photodiode-based detection that
   could be used for standard applications of PCR and electrophoresis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first phase of an ongoing research program at
   University of Waterloo to study the effect of external fiber-reinforced
   polymer (FRP) sheet wrap confinement along a lap splice of reinforced
   concrete (RC) beams on their fatigue bond strength. Fatigue loading of
   RC beams containing a lap splice resulted in an increase in the number
   and width of cracks, an increase in deflection, and a decrease of the
   bond strength between the steel rebar and the surrounding concrete. The
   phase of the research described here consists of monotonic and fatigue
   tests of sixteen reinforced concrete beam with dimensions
   2200x350x250mm. Each beam was reinforced with two 20M bars lap spliced
   in the constant moment region of the tension zone and two 10M bars in
   the compression zone outside the constant moment region. The test
   variables were the presence or absence of an FRP wrapping, the type of
   the FRP wrapping glass or carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP or
   CFRP), the type of loading, and the fatigue load range. The test results
   for monotonic loading showed that the stiffness of all beams was almost
   the same, but that the FRP sheet wrapping increased the bond strength
   and the deflection at ultimate load. All beams tested under fatigue
   loading failed by a bond failure except one CFRP-wrapped beam that
   failed by fatigue of the main reinforcement. The FRP sheet increased the
   bond strength for all specimens under fatigue loading. (C) 2015 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Interface management (IM) is an emerging construction management
   practice that industry finds necessary for megaprojects that have become
   more complex and global. Defined as the appropriate management of
   communications, relationships, and deliverables among stakeholders,
   effective IM is integral to project success. Yet, because it is an
   emerging discipline, IM implementation has varied widely across the
   industry. Furthermore, the effect of IM on project performance is still
   unclear. To address these gaps, the construction industry institute
   (CII) chartered a research team, to identify the current state of IM and
   to investigate the relationship between systematic IM and project
   performance. To accomplish this, the authors conducted structured
   interviews for 46 projects. The study results showed that IM practices
   are most often found in industrial projects, with dollar values of more
   than one billion. In addition, IM adoption is positively correlated with
   the project dollar value and number of interface stakeholders. In terms
   of performance, projects with systematic IM tend to have lower mean and
   less dispersed cost growth, compared with projects without systematic
   IM. These results contribute to an understanding of the potential
   benefits of IM and its appropriate application as it further develops
   and is used in practice. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Extremely large, complex projects with numerous geographically
   distributed stakeholders experience substantial risks related to the
   interfaces among stakeholders. This is particularly true during project
   definition and design, where despite discrete deliverables across the
   interfaces, decisions require some iteration. Managing interfaces has
   become feasible with the advent of internet and electronic product and
   process-management systems to the extent that full-time
   interface-management (IM) positions exist in practice. However, IM lacks
   formal structure, integration with critical-path-method scheduling, and
   methods to identify high-risk interface points (IPs). Throughout this
   paper, a graph-based algorithm is developed to identify key IPs in the
   network of IPs in a capital project. Furthermore, a new approach is
   discussed to link the key IPs to the interface milestones to identify
   schedule-related risks and mitigate their adverse impact. The
   functionality of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in an offshore
   model project. The contributions of this paper provide foundational
   material for further research in IM. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

   fault detectability and closed loop performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{42-53}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel methodology for simultaneous optimal tuning
   of a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm and a feedback
   controller for a chemical plant in the presence of stochastic parametric
   faults. The key idea is to propagate the effect of time invariant
   stochastic uncertainties onto the measured variables by using a
   Generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion and the nonlinear first
   principles' model of the process. A bi-level optimization is proposed
   for achieving a trade-off between the fault detectability and the closed
   loop process variability. The goal of the outer level optimization is to
   seek a trade-off between the efficiency of detecting a fault and the
   closed loop performance, while the inner level optimization is designed
   to optimally calibrate the FDD algorithm. The proposed method is
   illustrated by a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system with a
   fault consisting of stochastic and intermittent variations in the inlet
   concentration. Beyond achieving improved trade-offs between fault
   detectability and control, it is shown that the computational cost of
   the gPC model based method is lower than the Monte Carlo type sampling
   based approaches, thus demonstrating the potential of the gPC method for
   dealing with large problems and real-time applications. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The trace inverse functions Tr(lambda x (-1)) over the finite field are
   a class of very important Boolean functions and are used in many stream
   ciphers such as SFINKS, RAKAPOSHI, the simple counter stream cipher

   the security of those ciphers in resistance to (fast) algebraic attacks,
   the authors need to characterize algebraic properties of Tr(lambda x

   Tr(lambda x (-1)) are given in the public literature, for example, the
   NGG upper bound and the Bayev lower bound, etc. This paper gives the
   exact value of the algebraic immunity of Tr(lambda x (-1)) over , that
   is, , where n a parts per thousand yen 2, lambda a and lambda not equal

Abstract = {{In order to study the deformation behavior and evaluate the workability
   of the dual-phase Mg-9Li-3Al-2Sr alloy, isothermal hot compression tests
   were conducted using the Gleeble-3500 thermal-mechanical simulator, in
   ranges of elevated temperatures (423-573 K) and strain rates (0.001-1
   s(-1)). Plastic instability is evident during the deformation which is
   in the form of serrated flow; serrated yielding is attributed to the
   locking of mobile dislocations by the Mg and Li atoms which diffuse
   during the deformation. The relationships between flow stress, strain
   rate and deformation temperature were analyzed and the deformation
   activation energy and some basic material factors at different strains
   were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. The effects of temperature
   and strain rate on deformation behavior were represented using the
   Zener-Hollomon parameter in an exponent-type equation. To verify the
   validity of the constitutive model, the predicted values and
   experimental flow curves under different deformation conditions were
   compared, the correlation coefficient (0.9970) and average absolute
   relative error (AARE=4.41\%) were calculated. The results indicate that
   the constitutive model can be used to accurately predict the flow
   behavior of dual-phase Mg-9Li-3Al-2Sr alloy during high temperature
   deformation.}},

Title = {{Hydrologic impacts of subsurface drainage at the field scale: Climate,
   landscape and anthropogenic controls}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Installation of subsurface drainage systems is one of the most common
   modifications of the agricultural landscape, and while it is well
   accepted that these systems alter the hydrologic regime, the nature and
   magnitude of such alterations remains poorly understood. We explore the
   impact of drainage systems using the field-scale model DRAINMOD and
   rainfall and soils data for Iowa. Our objective is to understand how
   climate, landscape and anthropogenic controls modify the hydrological
   response at the field scale. We show that drainage systems do not
   significantly alter the annual peak flows (Q(p)). This is because Q(p)
   is typically generated by the largest storms of the year for which the
   additional soil storage created by the drains does not significantly
   alter the total quick-flow volume of water entering the streams, and
   thus the hydrograph peaks. We identify a threshold storm size (similar
   to 6 cm/day for Iowa) beyond which tiles have minimal impact on the peak
   flow. Effects are apparent, however, for peak flows generated by other
   storms in which the percent of peak flow reduction is a function of the
   storm size and the antecedent moisture conditions. The effect of the
   drains on runoff production is further investigated using the daily
   Flashiness Index (FI). For soils with high hydraulic conductivity (K),
   tile drains increase the FI due to faster flow routing through
   subsurface drains, while for soils with low K, drainage decreases
   flashiness due to availability of increased soil storage that reduces
   surface runoff. We conclude that tile drains homogenize spatial patterns
   in hydrologic response by minimizing response differences between soil
   types. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of tile spacing and show
   that the FI decreases with an increase in drain spacing up to an optimal
   spacing (SM), beyond which FI increases with greater spacing. The FI-S-M
   relationship was found to be a function of soil type and rainfall
   intensity, with the U-shaped behavior more apparent for low K soils and
   high rainfall intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the principle of virtual work. Two sets of equilibrium equations, one
   describing the pile displacement and rotation and the other describing
   the displacements in the soil, are obtained and solved analytically and

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The quality of processed sands is a critical issue for several
   construction applications (asphalt mixes, concrete, granular layers).
   The sand flow test is commonly used to control this quality. High
   accuracy video capturing equipment is now also used to characterize the
   shape of aggregates. The objective of this study is to model the
   relationship between the actual shape of sand particles, measured using
   a video-capturing equipment, to the sand's flowing time in a hopper, in
   order to eliminate the need for sand flow laboratory measurements.
   Several samples of processed and natural sands were tested using on the
   sand flow test equipment used in the European standards. The shape of
   the particles was then analyzed using a video-capturing equipment. A
   simple empirical relation was found between the shape factor of
   particles by Beverloo's law and the actual shape of particles,
   characterized by a shape index defined in this study. The results were
   then confronted with the sand test equipment specified in the ASTM
   standards, to validate this empirical relation.
   The coefficients in this new relation had to be experimentally
   determined according to definition of the particle's diameter, the video
   system, and the sand flow test equipment. The discharge coefficient was
   also taken into consideration. This is mainly experimental work; the
   physical explanation of this relation would have to be analyzed in
   greater depth in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The photocurrent and the lag signals in amorphous selenium (a-Se)
   detectors have been characterized by measuring the optical and residual
   currents under varying light intensity, applied electric field, and
   temperature. A mathematical model for the transient photocurrent and
   residual current in a-Se detectors has also been developed. The
   photocurrent and the lag signal increase rapidly with the applied field
   because of enhancement of the quantum yield. The residual current
   increases with increasing the field, ambient temperature, and light
   intensity. The lag signal gets saturated with increasing the intensity.
   The percentage lag signal decreases with increasing the field and light
   intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Parabolic trough solar collectors can be used to drive endothermic
   reactions, such as methane reforming, while using molten salts as a heat
   transfer fluid. However, linear focus concentrators can only provide
   temperatures under 600 degrees C, resulting in CH4 conversions well
   below 50\%. The equilibrium can be shifted toward much higher
   conversions if H-2 is continuously removed from the reaction mixture via
   a H-2-selective membrane, while simultaneously generating a high-purity
   H-2 stream. In this study, a tube-and-shell, molten salt-heated packed
   bed membrane reformer (Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, 5 mu m supported Pd film
   membrane) is analyzed numerically using computational fluid dynamics and
   non-isothermal formulation. The effects of molten salt supply rate and
   reforming feed flow rate on the reformer performance, which is evaluated
   in terms of CH4 conversion, H-2 recovery, and selectivity to CO, are
   investigated. Depending on operating parameters, significant temperature
   and concentration gradients may form in both axial and radial
   directions. These gradients can be prevented by adjusting feed rates in
   the reforming and molten salt compartments. For the optimized case, CH4
   conversion of 99\% and H-2 recovery of 87\% are predicted for the molten
   salt feed temperature of 600 degrees C and reforming feed space velocity
   of 5000 h(-1), which corresponds to a power density of 1.9 kW/L and a
   fuel heating value upgrade of 40\%. A preliminary techno-economic
   evaluation is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel closed-loop process is demonstrated to control deposition
   microstructure during laser additive manufacturing (LAM) in real-time.
   An infrared imaging system is developed to monitor surface temperatures

   temperatures are recorded in real-time to provide adequate information
   regarding thermal gradients, and thus control the deposition
   microstructure affected by cooling rates during LAM. Using correlations
   between the cooling rate, traveling speed, and the clad microstructure,
   a novel feedback PID controller is established to control the cooling
   rate. The controller is designed to maintain the cooling rate around a
   desired point by tuning the traveling speed. The performance of the
   controller is examined on several single-track and multi-track
   closed-loop claddings in order to achieve desired microstructures with
   specific properties. Results indicate that the closed-loop controller is
   capable of generating a consistent controlled microstructure during the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel approach to study the problem of
   master-slave synchronization for chaotic delayed Lur'e systems with
   sampled-data feedback control. Specifically, first, it is assumed that
   the sampling intervals are randomly variable but bounded. By getting the
   utmost out of the usable information on the actual sampling pattern and
   the nonlinear part condition, a newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional is constructed via a more general delay-partition approach.
   Second, in order to obtain less conservative synchronization criteria, a
   novel integral inequality is developed by the mean of the new adjustable
   parameters. Third, a longer sampling period is achieved by using a
   double integral form of Wirtinger-based integral inequality. Finally,
   three numerical examples with simulations of Chua's circuit are given to
   demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{145-162}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A mechanochromic composite comprises an excimer-forming fluorescent dye
   dispersed in a compatible polymeric host. Upon large deformation of the
   polymeric structure, a shift of the fluorescence emission from the
   excimer band to the monomer band is observed, due to reorganization of
   dye aggregates. Mechanochromic elastomers can be tailored to produce a
   reversible optical response during cyclic deformation. Here, we study
   the optomechanical properties of mechanochromic elastomers undergoing
   large uniaxial and biaxial deformations. Through detailed experiments
   and constitutive modeling, we relate the optical response of the
   mechanochromic elastomer to the deformation of the polymer network. We
   confirm that optical response is largely reversible and is modulated by
   the initial dye concentration in the polymer. We adapt the classical
   Arruda-Boyce model to elucidate microstructural modifications of the
   polymer-dye blend. We propose a constitutive hypothesis for the optical
   behavior of the material, which relates variations of the emission
   spectrum to surface stretching. This knowledge can aid in the design of
   strain and stress sensors for applications in mechanics, biomechanics,
   and life sciences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{89-95}},

Abstract = {{Background: For people with lower extremity amputations, the decreased
   confidence and suboptimal gait associated with dynamic instability can
   negatively affect mobility and quality of life. Quantifying dynamic
   instability could enhance clinical decision making related to lower
   extremity prosthetics and inform future prosthetic research.
   Objective: To quantitatively examine gait adaptations in transfemoral
   amputees across various walking conditions.
   Study design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: Plantar-pressure data were collected from 11 individuals with
   unilateral transfemoral amputations using an in-shoe plantar-pressure
   measurement system while navigating rigid and soft ground, ramp, and
   stair conditions. Six parameters were examined: anterior-posterior and
   medial-lateral center-of-pressure direction changes, sensor cell loading
   frequency (cell triggering), maximum lateral force position, double
   support time, and stride time. Paired t-tests and analyses of variance
   were used to examine differences between limbs and walking conditions,
   respectively.
   Results: Values for medial-lateral center-of-pressure direction change,
   sensor cell loading frequency, and double support time were
   significantly greater on the intact limb than the prosthetic limb.
   Significant differences between conditions occurred only for
   anterior-posterior center-of-pressure direction change and double
   support time on the prosthetic limb.
   Conclusion: Higher values on the intact limb suggest that it plays a key
   role in maintaining stability and optimizing body progression during
   different tasks. Differences between participants, limbs, and walking

Abstract = {{The long term impact of SRT (100-40 days) and recovery cleaning on
   membrane performance of an An-MBR treating authentic municipal
   wastewater in a large pilot plant was assessed. Successful operation of
   the pilot plant at a flux of 17 LMH was maintained for a period of 536
   days during which the longest period of operation without recovery
   cleaning or membrane replacement was 178 days. Lower SRT (40 days)
   reduced the fouling propensity of the mixed liquor in terms of TSS
   concentration and the dewaterability indicators including colloidal COD
   (cCOD) concentration and capillary suction time (CST). Critical fluxes
   ranged from 21 to 23 LMH to 25-27 LMH for SRTs of 70 and 40 days
   respectively and this was consistent with the reduced concentrations of
   TSS and improved dewaterability under the latter conditions. Recovery
   cleaning was found to result in substantial reduction of resistance as
   indicated by both pilot plant operation and clean water flux tests. The
   long-term fouling rate was observed to be higher with cleaned membranes
   as compared to virgin membranes. The lower membrane fouling with virgin
   membranes suggested that accumulation of foulants, which were resistant
   to cleaning, caused the higher fouling rates for the cleaned membranes.

Abstract = {{Bitumen mining in the Canadian oil sands creates large volumes of oil
   sands process-affected water (OSPW), the toxicity of which is due in
   part to naphthenic acids (NAs) and other acid extractable organics
   (AEO). The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of solar
   photocatalysis over TiO2 to remove AEO from OSPW. One day of
   photocatalytic treatment under natural sunlight (25 MJ/m(2) over similar
   to 14 h daylight) eradicated AEO from raw OSPW, and acute toxicity of
   the OSPW toward Vibrio fischeri was eliminated. Nearly complete
   mineralization of organic carbon was achieved within 1-7 day equivalents
   of sunlight exposure, and degradation was shown to proceed through a
   superoxide-mediated oxidation pathway. High resolution mass spectrometry
   (HRMS) analysis of oxidized intermediate compounds indicated
   preferential degradation of the heavier and more cyclic NAs (higher
   number of double bond equivalents), which are the most environmentally
   persistent fractions. The photocatalyst was shown to be recyclable for
   multiple uses, and thus solar photocatalysis may be a promising
   ``green{''} advanced oxidation process (AOP) for OSPW treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the importance of a consistent description of

   Through a case study in the context of primary health care, we address
   the research problem of finding ways to build consistent real work

   healthcare domain, in order to foster the design of improved work
   situations and support devices. This is a qualitative field study based
   on ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews carried out
   among professionals involved in the risk assessment process in a primary
   healthcare facility. The objects of ergonomic work analysis were work
   places and work situations with focus on human activity, as well as
   surrounding aspects. The analysis identified elements in the work domain
   with high cognitive demand and operations that could increase mental
   workload, providing elements for the earlier stages of the design of
   work situations and support devices to improve the risk assessment in
   primary health care. This paper shows the usefulness of real work
   descriptions in the design for complex situations like the risk

   derivative gains and GMDH neural representation of automotive engines
   for coldstart emission reductions}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{In this research, a high-performance predictive controller is developed
   for automotive coldstart emission reductions. The proposed control
   scheme combines a hybrid switching predictive controller (HSPC) with
   proportional integral derivative (PID) gains to simultaneously minimize
   the cumulative hydrocarbon emissions (HCcum) and the control input
   variations for a given engine during the coldstart operation. It is
   essential to use a sufficiently accurate surrogate meta-representation
   of the real engine within this model-based controller to predict the
   states of the plant and impart proper control commands to the system.
   The existing studies in the research literature have clearly
   demonstrated that automotive engines have a highly transient nonlinear
   behavior during coldstart periods and different disturbances can affect
   their operations. To cope with the mentioned difficulties, several
   coldstart experiments are performed to capture a comprehensive database
   for the considered engine. Thereafter, a powerful knowledge-based
   black-box meta-modeling tool, known as group method data handling
   (GMDH), is adopted to have a neural representation of the engine's
   coldstart behavior. As a real-time controller, the proposed PID-based
   HSPC requires a fast and robust solver to calculate the gains of PID in
   a computationally efficient manner. Here, a multivariate quadratic
   fit-sectioning algorithm (MQFSA) is proposed to deterministically
   determine the control commands. Other than the considered online
   optimizer, a powerful chaos-enhanced evolutionary algorithm (CEA) is
   used to heuristically optimize the prediction horizon (H-P) and control
   commands horizon (H-U) to achieve the best results. It is demonstrated
   that using such an optimizer, instead of trial-and-errors, to
   heuristically set the control and plant prediction horizon lengths is an
   effective strategy. Finally, several comparative studies are conducted
   to further indicate the efficacy of the proposed PID-based HSPC for the
   automotive coldstart control problem. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{KSAP: An approach to bug report assignment using KNN search and
   heterogeneous proximity}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{68-84}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Context: Bug report assignment, namely, to assign new bug reports to
   developers for timely and effective bug resolution, is crucial for
   software quality assurance. However, with the increasing size of
   software system, it is difficult to assign bugs to appropriate
   developers for bug managers.
   Objective: This paper propose an approach, called KSAP
   (K-nearest-neighbor search and heterogeneous proximity), to improve
   automatic bug report assignment by using historical bug reports and
   heterogeneous network of bug repository.
   Method: When a new bug report was submitted to the bug repository, KSAP
   assigns developers for the bug report by using a two-phase procedure.
   The first phase is to search historically-resolved similar bug reports
   to the new bug report by K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method. The second
   phase is to rank the developers who contributed to those similar bug
   reports by heterogeneous proximity.
   Results: We collected bug repositories of Mozilla, Eclipse, Apache Ant
   and Apache Tomcat6 projects to investigate the performance of the
   proposed KSAP approach. Experimental results demonstrate that KSAP can
   improve the recall of bug report assignment between 7.5-32.25\% in
   comparison with the state of art techniques. When there is only a small
   number of developer collaborations on common bug reports, KSAP has shown
   its excellence over other sate of art techniques. When we tune the
   parameters of the number of historically-resolved similar bug reports
   (K) and the number of developers (Q) for recommendation, KSAP keeps its
   superiority steadily.
   Conclusion: This is the first paper to demonstrate how to automatically
   build heterogeneous network of a bug repository and extract meta-paths
   of developer collaborations from the heterogeneous network for bug
   report assignment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an investigation into the rate
   sensitivity of DP600, TRIP780 and M5182-O sheet metal alloys. The effect
   of strain rate on both the flow stress and anisotropy characteristics
   was also examined. Tensile experiments were performed at room
   temperature under conditions ranging from quasi-static to high strain
   rate loading on the three alloys in three orientations (0 degrees, 45
   degrees, and 90 degrees) with respect to the rolling direction. The
   longitudinal and width strains were measured with a biaxial extensometer
   for the quasi-static experiments and using Digital Image Correlation
   (DIC) methods for the elevated strain rate experiments. The DP600 and
   TRIP780 steels showed moderate rate sensitivity while M5182-O showed
   relatively low or even negative rate sensitivity that was a function of
   strain rate. The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed in
   AA5182-O up to a strain rate of 1 s(-1) and was considered to be the
   cause of the negative rate sensitivity. The hardening behavior of the
   TRIP780 at a strain rate of 1000 s(-1) differed from that observed at
   lower strain rates. This difference is attributed to the effect of the
   adiabatic temperature rise on the transformation-induced plasticity
   effect (TRIP). The Lankford coefficients and the variation in flow
   stress with material orientation were relatively insensitive to strain
   rate for all three alloys. A number of constitutive fits were considered
   and validated successfully through finite element analysis simulations
   of the tensile experiments. The performance of the constitutive models
   was evaluated through comparison of the predicted and measured
   engineering stress-strain responses and the area reduction at the
   measured elongation at fracture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a compact, low-loss, and low-cost phase shifter for
   millimeter-wave/sub-THz applications. The basic idea is to perturb the
   propagation constant of a high resistivity silicon image guide by
   high-dielectric constant barium lanthanide tetratitanates (BLT) ceramic
   loading. Three different BLT ceramic samples have been tested. The
   measured maximum phase-shift variation reaches 150 degrees at 100 GHz
   with an average insertion loss of 2.85 dB and an insertion loss
   variation, <0.7 dB for a sample of a 5-mm length. The proposed phase
   shifter has a bandwidth from 95 to 105 GHz. A low-cost fabrication
   technology has been developed and used to realize this phase shifter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust wavelet-ANN based algorithm for
   single-phasing detection and single-phasing classification in
   distribution systems with a high penetration of distributed generation
   (DG). In traditional vertically integrated distribution systems,
   single-phasing events are detected easily, as the current of one of the
   phases is lost completely, resulting in a significant current unbalance
   ratio. However, this is not the case for distribution systems with a
   high penetration level of DG units, as the backfeed current from the DG
   units will support the current in the lost phase, hence masking the
   singlephasing operation. In the proposed algorithm, the transient
   current signals generated at the onset of the single-phasing condition
   are combined into a modal signal. This signal is analyzed using discrete
   wavelet transform (Dwn to extract the feature vector denoting the
   distinctive features for each frequency band. Finally, artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) are used to detect single-phasing conditions and to
   classify the lost phase. Simulation results have confirmed the
   dependability and security of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{449-458}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding fish migratory patterns and movements often relies on tags
   that are externally or internally implanted. Energy harvesting from fish
   swimming may benefit the state of the art of fish-tags, by increasing
   their battery lifetime and expanding their sensory capabilities. Here,
   we investigate the feasibility of underwater energy harvesting from the
   vibrations of a biomimetic fish tail though piezoelectric materials. We
   propose and experimentally validate a modeling framework to predict the
   underwater vibration of the tail and the associated piezoelectric
   response. The tail is modeled as a geometrically tapered beam with
   heterogeneous physical properties, undergoing large amplitude vibration
   in a viscous fluid. Fluid-structure interactions are described through a
   hydrodynamic function, which accounts for added mass and nonlinear
   hydrodynamic damping. To demonstrate the practical benefit of energy
   harvesting, we assess the possibility of powering a wireless
   communication module using the underwater vibration of the tail hosting
   the piezoelectrics. The electrical energy generated by the
   piezoelectrics during the undulations of the tail is stored and used to
   power the wireless communication device. This preliminary test offers
   compelling evidence for future technological developments toward
   self-powered fish-tags. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Frequency response of curved bilayer microcantilevers with applications
   to surface stress measurement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Bilayer microcantilevers are normally curved because of
   fabrication-induced stresses. When used in biological/chemical sensing
   applications, the absorption of target agents onto the functionalized
   surface of the microcantilever creates a surface stress that shifts its
   resonance frequency. Despite numerous efforts, the mechanisms of surface
   stress-induced shift in the resonance frequency of microcantilevers
   remain elusive. To address this problem, this work presents a detailed
   analysis of the frequency response of microcantilevers, with different
   width-to-thickness ratios and curvature levels, using classical
   lamination theory and the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Based on the results of
   this analysis, a new relationship between resonance frequency shift and
   curvature variation due to differential surface stress loading is
   established. By comparing the strain energies associated with the
   in-plane and out-of-plane displacements of the microcantilever at
   different curvature levels, a new implicit model for surface
   stress-induced resonance frequency shift in microcantilevers is
   presented. Verified against the results of experiments carried out on
   gold/polysilicon microcantilevers, the new model is expected to provide
   a better understanding of surface stress-microcantilever resonator
   interaction, which is critical to systematic optimization of
   resonance-based micro sensors. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the removal of heavy metals (i.e., Co (II), Cu
   (II), Ni (II), Pb (II), Fe (III), Cd (II), Zn (II) and Mn (II)) from
   water with polymer-enhanced ultrafiltration using polyvinylamine (PVAm)
   as a complexing agent. At a PVAm dosage of 0.1 wt\%, metal rejections as
   high as over 99\% were achieved for Pb (II), Cu (H) and Fe (III). The
   coordination interactions between PVAm and the heavy metals were
   investigated using UV-vis spectral and conductometric analyses. It was
   shown that the performance of PEUF for metal rejection was related to
   the coordination interactions between PVAm and the heavy metals. It was
   also found that when divalent sulfate anions were present, the
   PVAm-metal complexes precipitated out of the solution at high metal
   concentrations. Thus PVAm could also be used as a flocculant for metal
   removal by flocculation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, electrically conductive and superoleophobic
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been fabricated through embedding Ag
   flakes (SFs) and Ag nanowires (SNWs) into microstructures of the
   trichloroperfluorooctylsilane (FDTS)-blended PDMS elastomer.
   Microstructured PDMS surfaces became conductive at the percolation
   surface coverage of 3.0 x 10(-2) mg/mm(2) for SFs; the highest
   conductivity was 1.12 x 10(5) S/m at the SFs surface coverage of 6.0 x
   10(-2) mg/mm(2). A significant improvement of the conductivity
   (increased 3 times at the SNWs fraction of 11\%) was achieved by using
   SNWs to replace some SFs because of the conductive pathways from the
   formed SNWs networks and its connections with SFs. These conductive
   fillers bonded strongly with microstructured FDTS-blended PDMS and
   retained surface properties under the sliding preload of 8.0 N.
   Stretching tests indicated that the resistance increased with the
   increasing strains and returned to its original state when the strain
   was released, showing highly stretchable and reversible electrical
   properties. Compared with SFs embedded surfaces, the resistances of
   SFs/SNWs embedded surfaces were less dependent on the strain because of
   bridging effect of SNWs. The superoleophobicity was achieved by the
   synergetic effect of surface modification through blending FDTS and the
   microstructures transferred from sand papers. The research findings
   demonstrate a simple approach to make the insulating elastomer to have
   the desired surface oleophobicity and electrical conductivity and help
   meet the needs for the development of conductive devices with
   microstructures and multifunctional properties.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the requirements of both high energy and power density with
   cycle durability of modern EVs, we prepared a novel nanosulfur granular
   assembled film coated on the three-dimensional graphene sponge (3D-GS)
   composite as a high-performance active material for rechargeable lithium
   sulfur batteries. Instead of conventional graphene powder,
   three-dimensional rGO sponge (3D-rGO) is employed for the composite
   synthesis, resulting in a sulfur film directly in contact with the
   underlying graphene layer. This significantly improves the overall
   electrical conductivity, strategically addressing challenges of
   conventional composites of low sulfur utilization and dissolution of
   polysulfides. Additionally, the synthesis mechanism of 3D-GS is
   elucidated by XPS and DFT analyses, where replacement of hydroxyl group
   of 3D-rGO sponge by sulfur (S-8) is found to be thermodynamically
   favorable. As expected, 3D-GS demonstrates outstanding discharge
   capacity of 1080 mAh g(-1) at a 0.1C rate, and 86.2\% capacity retention
   even after 500 cycles at a 1.0C rate.}},

Abstract = {{We report a comprehensive study on the interactions between cationic

   techniques, such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface
   tension, light scattering, electrophoretic mobility, and fluorescence
   anisotropy measurements, we identified two different driving forces for
   the formation of surface induced micellar aggregates. For the C(12)TAB
   surfactant, a surfactant monolayer with the alkyl chains exposed to the
   water is formed via electrostatic interactions at low concentration. At
   a higher surfactant concentration, micellar aggregates are formed at the
   CNC surface. For the C(14)TAB and C(16)TAB systems, micellar aggregates
   are formed at the CNC surface at a much lower surfactant concentration
   via electrostatic interactions, followed by hydrophobic interactions
   between the alkyl chains. At higher surfactant concentration, charge
   neutralization and association of the surfactant decorated CNC
   aggregates led to flocculation.}},

Title = {{MSEBAG: a dynamic classifier ensemble generation based on

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{406-419}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a dynamic classifier system, MSEBAG, which is
   characterised by searching for the `minimum-sufficient ensemble' and
   bagging at the ensemble level. It adopts an `over-generation and
   selection' strategy and aims to achieve a good bias-variance trade-off.
   In the training phase, MSEBAG first searches for the `minimum-sufficient
   ensemble', which maximises the in-sample fitness with the minimal number
   of base classifiers. Then, starting from the `minimum-sufficient
   ensemble', a backward stepwise algorithm is employed to generate a
   collection of ensembles. The objective is to create a collection of
   ensembles with a descending fitness on the data, as well as a descending
   complexity in the structure. MSEBAG dynamically selects the ensembles
   from the collection for the decision aggregation. The extended adaptive
   aggregation (EAA) approach, a bagging-style algorithm performed at the
   ensemble level, is employed for this task. EAA searches for the
   competent ensembles using a score function, which takes into
   consideration both the in-sample fitness and the confidence of the
   statistical inference, and averages the decisions of the selected
   ensembles to label the test pattern. The experimental results show that
   the proposed MSEBAG outperforms the benchmarks on average.}},

Title = {{Factors of Influence on the Performance of a Short-Latency Non-Invasive
   Brain Switch: Evidence in Healthy Individuals and Implication for Motor
   Function Rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Brain computer interfacing (BCI) has recently been applied as a
   rehabilitation approach for patients with motor disorders, such as
   stroke. In these closed-loop applications, a brain switch detects the
   motor intention from brain signals, e.g., scalp EEG, and triggers a
   neuroprosthetic device, either to deliver sensory feedback or to mimic
   real movements, thus re-establishing the compromised sensory motor
   control loop and promoting neural plasticity. In this context, single
   trial detection of motor intention with short latency is a prerequisite.
   The performance of the event detection from EEG recordings is mainly
   determined by three factors: the type of motor imagery (e.g.,
   repetitive, ballistic), the frequency band (or signal modality) used for
   discrimination (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and MRCP, i.e.,
   movement-related cortical potential), and the processing technique
   (e.g., time-series analysis, sub-band power estimation). In this study,
   we investigated single trial EEG traces during movement imagination on
   healthy individuals, and provided a comprehensive analysis of the
   performance of a short-latency brain switch when varying these three
   factors. The morphological investigation showed a cross-subject
   consistency of a prolonged negative phase in MRCP, and a delayed beta
   rebound in sensory-motor rhythms during repetitive tasks. The detection
   performance had the greatest accuracy when using ballistic MRCP with
   time-series analysis. In this case, the true positive rate (TPR) was
   similar to 70\% for a detection latency of similar to 200 ms. The
   results presented here are of practical relevance for designing BCI
   systems for motor function rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology for simultaneous design and control under process
   disturbances and parameter uncertainty is presented using power series
   expansions (PSE) approximations. The key idea in this methodology is to
   back-off from the optimal steady-state design, which might be infeasible
   because of process dynamics and parameter uncertainty, to obtain the
   optimal design parameters that result in a dynamically feasible and
   economically attractive process. The work focuses on calculating various
   optimal design and control parameters by solving a set of optimization
   problems in an iterative manner using mathematical expressions obtained
   from PSE. These approximations are used to determine the direction in
   the search of optimal design parameters and operating conditions that is
   required for an economically attractive and dynamically feasible
   process. The proposed method was tested on a nonisothermal CSTR, and the
   results were compared with the formal integration process. The effect of
   the methodologys key tuning parameters is also presented. The results
   show that this method has the potential to address the integration of
   design and control of dynamic systems under uncertainty at low
   computational costs.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient drug loading and selectivity in drug delivery are two key
   features of a good drug-carrier design. Here we report on such a drug
   carrier formed by using hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMS NPs)
   as the core and specifically designed multifunctional amphiphilic agents
   as the encapsulating shell. These nanocarriers combine the advantages of
   the HMS NP core (favorable physical and structural properties) and the
   versatility of an organic-based shell (e.g., specificity in chemical
   properties and modifiability). Moreover, both the properties of the core
   and the shell can be independently varied. The varied core and shell
   could then be integrated into a single device (drug carrier) to provide
   efficient and specific drug delivery. In vitro and in vivo data suggests
   that these drug nanocarriers are biocompatible and are able to deliver
   hydrophobic drugs selectively to target tumor cells. After the break of
   the pH-labile linkages in the shell, the drug payload can be released
   and the tumor cells are killed.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption behavior of methylene blue by cellulose
   nanocrystal-alginate (CNC-ALG) hydrogel beads in a fixed bed column was
   studied by varying the initial dye concentrations, bed depths and flow
   rates. An unusual phenomenon was observed in the early phase of the
   adsorption, and the phenomenon was elucidated by varying other critical
   design parameters, such as the flow direction, diameter of column and
   composition of adsorbent. The swelling and shrinkage of hydrogel beads
   during the adsorption was responsible for the anomalous concentration
   versus time profile of the adsorption process. The maximum adsorption
   capacity of the column was 255.5 mg/g, which is in agreement with the
   batch study determined from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. A
   comprehensive understanding on the adsorption mechanism of CNC-ALG
   hydrogel beads during the early stages of adsorption was derived from
   this study. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, Erichsen cup height and limiting drawing ratio of
   fiber laser welded DP980 blanks were compared with respect to that of
   parent metal to understand the role of deformation mode in formability
   context. The strain localization was observed consistently at the outer
   heat affected zone (HAZ) during both the tests in laser welded blanks
   with failure propagated in radial direction and parallel to the weld.
   The microstructure development in the outer HAZ was analyzed by SEM, TEM
   and instrumented nano-indentation. The SEM images of the necked region
   revealed void initiation at the interface of ferrite and martensite due
   to heterogeneity in properties between the phases. The TEM bright field
   images with SAD analysis confirmed tempering of martensite and carbide
   precipitation accompanied with reduction in hardness in the outer HAZ,
   referred as soft zone (SZ). FE simulation results considering local weld
   properties revealed strain localization and subsequent failure under
   plane strain deformation mode due to the presence of the SZ in both
   Erichsen cup and deep drawing tests. It was found that the reduction in
   formability due to the presence of SZ was not severe in deep drawing
   process as compared to the stretch forming test. This was due to the
   difference in thickness distribution and thinning development in the
   blanks deformed under different stress and strain states inherited from
   the tool geometry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and Phase Field Crystal (PFC)
   modelling, the early-stage precipitation phenomenon is investigated for
   naturally- and artificially-aged Al-Mg-Si alloys of two different Mg/Si
   ratios, i.e. 1 and 2. It is shown that, regardless of alloy composition
   and aging history, the earliest precipitates appear as finely-dispersed
   Si-rich clusters which gradually undergo a simultaneous coarsening and
   Mg-enrichment. In addition, the energetic factors for the instability of
   natural aging clusters are analysed. The energy analysis also suggests
   that the initial Si-enrichment of the earliest precipitates is due to
   the affinity of locally-strained areas for higher Si concentrations when
   achieving a meta-stable equilibrium with the strain-free surrounding
   matrix. The subsequent Mg-enrichment is shown to be energetically
   necessary for an evolving precipitate to survive and grow. The alloy
   with smaller Mg/Si ratio shows a delay in the onset of Mg-enrichment
   during natural aging, which is attributed to the higher average Si
   content, as well as the slow kinetics of diffusion at natural aging
   temperatures. It is shown that this alloy exhibits a smaller nucleation
   barrier and critical nucleus size as well. We suggest that the above
   described mechanisms govern the evolution of early-stage clustering in
   the common range of age-hardenable Al-Mg-Si alloy compositions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The dual-phase Mg-9Li-3Al-2Sr-2Y alloy was extruded at 553 K using
   Double Change Channel Angular Pressing (DCCAP) with an extrusion ratio

   accurate computation of the material flow and deformation was performed,
   of which the results showed good agreement with microscope observations
   and micro-hardness measurements on the deformed billet and extrudate.
   Results suggest that dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurs during the
   deformation and leads to grain refinement during the DCCAP process. The
   tensile strength and elongation after fracture in middle part of the

Abstract = {{Advanced high strength steels (AHSS), specifically dual phase (DP)

   type on the microstructure, mechanical properties and fatigue properties
   of FLW similar joints of DP980 was assessed. There existed spherical
   tempered martensite in the GA coated DP980 base metal (BM), most likely
   caused by the galvannealing process. Coating type did not present a
   noticeable effect on the microstructure of the welded zones. The GI
   coating, however, could evaporate violently during welding, resulting in
   high concavity and other welding defects which negatively affect the
   high-cycle fatigue property. Measures to mitigate the negative effects

Abstract = {{In the current study, a novel intelligent control algorithm is proposed
   for the efficient reduction of coldstart hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of
   an automotive engine. The proposed intelligent controller inherits the
   computational advantages of two advanced techniques, namely hybrid
   switching predictive controller and extreme learning machine (ELM). The
   proposed model-based predictive controller has a switching behavior
   which enables it to be used for a deliberate control of the considered
   engine's behavior during the coldstart period. As the hybrid controller
   requires a hybrid model for processing, a bi-level ELM is used which is
   composed of two independent ELMs for the calculation of exhaust gas
   temperature (T-exh) and engine-out HCs. A novel online trajectory
   builder is also introduced to make sure that the control commands are
   adjusted according to the actual behavior of the engine. Through
   simulations, the computational potentials of ELM for designing hybrid
   switching controllers are demonstrated. Furthermore, it is indicated
   that the proposed hybrid switching controller can afford qualified
   results for the considered case study. To verify the authenticity of the
   obtained results, two well-known controllers, namely nonlinear model
   predictive controller (NMPC) and an optimal controller based on the
   Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP), are taken into account. The
   numerical experiments also host an additional step which evaluates the
   impact of prediction horizon (H-P) on the performance of the controller.
   Based on all of the mentioned simulations, the efficacy of hybrid
   switching predictive controller with bi-level ELM (HSPC-BELM) is
   verified. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide invaluable information about the
   structure of different tissue types in the brain. Standard dMRI
   acquisitions facilitate a proper analysis (e.g. tracing) of
   medium-to-large white matter bundles. However, smaller fiber bundles
   connecting very small cortical or sub-cortical regions cannot be traced
   accurately in images with large voxel sizes. Yet, the ability to trace
   such fiber bundles is critical for several applications such as deep
   brain stimulation and neurosurgery. In this work, we propose a novel
   acquisition and reconstruction scheme for obtaining high spatial
   resolution dMRI images using multiple low resolution (LR) images, which
   is effective in reducing acquisition time while improving the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed method called
   compressed-sensing super resolution reconstruction (CS-SRR), uses
   multiple overlapping thick-slice dMRI volumes that are under-sampled in
   q-space to reconstruct diffusion signal with complex orientations. The
   proposed method combines the twin concepts of compressed sensing and
   super-resolution to model the diffusion signal (at a given b-value) in a
   basis of spherical ridgelets with total-variation (TV) regularization to
   account for signal correlation in neighboring voxels. A computationally
   efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) is introduced for solving the CS-SRR problem. The
   performance of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated on
   several in-vivo human data sets including a true SRR scenario. Our
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used
   for reconstructing sub-millimeter super resolution dMRI data with very
   good data fidelity in clinically feasible acquisition time. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The release into the environment of antimicrobial compounds from both
   human and agricultural sources is a growing global concern. The Grand
   River watershed, the largest mixed-use watershed in southern Ontario,
   receives runoff from intensive animal production as well as municipal
   wastewater effluents from a rapidly increasing human population. A
   survey of surface waters and wastewater effluents was conducted across
   the watershed to assess the occurrence and distribution of several
   antimicrobials (i.e., trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine,
   lincomycin, and monensin) and chemical indicators (i.e., ammonia,
   nitrate, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, atrazine) and to characterize exposure
   levels. The human antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were
   detected in the urban areas of the main channel at mean concentrations
   of 8 +/- 7 ng/L and 31 +/- 24 ng/L, respectively, but at much lower
   concentrations in the agricultural tributaries. In contrast, the
   veterinary antimicrobial sulfamethazine was detected at a mean
   concentration of 11 +/- 9 ng/L in the main channel, and at a much higher
   concentration in the agricultural tributaries. Lincomycin was detected
   in only two river samples and not in the effluents while monensin was
   not detected in all samples. The herbicide atrazine was detected at very
   low concentrations in the surface waters of both the tributaries and the
   main channel. The concentrations of the antimicrobials and chemical
   indicators generally increased downstream of the confluences with
   agricultural tributaries and effluent outfalls. In the wastewater
   effluents, the concentrations of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole,
   ibuprofen, and venlafaxine decreased with increasing treatment levels
   (i.e., secondary to tertiary) as indicated by ammonia/nitrate
   concentrations. There was a strong correlation among trimethoprim,
   sulfamethoxazole, and venlafaxine in the main channel and in the
   wastewater effluents. While the environmental concentrations of
   antimicrobials in the watershed are low relative to toxicity thresholds,
   their persistence in the environment may be an important consideration
   in defining strategies for future water management. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{498}},
Pages = {{158-166}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The surface charge of weak cation exchange membranes, consisting of
   functionalized macroporous hydrogel coated nonwoven support material,
   was related to its global swelling. Pore size visualization and analysis
   by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) of hydrated
   membranes subjected to freeze drying preserved the hydrogel macroporous
   structure and showed pores generally an order of magnitude larger than
   immunoglobulin G (IgG). At pH 6 and higher, the membrane average pore
   size was high reflecting the strong negative charge of the carboxylic
   acid groups. At pH below 5.5, the membrane average pore size was lower
   reflecting the nearly zero surface charge of the membrane material. The
   charge of IgG was the predominant factor responsible for IgG binding and
   elution. Maximum IgG binding capacity was observed at pH 4.8 and 0 M
   KCI, whereas highest IgG elution was obtained at pH 7 and 0 M KCI. The
   presence of KCI at pH 4.8 decreased IgG binding capacity while KCI
   addition at pH 7 did not affect IgG recovery but KCI addition was
   required for IgG elution at pH 4.5. Convective transport limitations,
   which were investigated in a dynamic flow through system, were reduced
   while strong asymmetry of the breakthrough curve remained when the feed
   flow rate was increased. Protein accumulation at the membrane surface
   and in the membrane pores may exist during dynamic operation. Further
   work should be devoted to the investigation of protein accumulation and
   its distinction from protein binding. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{We present a true metasurface antenna based on electrically-small
   resonators. The resonators are placed on a flat surface and connected to
   one feed point using corporate feed. Unlike conventional array antennas
   where the distance between adjacent antennas is half wavelength to
   reduce mutual coupling between adjacent antennas, here the distance
   between the radiating elements is electrically very small to affect good
   impedance matching of each resonator to its feed. A metasurface antenna
   measuring 1.2 lambda x 1.2 lambda and designed to operate at 3 GHz
   achieved a gain of 12 dBi. A prototype was fabricated and tested showing
   good agreement between numerical simulations and experimental results.
   Through numerical simulation, we show that the metasurface antenna has
   the ability to provide beam steering by phasing all the resonators
   appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{The flow stress behavior of 7150 aluminum alloys with different Zr
   (0-0.15 wt\%) and V (0.01-0.15 wt\%) additions was investigated using
   uniaxial compression tests conducted at various temperatures and strain
   rates. Using the revised Sellars' constitutive analysis, the activation
   energy maps for hot deformation of 7150 alloys are proposed, which are
   considered as a function of deformation temperature, strain rate and
   micro-alloying elements. The results reveal that the activation energies
   of all 7150 alloys decrease with increasing deformation temperature and
   increasing strain rate. The activation energies for hot deformation of
   the alloy with 0.12-0.15\% Zr are remarkably increased compared with
   those of the base alloy at most deformation conditions due to the
   pinning effect of Al3Zr dispersoids on dislocation and the restrained
   dynamic recovery. The 0.05\% V addition significantly increases
   activation energies, preferentially at lower temperatures of 573-623 K,
   correlated with the V solute drag effect. At higher V additions from
   0.11\% to 0.15\%, the activation energy generally increases at the
   majority of deformation conditions due to the Al21V2 dispersoid pinning
   effect. However, remarkable decreases in activation energy are exhibited
   at low deformation temperatures of 573-700 K and at low strain rates of
   0.001-0.008 s(-1), attributed to the enhanced dynamical precipitation
   and severe depletion of solutes. Comparing the activation energy maps
   for the alloys studied, the effects of the micro-alloying of Zr and V on
   plastic deformation under specific deformation conditions can be better
   understood. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   intermetallic and (Fe, Al)(2)Zr Laves phases. An isothermal annealing
   carried out at 450 degrees C for 50 h led to a phase transformation from
   a B2 to an equilibrium DO3 phase. The Fe3Al based alloy samples with the
   B2 structure, directly after the LENS process and with the DO3 structure
   after annealing, exhibited similar yield strength and ultimate tensile

   field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware, the optics, position
   sensing detector (PSD) and photo detector (PD). The experimental results
   demonstrated that the proposed scheme is able to achieve accurate

Abstract = {{In this study, a comprehensive empirical test is conducted to analyse
   the effects of two well-known chaotic maps, namely sinusoidal and

   optimization of continuous problems. To do so, 13 well-known numerical
   benchmark problems in three distinctive dimensions, namely 50D, 100D and
   200D, are considered and the genetic algorithm (GA) with simple version
   and chaos-enhanced versions of the mentioned crossover operators are
   utilized for optimizing these functions. Furthermore, a time complexity

Abstract = {{In recent years, with the explosion of digital images on the Web,
   content-based retrieval has emerged as a significant research area.
   Shapes, textures, edges and segments may play a key role in describing
   the content of an image. Radon and Gabor transforms are both powerful
   techniques that have been widely studied to extract shape-texture-based
   information. The combined Radon-Gabor features may be more robust
   against scale/rotation variations, presence of noise, and illumination
   changes. The objective of this paper is to harness the potentials of
   both Gabor and Radon transforms in order to introduce expressive binary
   features, called barcodes, for image annotation/tagging tasks. We
   propose two different techniques: Gabor-of-Radon-Image Barcodes
   (GRIBCs), and Guided-Radon-of-Gabor Barcodes (GRGBCs). For validation,
   we employ the IRMA x-ray dataset with 193 classes, containing 12,677
   training images and 1,733 test images. A total error score as low as 322
   and 330 were achieved for GRGBCs and GRIBCs, respectively. This
   corresponds to 81\% retrieval accuracy for the first hit.}},

Abstract = {{Using content-based binary codes to tag digital images has emerged as a
   promising retrieval technology. Recently, Radon barcodes (RBCs) have
   been introduced as a new binary descriptor for image search. RBCs are
   generated by binarization of Radon projections and by assembling them
   into a vector, namely the barcode. A simple local thresholding has been
   suggested for binarization. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
   ``autoencoded Radon barcodes{''}. Using images in a training dataset, we
   autoencode Radon projections to perform binarization on outputs of
   hidden layers. We employed the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent
   approach for the training. Each hidden layer of the autoencoder can
   produce a barcode using a threshold determined based on the range of the
   logistic function used. The compressing capability of autoencoders
   apparently reduces the redundancies inherent in Radon projections
   leading to more accurate retrieval results. The IRMA dataset with 14,410
   x-ray images is used to validate the performance of the proposed method.
   The experimental results, containing comparison with RBCs, SURF and
   BRISK, show that autoencoded Radon barcode (ARBC) has the capacity to
   capture important information and to learn richer representations
   resulting in lower retrieval errors for image retrieval measured with
   the accuracy of the first hit only.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the mechanical behaviours of the surrounding
   rocks in the underground caverns of the Wudongde hydropower plant,
   triaxial tests are performed on a type of dolomite. It is revealed that
   damage induced by crack development is the main factor controlling the
   nonlinear plastic deformation and failure behaviour of the dolomite in
   both pre- and post-peak regimes. Based on this understanding, a coupled
   elastoplastic damage model is developed for capturing the dolomite's
   mechanical behaviours. In the model, the effects of plasticity and
   damage on rocks is described by introducing plastic hardening and damage
   softening commonly in the plastic yield surface. Which are both derived
   from a suitable Helmholtz free energy function. The model is used to
   simulate the triaxial tests. Comparisons between test results and the
   numerical modelling show that the developed model is capable of
   describing the macro mechanical behaviours of the Wudongde dolomite.}},

Abstract = {{Software defect prediction, which predicts defective code regions, can
   help developers find bugs and prioritize their testing efforts. To build
   accurate prediction models, previous studies focus on manually designing
   features that encode the characteristics of programs and exploring
   different machine learning algorithms. Existing traditional features
   often fail to capture the semantic differences of programs, and such a
   capability is needed for building accurate prediction models.
   To bridge the gap between programs' semantics and defect prediction
   features, this paper proposes to leverage a powerful representation-
   learning algorithm, deep learning, to learn semantic representation of
   programs automatically from source code. Specifically, we leverage Deep
   Belief Network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features from token
   vectors extracted from programs' Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
   Our evaluation on ten open source projects shows that our automatically
   learned semantic features significantly improve both within-project
   defect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction (CPDP)
   compared to traditional features. Our semantic features improve WPDP on
   average by 14.7\% in precision, 11.5\% in recall, and 14.2\% in F1. For
   CPDP, our semantic features based approach outperforms the
   state-of-the-art technique TCA+ with traditional features by 8.9\% in
   F1.}},

Abstract = {{A decade ago, the crowdsourcing term was first coined and used to
   represent a method for expressing the wisdom of the crowd in
   accomplishing tasks that need human intelligence rather than machines
   and can be more efficiently accomplished time and financial wise using
   the crowd rather than indoor experts. This crowdsourcing process mainly
   contains four modules: designing incentives, then collecting,
   aggregating and verifying received information. The expert discovery
   module can be added to reduce the cost and enhance reliability and
   accuracy. The crowdsourcing process is used in this work to harness the
   mental ability of reliable Internet users around the globe and to
   improve the knowledge discovery techniques over social media; especially
   Twitter. The main objective is to improve the quality of the Twitter
   Exemplar-based topic detection system. The feedback from the crowd is
   utilized to adjust weights of the cosine similarity function deployed in
   the Exemplar-based topic detection algorithm. Testing the system using
   the Football Association Cup (FA Cup) dataset, it is found that the
   crowdsourcing has achieved a constant increase in the topic recall (by
   up to 15\%), term precision (by up to 4\%) and term recall (by up to
   3\%). Therefore, the new weights succeeded in increasing the three

Abstract = {{Distance plays a vital role in many applications of data analytics. In
   this paper, the concept of distance between any two data objects X and Y
   is addressed from the perspective of Shannon information theory.
   Consider a coding paradigm where X and Y are encoded into a sequence of
   coded bits specifying a codeword ( or method) which would in turn
   convert Y into (X) over cap, and X into (Y) over cap such that both the
   distortion between X and (X) over cap and the distortion between Y and
   (Y) over cap are less than or equal to a prescribed threshold D. Given a
   class C of coding schemes within the coding paradigm, the information
   distance R-C( X, Y, D) between X and Y at the distortion level D is
   defined as the smallest number of coded bits afforded by coding schemes
   from C. For two important classes C, R-C(X, Y, D) is shown to be indeed
   a pseudo distance in some sense; it is further characterized or bounded.
   When C is the class of so-called separately precoded broadcast codes, it
   is shown that for any stationary, totally ergodic sources X and Y,
   R-C(X, Y, D) is equal to the maximum of the Wyner-Ziv coding rate of X
   with Y as side information and the Wyner-Ziv coding rate of Y with X as
   side information. In the general case where C consists of all codes
   within the coding paradigm, upper and lower bounds to R-C(X, Y, D) are
   established, and are further shown to be tight when X and Y are jointly
   Gaussian. The distance R-C(X, Y, D) generalizes the notion of
   information distance defined within the framework of Kolmogorov
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with finding a `least interaction' controller that
   generically achieves pole placement, given a actuator-sensor interaction
   possibility for the controller. The structure of the plant and the
   controller are modeled as an undirected and bipartite graph. Assuming
   that the plantkontroller structures are specified, we find a minimum
   controller substructure within the specified controller structure such
   that the controller substructure allows generic eigenvalue
   assignability. The minimum is in the sense that the bipartite graph
   consisting of the proposed controller has the minimum number of edges.
   The complexity of a brute-force algorithm to identify a minimum
   controller substructure would be exponential and hence we propose two
   formulations for solving this problem, using recent results about
   equivalence of generic pole-assignability and covering of plant edges
   using cycles. The first uses multi commodity flow networks to include
   all plant edges in some cycle using the least number of controller
   edges. We show that an integer solution to this formulation gives a
   minimum controller substructure for arbitrary pole placement problem.
   Since the problem of finding a feasible integer flow in multicommodity
   networks is NP-complete, there is ample reason that identifying a
   minimum controller substructure is NP-hard. The second formulation uses
   the framework of travelling salesman with profits (TSP with profits) to
   cover all vertices of the bipartite graph by cycles using the least
   number of controller edges. The TSP-with-profits problem too belongs to
   the class of NP-hard problems. We show that our formulation is
   equivalent to the so-called Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem
   (GTSP) thus allowing branch-cut algorithms developed for GTSP problems.}},

Abstract = {{Driver behaviour has a significant influence on vehicle accidents.
   Measuring and providing feedback on driver behaviour can provide
   significant benefits for understanding and improving road safety. In
   order to detect driver actions and driving characteristics from the
   broadest population of drivers, mobile phones can be used to collect low
   cost information and provide easy accessibility, using sensors available
   on the mobile phone such as the GPS and IMU. Such information is
   collected as a time series dataset, which generally has high dimensional
   variables. Dealing with this high dimensional data is a crucial problem
   for statistical analysis. Feature abstraction techniques can reduce the
   dimensionality by extracting salient features from the dataset. This
   paper proposes a feature abstraction method using stacked sparse
   autoencoders in order to reduce driver dataset variables. The utility of
   the derived features is demonstrated on a driver action classification

Abstract = {{Exploiting physical layer (PHY) characteristics has great potential to
   complement and secure upper-layer authentication protocols. Unlike
   existing PHY authentication mechanisms requiring special hardware
   designs, in this paper, we propose a practical PHY-aided authentication
   approach based on weighted fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT). Instead
   of exploiting the channel or hardware characteristics that are out of
   control, the proposed scheme can provide two-fold protection on
   upper-layer protocols by leveraging the intrinsic PHY features of the
   transmitted signal. Firstly, WFRFT can hide and forge the modulation
   paradigm to mislead attackers in signal demodulation. Secondly, WFRFT
   signal can be adjusted among different patterns automatically and
   dynamically to provide more security and freedom in PHY authentication,
   similar to frequency-hopping systems. Numerical simulations and analyses
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve more secure
   authentication with tolerable computational overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestions cause not only the time-consuming and frustrating
   experiences to drivers, but also other critical problems, such as fuel
   waste, air pollution and accidents. Real-time traffic information
   exchange can avoid vehicles being congested on roads. However, when the
   drivers are acquiring the traffic information, their privacy is
   inevitable to be disclosed. To preserve the driver's privacy, in this
   paper, we propose a privacy-preserving real-time navigation system
   (PRIN) using vehicular crowdsourcing. In PRIN, the RSUs cooperatively
   find an optimal path for the querying vehicle to the destination
   according to the real-time traffic information crowdsourced by the
   vehicles in their coverage areas. The querying vehicle retrieves the
   navigation result from each RSU successively when entering its coverage
   area, and follows the proper driving route to the next RSU, until
   reaching its destination. During these querying, crowdsourcing and
   retrieving processes, the driver's personal information, such as
   location, identity, is protected from being disclosed to attackers. In
   addition, a trusted authority can trace the drivers' identities if they
   upload false traffic information. Finally, we discuss the properties of
   conditional privacy preservation and demonstrate the efficiency of PRIN.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing worst case routing latencies while delivering high throughput
   and low energy are key design concerns in the engineering of overlay
   packet-switched NoCs for FPGA fabrics. Deflection routed torus NoCs are
   known to map particularly well to modern wire-rich FPGA substrates with
   fracturable LUT organizations while delivering high sustained bandwidths
   for various workloads and traffic patterns. However, they suffer from
   significantly higher worst case routing latencies due to deflections,
   particularly at large system sizes, when compared to classic buffered
   NoCs. To tackle this challenge, we design a deadlock-free hierarchical
   torus that (1) targets worst case latencies in deflection torus NoCs by
   separating deflections into two levels of the NoC, (2) delivers an
   FPGA-friendly design for deadlock freedom by providing physical escape
   channels in the lower levels, and (3) naturally supports physical layout
   for large multi-die FPGA chips by mapping upper level links to expensive
   interposer connections between dies. We generate layouts for
   implementing the NoC on the ML605 board (XCV6LX240T FPGA), VC707 board
   (XC7VX485T FPGA) and large multi-die XC7V2000T chips while delivering
   fast 300-500 MHz NoCs while consuming 10-15\% of FPGA LUT resources. For
   instance with the 16 x 16 NoC, we reduce worst case deflection costs by
   1.5-10 x while simultaneously improving sustained rates by 1.5-2x and
   lowering energy requirements by 25 \% for a range of
   statistically-generated traffic patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Human motion analysis is of crucial importance in countless applications
   such as human-robot interaction or during the design of assistive
   devices. Human motion should be estimated as accurately as possible at
   both kinematics and dynamics levels. Accurately estimating joint
   trajectories, inter-segmental loads, geometric parameters and body
   segment inertial parameters specific to each subject will allow most of
   the indexes used to quantify/analyze human motion to be reconstructed.
   In this study, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to
   estimate the joint angles, velocities, and accelerations. Moreover two
   constraint quadratic problems are used to determine geometric parameters
   and body segment inertial parameters. Contrary to state of the art
   methods that rely solely on marker data to perform inverse kinematics,
   the proposed approach relies on force-plate data to obtain dynamically
   consistent joint trajectories. The proposed approach is evaluated on a
   squat exercise, performed by 8 subjects, and shows an improved accuracy
   in joint kinematics and inertial parameter estimation over the classical
   methods.}},

   represented with Lie group members, including special orthogonal groups

   Group Extended Kalman Filter (LG-EKF) for stochastic inference on
   groups, thus explicitly accounting for the non-euclidean geometry of the
   state space, and provide the derivation of the LG-EKF recursion for
   articulated motion estimation. We evaluate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm in both simulation and on real-world motion capture
   data, comparing it with the Euler angles based EKF. The results show
   that the proposed filter significantly outperforms the Euler angles
   based EKF, since it estimates human motion more accurately and is not

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a spectral parallelism electronic system that
   works as a data acquisition and image reconstruction system for magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). It uses a custom receiver chain and narrowband
   bandpass filters. The broadband magnetic resonance (MR) signal is
   spectrally separated into multiple narrowband channels. Then each
   channel signal is processed individually and the system recombines the
   frequency-limited narrowband signals from the separate channels to
   reconstruct images or signal profiles. The final image is reconstructed
   by recombining all the channels data via weighted addition, where the
   weights correspond to the frequency responses of each narrowband filter.
   Results were obtained using a clinical MRI system and the images
   acquired by the developed embedded system showed the feasibility of
   achieving images with signal-to-noise ratio comparable to those produced

Abstract = {{In this paper, weighted fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT) is applied
   to safeguard the physical layer (PHY) security of wireless
   communications. By leveraging the features of WFRFT, we propose a PHY
   security modulation scheme which significantly degrades the equivalent
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the unauthorized receiver while imposing
   no impact on the legitimate receiver. With the proposed scheme, a robust
   nonzero secrecy capacity can be guaranteed. Moreover, the proposed
   scheme can conceal the actual modulation paradigms to prevent malicious
   signal detection, due to the variation in signal characteristics. A
   higher order statistics (HOS) based classifier is used to evaluate the
   anti-recognition performance. Moreover, the secrecy performance of the
   proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of both secrecy capacity and
   average bit error rate (BER) by numerical simulations. Finally, as a
   proof-of-concept, an all-digital field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   based prototype system is developed to validate the practicability of
   the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and
   vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has
   been proposed to bring essential and potential benefits, such as
   improving traffic safety and offering computational services to road
   users. To make such computational services reliable and secure, the
   computation results from the vehicular cloud (VC) should be verifiable
   and the trustworthy vehicles need to be selected to form the VC with
   disclosure-minimizing privacy. To address these challenges, a
   privacy-preserving trust-based verifiable vehicular cloud computing
   scheme has been proposed in this paper, named PTVC. Specifically, the
   proposed PTVC scheme integrates the unique features of VCC and the
   requirements of privacy into traditional reputation system based on beta
   distribution, which can help differentiate the trust levels of the
   vehicles and preserve location privacy in the meantime. Moreover, by
   using the verifiable techniques, the cloud users can verify the
   correctness of outsourced computation while guaranteeing the privacy of
   their outsourced data. Detailed security analysis shows that the
   proposed PTVC scheme is secure and robust against several sophisticated
   attacks. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations
   are also conducted, demonstrating its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{After big disasters, a damaged area can be out of contact because of
   severe damage of existing network infrastructures. Meanwhile, high
   demands for network connections to the disaster area will arise to
   collect damage information and disseminate rescue instructions. In this
   paper, we propose to construct a network for disaster management using
   mobile stations equipped with sensors and network interfaces. They are
   controlled by a disaster management center via wide area network
   technology, and conduct various disaster management tasks, such as
   damage sensing, information collection and message dissemination. To
   address the challenges of unpredictable tasks and limited number of
   mobile stations with working capability constraints, we propose an
   online algorithm that schedules mobile stations for disaster management
   tasks with weights in each time slot, without any knowledge of future
   task arrivals. Our objective is to maximize the total weight of finished
   tasks under constraints of maximum working capability of mobile
   stations. We prove that the performance of proposed online algorithm is
   no worse than e-1/e of optimal solutions. Extensive simulations are
   conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a secure transmission protocol for two users
   exchanging their respective information in an n-hop MIMO Ad hoc network.
   By exploiting the properties of the transmission medium in the physical
   layer, three channel models are utilized to provide secure transmission,
   namely one-way relay channel, two-way untrusted relay channel, and
   multiple access channel. Using these channel models, we design a basic
   protocol with a minimized time slot cost, i.e. n + 1. Based on this
   basic protocol, we show that the attacker, either untrusted relay or
   external eavesdropper, can only obtain a summed signal in each time
   slot, and this summed signal cannot be decomposed to recover the
   individual information from the users. We then present cryptographic
   analysis for the first time to identify a weakness which is common for
   all known security schemes based on the summed signal. Thirdly, we
   introduce an evolutionary protocol proposed with two rounds of
   interlaced information exchange, which defeats this weakness. Finally,
   the simulation is performed to demonstrate the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A concept of Cloud Radio Access Networks (CRANs) with Power over Fiber
   (PoF) is expected to work as a post-disaster access network
   architecture. In this architecture, since external power is supplied to
   Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) through the optical-fiber cable for data
   communication, RRHs can operate even when power cables are disrupted due
   to disasters. This network, however, needs to reduce the power
   consumption for RRH operation and consider Quality of Experience (QoE)
   to provide sustainable service with enough user satisfaction. To this
   end, we propose user position guidance approaches which give advices of
   the best position to users. Our proposed approaches are able to achieve
   high sustainability while satisfying the QoE constraint. Furthermore,
   the effectiveness of our proposed approaches is evaluated by numerical

Abstract = {{In this paper, sustainable resource allocation for green Cloud Radio
   Access Networks (C-RAN) powered by renewable energy is investigated.
   Specifically, the Base Station pool (BS pool) in the C-RAN distributes
   data to a set of remote radio heads (RRHs) with energy harvesting (EH)
   capability, and allocates sub-carriers to the selected RRHs for downlink
   transmissions, by jointly considering the user throughput and energy
   sustainability performance of RRHs. To this end, a utility optimization
   problem is formulated, characterizing the stochastic process of energy
   harvesting (EH) and wireless fading channel. Based on Lyapunov
   optimization techniques, the formulated problem is decomposed into three
   sub-problems, i.e., energy harvesting, data scheduling, and sub-carrier
   allocation. An efficient online algorithm is developed to obtain the
   maximal aggregate user utility while ensuring the stability of the data
   buffers and sustainability of the energy buffers. Performance analysis
   demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can achieve a suboptimal
   performance with guaranteed upper bounds of data queue and energy queue
   lengths. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an energy management system (EMS)
   for a water pumping system with the objective of minimizing energy

   the rotational speed is reduced using variable speed drive control.
   Considering a linear relationship between the centrifugal pump's
   rotational speed and flow rate, a neural network is trained to estimate
   the power consumption as a function of the output flow rate. This model
   is included in the EMS to determine the optimal load schedule and
   optimal pump operations. Simulation results indicate potential savings
   on energy cost and demand charges as the pumps' operational schedules
   and flow rates are optimized, and also the life cycle costs and
   reliability can be improved by minimizing number of startups.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging load represents a large and

   probabilistic analytical approach has been employed using an IEEE
   reliability test system. The PEV charging load is modeled based on the
   National Household Travel Survey and on currently available market data
   pertaining to PEV type and charging level. Also presented is the effect
   on the adequacy indices of each PEV load parameter, specifically
   penetration level, PEV type, and charging level. A further case study
   was conducted in order to evaluate the impact of the current time-of-use
   tariff in response to the expected increase in power demand due to the
   massive deployment of PEVs. The results show that the addition of PEVs
   significantly affects the generation reliability, and that higher
   charging levels and PEVs with greater battery capacity create a severe
   risk to generation reliability. Investigation of solutions that maintain
   reliability indices is therefore required.}},

Abstract = {{Electrifying the transportation sector will undoubtedly influence power
   systems in various aspects from network losses and cost of operation to
   system reliability. This paper presents a novel framework to evaluate
   the impact of PEV charging loads on composite power system reliability.
   An optimal power flow (OPF) based model combined with a minimum cut set
   approach is proposed to evaluate nodal and system reliability indices.
   In addition, the impact of PEV types, charging characteristics, driver
   behaviour, and time of use electricity price have been considered
   through a wide range of scenarios. As well, detailed studies that
   consider the IEEE RTS, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed
   technique, are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable based distributed generators are being used extensively owing
   to the benefits they offer for both utilities and investors. With the
   spread of these DGs in power systems, A precise model that follows the
   stochastic behavior of wind or solar is crucial for power system
   planning and operation. This paper presents novel probabilistic models
   for wind and solar based generators. These models give the output power
   from wind or solar in per unit from their rating with one continuous
   PDF. The goodness-of-fit tests are used to find the best fit PDF to
   model wind and solar output power. The Well-known forward-backward-
   sweep power flow algorithm is integrated with the proposed wind and
   solar probabilistic models to form a probabilistic power flow tool. The
   proposed probabilistic power flow tool is used to analyze the PG\&E
   69-bus system.}},

Abstract = {{A Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system which identifies similar
   medical images based on a query image can assist clinicians for more
   accurate diagnosis. The recent CBIR research trend favors the
   construction and use of binary codes to represent images. Deep
   architectures could learn the non-linear relationship among image pixels
   adaptively, allowing the automatic learning of high-level features from
   raw pixels. However, most of them require class labels, which are
   expensive to obtain, particularly for medical images. The methods which
   do not need class labels utilize a deep autoencoder for binary hashing,
   but the code construction involves a specific training algorithm and an
   ad-hoc regularization technique. In this study, we explored using a deep
   de-noising autoencoder (DDA), with a new unsupervised training scheme
   using only backpropagation and dropout, to hash images into binary
   codes. We conducted experiments on more than 14,000 x-ray images. By
   using class labels only for evaluating the retrieval results, we
   constructed a 16-bit DDA and a 512-bit DDA independently. Comparing to
   other unsupervised methods, we succeeded to obtain the lowest total
   error by using the 512-bit codes for retrieval via exhaustive search,
   and speed up 9.27 times with the use of the 16-bit codes while keeping a
   comparable total error. We found that our new training scheme could
   reduce the total retrieval error significantly by 21.9\%. To further
   boost the image retrieval performance, we developed Radon Autoencoder
   Barcode (RABC) which are learned from the Radon projections of images
   using a de-noising autoencoder. Experimental results demonstrated its
   superior performance in retrieval when it was combined with DDA binary
   codes.}},

Abstract = {{Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in large medical image archives is
   a challenging and necessary task. Generally, different feature
   extraction methods are used to assign expressive and invariant features
   to each image such that the search for similar images comes down to
   feature classification and/or matching. The present work introduces a
   new image retrieval method for medical applications that employs a
   convolutional neural network (CNN) with recently introduced Radon
   barcodes. We combine neural codes for global classification with Radon
   barcodes for the final retrieval. We also examine image search based on
   regions of interest (ROI) matching after image retrieval. The IRMA
   dataset with more than 14,000 x-rays images is used to evaluate the
   performance of our method. Experimental results show that our approach
   is superior to many published works.}},

   Dempster's conditional rule for updating belief is used to fuse evidence

   keeping the storage function. We show that driftlessness is a necessary
   condition for a sampled-data system on a matrix Lie group to be
   zero-state observable. The closed-loop sampled-data system is stabilized

   66.5\% at V-oc = 14.46V (open circuit voltage) with an approximately 650
   suns / 841 nm monochromatic source. Our simulations reproduce the PV
   characteristics of the physical devices with good (similar to \%)
   accuracy for V-oc and I-sc (short circuit current), which allows us to
   numerically study the influence of experimental conditions and design
   factors on device performance. Moreover, our simulations suggest that
   measured efficiencies are very close to the theoretical limits of the
   heterostructures under consideration. Our focus in these proceedings is
   twofold: a) to present an overview of the results of these experiments

Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) are being incorporated at an accelerated rate into
   Third-Gen photovoltaic (PV) and scaled-up PV processing platforms for
   production of high efficiency devices. As a result, studies are needed
   to examine QD toxicity in workplace environment. Herein, we report on a
   rapid and sensitive detection methods to examine risk of QD exposure in
   PV processing. QD-associated toxic elements were detected in slight
   amounts using gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) probe, followed by
   photoluminescence and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy
   (ICP-MS) analyses, which indicated the possibility of QD aerosolization
   during deposition, transferring and testing of the QD film. Cytotoxicity
   effects of different type QDs were also studied using cell culture
   viability. The results indicate that QD material and their coating are
   important factors in producing cytotoxicity effects. It was also
   demonstrated that CIS QDs have less cytotoxic effects on HeLa and CHSE
   cells than CdSe QDs, and may be considered non-toxic in comparison.}},

   Connectivity}},

Abstract = {{Deep neural networks are a branch in machine learning that has seen a
   meteoric rise in popularity due to its powerful abilities to represent
   and model high-level abstractions in highly complex data. One area in
   deep neural networks that are ripe for exploration is neural
   connectivity formation. A pivotal study on the brain tissue of rats
   found that synaptic formation for specific functional connectivity in
   neocortical neural microcircuits can be surprisingly well modeled and
   predicted as a random formation. Motivated by this intriguing finding,
   we introduce the concept of StochasticNet where deep neural networks are
   formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons. As a result, any
   type of deep neural networks can be formed as a StochasticNet by
   allowing the neuron connectivity to be stochastic. Stochastic synaptic
   formations in a deep neural network architecture can allow for efficient
   utilization of neurons for performing specific tasks. To evaluate the
   feasibility of such a deep neural network architecture, we train a
   StochasticNet using four different image datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST,
   SVHN, and STL-10). Experimental results show that a StochasticNet using
   less than half the number of neural connections as a conventional deep
   neural network achieves comparable accuracy and reduces over fitting on
   the CIFAR-10, MNIST, and SVHN data sets. Interestingly, StochasticNet
   with less than half the number of neural connections, achieved a higher
   accuracy (relative improvement in test error rate of similar to 6\%
   compared to ConvNet) on the STL-10 data set than a conventional deep
   neural network. Finally, the StochasticNets have faster operational
   speeds while achieving better or similar accuracy performances.}},

Abstract = {{In medical image analysis, registration of multimodal images has been
   challenging due to the complex intensity relationship between images.
   Classical multi-modal registration approaches evaluate the degree of the
   alignment by measuring the statistical dependency of the intensity
   values between images to be aligned. Employing statistical similarity
   measures, such as mutual information, is not promising in those cases
   with complex and spatially dependent intensity relations.
   A new similarity measure is proposed based on the assessing the
   similarity of pixels within an image, based on the idea that similar
   structures in an image are more probable to undergo similar intensity
   transformations. The most significant pixel similarity values are
   considered to transmit the most significant self-similarity information.
   The proposed method is employed in a framework to register different
   modalities of real brain scans and the performance of the method is
   compared to the conventional multi-modal registration approach.
   Quantitative evaluation of the method demonstrates the better
   registration accuracy in both rigid and non-rigid deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance (MR) images of higher quality is demanded for helping
   with more accurate and earlier diagnosis of different diseases. The
   overall quality of MR images is limited due to the existence of
   different degradation factors such as (1) MR aberrations due to
   intrinsic properties of the MR scanner, (2) magnetic field
   inhomogeneity, and (3) inherent MRI noise. Correcting each MRI
   degradation factor could be solely useful for the quality enhancement of
   MR imaging with a limited impact. Here, we propose a unified Bayesian
   based compensated MR imaging (CMRI) system which jointly corrects for
   the different aforementioned MR aberrations as well as MR noise and
   hence generates compensated MR (CMR) images with a higher quality.
   Testing the proposed CMRI system on both MR physical phantom as well as
   diffusion weighted and T2 weighted MR imaging data resulted in producing
   MR images with an overall higher quality that better represents
   different structures of tissue. The quantitative performance analysis
   shows a higher Signal to Noise (SNR) and Contrast to Noise (CNR) ratios
   as well as less Coefficient of Variation (CV) for reconstructed images
   using the proposed CMRI system compared to the Blind Deconvolution
   Compensation (BDC) method as state-of-the-art. As such, the proposed
   CMRI system has potential in improving MR image quality, which is
   important for accurate and consistent clinical interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of balance is prevalent in older adults and populations with gait
   and balance impairments. The present paper aims to develop a method to
   automatically distinguish compensatory balance responses (CBRs) from
   normal gait, based on activity patterns of muscles involved in
   maintaining balance. In this study, subjects were perturbed by lateral
   pushes while walking and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were
   recorded from four muscles in their right leg. To extract sEMG time
   domain features, several filtering characteristics and segmentation
   approaches are examined. The performance of three classification
   methods, i.e., k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, and random
   forests, were investigated for accurate detection of CBRs. Our results
   show that features extracted in the 50-200Hz band, segmented using peak
   sEMG amplitudes, and a random forest classifier detected CBRs with an
   accuracy of 92.35\%. Moreover, our results support the important role of
   biceps femoris and rectus femoris muscles in stabilization and
   consequently discerning CBRs. This study contributes towards the
   development of wearable sensor systems to accurately and reliably
   monitor gait and balance control behavior in at-home settings

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer and third leading
   cause of cancer death in Canadian men. Multi-parametric magnetic
   resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become a powerful non-invasive diagnostic
   tool for the detection of prostate cancer. Among mpMRI imaging
   modalities, diffusion-weighed imaging has shown the most promising
   results in accurate detection of prostate cancer. Introduced recently,
   correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) is a new form of diffusion imaging
   which accounts for the joint correlation of diffusion signal attenuation
   across multiple gradient pulse strengths and timings to improve the
   separability of cancerous and healthy tissues. Dual-stage CDI (D-CDI) is
   a newer generation of CDI where in contrast to CDI that does not capture
   anatomical information, an additional signal mixing stage between the
   correlated diffusion signal from the first signal mixing stage (CDI) and
   an auxiliary diffusion signal is performed to incorporate anatomical
   context. The core of D-CDI is a signal mixing algorithm that combines
   diffusion images at different b values to construct a single image. In
   this paper, we enhance the signal mixing algorithm to optimize the
   contribution of each single b-value image to maximize the separability
   of cancerous and healthy tissues. We evaluated the enhanced D-CDI
   (eD-CDI) using area under the ROC curve for datasets of 17 patient cases
   with confirmed prostate cancer and the results show that eD-CDI
   outperforms the original D-CDI as well as T2 weighted images and
   diffusion-weighed images used in the form of apparent diffusion
   coefficient maps.}},

Abstract = {{To enable automatic analysis of athletic movement, the first task is to
   recognize the athletic movements to be analyzed from a continuous motion
   data stream. Automated detection of athletic movement and the isolation
   of the recruited body parts would enable the analysis of sporting
   movements for improving sports performance and preventing possible
   injuries. In this paper, an unsupervised method for detecting and
   isolating athletic movements is proposed. Given motion capture data, the
   method automatically identifies when athletic movements are being
   performed and the body parts involved using the concepts of the
   manipulability and kinematic dimensionality reduction. Experiments
   demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to detect and isolate
   athletic movements from a variety of motion data.}},

Abstract = {{The primal-dual or saddle-point gradient algorithm has recently
   attracted interest as a systematic technique for solving distributed
   optimization problems. To examine the robustness of the algorithm, here
   we introduce exogenous disturbance inputs and quantify the performance
   of the algorithm in terms of the induced L-2-gain from the disturbance
   to deviations around the optimizer. For convex problems without
   inequality constraints, we find that the L-2-gain from a disturbance to
   the deviation of the primal state from the optimizer depends only on how
   strongly convex the agent objective functions are, and not on the
   equality constraints or on algorithm time constants. For primal-dual
   laws derived from an augmented Lagrangian, we show that the L-2-gain is
   a non-increasing function of the augmentation parameters, and therefore
   that augmentation may be beneficial for improving input/output
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal frequency controllers for power networks based on distributed
   averaging have previously been shown to be an effective means of
   distributing control authority among agents while maintaining a globally
   optimal operating point. Distributed control architectures however
   require an implicit trust between participating agents, in that each
   must faithfully communicate the appropriate control variables to
   neighboring agents. Here we study the case where some agents attempt to
   ``cheat the system{''} by adding a bias to the averaging controller in
   order to lower their generation cost. We quantify the effect of this
   dishonesty on the resource allocation problem and introduce a ``cost
   graph{''} whose weights measure the effect of the bias on the optimal
   equilibrium. Moreover, we propose an ``honesty-enforcing{''} controller
   which counteracts the dishonest agents, and restores the optimal
   setpoint of the network.}},

Abstract = {{Primal-dual gradient methods have recently attracted interest as a set
   of systematic techniques for distributed and online optimization. One of
   the proposed applications has been optimal frequency regulation in power
   systems, where the primal-dual algorithm is implemented online as a
   dynamic controller. In this context however, the presence of external
   disturbances makes quantifying input/output performance important. Here
   we use the H-2 system norm to quantify how effectively these distributed
   algorithms reject external disturbances. For the linear primal-dual
   algorithms arising from quadratic programs, we provide an explicit
   expression for the H-2 norm, and examine the performance gain achieved
   by augmenting the Lagrangian. Our results suggest that the primal-dual
   method may perform poorly when applied to large-scale systems, and that
   Lagrangian augmentation can partially (or completely) alleviate these
   scaling issues. We illustrate our results with an application to power
   system frequency control by means of distributed primal-dual
   controllers.}},

   showing that it can be written as the difference between the mean
   voltage levels on either side of the chosen cut, plus an accompanying
   error term. We then show that this error vanishes under a simple graph
   theoretic condition on the weighted degrees of nodes adjacent to the
   cutset. In this case, the model-based cutset voltage can be computed in
   a model-free manner by taking wide-area voltage measurements and
   averaging. We extend our results to the case of a voltage defined across

Title = {{Sparse Reconstruction of Compressive Sensing Multi-Spectral Data Using
   an Inter-Spectral Multi-Layered Conditional Random Field Model}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The broadband spectrum contains significantly more information than what
   the human eye can detect, with different wavelengths providing unique
   information about the intrinsic properties of an object. Recently,
   compressive sensing-based strategies for multi-spectral imaging via
   wavelength filtering at the pixel level on the imaging detector have
   been proposed for simultaneous acquisition of multi-spectral imaging
   data greatly reducing the acquisition times. To utilize such compressive
   sensing strategies for multi spectral imaging, strong reconstruction
   algorithms that can reconstruct dense multi-spectral image cubes from
   the sparse compressively sensed observations are required. This paper
   proposes a comprehensive inter spectral multi-layered conditional random
   field (IS-MCRF) sparse reconstruction framework for multi spectral
   compressively sensed data captured using such acquisition strategies.
   The IS-MCRF framework leverages the information between neighboring
   spectral bands to better utilize the available information for
   reconstruction. The proposed framework was evaluated using compressively
   sensed multi-spectral acquisitions ranging from visible to near infrared
   spectral bands obtained by a simulated compressive sensing-based
   multi-spectral imaging system. Results show noticeable improvement over
   the existing sparse reconstruction techniques for compressive
   sensing-based multi-spectral imaging systems in preserving spatial and
   spectral fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to study the impact of seven different
   window systems on overall energy consumption of educational buildings.
   In particular, four of the windows are non-traditional liquid crystal
   base, namely 1) Tunable, 2) Broadband Type 1, 3) Broadband Type 2, and
   4) Broadband Type 3. For the purpose of simulation, a LEED Gold
   certified building located at a major university in the U. S. was
   modeled, benchmarked, and calibrated. Then several scenarios according
   to window choices haven been tested, both in actual and different
   climate zones. The results show, Broadband Type 2 and Type 3 can make a
   significant impact in reducing building energy consumption. Their
   contribution is higher for projects located in hotter climates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the architecture of a hybrid adder based on the
   combination of the carry-lookahead and carry-select adder architectures.
   A 16-bit adder is designed as a case study to show the efficiency of the
   proposed architecture. This adder is implemented in a 0.18 mu m CMOS
   technology using domino logic for most of the sub-circuits. The
   simulation results show that the 16-bit hybrid adder achieves a
   worst-case delay of 876.7 ps and has an average power consumption of
   787.2 mu W at 125 degrees C for a throughput of 100 Mega operations per
   second in the slow-slow corner. The paper also demonstrates the
   efficiency of this architecture for higher number of bits.}},

   independently in determining the state of lithiation of graphite within
   a lithium ion battery, which can be used in a state of charge estimation

Abstract = {{Computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms have been proposed for
   auto-detection of different types of cancer. CAD algorithms rely on
   machine learning methods to classify regions of interest in images into
   cancerous and healthy regions. In cancer screening, the foremost problem
   to solve is whether a patient has cancer, regardless of the location of
   cancerous regions in the organ. This allows early detection of the
   disease leading to a right course of action in terms of treatment to be
   taken. In machine learning, this problem has been formulated as
   multi-instance learning (MIL) where bags of instances are classified
   rather than the individual instances. In this paper, we propose a bag of
   bags (BoB) nested MIL algorithm where high-level bags (or parent bags),
   each contains multiple smaller bags of instances. We applied the
   proposed BoB MIL algorithm to prostate cancer detection problem using
   magnetic resonance imaging data to first detect which patients have
   cancer and consequently, to detect which slices in the 3D volume imaging
   data of the detected patients contain cancerous regions. Experimental
   results obtained from the imaging data of 30 patients with ground-truth
   data based on biopsy results show that the proposed algorithm is not
   only capable of detecting prostate cancer at patient level, it is also
   able to detect the cancerous regions at slice level of imaging data with
   high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Due to physical isolation as well as use of proprietary hardware and
   protocols, traditional real-time systems (RTS) were considered to be
   invulnerable to security breaches and external attacks. This assumption
   is being challenged by recent attacks that highlight vulnerabilities in
   RTS. Besides, a straightforward integration of security mechanisms might
   compromise the safety and predictability guarantees of such systems. In
   this paper, we focus on integrating security mechanisms into RTS
   (especially legacy RTS) and define a metric to measure the effectiveness
   of such integration. We combine opportunistic execution with
   hierarchical scheduling to maintain compatibility with legacy systems
   while still providing flexibility. The proposed approach is shown to
   increase the security posture of RTS without impacting their temporal
   (and hence, safety) constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Software product lines are now an established framework for software
   design. They are specified by special diagrams called feature models.
   For formal analysis, the latter are usually encoded by Boolean
   propositional theories. We discuss a major deficiency of this semantics,
   and show that it can be fixed by considering a product to be an
   instantiation process rather than its final result. We call intermediate
   states of this process partial products, and argue that what a feature
   model really defines is a poset of its partial products. We argue that
   such structures can be viewed as special Kripke structure that we call
   partial product Kripke structures, ppKS. To specify these Kripke
   structures, we propose a CTL-based logic, called partial product CTL,
   ppCTL. We show how to represent a feature model M by a ppCTL theory M L
   (M) (M L stands for modal logic) such that any ppKS satisfying the
   theory is equal to the partial product line determined by M. Hence, M L
   ( M) can be considered a sound and complete representation of M. We also
   discuss several applications of the modal logic view in feature
   modeling, including refactoring of feature models.}},

Abstract = {{We study derivation of distributed control laws for the cohesive motion
   problem of multi-agent systems. In the literature, stability analysis of
   the established control laws for this objective are heavily dependent on
   the number of the agents and are left incomplete. We convert the
   original problem setup to an equivalent linear state regulation problem.
   We define the inter-agent relative position variables as system states
   and derive a linear system dynamics. State regulation of the system
   corresponds to solving the cohesive motion objective. Further, we design
   a distributed control law to regulate the system states, which
   eventually corresponds to an easy-to-implement, proportional control law
   for each agent. Finally, we derive a sufficient condition on the agent
   speed bounds for distance maintenance in minimally persistent
   formations.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in wearable technologies have led to the development of
   new modalities for human-machine interaction such as gesture-based
   interaction via surface electromyograph (EMG). An important challenge
   when performing EMG gesture recognition is to temporally segment the
   individual gestures from continuously recorded time-series data. This
   paper proposes an approach for EMG data segmentation, by formulating the
   segmentation problem as a classification task, where a classifier is
   used to label each data point as either a segment point or a non-segment
   point. The proposed EMG segmentation approach is used to recognize 9
   hand gestures from forearm EMG data of 10 participants and a balanced
   accuracy of 83\% is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a class of distributed sub-modular maximization
   problems in which each agent must choose a single strategy from its
   strategy set. The objective is to maximize a submodular function of the
   strategies chosen by each agent. However, each agent has only partial
   information on the choices of other agents when making its decision. The
   main objective of this paper is to investigate how the limitation of
   information about the strategy sets or actions of other agents affects
   the performance when agents make choices according to a local greedy
   algorithm. In particular, we provide lower bounds on the performance of
   greedy algorithms for submodular maximization, which depend on the
   clique number of the graph. We also characterize graph-theoretic upper
   bounds in terms of the chromatic number of the graph. Finally, we
   demonstrate how certain graph properties limit the performance of the
   greedy algorithm.}},

   in which the time-variation is non-existent or slow, with results
   pertaining to systems with rapid time-variations limitted to those in
   which the time-variation is of a known form or for which the plant has
   stable zero dynamics. Here we propose a new adaptive controller design
   based on the related area of gain scheduling. We consider the case in
   which the plant uncertainty is limitted to a scalar variable; under
   suitable assumptions on the plant under consideration, it is proven that
   the controller yields a closed loop system which is stable under fast

Abstract = {{This paper investigates transient performance of inverter-based
   microgrids in terms of the resistive power losses incurred in regulating
   frequency under persistent stochastic disturbances. We model the
   inverters as second-order oscillators and compare two algorithms for
   frequency regulation: the standard frequency droop controller and a
   distributed proportional-integral (PI) controller. The transient power
   losses can be quantified using an input-output H-2 norm. We show that
   the distributed PI-controller, which has previously been proposed for
   secondary frequency control (the elimination of static errors), also has
   the potential to significantly improve performance by reducing transient
   power losses. This loss reduction is shown to be larger in a loosely
   interconnected network than in a highly interconnected one, whereas
   losses do not depend on connectivity if standard droop control is
   employed. Moreover, our results indicate that there is an optimal tuning
   of the distributed PI-controller for loss reduction. Overall, our
   results provide an additional argument in favor of distributed
   algorithms for secondary frequency control in microgrids.}},

Abstract = {{A networked controlled system (NCS) in which the plant communicates to
   the controller over a channel with random delay loss is considered. The
   channel model is motivated by recent development of tree codes for NCS,
   which effectively translates an erasure channel to one with random
   delay. A causal transform coding scheme is presented which exploits the
   plant state memory for efficient communications (compression) and
   provides robustness to channel delay loss. In this setting, we analyze
   the performance of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) closed-loop systems
   and the design of the optimal controller. The design of the transform
   code for LQG systems is posed as a channel optimized source coding
   problem of minimizing a weighted mean squared error over the channel.
   The solution is characterized in two steps of obtaining the optimized
   causal encoding and decoding transforms and rate allocation across a set
   of transform coding quantizers. Numerical and simulation results for
   Gauss-Markov sources and an LQG system demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed schemes.}},

   environments where intruders use the information about a patrolling path
   to increase chances of successful attacks. We use Markov chains to
   design randomized patrolling paths on graphs. We present four different
   intruder models, each of which use information about the patrolling path
   in a different manner. We characterize the expected rewards for those
   intruder models as a function of the Markov chain that is being used for
   patrolling. We show that minimizing the reward functions is a non-convex
   optimization problem. We propose a pattern search based algorithm to
   determine a locally optimal patrolling strategy. We also show that for a
   certain type of intruder, a deterministic patrolling policy given by an
   orienteering tour of the graph is the optimal patrolling strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a modified version of multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
   sliding mode control technique is applied to reduce the total
   hydrocarbon emissions of an automotive engine during the coldstart
   period. This specific control design technique is suitable for MIMO
   systems with constraints on their input signals and it allows finding a
   set of upper limits for the gains of sliding mode controller (SMC) with
   regard to the given input constraints. In this context, an optimization
   problem is formulated to calculate the upper bounds of SMC gains to
   ensure the feasibility of the calculated control commands for the
   considered coldstart control problem. Through simulations, it is
   indicated that the devised SMC can properly track the given exhaust gas
   temperature (T-exh) and engine-out hydrocarbon emission (HCraw-c)
   desired profiles in the presence of external disturbances without
   violating the existing engine system input constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of active learning (AL) methods for improving the marine

   classifier. As many as 56 commonly used features are used for the
   classification. The AUC measures are estimated using the 6-fold cross
   validation technique to achieve bias-reduced evaluation of performance
   of the AL-based classifiers. The experiment results show that 22 to 74
   percent of samples could be reduced for training SVM classifiers with
   certain destination performance, if the proper AL method such as AL-6 is

   Specifically, a larger switching gain should be adopted in order to

   suppress the chattering. In addition, an improved boundary layer method
   is applied such that the chattering can be further eliminated. Both of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modeling methodology able to determine the

   Firstly, theoretical analysis is performed to illustrate the

   electrode voltages. Then finite element method and mathematical
   preprocessing are conducted to obtain the analytical expression of the
   electric potential. Consequently, the corresponding analytical
   representations for conventional dielectrophoretic force,
   travelling-wave dielectrophoretic force and electroratation torque with
   respect to the applied electrode voltages are obtained and the developed
   analytical models lead to a nonlinear nonaffine micromanipulation
   system. Numerical simulations are conducted by finite element method

   Finally, A dynamic feedback control is proposed for stable motion
   control of a microparticle in such a system. Simulation results

Abstract = {{The increasing complexity and connectivity of modern embedded systems
   highlight the importance of runtime monitoring to ensure correctness and
   security. This poses a significant challenge, since monitoring tools can
   break extra-functional requirements such as timing constraints.
   Non-intrusive program tracing through side-channel analysis techniques
   have recently appeared in the literature and constitute a promising
   approach. Existing techniques, however, exhibit important limitations.
   In this paper, we present a novel technique for non-intrusive program
   tracing from power consumption, based on a signals and system analysis
   approach: we view the power consumption signal as the output of a system
   with the power consumption of training samples as input. Using spectral
   analysis, we compute the impulse response to identify the system; the
   intuition is that for the correct training sample, the system will
   appear close to a system that outputs a shifted copy of the input
   signal, for which the impulse response is an impulse at the position
   corresponding to the shift. We also use the Control Flow Graph (CFG)
   from the source code to constrain the classifier to valid sequences
   only, leading to substantial performance improvements over previous
   works.
   Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our technique and show
   its applicability to runtime monitoring. The experiments include tracing
   programs that execute randomly generated sequences of functions as well
   as tracing a real application developed with SCADE. The experimental
   evaluation also includes a case-study as evidence of the usability of
   our technique to detect anomalous execution through runtime monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the impact of random interactions between
   agents in a social network on the diffusion of opinions in the network.
   Opinion of each agent is assumed to be a binary variable and each agent
   is assumed to be able to interact with any other agent in the network.
   This models scenarios where every agent in the network has to choose
   from two available options and the size of the neighborhood of each
   agent is an increasing function of the total number agents in the
   network. It is assumed that each agent updates its opinion at random
   instants upon interacting with other randomly sampled agents. We
   consider two simple rules of interaction: (1) the voter rule in which
   the updating agent simply copies the opinion of another randomly sampled
   agent; (2) the majority rule, in which the updating agent samples
   multiple agents and adopts the majority opinion among the sampled agents
   and the agent itself. Under each rule, we consider two different
   scenarios which have not been considered in the literature thus far: (1)
   where the agents are `biased' towards one of the opinions, (2) where
   different agents have different degrees of stubbornness. We show that
   the presence of biased agents reduces the consensus time for the voter
   rule exponentially as compared to the case where the agents are
   unbiased. For the majority rule model with biased agents, we show that
   the network reaches consensus on a particular opinion with high
   probability only when the initial fraction of agents having that opinion
   is above a certain threshold. For the majority rule model with stubborn
   agents, we observe metastability where the network switches back and
   forth between stable states spending long intervals in each state.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the possibility of travelling wave amplification in
   graphene at the TIlz range of frequency is explored using a quantum
   mechanical model. Graphene as a zero overlap semi-metal can be easily
   doped electrically. Due to high mobility of electrons and holes in
   graphene, high drift velocities can be induced by applying a DC voltage
   across the graphene sheet. In this paper, the interaction between the EM
   wave and carriers in graphene is analysed. The linear response theory is
   applied to find the induced current and conductivity in the presence of
   an incident electromagnetic wave. The results show that the negative
   conductivity and in turn electromagnetic amplification in microwave and
   THz frequencies can be obtained for drift velocities slightly greater
   than the phase velocity at room temperature. With this property,
   graphene can be used in future solid state travelling wave amplifiers
   instead of its semiconductor counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents several new control methods different from the
   classical PID control and modern control theory. Those control methods
   are simple without using the state equation of system and internal model
   principle, but its tracking performance is even better. Among those new
   controls, The ST-ER control and ST-ER-DE control are designed to control
   different kinds of precise linear systems to yield high tracking speed
   and low overshoot. GAST-ER control and GAST-ER-DE control respectively,
   base on ST-ER control and STER-DE control are robust control methods
   which can track different kinds linear systems or approach linear
   systems with high tracking speed and almost no overshoot even when there
   is little or no information available regarding plant dynamics. In this
   paper, some simulation examples are given to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of those controls. Besides, The GAST-ER-DE control is
   applied to the micromirror plant without knowing its model and the
   experiment results are successful. With the new outlook and
   possibilities that GAST-ER control and GAST-ER-DE control will promote a
   revolution in controlling field and break the hold of classical PID and
   enter a new era for its simplicity and high efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we try to draw attention to a particular type of force
   that has been somehow overlooked in the control of mechanical
   manipulators: gyroscopic force. At first, we broaden our understanding
   of gyroscopic effect intrinsic in mechanical systems by reformulating
   the EulerLagrange (EL) equation in terms of a gyroscopic part and the
   non-gyroscopic ones (or Rayleigh type). Then, we propose the use of
   artificial gyroscopic force to assist existing control laws. As a force
   that does not do any work, the gyroscopic force can be effectively used
   in combination with many existing control laws for mechanical systems
   without affecting their salient features such as the stability or the
   convergence to a target point. As a specific example, we look into the
   potential energy shaping parameterized by taskspace variables (also
   known as the Jacobian transpose method) as a base control law, and
   combine it with an artificial gyroscopic forcing term. We propose one
   specific way to design the gyroscopic force as a term quadratic in
   velocity that operates in reference to a desired velocity field shape
   (also parameterized in taskspace). The resulting control strategy
   enables us to shape the intermediate path profiles and thus realizes a
   taskspace control law that is free from any inverse transformations. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using simulation results
   with a three-link planar manipulator.}},

   mechanism using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention, then determines the
   calibration parameters which allow for the estimation of the time
   varying extrinsic transformations between camera frames. We validate our
   calibration approach using a dynamic camera cluster consisting of a
   static camera and a camera mounted to a pan-tilt unit, and demonstrate
   that the dynamic camera cluster can provide accurate tracking when used

Abstract = {{The limited battery capacity of Electric vehicles (EVs), and
   consequently limited cruising range, hinders their widespread adoption.
   This paper proposes a solution to the problem of optimal energy/time
   routing under battery constraints. A multi-criteria path-finding
   algorithm, A({*}), is proposed to function in two modes. The first is an
   energy mode to solve the problem of energy-optimal routing under battery
   constraints. This mode computes the most energy-efficient route from a
   source to a destination, thus extending the cruising range of the
   battery. The second is a travel-time mode to compute the time-optimal
   route under the battery constraints. The multi-criteria model aims to
   use the modes to strike a balance between energy consumption and travel
   time, so as to satisfy the user constraints and needs. This research
   reports simulation work conducted to test and validate the proposed
   model under various driving conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The limited cruising range of Electric vehicles (EVs) and the lack of
   recharging stations have contributed to what is viewed by potential
   adopters as range anxiety-contributing to a reserved attitude towards
   EVs. Within the context of this paper, range anxiety is defined as the
   concern of the vehicle operator that the EV is running out of energy.
   Thus, there is a critical need that the vehicle path is planned such
   that the operator is assured of access to energy recharging and such
   that the EV must possess a path rejection capability to prevent the
   potential of an out-of-energy state in-between recharging stations. This
   paper addresses this issue and proposes a technique to minimize range
   anxiety. This technique analyzes the battery capacity the EV needs to
   reach a charging station so that drivers are guaranteed not to be
   stranded. It also computes a robust estimate of driving range on a
   specific path. The paper reports simulation work conducted to test and
   validate the proposed techniques under various driving conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a hybrid predictive tool is developed to model the main
   properties of Hydroxyapatite Dicalcium Phosphate Anhydrous (HA/DCPA)
   scaffold. Since this biodegradable scaffold is widely used as a bone
   substitute material, it is mandatory to develop an identification model
   which can give some useful information about its pivotal
   characteristics. To this aim, two main steps are made. Firstly, the
   effect of HA/DCPA weight ratio on its compression strength, elastic
   modulus, calcium dilution, density, porosity and weight change are
   investigated through experiments. Thereafter, the proposed tool which
   integrates an Aggregated Neural Network (ANN) and a well-known
   optimisation method called Multi-objective Lamarckian Immune Algorithm
   (MLIA) is used to find a robust model. To elaborate on the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach, some well-known identification systems such as
   Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
   System (ANFIS) and Composite Neuro Particle Swarm Algorithm (CNPSA) are
   used. The results indicate that the method is strongly capable of
   modelling all the properties of HA/DCPA simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{The transition of space missions concepts from an all-in-the-clear

   the definition of cryptoperiods that are tailored to the space context.
   Approaches used on the ground very often cannot be directly applied to
   the space segment. Some previous works investigate some aspects of key
   management. This work addresses the problem of defining cryptoperiods
   for authentication mechanisms by revisiting and refining some previous
   approaches. A detailed methodology is devised for a broad range of space
   mission's concepts and attack scenarios, which allows for the definition
   of cryptoperiods for TC and TM, for both LEO and GEO missions. The
   results reported in this paper are crucial to precisely define
   authentication cryptoperiods for the space segment and consequently

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a promising step toward
   reaching a fully green passenger vehicle with large pre-chargeable
   batteries which offer a very good fuel economy. Many researchers are now
   focussing on making vehicles safer and more efficient by improving
   vehicles' interaction with their environment and assisting drivers to
   make better decisions with less errors. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
   systems are a way to connect vehicles to the most important part of
   their environment which is the surrounding traffic. It has been shown
   that using the data from preceding traffic by ACC systems can
   significantly improve the driving performance. This study presents an
   ecological ACC (Eco-ACC) system that takes advantage of a radar and
   traffic light-to-vehicle communications (TL2VC) to predict the future
   trajectory of its preceding vehicle and employs this information to
   drive the vehicle with an ecological driving pattern. The problem is
   formulated as an optimal control problem and the model predictive
   control (MPC) method is used to solve it. The proposed Eco-ACC is
   evaluated using a high-fidelity Toyota Prius PHEV model, which shows
   about 17\% improvement in the energy cost compared to a regular
   car-following ACC.}},

Abstract = {{A Knowledge Management System (KMS) refers to a system for managing
   knowledge in organizations, supporting creation, capture, storage and
   dissemination of information. KMS is viewed as an essential tool to
   extract tacit knowledge from data, convert it to explicit knowledge and
   preserve the same for future utilization. The system involves creation
   of a knowledge repository using the extracted knowledge and
   disseminating it in the form of query response systems. In this work, we
   have proposed the architecture for an administrator-centric KMS which
   revolves around the concept of Knowledge Administrator (KA) with a
   Knowledge Worker (KW) standard. KA is responsible for maintenance as
   well as security and efficiency of the framework which are essential for
   a reliable KMS. In this system, the Knowledge Worker (KW) structure is
   hierarchical which provides scope for building a knowledge repository
   which is often encountered to be critical in some of its applications.
   The Knowledge Base (KB) is built on tag extraction based on inverted
   indexing. The system was a learning automation which used the available
   client feedback in response to the query answered from the knowledge
   base. The knowledge repository interacted with data using a framework
   created based on inverted indexing. A salient feature of the
   architecture is the notion of Probabilistic Optimum Performance (POP)
   factor used for rating KWs. The rating which is determined by past
   performance and client feedback acts as a driving force for a more
   comprehensive KB as its interaction with its environment increases.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the use of new actuation methods in capacitive
   shunt micro switches. We formulate the coupled electromechanical problem
   by taking into account the fringing effects and nonlinearities due to
   mid-plane stretching. Static analysis is undertaken using the
   Differential Quadrature Method (DQM) to obtain the pull in voltage which
   is verified by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM). Based on
   Galerkin approximation, a single degree of freedom dynamic model is
   developed and limit-cycle solutions are calculated using the Finite
   Difference Method (FDM). In addition to the harmonic waveform signal, we
   apply novel actuation waveform signals to simulate the
   frequency-response. We show that, biased signals, using a square wave
   signal reduces significantly the pull-in voltage compared to the
   triangular and harmonic signal. Finally, these results are validated
   experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{When there is a two to one internal resonance ratio between the natural
   frequencies of the pitch motion and the roll motion of a ship, a
   nonlinear energy transfer occurs between the modes. If the ship is
   excited near the pitch natural frequency and at a large enough
   excitation amplitude, the pitch mode transfers energy to the roll mode.
   We use this interesting phenomenon to develop a wave power device for
   off-shore purposes. In this paper, we experimentally show that we can
   use a horizontal pendulum and use the quadratic nonlinear coupling
   between the pitch and the roll mode to get full rotation of the pendulum
   inside the ship. A rotating pendulum will generate orders of magnitude
   more power than a locally oscillating one when connected to a DC
   generator. This article measures the angle of the pendulum at the pitch
   frequency excitation of the ship to experimentally confirm the expected
   theoretical results on this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to efficiently compute RGB-D scene flow is introduced
   based on matching 3D points from one frame to the next in a hierarchical
   fashion. Most state-of-the-art RGB-D scene flow methods are set in a
   variational framework and formulated as an energy minimization problem.
   While these methods are able to provide high accuracy, they are
   computationally expensive and not robust under larger motions in the
   scene. As well, the RGB-D scene flow datasets presented to date are
   mostly based on qualitative evaluation of real scenes. The main
   contributions of this work are to present a method of efficiently
   computing approximate scene flow and provide an RGB-D scene flow dataset
   with ground truth flow for quantitative evaluation. Quickly determining
   approximate motions in a scene is tremendously useful for any computer
   vision tasks that benefit from motion cues such obstacle avoidance,
   object recognition, action recognition, etc. The proposed method, named
   Hierarchical Spectral Grouping Scene Flow (HSG-SF), uses a simple
   coarse-to-fine voxelization scheme combined with spectral grouping
   methods to provide fast estimates of motion and accommodate for larger
   motions. Experimental results show that HSG-SF can provide reliable
   scene flow estimates at significantly faster runtime speed than current
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{A non-saliency guided watermarking approach is introduced where the
   watermark is embedded in natural images based on three measures, namely,
   non-saliency, heterogeneity and brightness. The three measures aim to
   exploit the main characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) for
   the purpose of embedding watermarks in images. The proposed method has
   the following advantages: 1) increasing the imperceptibility of the
   watermark through modeling HVS, 2) robustness to different attacks
   through embedding the data into non-salient areas with strong features
   and 3) increasing the watermarking capacity of labeling image pixels as
   appropriate or inappropriate candidates by using the continuous
   non-saliency heterogeneity-brightness spectrum as opposed to binary
   labeling schemes as suggested by other methods. A variety of experiments
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing
   state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and imperceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{Global saliency is an important aspect of many computer and robotic
   vision tasks, and with the increased interest in fields such as
   autonomous navigation, a significant area of research. A challenging
   aspect of modelling global saliency in practical applications is the
   presence of varying or non-uniform illumination conditions. Many current
   models fail to accurately detect salient regions in non-uniform
   illumination conditions and often produce different saliency maps for
   the same image under changing illumination. In this paper, we propose a
   novel model for illumination robust global saliency. For a given input
   image, texture-illumination guided energy responses (TIGERs) are
   computed at different scales using a novel multi-scale extension of
   TIGER. To acquire these responses, image intensity is modelled as the
   summation of the low frequency illumination component and the high
   frequency texture component. A captured image is disassociated into
   these components via Bayesian minimization, with the required posterior
   probability estimated through an importance-weighted Monte Carlo
   sampling approach. The texture-illumination guided global energy
   response (TIGGER) is computed as the aggregate sum of TIGERs across all
   scales. The global saliency map is obtained via a k-means
   clustering-based region adjacency graph (RAG) model. Experimental
   results produce global saliency maps with improved performance in
   non-uniform lighting conditions and greater consistency when compared to
   other state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks,
   have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference
   between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter
   dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field
   (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series
   of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an
   artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot.
   The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that
   can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper
   focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open
   hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot
   vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision.}},

Abstract = {{Animal Behavioural Monitoring requires near real-time and robust scene
   information. State of art methods to construct a complete RGB-D video of
   a scene are typically slow, or done offline and often both
   computationally and monetarily expensive. In this paper, we present a
   near real-time method called KinectScenes that fuses N RGB-D point
   clouds acquired from statically positioned commodity hardware to
   reconstruct large \& complete dynamic 3D scenes. Specifically, we
   introduce a pipeline that fuses RGB-D sensor data to generate a
   spatio-temporal coherent 3D free viewpoint video with near 360 degrees
   purview - only limited by the number and placement of the sensors.
   KinectScenes differentiates from existing state of art in that 1. It is
   near real-time: 7 similar to 15 fps, and 2. it remains unperturbed to
   minute motion of the static sensors. In addition, we contribute a new
   dataset of RGB-D scenes to the research community as to enable rapid
   progress for behavioral tracking research. Applications include precise
   human and animal behavioral tracking, inexpensive VR scene generation,
   object recognition and interaction. Early results demonstrate that
   KinectScenes is both efficient in near real-time and can densely and
   richly reconstruct a given dynamic scene using 3 sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing penetration rate of Plug-in Electric Vehicles
   (PEVs), the infrastructure planning of PEV fast charging stations is
   under way. Owing to the environmental friendly property of the Renewable
   Energy Source (RES), Photovoltaic (PV)-integrated fast charging stations
   are proposed to facilitate the RES utilization and to minimize the
   station operation cost. However, the intermittent nature of PV adds
   stochastic property into the station operation process, which increases
   the possibility of the Quality of Service (QoS) degradation. In this
   paper, we propose a Markov Chain model to analyze the stochastic process
   of the PV panels utilization. Then, a PV sizing optimization problem is
   formulated to determine the optimal number of PV panels in the station
   by minimizing the station operation cost, while guaranteeing the QoS
   requirement of the station. Finally, we provide a case study to validate
   the feasibility of the PV sizing scheme in terms of the station
   operation cost and QoS.}},

   construct RS-4 polar codes using genie-aided simulations, where the

Abstract = {{Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is regarded as the keystone of
   Internet of things (loT) since it enables ubiquitous data exchange among
   devices without any artificial intervention. Cellular system is expected
   to play a significant role in successfully implementing the M2M
   communications for its ready-to-use infrastructure. However, there still
   exist many challenges, such as co-channel interferences to existing
   mobile users, congestions and limited battery capacity of M2M devices.
   In this paper, in order to realize M2M communication over cellular
   system, we propose a power- and spectrum-efficient
   massive-code-space-multiplex (massive-CSM) access scheme, in which
   quasi-orthogonal massive MIMO channels are utilized as resource blocks
   in the framework of SCMA. In the proposed scheme, group headers gather
   data from M2M devices by D2D links and communicate with eNB.
   Additionally, D2D-link power consumption optimization and transmit
   layers allocation algorithm are provided to minimize power consumption
   of codewords distribution among group headers. By applying random matrix
   theory, we also drive an uplink asymptotic equivalent (AE) of signal to
   interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the system as the number of eNB
   antennas approach infinity. Simulation results show that the proposed
   multiplex access scheme improves the uplink capacity several times than
   traditional scheme and our algorithm achieves better results with less
   time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate mobile user's (MU's) uplink traffic offloading based on
   the new paradigm of small-cell dual connectivity (DC) that allows a MU
   to simultaneously offload traffic to a small-cell base station (sBS) and
   send data to a macro base station (mBS). In spite of the benefit of
   reducing the MU's power consumption, traffic offloading via DC leads to
   a security issue, i.e., a malicious node close to the sBS might
   intentionally eavesdrop the MU's offloaded data by receiving the MU's
   radio signal. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem that
   jointly determines the MU's traffic scheduling and transmit-powers to
   the sBS and mBS, with the objective of minimizing the MU's total power
   consumption, while guaranteeing both the MU's secrecy requirement and
   traffic demand requirement. To solve the formulated joint optimization
   problem, we propose an effective layered-algorithm (which exploits the
   hidden convexity of the problem) to solve it and compute the MU's
   optimal offloading solution. Numerical results validate the efficiency
   of our algorithm and the significant influences of the MU's secrecy
   requirement.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, with the advent of Internet of things, mobile devices are
   expected to carry on more and more computation intensive applications,

   devices, the current single cloud environment will still encounter
   resource depletion, which will lead to application offloading failure
   and user dissatisfaction. In order to enhance the scalability and
   reliability of application offloading service in mobile cloud computing,
   we study the heterogeneous mobile cloud, which integrates mobile
   cloudlet with infrastructure-based cloudlet. In such a scenario, when
   the infrastructure-based cloudlet becomes unavailable due to
   insufficient resource, mobile cloudlet can help to provide computation
   offloading service. We develop a centralized task scheduling algorithm
   to select reliable worker nodes in mobile cloudlet for the offloaded
   tasks. Simulation results show that heterogeneity of cloud resource can
   enhance scalability of offloading service efficiently. Also, the

Abstract = {{Wi-Fi is a cost-effective way to offload the increasing data traffic
   from cellular networks. However, users can only associate to one access
   point (AP) at a time, which limits the offloading performance in
   multiple hotspots scenario. In order to enhance the offloading
   performance and improve the utilization of Wi-Fi capacity as well, we
   propose a terminal-to-terminal (T2T) communication incorporated Wi-Fi
   offloading (Ti-Fi), where two neighboring users can assist each other to
   offload data via T2T communication and their Wi-Fi connections. We
   analyze the proposed Ti-Fi scheme by employing the M/G/1/K queueing
   model and evaluate the offloading performance. We show that the T2T
   communication can improve the Wi-Fi offloading efficiency by up to 21\%
   and reduce the cellular traffic by up to 80\% with very short extra
   delay. The results in this paper provide important guidelines on
   efficiently deploying Wi-Fi networks and choosing T2T pairs to improve

Abstract = {{One of the limitations of carbon nanotube (CNT) field emitter arrays
   (FEA) is the non-uniformity of total emission current contribution from
   each emitter due to geometry variation among CNT field emitters. We
   previously used a ballast resistor to ballast each emitter's current
   contribution to improve the reliability and stability of our CNT field
   emission (FE) cathode with coaxial gate. However, this approach has two
   main disadvantages: reduced FE current and enlarged power dissipation.
   In this paper, we improve the ballasting of our CNT FEA with coaxial
   gate using a doped silicon resistor. Each CNT field emitter is in series
   with a doped silicon resistor to avoid over current, based on the
   saturation of drift velocity in doped silicon. The FE current from each
   emitter can be limited at a desired current level based on the doping
   density and size of the doped silicon resistor. Those dominating emitter
   can be protected as gate voltage increases. The proposed approach is
   expected to improve our CNT cathode reliability and stability.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-mode systems work in configurations, but face the challenge of
   ensuring timing guarantees during mode changes. In a multi-mode system,
   a mode-change request occurs when the system wants to operate in a new
   mode, but is already running in one. One mode may include some tasks
   that are same as that of another mode. Therefore, the new mode may have
   tasks that are same as the old mode. Changing modes in such a way to
   skip some already completed tasks can decrease the workload of the new
   mode.
   Traditional protocols for changing modes always look forward in time to
   schedule tasks, although using already completed tasks may avoid
   re-executing them in the new mode. Reusing common tasks reduces the time
   to re-execute them while switching modes. In this paper, we introduce
   the concept and design considerations for a mode-change technique that
   may use completed tasks stored in checkpoints to avoid unnecessary
   re-execution and facilitate faster execution of new mode tasks. Through
   an example case-study, experimental results demonstrate that the
   overhead of using checkpoints is low, and using rollback facilitates
   faster execution of new mode tasks if completed tasks stored in
   checkpoints can be reused.}},

Abstract = {{Crash data for road safety analysis and modeling are growing steadily in
   size and completeness because of the latest advancement in information
   technologies. This increased availability of large data sets has
   generated resurgent interest in applying a data-driven nonparametric
   approach as an alternative to the traditional parametric models for
   crash risk prediction. This paper investigates the question of how the
   relative performance of these two alternative approaches changes as
   crash data grow. Two popular techniques from the two approaches are
   compared: negative binomial models for the parametric approach and
   kernel regression for the nonparametric counterpart. Two large crash
   data sets are used to investigate the performance of these two methods
   as a function of the amount of training data. A rigorous bootstrapping
   validation process shows that the two approaches have strikingly
   different patterns, especially in sensitivity to data size. The kernel
   regression method outperforms the model based approach that is, negative
   binomial for predictive performance, and that performance advantage
   increases noticeably as data available for calibration grow. With the
   arrival of the big data era and the added benefits of enabling automated
   road safety analysis and improved responsiveness to current safety
   issues, nonparametric techniques (especially those of modern machine
   approaches) can be counted as an important tool in road safety studies.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new antenna design paradigm based on the metasurface
   concept. The design concept is based on Huygens principle. A new antenna
   is composed of an ensemble of electrically-small resonators, or
   elements. Unlike conventional array antennas where the distance between
   adjacent antennas is close to lambda/2, here the distance between the
   radiators is electrically very small which requires tuning of the input
   impedance of the elements to maximize power transfer to the antenna. An
   array of 8 x 8 cross resonators arranged on Rogers substrate was
   designed to operate at 3GHz. The new metasurface antenna has the
   advantage of fine tuning the gain through incrementally adding
   additional elements. Most importantly, the antenna can be designed to
   have maximum gain in any practically any direction in the half plane.}},

   the variable characteristics of the wind at a particular site. The most
   commonly used PDFs, along with some advanced PDFs, have been verified
   against the observed wind data based on consideration of two well-known
   goodness of fit statistical tests. A further case study is conducted in
   order to evaluate the impact of sample size on the selection of the
   best-fit PDFs. From a variety of candidate PDFs, the results indicate
   that the Generalized Logistic and Dagum distributions are the PDFs that
   best maintain the main characteristics of the observed wind data.}},

Abstract = {{A current-source inverter-based standalone wind energy conversion system
   has been recently proposed for low power applications. In this paper,
   the system is modified by removing the dump load and avoiding the
   surplus power generation by curtailment of wind power. The
   generator-side converter is used to control the shaft speed, allowing
   extraction of maximum available wind power in normal mode of operation,
   and to regulate DC-link current, allowing curtailment of wind power when
   it is not possible to absorb maximum available power by the storage
   system and the load. In order to verify successful operation of the
   system under a wide range of load types, a reduced-order generic load
   model, that is suitable for both balanced and unbalanced load
   conditions, is developed and tested with the system. The current-source
   inverter is used to control positive-and negative-sequence voltage
   components separately. The operation of the modified system is
   investigated and verified under variable wind and load conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of the ``smart grid{''} has led stakeholders in the power
   industry to promote more efficient technologies to the network.
   Distribution systems are a favorite place to host most of these
   technologies including Renewable-based distributed generation (DG). Wind
   Turbine Generators (WTGs) in particular have proved their usefulness for
   supplying a fair portion of power demand; however, the power output of
   WTGs is mainly dependent on the stochastic nature of the site's wind
   speed in addition to the design parameters of WTGs. Furthermore, WTGs
   can only be suitably utilized when their capacities and locations are
   optimized in such a way to achieve certain goals. In this paper, the
   effect of wind generator design parameters, namely cut-in, cut-out, and
   rated wind speeds, on the problems of sizing and siting WTGs-based DGs
   is addressed. The probabilistic optimization model is used to minimize
   the system's annual energy losses, and the results reveal that the
   design parameters of WTGs must be carefully selected due to their strong
   effect on system losses and DG locations and capacities.}},

Abstract = {{The future smart grid can have an AC/DC hybrid structure that enables
   the integration of AC/DC energy supply and demand, thus permitting the
   formation of AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs). The AC/DC HMG is a
   promising concept that provides the envisioned smart grid with the
   plug-and-play feature. Nevertheless, understanding such hybrid systems,
   especially during islanding, require an accurate and robust load flow
   program. To this end, this paper proposes a novel robust power flow
   algorithm for isolated AC/DC HMGs. The power flow problem is formulated
   as a least-squares minimization problem, and solved using the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The accuracy of the proposed load flow
   algorithm is validated against time domain simulation results, while its
   robustness is demonstrated on a highly-resistive network. The proposed
   load flow algorithm is expected to reveal the light for further studies

Abstract = {{AC/DC hybrid microgrid is a promising architecture that allows for
   hosting energy resources and modern loads from AC and DC types; and in
   turn, it reduces the number of conversion stages among other technical
   and economical benefits. Consequently, power distribution planners
   started to investigate the possibility of hybridizing the existing AC
   grids and designing new AC/DC hybrid clusters referred to as microgrids
   as a step towards the envisioned smart grid with AC/DC technologies and
   ``plug-and-play{''} feature. Nevertheless, while being islanded, AC/DC
   hybrid microgrids bring operational challenges to the system operation
   such as coordination among the distributed resources in both AC/DC
   subgrids, control and management of the power transfer through the
   interlinking converters, droop control of inverter-based distributed
   energy resources, and accurate power sharing. This paper looks closely
   at the problem of active and reactive power sharing in islanded
   droop-based AC/DC hybrid microgrids and proposes a unified power sharing
   scheme that is able to simultaneously ensure precise power sharing in
   both AC and DC subgrids. Test results demonstrate the capability of the
   proposed scheme in achieving exact power sharing not only among the
   energy resources in proportion to their ratings but also among the
   interlinking converters.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles will drive the future, therefore forecasting and
   simulating `transportation electrification' demand over the coming years
   has become important for utilities. Ever since electricity was
   commercialized there has been a need for demand forecasting and
   simulation because electricity provider's ability to produce energy far
   exceeds their ability to store energy. This is an industry worth
   billions of dollars and therefore even a marginal improvement in the way
   it's predicted can have a great impact. Demand forecasting is critical
   for unit commitment and broadly effects the wholesale electricity market
   price. With the addition of transportation electrification this process
   has become even more challenging. Traditional ways are hard to model and
   computationally intensive, nowadays this type of problem is of great
   interest in the field of machine learning as well, because of the
   availability of large datasets from utilities. However datasets for
   transportation electrification still remain a huge challenge therefore
   more work needs to be done in forecasting electric vehicular loads. This
   paper tackles this new problem and presents a new method called Feature
   Fitting Simulation Algorithm to estimate electric vehicle charging
   demand profiles. The simulation was performed on MATLAB and Excel using
   various tools and functions to ensure the algorithms run on optimum
   efficiency. The novel feature of the algorithm is its hybrid structure
   of considering both historical and simulation data for temporal
   predication, secondly it introduces two key variables scaling and
   sensitivity to better control the time series output. FFSA is vetted
   against machine learning algorithms and the results indicate a better
   performance achieved by FFSA.}},

   laboratory specimens were produced by applying different amounts of
   nano-lotus leaf coating on the top of the textured concrete surface. The
   British pendulum test was used to measure the friction number, and an
   impedance tube was used to determine the sound absorption coefficient.
   Laboratory results indicate that nano-lotus leaf coated concrete can
   maintain the required friction property for rigid pavement, but may not

Abstract = {{False data injection (FDI) attack is one of the severe attacks that
   threatens the smart grid's efficiency and reliability. Power grid's
   status is monitored by many measurement units spread all over the grid;
   these units periodically send their measurements to the grid's control
   center (CC), which utilizes them to make the right decisions for the
   grid. FDI attack inserts fake measurements among the correct ones to
   mislead CC to make wrong decisions and consequently impact on the grid's
   performance. Several works are proposed to only detect FDI attack
   utilizing various estimation tests and optimization techniques. In our
   paper, we propose an FDI attack prevention technique that is based on
   protecting the integrity of the measurements at measurement units and
   during their transmission to the CC, even with the presence of
   compromised units. So, the proposed scheme alleviates the negative
   impacts of FDI attack on grid's performance. Security analysis and
   performance evaluation show that our scheme guarantees the integrity and
   availability of the measurements with lightweight overhead, especially
   on the restricted-capabilities measurement units.}},

Abstract = {{Smart meters are integral to power dispatch in the emerging smart grid,
   by periodically collecting and reporting the electricity consumption of
   users to the control center to satisfy practical requirements. However,
   the real-time electricity measurements of individual households may
   contain plenty of users' privacy, e.g., activities and habits. To resist
   the privacy exposure from the individual measurements, we propose an
   Efficient Data AggregaTion (EDAT) scheme, in which every smart meter in
   the residential area uses a random noise to protect the concrete reading
   from being exposed to the attackers and the local gateway aggregates the
   individual measurements into a compact report before forwarding to the
   control center. In EDAT scheme, we remove the trusted third party and
   allow the smart meters to negotiate and generate the sum of the noise
   using polynomials, by which the control center can recover the power
   consumption of a residential area, other than a specific household. The
   security of the EDAT scheme can be reduced to the Decisional
   Diffie-Hellman assumption, and both the computational and communication
   overhead of each smart meter are small.}},

Abstract = {{Carpooling, as an effective and eco-friendly travel mode, becomes a kind
   of public spontaneous behavior with multiple travellers sharing a
   vehicle to reduce individuals' travel cost, carbon emissions and traffic
   congestion. Although ubiquitous network access offers great convenience
   for travellers to find carpools, the safety becomes a big obstacle for
   them to accept this emerging travel mode. To address the safety concern,
   it seems inevitable to sacrifice the identity privacy for both drivers
   and passengers. In this paper, we propose an Anonymous Mutual
   Authentication (AMA) protocol to solve the contradiction between safety
   and privacy preservation by utilizing the BBS+ signature. In AMA, the
   passenger and the driver can mutually authenticate the identities
   without exposing their actual identities, but showing their membership
   of a trustable group. The AMA also allows to trace the identity of the
   driver (the passenger) on behalf of a judger if the passenger (the
   driver) complains the misbehavior of the driver (the passenger). The AMA
   is secure and efficient for real applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate how the mobile users (MUs) can effectively
   offload traffic by taking advantage of the capability of
   dual-connectivity, which enables an MU to simultaneously communicate
   with a macro base station (BS) and a small-cell access point (AP) via
   two radio-interfaces. We formulate an optimization problem that jointly
   determines each MU's traffic schedule (between the BS and AP) and power
   allocations (between two radio-interfaces), with the objective to
   minimize all MUs' total cost. We first propose an effective scheme to
   characterize the feasibility of the joint optimization problem. Then, by
   exploiting the layered structure, we propose an efficient layered scheme
   to solve it. Numerical results are provided to validate the proposed
   schemes and show the performance gain via properly offloading MUs'

Abstract = {{The best known achievable rate region for the two-user Gaussian
   interference channel is due to the Han-Kobayashi (HK) scheme. The HK
   achievable region includes the regions achieved by all other known
   schemes. However, mathematical expressions that characterize the HK
   region are complicated and involve a time sharing variable and two
   arbitrary power splitting variables. Accordingly, the boundary points of
   the HK region, and in particular the maximum HK sum-rate, are not known
   in general. This paper studies the sum-rate of the HK scheme with
   Gaussian inputs. For the weak interference class, this study fully
   characterizes the maximum achievable sum-rate and shows that the weak
   interference class is partitioned into five regions. For each region,
   the optimal power splitting and the corresponding maximum achievable
   sum-rate are expressed in closed forms. Moreover, we show that the same
   approach can be adopted to characterize all boundary points.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a two-transmitter two-receiver dual-band Gaussian
   interference channel (GIC) which is motivated by the simultaneous use of
   both the conventional microwave band and the unconventional millimeter
   wave (mm-wave) band in future wireless networks where the traditional
   microwave band is complemented by additional spectrum in the mm-wave
   band. A key modeling feature of the mm-wave band is that due to severe
   path loss and relatively small wavelength, it must be used with highly
   directional antennas, and thus the transmitter is able to transmit to
   its intended receiver with negligible to no interference to other
   receivers. For this model, we derive some sufficient conditions on the
   channel gains under which the capacity of this type of dual-band GIC is
   determined. Specifically, these conditions are classified as when
   microwave band channel gains have (a) weak interference, i.e., both the
   cross channel gains are less than 1 and (b) mixed interference, i.e.,
   only one of the cross channel gains is less than 1, while the channel
   gains in the dual-band GIC satisfy certain additional conditions in each
   case.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional sensitive data disclosure analysis faces two challenges: to
   identify sensitive data that is not generated by specific API calls, and
   to report the potential disclosures when the disclosed data is
   recognized as sensitive only after the sink operations. We address these
   issues by developing BIDTEXT, a novel static technique to detect
   sensitive data disclosures. BIDTEXT formulates the problem as a type
   system, in which variables are typed with the text labels that they
   encounter (e.g., during key-value pair operations). The type system
   features a novel bi-directional propagation technique that propagates
   the variable label sets through forward and backward data-flow. A data
   disclosure is reported if a parameter at a sink point is typed with a
   sensitive text label. BIDTEXT is evaluated on 10,000 Android apps. It
   reports 4,406 apps that have sensitive data disclosures, with 4,263 apps
   having log based disclosures and 1,688 having disclosures due to other
   sinks such as HTTP requests. Existing techniques can only report 64.0\%
   of what BIDTEXT reports. And manual inspection shows that the false
   positive rate for BIDTEXT is 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of Inter-vehicle link duration is an important parameter
   in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), as it is useful for vehicles to
   delay their information transmission if link breakage is anticipated
   before completing the transmission. In addition, it plays a pivotal role
   in routing, as it allows proactive construction of long-life paths, and
   optimizing next hop selection in position-based routing (PBR). However,
   due to the high mobility of vehicles and the complicated vehicular
   mobility patterns in urban areas, the estimation of link duration in
   urban VANETs is still an open research issue. Different from other
   complex link duration estimation methods, we introduce a lightweight
   neural networks (NNs) based mobility prediction scheme which allows
   vehicles to autonomously predict their future mobility speed for a
   certain time window. Then, the expected speed is used in an urban area
   mobility prediction model to estimate link duration between neighbouring
   vehicles. Extensive simulation results are given to demonstrate the
   validity of the proposed methods.}},

   sharing. The simulation results reveal that the unequal reactive power
   sharing in AC microgrids and the inexact active power sharing in DC
   microgrids will migrate to AC/DC hybrid microgrids. The research
   outcomes also show that the interlinking converters encounter the same

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a Microgrid test bed platform. The aim
   of this test bed is to provide a real-time verification and simulation
   tool for islanded Microgrids. The main characteristics are high
   architectural flexibility, high reconfigurability of the simulated
   Microgrid, and low number of inverters required to simulate an islanded
   Microgrid in hardware. The test bed is composed of a number of unified
   inverter modules (simulation modules), each simulating one grid
   participant. Each simulation module consists of a three-phase voltage
   source inverter, a local controller and a real-time emulation of several
   generation plants. This approach allows a wide range of studies in
   Microgrid control and inverter control for Distributed Generation. This
   paper describes the test bed platform and demonstrates an implementation
   with four grid participants.}},

   use in autonomous driving, based on cooperative on-line estimation of
   unknown and time varying road conditions. The autonomous vehicle is
   linearly modelled with constraints dependent on the road condition
   parameter. The proposed model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to
   be adaptive to this parameter. To accommodate this adaptive design, a
   particular method is developed for estimating the road friction
   coefficient cooperatively, by disseminating individual estimates in a
   vehicular network and using a consensus algorithm to converge these
   estimates to the maximum likelihood value. Presented simulation results
   demonstrate that the cooperative consensus scheme improves estimation
   significantly, and accordingly, the adaptive MPC incorporates road
   condition properly in collision avoidance planning.}},

   recently gained interest due to their applications in reducing the
   training and testing time of kernel-based learning algorithms. Current
   random projection methods avoid the curse of dimensionality by embedding
   the nonlinear feature space into a low dimensional Euclidean space to
   create nonlinear kernels. We introduce a Layered Random Projection
   (LaRP) framework, where we model the linear kernels and nonlinearity
   separately for increased training efficiency. The proposed LaRP
   framework was assessed using the MNIST hand-written digits database and
   the COIL-100 object database, and showed notable improvement in object
   classification performance relative to other state-of-the-art random

   proposed. Saliency computation is considered as an optimization problem
   that maximizes the energy of a fully-connected graphical model based on
   spatio-temporal feature distinctiveness. Each pixel in a video is
   modeled by a node, and the spatio-temporal feature distinctiveness
   between pixels by edges connecting the nodes in the graph. The
   computational complexity is addressed by compressing the fully-connected
   graph into an abstracted, fully-connected graph with far fewer nodes,
   where each node in the new graph characterizes nodal groups. The
   saliency value of each pixel is then computed based on spatio-temporal
   feature distinctiveness and the energy representation of its nodal group
   given the constructed graphical model. Experimental results show that
   our approach outperforms existing approaches to spatio-temporal salient

   When a SC is detected, it is designated as an I frame; the quantization
   parameters for this frame and its subsequent frames before the next SC
   are determined. Compared to the default LD configuration, experimental

Abstract = {{With the fast advances in video acquisition, computational imaging, and
   display technologies, there has been a growing interest in high dynamic
   range (HDR) videos. Tone mapping operators (TMOs) that convert HDR
   content to low dynamic range (LDR) ones provide a practically useful
   solution for the visualization of HDR videos on standard LDR displays,
   where the user experience highly depends on the performance of the TMOs
   being used. Without an appropriate perceptual quality measure, different
   TMOs cannot be compared. Subjective experiments may be a reliable
   solution, but is time consuming, expensive, and difficult to be embedded
   into optimization processes. Here we make one of the first attempts to
   develop an objective quality assessment model for tone-mapped videos
   that incorporates structural fidelity, statistical naturalness and
   memory effect. Validation using subject-rated tone-mapped videos show
   that the proposed method is well-correlated with subjective scores.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method, Stochastically Acquired Photoplethysmogram for Heart
   rate Inference in Realistic Environments (SAPPHIRE), is proposed for
   robust remote heart rate measurement through broadband video. A set of
   stochastically sampled points from the cheek region is tracked and used
   to construct corresponding time series observations via skin erythema
   transforms. From these observations, a photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform
   is estimated via Bayesian minimization, with the required posterior
   probability inferred using a Monte Carlo approach. To mitigate the
   effects of noise, the contribution of each observation is weighted based
   on the observation's likelihood to contain relevant data. A bandpass
   filter is applied to the estimated PPG waveform to omit implausible
   heart rate frequencies, and the heart rate is estimated through
   frequency domain analysis. Experimental results acquired from a set of
   thirty videos indicate significantly improved performance in comparison

Abstract = {{Network streaming video services have been growing explosively in the
   past decade, but how to measure and assure the video
   quality-of-experience (QoE) of end consumers is still an open problem.
   Poor presentation quality and playback stalling have been identified as
   the most dominant factors that degrade user QoE. Although both factors
   have been studied individually, little is known about the interactions
   between them. In this work, we first construct a streaming video
   database that contains compressed videos at different distortion levels
   and with different stalling patterns. We then carry out a subjective
   test to evaluate the QoE of the videos. The results reveal some
   interesting dependency between presentation quality and playback
   stalling. Specifically, playback stalling always causes QoE degradation,
   but the strength of such degradation depends on the presentation quality
   when the stalling event occurs.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, advances in medical imaging have led to the emergence
   of massive databases, containing images from a diverse range of
   modalities. This has significantly heightened the need for automated
   annotation of the images on one side, and fast and memory-efficient
   content-based image retrieval systems on the other side. Binary
   descriptors have recently gained more attention as a potential vehicle
   to achieve these goals. One of the recently introduced binary
   descriptors for tagging of medical images are Radon barcodes (RBCs) that
   are driven from Radon transform via local thresholding. Gabor transform
   is also a powerful transform to extract texture-based information. Gabor
   features have exhibited robustness against rotation, scale, and also
   photometric disturbances, such as illumination changes and image noise
   in many applications. This paper introduces Gabor Barcodes (GBCs), as a
   novel framework for the image annotation. To find the most
   discriminative GBC for a given query image, the effects of employing
   Gabor filters with different parameters, i.e., different sets of scales
   and orientations, are investigated, resulting in different barcode
   lengths and retrieval performances. The proposed method has been
   evaluated on the IRMA dataset with 193 classes comprising of 12,677
   x-ray images for indexing, and 1,733 x-rays images for testing. A total
   error score as low as 351 (approximate to 80\% accuracy for the first
   hit) was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In medical image analysis, multi-modal registration has been a
   challenging task due to the complex intensity relationship between
   images to be aligned. Conventional multi-modal approaches tend to assess
   the accuracy of the alignment by measuring a similarity based on
   statistical dependency of the intensity values between images However,
   measuring statistical similarity measures, such as mutual information,
   is not promising, especially in those cases with complex and spatially
   dependent intensity relations.
   A new similarity measure is proposed based on the concept of
   self-similarity, the similarity of patches within an image, motivated by
   the fact that similar structures are more probable to undergo similar
   intensity transformations. The method is applied to the registration
   framework to align simulated and real brain images from different
   modalities and compared to the conventional multi-modal registration
   method. Quantitative evaluation of the method demonstrates that better
   accuracy can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant protein production in E. coli has several advantages over

   of eukaryotic post translational modification are the most disadvantages
   of this system. Exporting of correctly folded proteins to the outside of
   reductive cytoplasmic environment through twin-arginine system could
   help to pass these limiting steps. Two signal sequences, TorA and SufI
   are used at N-terminal of human growth hormone (hGH) bearing DsbA gene
   sequence at C-terminal to enhance folding. The synthetic cassettes
   including the signal sequence, hGH and DsbA were transformed into E.
   coli BL21 (DE3) to study the effect of signal sequence and DsbA
   chaperone on translocation and folding of the protein. The results
   confirmed using signal sequence at N-terminal of targeted protein and
   coexpression with DsbA could transport proteins to the periplasmic space
   and culture media compared to control groups. Although there is no
   protein band of somatropin in SDS-Page of culture media samples when
   using SufI as signaling sequence, the study demonstrated TorA signal
   sequence could transport the target protein to the culture media.
   However, there was a considerable amount of hGH in periplasmic space

Abstract = {{In crowdsourced testing, an important task is to identify the test
   reports that actually reveal fault - true fault, from the large number
   of test reports submitted by crowd workers. Most existing approaches
   towards this problem utilized supervised machine learning techniques,
   which often require users to manually label a large amount of training
   data. Such process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, reducing
   the onerous burden of manual labeling while still being able to achieve
   good performance is crucial. Active learning is one potential technique
   to address this challenge, which aims at training a good classifier with
   as few labeled data as possible. Nevertheless, our observation on real
   industrial data reveals that existing active learning approaches
   generate poor and unstable performances on crowdsourced testing data. We
   analyze the deep reason and find that the dataset has significant local
   biases.
   To address the above problems, we propose LOcal-based Active
   ClassiFication (LOAF) to classify true fault from crowdsourced test
   reports. LOAF recommends a small portion of instances which are most
   informative within local neighborhood, and asks user their labels, then
   learns classifiers based on local neighborhood. Our evaluation on 14,609
   test reports of 34 commercial projects from one of the Chinese largest
   crowdsourced testing platforms shows that our proposed LOAF can generate
   promising results. In addition, its performance is even better than
   existing supervised learning approaches which built on large amounts of
   labelled historical data. Moreover, we also implement our approach and
   evaluate its usefulness using real-world case studies. The feedbacks
   from testers demonstrate its practical value.}},

Abstract = {{To improve software reliability, many rule-based techniques have been
   proposed to infer programming rules and detect violations of these rules
   as bugs. These rule-based approaches often rely on the highly frequent
   appearances of certain patterns in a project to infer rules. It is known
   that if a pattern does not appear frequently enough, rules are not
   learned, thus missing many bugs.
   In this paper, we propose a new approach-Bugram-that leverages n-gram
   language models instead of rules to detect bugs. Bugram models program
   tokens sequentially, using the n-gram language model. Token sequences
   from the program are then assessed according to their probability in the
   learned model, and low probability sequences are marked as potential
   bugs. The assumption is that low probability token sequences in a
   program are unusual, which may indicate bugs, bad practices, or
   unusual/special uses of code of which developers may want to be aware.
   We evaluate Bugram in two ways. First, we apply Bugram on the latest
   versions of 16 open source Java projects. Results show that Bugram
   detects 59 bugs, 42 of which are manually verified as correct, 25 of
   which are true bugs and 17 are code snippets that should be refactored.
   Among the 25 true bugs, 23 cannot be detected by PR-Miner. We have
   reported these bugs to developers, 7 of which have already been
   confirmed by developers ( 4 of them have already been fixed), while the
   rest await confirmation. Second, we further compare Bugram with three
   additional graph-and rule-based bug detection tools, i.e., JADET,
   Tikanga, and GrouMiner. We apply Bugram on 14 Java projects evaluated in
   these three studies. Bugram detects 21 true bugs, at least 10 of which
   cannot be detected by these three tools. Our results suggest that Bugram
   is complementary to existing rule-based bug detection approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of inverter-based distributed generation units (DGs) is highly
   dependent on the ratio of DG impedance to grid impedance. To assess the
   system stability both DG and grid impedances should be known beforehand.
   This paper proposes a multivariable impedance model for droop-based DGs
   that are typically employed in microgrids. The proposed model is
   essential when assessing the microgrid stability and can be utilized to
   design DG adaptive controllers that mitigate the instability issues
   triggered by grid impedance variations. A frequency sweep identification
   method with chirp excitation is used to validate the proposed DG
   impedance model. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed DG
   impedance model in contrast with the estimated one.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores a simple method for implementing longer transistors:
   connecting devices in series, herein called the series-stack. The
   series-stack may be necessary for designers using fixed-length
   transistors, while requiring high gain and low noise performance. To
   test the feasibility of this architecture, a two-stage CMOS amplifier is
   designed using the TSMC 65nm process. Analysis of the results yield
   differences from 2\% to 30\% between the series-stack and traditional
   methods, depending on the metric. Yet, most discrepancies are expected,
   and the two implementations follow similar trends with respect to
   current density and length. The series-stack is deemed a suitable
   alternative to long transistor designs, especially when considering
   organizational advantages at the layout level.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the generic models of different hybrid ac/dc
   microgrids components. The operational philosophy is oriented towards
   decentralized schemes while considering the absence of a single slack
   bus in the entire system. Instead, the DG units operate based on droop
   characteristics, thereby forming a multi-slack distribution system, and
   accordingly stabilize the system frequency and voltage. Unlike in
   grid-connected systems, the system frequency and voltage are variable,
   rather than fixed. These new operational characteristics are highlighted
   in the models proposed for the DG units, loads, and interlinking
   converters as well. The solution of the nonlinear equations, represent
   the system steady-state behavior, are contrasted with detailed
   time-domain simulations performed in PSCAD/EMTDC environment to evaluate
   the modeling accuracy.}},
