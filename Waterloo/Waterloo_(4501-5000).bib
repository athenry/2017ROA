Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate cross-layer superposition coded multicast
   (SCM). Previous studies have proven its effectiveness in exploiting
   better channel capacity and service granularities via both analytical
   and simulation approaches. However, it has never been practically
   implemented using a commercial 4G system. This paper demonstrates our
   prototype in achieving the SCM using a standard 802.16 based testbed for
   scalable video transmissions. In particular, to implement the
   superposition coded (SPC) modulation, we take advantage a novel software
   approach, namely logical SPC (L-SPC), which aims to mimic the physical
   layer superposition coded modulation. The emulation results show
   improved throughput comparing with generic multicast method.}},

   degradation. Two identical transformers are studied by energizing
   independently under power frequency sinusoidal and width-modulated pulse
   trains. The dielectric characteristics of the test objects, like partial
   discharge activities, insulation resistance, are periodically measured
   during the ageing process. After a period of 500 hours of testing the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the use of Terahertz (THz) SPR near-field sensor to
   characterize materials such as PMMA and those used in organic light
   emitting diode (OLED). The SPR device contains 2D periodic circular or
   square hole array in 500 nm Al on an 5 mm-thick intrinsic silicon, and
   was fabricated by photolithography and wet etching. For THz spectrum
   measurement, the SPR device with and without thin (PMMA) film on it is
   placed at the focus of the THz beam in transmission THz Time Domain
   Spectroscopy (TDS), where the spectrum is obtained from the
   Fourier-transformed sample and reference THz pulses. The transmission is
   obtained from the ratio between the sample spectrum and reference
   spectrum, whereas the phase change is the phase difference between the
   two spectra. To avoid overlap with water absorption lines, the optimal
   SPR device design has a period of 320 mu m and square holes of 150 mu m
   side length. The theoretical SPR frequencies in the THz range are
   determined for the metal-silicon modes and metal-air modes (0.9375 THz
   for mode (0, 1) at the metal-air interface). The measurement results
   confirmed the theoretical SPR frequencies for metal-silicon mode and
   demonstrate a shift to 0.9211 THz due to 2 mu m of PMMA layer on the
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{The assimilation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in an
   operational data assimilation system for the purpose of estimating sea
   ice properties is a relatively unexplored area. One of the areas where
   SAR data can provide key information regarding the details of the ice
   cover is in the marginal ice zone. However, automatic interpretation of
   the images in this area is challenging due to sensitivity of the
   backscattered signal to changing surface and environmental conditions
   and speckle noise. In this paper the impact of denoising on the
   assimilation of SAR texture features is examined. Two cases have been
   considered; one assimilating texture features without denoising and the
   other one having a denoising step prior to the assimilation of texture
   features. The contribution of the denoising to the analysis is
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of employing a systems thinking approach to addressing
   complex water resources problems in Canada is demonstrated by
   summarizing and comparing the valuable contributions of the authors of
   the papers appearing in this special issue of the Canadian Water
   Resources Journal. The authors originally presented their research at
   Water 2010, held in Quebec City from July 5th to 7th, 2010, as part of
   an ongoing sequence of conferences called the International Conferences
   on Water Resources and Environment Research (ICWRER). By tackling
   challenging water resources problems in an integrative and adaptive
   fashion from a system of systems engineering perspective that considers
   stakeholders' value systems, reasonable solutions can be found that are
   robust, sustainable and fair. Indeed, across the papers, the authors use
   a rich range of systems techniques for investigating the natural,
   technological, and societal systems aspects of complex water resources
   problems in Canada. A challenge is put forward to the Canadian water
   resources community to design a realistic water policy for Canada that
   is based upon sound systems principles and is, therefore, in consonance
   with other connected systems domains involving energy, climate change,
   societal well-being, the economy, and international commitments.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to find a computationally inexpensive

   approach is called the surrogate model optimization (SMO), which relies
   on optimizing a surrogate model instead of the original model that
   requires significantly more computing time. The proposed SMO method
   combines the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method and a statistical
   approach called the ``Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments
   (DACE){''}. To investigate the performance of this approach, the Monte
   Carlo sampling and LHS results are compared with the results of the
   proposed SMO. As the case study, the prediction results of WATCLASS
   hydrologic model over Smokey river watershed using MC, LHS and SMO are
   presented. The proposed SMO is shown to be significantly faster than
   traditional calibration methods based on Monte Carlo simulation or other
   global optimization methods.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{47-60}},
Abstract = {{A formal decision making methodology is presented for equitably
   allocating water among competing users in a river basin when taking into
   account both the societal and physical systems aspects of the allocation
   problem. More specifically, within the societal component of the
   decision problem, multiple participants, their multiple objectives,
   equity principles, and economic factors are taken into account, while
   the physical systems part reflects relevant hydrologic and environmental
   factors. The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) incorporates
   these societal and physical systems concerns within the framework of a
   large-scale optimization program which is divided into two main steps.
   Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing legal water
   rights regimes or agreements. In the second step, water and associated
   benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide

Abstract = {{A transboundary conflict between Canada and the United States due to
   slag contamination in Lake Roosevelt is formally studied using the Graph
   Model for Conflict Resolution. Three key decision makers (DMs) were
   identified: 1) Teck Cominco, the largest mining, mineral processing and
   metallurgical company in Canada; 2) the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency; and 3) the Colville Indian Tribes, whose traditional
   territories are located in the Lake Roosevelt area. After a careful
   background investigation, the conflict among these three groups is
   modeled by identifying three key DMs, potential courses of action for
   each DM, and the relative preferences of each DM with respect to the
   states or scenarios that could occur as of May 2006, just before the
   settlement agreement was signed. Subsequently, a stability analysis is
   carried out and several strong equilibria or potential solutions to the
   conflict are identified. The analytical results verify the suitability
   of the developed analytical model, suggest mutual agreements between the
   stakeholders as a potential solution for the conflict, and highlight the
   importance of establishing new or strictly enforcing existing water
   policies in order to resolve current conflicts and to avoid any future
   controversies.}},

   is first proposed to avoid the difficulty in image alignment for
   imperfect data, followed by a robust factorization scheme to handle
   outlying and missing data. The novelty and main contributions of the
   paper are as follows: (i) as a new addition to previous nonrigid
   structure from motion, the proposed factorization algorithm can
   perfectly handle imperfect tracking data; (ii) it is demonstrated that
   the image reprojection residuals are in general proportional to the
   error magnitude of the tracked features. Thus, the outliers can be
   detected directly from the residuals, which are then used to estimate
   the uncertainties of the image measurement; and (iii) the robust
   factorization scheme is proved empirically to be more efficient and more
   accurate than other robust algorithms. The proposed approach is
   validated and evaluated by extensive experiments on synthetic data and
   real image sequences.}},

   Stiffeners on Steel Highway Bridges}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2360}},
Pages = {{27-35}},
Abstract = {{Numerous steel highway bridges, still in use today, were built during
   the construction boom between the late 1950s and the late 1970s. Fatigue
   cracking can be considered a main source of deterioration for these
   bridges. The largest category of observed fatigue cracks is caused by
   out-of-plane distortion. The most susceptible locations are those at
   which transverse structural components (such as diaphragms or cross
   frames) are framed into longitudinal girders through web stiffeners that
   are not attached to the flanges. In the current study, a web stiffener
   detail is fatigue tested under different cyclic loading conditions.
   As-welded specimens are tested, along with specimens retrofitted by
   grinding and rewelding, needle peening, or the adhesive bonding of
   fiber-reinforced polymer attachments. Direct strain and deflection
   measurements are compared with finite element analysis predictions, and
   local (hot-spot) stresses are compared with hot-spot stress design
   curves. A time series-based method for damage detection is also explored
   for the prediction of fatigue crack depth with strain data. The method
   is validated through the use of small- and large-scale specimen strain
   data. It is found that damage measures based on strains in the vicinity
   of the critical hot spot are closely correlated with the true crack
   depth.}},

Abstract = {{Bluetooth headsets are one of the popular accessories of mobile phones
   because of their convenience. It is necessary to assess the impact of
   electromagnetic waves on the human head when a person is using a
   headset. In this paper different scenarios closely modeling the
   situations that a subject may use the headset in real life are
   simulated. Simulations are performed for two types of materials commonly
   used to manufacture the headsets, namely silicone and acetal, and for
   two different orientation angle of the headset on the ear. Specific
   Absorption Rate (SAR) and path loss values are then obtained for two
   different environments, the open space and inside a car. SEMCAD-X
   software is used as a FDTD-based simulation platform for our numerical
   studies. It can be seen from the results that the minimum amount of SAR
   is obtained by using acetal headsets in open space and sillicone
   headsets inside the car for an angle of 60 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two versions of a Welch-Gong cipher designed for use
   in passive RE ID tags. The low-cost and low-power requirements for
   passive RFID tags impose stringent design constraints for the chips used
   in the tags. The WG(5)-80(x) cipher operates over the f nite f eld F-25,
   and has an 80-bit secret key and 80-bit initialization vector.
   WG(5)-80(x(11)) is the same as WG(5)-80(x), but includes a decimation
   function of x(11), which increases the linear complexity at the cost of
   losing the 1-order resiliency property that is inherent in the
   WG-transform. Both ciphers can be implemented using parallel LFSRs to
   provide throughputs ranging from one to twenty-f ve bits per clock
   cycle. On a 130 nm fabrication process with a clockspeed of 100 kHz and
   a throughput of 100 kbps, WG(5)-80(x) has an area of 1229 GE (gate
   equivalents) and a power consumption of 0.78 mu W. The linear complexity
   of the cipher is The corresponding numbers for WG(5)-80(x(11)) are 1235
   GE, 0.79 mu W, and 222. This paper presents results for a 130 nm and a
   180 nm process, and data rates of 100 kbps and 200 kbps. The combined
   area and power results for the WG(5) ciphers are approximately 5\%
   better than previous results for low-data-rate ciphers. In addition,
   WG-ciphers offer mathematically guaranteed randomness and cryptographic
   properties not provided by other ciphers.}},

Title = {{Development of Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program Pavement Assets
   Under Performance-Based Contracts}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2361}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, there has been a movement in North America toward
   a performance-based contract (PBC) model for maintaining and managing
   road networks. In traditional method-based contracts, the owner agency
   specifies techniques, materials, methods, and quantities, along with the
   time period for the contract. By contrast, in a PBC, the client agency
   specifies certain clearly defined minimum performance measures to be met
   or exceeded during the contract period. PBC is a type of contract in
   which payments are explicitly linked to the contractor's successfully
   meeting or exceeding certain clearly defined minimum performance
   indicators. Therefore, the selection of a PBC model for maintenance and
   rehabilitation differs significantly from that of a traditional asset
   management contract Also, a PBC is more complex because of the pavement
   deterioration process and probability of failure to achieve the
   specified level of service for various performance measures along the
   contract period. A novel framework was developed for the selection of
   maintenance and rehabilitation activities with a model for pavement
   performance prediction and linear optimization. A case study based on
   data from the second generation pavement management system of the
   Ministry of Transportation Ontario is used to illustrate the framework.}},

   accurate analytical model to predict the execution time of such
   applications on heterogeneous CMPs. Our experimental results illustrate

Abstract = {{Large-scale networks consisting of similar similar subprocesses can
   conveniently be modeled as Parameterized Discrete Event Systems (PDES).
   This modeling is particularly useful when the number of subprocesses is
   arbitrary, unknown or time- varying. Unfortunately, key problems such as
   checking the nonblocking property in these networks are undecidable.
   Moreover, mathematical tools supporting analysis of these networks are
   very limited. In previous work, we introduced weak invariant simulation
   in its preliminary form as a new mathematical notion for analysis of
   deterministic PDES and for defining tractable subclasses of PDES. In
   this paper, we broaden the definition of weak invariant simulation for
   nondeterministic PDES and give more insight into its properties. We
   compare weak invariant simulation to other simulation relations in the
   literature. Moreover, we propose a method to check whether a process
   weakly invariantly simulates another process with respect to a specific
   subalphabet. The greatest lower bound of all weak invariant simulations
   between two processes is also introduced. To illustrate the significance
   of weak invariant simulation, we outline its application to deadlock
   analysis of parameterized networks.}},

   offering him a sequence of rewards, with each reward granted only if he

   then use this model to devise a control algorithm that controls the

   attitude to a large enough value in finite time, the person's behavior
   can be brought to any desired level. This approach has the significant
   advantage that, at the end of the time interval, no reward is needed to
   maintain the desired behavior. We consider both open-loop and feedback

Abstract = {{In this paper we study rebalancing strategies for a mobility-on-demand
   urban transportation system blending customer-driven vehicles with a
   taxi service. In our system, a customer arrives at one of many
   designated stations and is transported to any other designated station,
   either by driving themselves, or by being driven by an employed driver.
   When some origins and destinations are more popular than others,
   vehicles will become unbalanced, accumulating at some stations and
   becoming depleted at others. This problem is addressed by employing
   rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular destinations to
   the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the rebalancing
   drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to ``rebalance the
   rebalancers{''} by letting them travel back to the popular destinations
   with a customer. In this paper we study how to optimally route the
   rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that the number of waiting customers
   remains bounded while minimizing the number of rebalancing vehicles
   traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing drivers needed;
   surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can find the
   optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs.
   We determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum number of
   vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Our simulations
   suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need between
   1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Synchro-squeezing transform has recently emerged as a powerful signal
   processing tool in non-stationary signal processing. Premised upon the
   concept of time-frequency (TF) reassignment, its basic objective is to
   provide a sharper representation of signals in the TF plane and extract
   the individual components of a non-stationary multi-component signal,
   akin to empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The rich mathematical
   structure based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) makes
   synchro-squeezing powerful for gear fault diagnosis, as faulty gear
   signal is frequently constituted out of multiple amplitude-modulated and
   frequency-modulated signals embedded in noise. This work utilizes the
   decomposing power of synchro-squeezing transform to extract the IMFs
   from a gear signal followed by the application of standard gearbox
   condition indicators which promises greater prognostic power than that
   can be achieved by applying condition indicators directly to the
   inherently complex gear signals. The efficacy and robustness of the
   algorithm are demonstrated through practical experimental data obtained
   from a helicopter gear box.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene/Si hole array (SiHA) Schottky junctions show great promise as
   high-efficiency, cost-effective solar cells. However, their applications
   are still limited by the severe surface recombination of the nano-hole
   SiHA and inferior device stability arising from volatile oxidant doping.
   Here, we demonstrate the construction of high-efficiency graphene/SiHA
   devices with enhanced device performance and stability. The micro-hole
   SiHA fabricated by photolithography and reaction ion etching (RIE)
   possesses a smooth surface, thus ensuring a low surface recombination
   velocity. Also, the light harvesting of the micro-hole SiHA could be
   readily tuned by adjusting the hole depth. Introduction of the
   micro-hole SiHA, along with the use of AuCl3 for graphene doping, gives
   rise to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.40\% for the
   graphene/SiHA devices. Additionally, the device stability is
   substantially improved and shows a relatively low degradation ratio
   after storing in air for 3 months. It is expected that the graphene/SiHA
   devices will have important applications in new-generation Si solar

Abstract = {{A series of acid-cleavable ABA-type triblock copolymers, namely
   poly(3-caprolactone)-acetal-poly(ethylene
   glycol)-acetal-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL-a-PEG-a-PCL), were
   synthesized via a combination of ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of
   epsilon-caprolactone initiated by propargyl alcohol and subsequent
   ``CuAAC{''} click reaction with azide terminated acetal-containing
   poly(ethylene glycol). The chemical composition and structures of the
   copolymers were characterized by H-1 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy, while
   their molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were measured
   by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The critical aggregation
   concentration (CAC), size parameters and morphologies of micelles
   self-assembled from PCL-a-PEG-a-PCL were determined by fluorescence
   probing, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), respectively. Since the acetal groups are unstable in
   weak acidic media, it is anticipated that this class of triblock
   copolymer micelles can be dissociated in an intracellular environment.
   This was confirmed by monitoring the size change of micelles with the
   increase of degradation time under acidic conditions, as well as the
   molecular weights of degradation products. The pH-triggered release of
   doxorubicin (DOX) from PCL-a-PEG-a-PCL micelles was studied and compared
   with a pH-insensitive PCL-b-PEG-b-PCL system without acetal groups,
   demonstrating that the cleavage of acetal linkages was responsible for
   the pH-responsive drug release profiles. In vitro cytotoxicity tests
   against HeLa and L929 cells by MTT assays indicated that the
   self-assembled micelles displayed very low cytotoxicity. In addition,
   the intracellular drug release against HeLa cells was further
   investigated by a live cell imaging system using free DOX as a control.
   This work provides a facile strategy for the preparation of a new type
   of biodegradable amphiphilic copolymer as a highly promising
   intracellular delivery system for hydrophobic drugs.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the challenge of computing worst-case response times
   of hard real-time applications deployed on multiprocessor systems. In
   particular, the worst-case response time analysis (WCRTA) focuses on the
   communication between distributed tasks of hard real-time applications.
   The proposed WCRTA models the communication as a pipelined communication
   resource model. This model incorporates the effect of pipelining, and
   the parallel transmission of data. Applications of such a model include
   multiprocessor systems that use complex interconnects such as
   network-on-chips (NoC)s with priorities. In this paper, we present an
   exponential analysis, and a polynomial analysis, and prove its
   correctness. As an application, we apply the pipelined communication
   resource model to priority-aware NoCs, and we compare the proposed
   analyses against prior analysis techniques. Our experimental evaluation
   on two instances of 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 NoCs with 512,000 synthetic
   benchmarks shows 48.3\% and 66.7\% improvement in schedulability for the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the differences of applying cooperation to
   fully-connected and multi-hop wireless networks, and find out that both
   the enlarged interference area and link density play a pivotal role in
   making the beneficial cooperation decision in a multi-hop network.
   Through characterizing effects of the enlarged interference area and
   link density on the overall network performance, a beneficial
   cooperation opportunity can be identified. By employing a randomized
   scheduling scheme and deriving the interference-free probability of any
   two links, the expected numbers of concurrent direct and cooperative
   transmissions can be obtained, where the ratio of these two numbers is
   defined as the beneficial cooperation ratio. Such a ratio translates the
   reduced spatial reuse to a requirement of the cooperation gain and
   provides a guideline for enabling beneficial cooperation on a
   single-link basis. Finally, the analytical and simulation results
   demonstrate that the beneficial cooperation criterion for a multi-hop
   network derived in this paper is more accurate than that in {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the challenges of designing a robust, and undetectable
   covert channel, in this paper we introduce a design methodology for
   timing covert channels that achieve provable polynomial-time
   undetectability. This means that the covert channel can not be detected
   by any polynomial-time statistical test that analyzes the samples of the
   covert traffic and the legitimate traffic. The proposed framework is
   based on modeling the covert channel as a differential communication
   channel, and the formulation for modulation/demodulation processes that
   are derived according to the communication model. The proposed scheme
   incorporates a trellis structure in modulating the covert message. The
   trellis structure is also used at the covert receiver to perform
   iterative demodulation/decoding of the covert message that significantly
   enhances the channel reliability.
   In addition, the paper presents an adaptive modulation strategy that
   improves the channel robustness without compromising the stealthiness of
   the channel. The combination of the adaptive modulation and the trellis
   structure gives the covert channel considerable flexibility and low
   error rate at the covert receiver. In fact, performance analysis of the
   channel reveals that the proposed covert communication scheme withstands
   extremely high levels of network noise and adversarial disruption, while
   it maintains an outstanding undetectability level and covert rate.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an increasing role in a wide
   variety of applications ranging from hostile environment monitoring to
   telemedicine services. The hardware and cost constraints of sensor
   nodes, however, make sensors prone to clone attacks and pose great
   challenges in the design and deployment of an energy-efficient WSN. In
   this paper, we propose a location-aware clone detection protocol, which
   guarantees successful clone attack detection and has little negative
   impact on the network lifetime. Specifically, we utilize the location
   information of sensors and randomly select witness nodes located in a
   ring area to verify the privacy of sensors and to detect clone attacks.
   The ring structure facilitates energy efficient data forwarding along
   the path towards the witnesses and the sink, and the traffic load is
   distributed across the network, which improves the network lifetime
   significantly. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate
   that the proposed protocol can approach 100\% clone detection
   probability with trustful witnesses. We further extend the work by
   studying the clone detection performance with untrustful witnesses and
   show that the clone detection probability still approaches 98\% when
   10\% of witnesses are compromised. Moreover, our proposed protocol can
   significantly improve the network lifetime, compared with the existing
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The effective inter-vehicle transmission of content files, e. g.,
   images, music and video clips, is the basis of media communications in
   vehicular networks, such as social communications and video sharing.
   However, due to the presence of diverse node velocities, severe channel
   fadings and intensive mutual interferences among vehicles, the
   inter-vehicle or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications tend to be
   transient and highly dynamic. Content transmissions among vehicles over
   the volatile and spotty V2V channels are thus susceptible to frequent
   interruptions and failures, resulting in many fragment content
   transmissions which are unable to finish during the connection time and
   unusable by on-top media applications. The interruptions of content
   transmissions not only lead to the failure of media presentations to
   users, but the transmission of the invalid fragment contents would also
   result in the significant waste of precious vehicular bandwidth. On
   addressing this issue, in this work we target on provisioning the
   integrity-oriented inter-vehicle content transmissions. Given the
   initial distance and mobility statistics of vehicles, we develop an
   analytical framework to evaluate the data volume that can be transmitted
   upon the short-lived and spotty V2V connection from the source to the
   destination vehicle. Provided the content file size, we are able to
   evaluate the likelihood of successful content transmissions through the
   model. Based upon this analysis, we propose an admission control scheme
   at the transmitters, that filters the suspicious content transmission
   requests which are unlikely to be accomplished over the transient
   inter-vehicle links. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the
   accuracy of the developed analytical model, and the effectiveness of the
   proposed admission control scheme. In the simulated scenario, with the
   proposed admission control scheme applied, it is observed that about
   30\% of the network bandwidth can be saved for effective content
   transmissions.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum-deposited small molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) with various
   electron extraction layers (EELs) and hole extraction layers (HELs) are
   studied. Upright OSCs are examined for their efficiencies, and for their
   photo- and thermal-stabilities. It is shown that the EEL conducts only
   because of the subsequent top electrode metal deposition, and that
   exciton blocking characteristics of the EEL alone are not sufficient to
   grant good solar cell characteristics. To this end, wide bandgap organic
   HELs cannot be placed between the bottom electrode and active organic
   layers to achieve the same effect as wide bandgap organic EELs at the
   opposite end of the device. Inverted vacuum-deposited OSCs, which place
   the HEL adjacent to the top metal anode, can make use of a wide bandgap
   organic HEL in combination with a thin MoO3 layer to achieve good device
   performance. Thick MoO3 HELs alone are also shown to be suitable for
   inverted vacuum-deposited OSCs, thus simplifying device fabrication. For
   these inverted devices, the thickness of the HEL required to achieve
   good device performance is found to be substantially higher than the
   equivalent EEL thickness in a standard upright device.}},

Abstract = {{Ethernet is widely recognized as an attractive networking technology for
   modern distributed real-time systems. However, standard Ethernet
   components require specific modifications and hardware support to
   provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical
   applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of
   hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly
   unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting
   prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation
   of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications.
   This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on
   reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in
   multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for
   time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly
   integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort
   traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication
   latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices
   for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new
   protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to
   verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to
   accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based
   solutions in real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{Relaying in femtocell networks is a promising and economically viable
   option to reduce the co-channel interference while improving indoor
   coverage and the network capacity in the next generation wireless
   networks. However, efficient relay selection as well as subcarrier and
   power allocation are critical in such networks when multiple users and
   multiple relays are considered. In this paper, an optimal resource
   (relay, subcarrier and power) allocation algorithm for co-channel
   deployed orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based
   femtocell systems is proposed. The resource allocation problem is
   formulated as a joint relay, subcarrier and power allocation problem
   with the objective of maximizing the sum of the weighted rates of the
   femtocell system subject to protecting the macrocell network's
   communications. Due to the non-convex nature of the original resource
   allocation problem, we obtain an optimal solution for the original
   problem by solving a relaxed problem via dual decomposition. Simulation
   results demonstrate that our proposed resource allocation algorithm
   outperforms the resource allocation algorithms proposed in literature by
   achieving higher throughput at the expense of a slight increment of the
   system complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The abundant bandwidth at 60 GHz band (around 7 GHz) offers the
   potential for multi-Gbps indoor wireless connections for
   bandwidth-intensive applications. However, 60 GHz millimeter wave
   (mmWave) links are highly susceptible to blockage since it is difficult
   to diffract around obstacles. In this paper, we propose multi-radio band
   integration framework to have 2.4/5 GHz band assist mmWave band to
   prevent drastic data rate reduction. Specifically, the problem of
   multi-radio band integration with TDMA-based MAC is formulated as an
   optimization problem. We decompose the problem into two sub-problems:
   radio band selection and space-time scheduling. Firstly, considering
   network load and mmWave channel status, we define start-integration
   threshold and stop-integration threshold to select an active radio band
   for data transmission. Secondly, a space-time scheduling scheme is
   proposed to allow multiple flows over different radio bands operate
   concurrently to exploit the spatial reuse. Simulation results of the
   proposed multi-radio band integration mechanism demonstrate significant
   improvements of network connectivity and the number of supported traffic
   flows.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate cooperative networking in cognitive radio
   networks (CRNs), which targets to help the primary users (PUs) for
   secure communications and provide transmission opportunities to
   secondary users (SUs). Two cooperation schemes: relay-jammer (R-J)
   scheme and cluster-beamforming (C-B) scheme, are proposed. In R-J
   cooperation scheme, two individual SUs, a relay and a friendly jammer,
   are leveraged by the PU to improve communication secrecy via
   cooperation; In return, the PU allocates a fraction of access time for
   SUs' transmission. To achieve the maximum secrecy rate, joint time and
   power allocation is considered. In C-B cooperation scheme, the PU
   cooperates with a cluster of SUs, which enhance the secrecy of primary
   link via collaborative beamforming and gain spectrum access
   opportunities as a reward. With the objective of maximizing the secrecy
   rate, the optimal weights and time allocation are studied. Numerical
   results validate the proposed schemes and demonstrate that the PU can
   significantly enhances the secrecy through cooperation with the
   cooperating SUs by allocating time and transmission power optimally.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demands for improving transmission reliability and
   efficiency have brought us a wide interest in smart grid. In current
   smart grid research, one of challenges is its security issue. If the
   security is not well addressed, the concept of smart grid cannot be
   widely accepted. In this paper, in order to simultaneously resolve the
   security and efficiency challenges in smart grid communications, we
   propose an efficient aggregate authentication protocol, called EATH,
   which is characterized by eliminating the Map-To-Hash hash and reducing
   the pairing operations in aggregation and verification to improve the
   computational efficiency. Detailed security analysis has shown that the
   proposed EATH protocol is secure in terms of source authentication and
   data integrity in smart grid communications. In addition, performance
   evaluation also demonstrates its efficiency in terms of low computation
   and communication overheads.}},

   in the high SNR regime. We prove that the HD-NAF relay network with
   two-layered codes corresponds to a successive refinable diversity
   multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) curve. With the identified property, a
   closed-form expression for an achievable upper bound of the system
   distortion exponent is derived, which can be achieved via properly

   conducted to show performance advantages of the considered two-layered

Abstract = {{Power dissipation and hardware cost are two major design concerns in the

   novel mixed-mode implementation of the weight update in particle PHD
   filter, which outperforms its counterpart digital-form implementation in
   terms of power dissipation and hardware resource consumption. In
   specific, the mixed-mode implementation uses multiple-input translinear
   element (MITE) networks to realize the likelihood function of weight
   update in the analog domain. T he MITE networks, which are operated in
   subthreshold region, contribute to the low-power implementation of the
   particle PHD filters, and can lead to parallel implementation of the
   weight update with lower hardware cost. Extensive simulations are
   conducted with circuit models and parameters from the Taiwan
   Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 0.18 mu m CMOS technology
   library for mixed-mode implementation of weight update, and the results
   show that the analog errors in this mixed mode implementation are

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a wormhole attack resistant secure neighbor
   discovery scheme, named SND, for 60 GHz directional wireless network
   with a centralized network controller (NC). In specific, the proposed
   SND scheme consists of three phases: the NC broadcasting phase, the
   network node response/authentication phase and the NC time-delay
   analysis phase. In the broadcasting phase and response/authentication
   phase, local time information and antenna direction information are
   elegantly exchanged with signature based authentication techniques
   between the NC and legislate network nodes, which can prevent most of
   the wormhole attacks. In the NC time-delay analysis phase, the NC can
   further detect the possible attack by using the time-delay information
   from the network node. To solve the transmission collision problem in
   the response/authentication phase, an RD-TDMA protocol is also proposed.
   Both simulation results and security analysis demonstrate that the
   proposed SND scheme can effectively resist wormhole attack for the 60
   GHz communication network with directional antenna.}},

Title = {{EAP-Based Group Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for
   Machine-Type Communications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Machine to machine (M2M) communications, also called machine-type
   communications (MTC), has widely been utilized in applications such as
   telemetry, industrial, automation, and SCADA systems. The group-based
   MTC, especially when MTC devices belong to non-3GPP network, will face
   new challenge of access authentication. In this paper, we propose a
   group authentication and key agreement protocol, called EG-AKA, for
   machine-type communications combining elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) based on EAP framework. Compared with conventional EAP-AKA, our
   protocol guarantees stronger security and provides better performance.
   Detailed security analysis has shown that the proposed EG-AKA protocol
   is secure in terms of user and group identity protection and resistance
   to several attacks. Furthermore, formal verification implemented in
   AVISPA proves that the proposed protocol is secure against various
   malicious attacks. Moreover, performance evaluation demonstrates its
   efficiency in terms of the signaling overhead, the bandwidth
   consumption, and the transmission cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the implementation issues of some recent
   research concepts to improve the flexibility and reliability of backbone
   networks to support future services. In particular, we are interested in
   the application of general dedicated protection (GDP) that has been
   proved to be a viable protection method in backbone networks. The GDP
   approach enables instantaneous failure recovery to the widest range of
   failure scenarios, provides extremely high connection availability even
   in sparse network topologies, while it is optimal in bandwidth
   requirement among all dedicated protection approaches. First, in order
   to reach optimal bandwidth allocation of GDP we adopt network coding in
   circuit switched backbone networks with special focus to the case when
   bit level XOR operation is allowed over the packet at the network nodes.
   We believe, addressing is one of the key challenges in implementing the
   proposed GDP architecture with network coding. As a solution, we show
   how to adopt some state-of-the-art stateless addressing at the
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) layer developed for multicast
   addressing such as Bloom-filters and balanced parenthesis. Extensive
   simulations are conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed
   architecture in terms of bandwidth consumption and packet header length.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud services based on data center networks (DCNs) require a
   transmission infrastructure with high-capacity, low-latency, low-cost
   and high-availability, which can be offered by survivable optical
   networks. DCN placement is a fundamental issue in supporting cloud
   services in optical networks. It concerns not only the cost of providing
   cloud services, but also the service availability against failures via
   proper service replicas. In this paper, we jointly optimize DCN
   placement with service routing and protection to minimize the network
   cost, while ensuring fast protection of all services against a single
   link or server failure. An ILP (Integer Linear Program) is formulated to
   achieve optimal joint design. It integrates p-cycle (preconfigured
   protection cycle) for fast protection against a single link failure, and
   DCN replicas and fast service rerouting against a server failure. To
   make the design more scalable, a two-step heuristic is proposed for
   large-size networks. The first step separately solves the DCN placement
   and service routing problem in the failure-free scenario, and the second
   step takes fast service protection into account. The proposed design is
   validated by extensive simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Road agencies typically collect travel time information from their
   network to identify traffic bottlenecks and to quantify the effects of
   road improvement investments in terms of travel time improvements. Road
   agencies can benefit from newly emerging automated data collection
   technologies that acquire travel time information for a large
   geographical area at lower costs. The objective of the study presented
   in this paper was to evaluate travel time data obtained from three
   technologies (i.e., Bluetooth, in-vehicle navigation systems, and mobile
   phone probes) compared with travel time obtained from probe vehicles
   equipped with Global Positioning Systems (GPSs). Traffic data were
   obtained for road types (e.g., freeways, arterials, ramps) in the study
   area from commercial data providers for a relatively large study area in
   the Province of Ontario, Canada. A multicriteria methodology was
   developed to evaluate data from each data provider on the basis of
   accuracy, coverage, number of observations, and capability to provide
   data for special facilities such as high occupancy vehicle lanes. The
   findings of this research suggested that all three technologies could
   replace traditional, GPS-equipped probe vehicles. This paper offers
   several recommendations on the use of travel time data from different
   data providers.}},

Abstract = {{A facile method has been developed based on extremely rapid heating
   (temperature ramp greater than 150 degrees C sec(-1)) for the synthesis
   of graphene nanosheets with heterogeneously doped nitrogen atoms (ex-NG)
   in a one-step process. The nanosheets are uniquely characterized by
   large expansions and openings between the layers that facilitate in the
   diffusion of the electrolyte to perform highly active oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR). Electron microscopy has verified a voile-like morphology
   of thermally reduced ex-NG, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has
   confirmed successful ammonia treatment of nitrogen incorporation into
   the graphitic network. The ORR activity of the graphene nanosheets is
   evaluated using both half-cell and single-cell performance tests. The
   half-cell test is conducted by rotating disk electrode measurements
   where the nanosheets have showed very comparable ORR activity to that of
   state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. A practical zinc-air battery
   have been utilized to test the single-cell performance of ex-NG1100,
   which have exhibited superior battery discharge voltages and reduced
   charge transfer resistance during the ORR compared to that of Pt/C. This
   outstanding catalytic activity of metal-free carbon-based graphene
   nanosheets is attributed to the opened structured attained by facile
   synthesis technique utilizing a rapid heating process. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Since the early 2000's there has been increasing adoption of dual-phase
   steels for automotive manufacture. Dual-phase steels have a multiphase
   microstructure containing ferrite martensite and sometimes bainite,
   which is achieved through complex processing that often requires a high
   alloy content. This combination of a multiphase microstructure
   containing metastable phases and a heavily alloyed chemistry can cause a
   high degree of heterogeneity in the properties of welded joints. This
   paper explores the literature of both the metallurgy reactions
   responsible for the post-welded properties and the effect that these
   properties have on three linear welding techniques used in the
   automotive sector: laser welding, gas metal arc welding, and HF tube
   welding. Finally welding parameters and joint designs are suggested to
   optimize post-weld properties in DP steels.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-phase (DP) steels offer favorable combinations of high strength and
   good deformability. These properties have made them a potential
   candidate for the fabrication of automobile body frame structures, which
   helps increase fuel economy by down-gauging material thickness and
   improving the crashworthiness of the vehicle. Resistance spot welding is
   extensively used in automotive manufacturing and is also a favorable
   method for joining DP steels. However, the main challenge in welding DP
   steel is to overcome the inconsistent failures encountered in the
   heat-affected zone and/or the fusion zone (nugget) in higher grades of
   DP steel spot welds. Failure in the heat affected zone of DP steel spot
   welds is related to the softening phenomenon which involves tempering of
   martensite as the temperature in this region reaches close to Ac-1 line
   of the steel. This article documents the review of the earlier work on
   softening occurring at subcritical heat affected zone of spot welded DP
   steels and its effects on the tensile performance of the spot welds.}},

Abstract = {{The brazeability of AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy and steel sheet using two
   different types of micro-interlayers (Al-12Si and Ni) in a single flare
   bevel lap joint configuration has been investigated. The macro- and
   microstructure, element distribution, and interfacial phases of the
   joints were studied by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). The results of this study suggest that the
   feasibility of this process depends strongly on the pre-existing Al-12Si
   coating or Ni electro-plating layer on the steel sheet. Both interlayers
   promoted wetting of the Mg-Al filler alloy. Use of the Al-12Si
   interlayer resulted in the formation of a brittle layer of
   theta-Fe(Al,Mg)(3) intermetallic compound along the braze/steel
   interface, which was responsible for bonding. In comparison, using a Ni
   interlayer led to formation of a band of AlNi intermetallic compound
   with different morphologies along the steel-fusion zone interface.
   However, this phase was not directly responsible for bonding. Bonding
   between the magnesium brazing alloy and the steel was facilitated by the
   formation of a transition layer composed of a solid solution of Ni in Fe
   at the steel interface. The average fracture shear strength of the bond
   using the Al-12Si and Ni interlayers reached 49.3 MPa and 96.8 MPa,
   respectively, which gave joint efficiencies of 31\% and 60\% with
   respect to the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy base metal. Thus, the Ni interlayer
   resulted in joints with significantly improved joint strength relative
   to those made using the Al-12Si interlayer.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic decoding provides ultra-low-complexity hardware for
   high-throughput parallel low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders.
   Asynchronous stochastic decoding was proposed to demonstrate the
   possibility of low power dissipation and high throughput in stochastic
   decoders, but decoding might stop before convergence due to
   ``lock-up{''}, causing error floors. In this paper, we introduce
   wire-delay dependent asynchronous stochastic decoding to reduce the
   error floors. Instead of assigning the same delay to all computation
   nodes in the previous work, different computation delay is assigned to
   each computation node depending on its wire length. The variation of
   update timing increases switching activities to decrease the possibility
   of the ``lock-up{''}, lowering the error floors. BER performance using a
   regular (1024, 512) (3,6) LDPC code is simulated based on our timing
   model that has computation and wire delays estimated under ASPLA 90nm
   CMOS technology. It is demonstrated that the proposed asynchronous
   decoder achieves an up to 0.25-dB gain compared with that of the
   synchronous and the conventional asynchronous decoders.}},

Abstract = {{Partial shading of a photovoltaic array is the condition under which
   different modules in the array experience different irradiance levels
   due to shading. This difference causes mismatch between the modules,
   leading to undesirable effects such as reduction in generated power and
   hot spots. The severity of these effects can be considerably reduced by
   photovoltaic array reconfiguration. This paper proposes a novel
   mathematical formulation for the optimal reconfiguration of photovoltaic
   arrays to minimize partial shading losses. The paper formulates the
   reconfiguration problem as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem
   and finds the optimal solution using a branch and bound algorithm. The
   proposed formulation can be used for an equal or nonequal number of
   modules per row. Moreover, it can be used for fully reconfigurable or
   partially reconfigurable arrays. The improvement resulting from the
   reconfiguration with respect to the existing photovoltaic

Abstract = {{Femtosecond laser induced nonthermal processing is an emerging
   nanofabrication technique for delicate plasmonic devices. In this work
   we present a detailed investigation on the interaction between
   ultra-short pulses and silver nanomaterials, both experimentally and
   theoretically. We systematically study the laser-silver interaction at a
   laser fluent from 1 J/m(2) to 1 MJ/m(2). The optimal processing window
   for welding of silver nanowires occurs at fluences of 200-450 J/m(2).
   The femtosecond laser-induced surface melting allows precise welding of
   silver nanowires for ``T{''} and ``X{''} shape circuits. These welded
   plasmonic circuits are successfully applied for routining light
   propagation.}},

   trichloroethylene (TCE) remaining after using the activated persulfate
   system was two-to three-fold higher in a soil slurry batch system than
   in an aqueous batch system. For all five aquifer materials investigated,
   an increase in the mass of the aquifer solids significantly decreased
   the degradation of TCE. A linear relationship was observed between the
   mass of aquifer materials and the initial TCE degradation rate,
   suggesting that the organic carbon and/or aquifer material constituents
   (e. g., carbonates and bicarbonates) compete with the oxidation of TCE.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-wrapped titanium dioxide nanoflower composites (G-TiO2)
   consisting of nanosheets and nanoparticles were synthesized using a
   two-step solvo/hydrothermal process. Materials were characterized using
   SEM, TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and
   FTIR. Further analysis was performed using Branauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   specific surface area analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy.
   Photocatalytic activity was determined by the photo-degradation of
   methylene blue under UV irradiation. Results show that the TiO2
   nanoflower exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than commercial P25
   by a factor of 1.49. This is attributed to the highly crystalline,
   hierarchical nature of the nanoflower structure, which provides improved
   charge transport and a reduced recombination rate of photo-generated
   electron-hole pairs. After wrapping with graphene, the G-TiO2 composite
   can further improve the photocatalytic performance by providing a planar
   conjugated surface for dye adsorption, by further reducing recombination
   through accepting electrons from TiO2, and by causing a red shift in
   light absorption. The highest photocatalytic performance was found using
   a graphene loading of 5 wt\%, which outperforms commercial P25 by a
   factor of 3.4.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a robust method for whole chip temperature mapping in

   measurements are based on the ratio of two bands in the fluorescence

   carboximide (BTBP) dye. Spectral bands were carefully chosen to minimize
   errors caused by photobleaching of the dye which results in a perceived
   drift in the temperature with time. The improvements result in a useful
   working time for this type of measurement to >20 h. We achieve a
   temperature resolution <2 degrees C with drift less than 0.58 degrees C
   h(-1) in thin-films of common polymers used in microfluidic device

Abstract = {{In this paper, we conduct transmission and reflection mode terahertz
   time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurements of organic
   semiconductors such as ALQ3 and TBADN. THz-TDS is effective for
   determining the purity of the organic semiconductors based on the
   refractive index and spectral signatures in THz range. In order to
   prepare the sample for a custom built sample holder, the powder samples
   are pressed into pellets of 13 mm diameter and a thickness of 2 mm using
   a hydraulic press. The organic semiconductor, for example ALQ3 sample,
   is prepared as a 70\% ALQ3 and 30\% polyethylene (PE) concentration
   pellet by mixing ALQ3 and PE. The ALQ3 pellet is measured in a chamber
   purged with dry nitrogen to avoid the effect of water vapor absorptions
   in ambient air. The absorption coefficient and index of refraction are
   measured from the spectra of the reference THz pulse and the THz pulse
   after transmission through the sample. The THz spectrum is obtained by
   applying a fast Fourier transform to the THz waveform. Further studies
   were conducted by reducing the concentration of the organic
   semiconductor from 70\% to 10\% ALQ3. We also obtained the spectral
   signature and absorption coefficient for 50\% TBADN 50\% PE pellet. The
   spectral signatures of ALQ3 were found to be at 0.868 THz, 1.271 THz and
   1.52 THz, while spectral signature of TBADN was found to be at 1.033
   THz.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid growth of the biomedical and the security applications,
   the interest in the development of compact and flexible sub-mm/THz
   radiation sources has grown significantly. In this paper we propose a
   novel source design to address this need. Taking the advantage of the
   Photonic Crystal (PC) structure, a metallic defected PC, with no axial
   discontinuities, was designed as a Slow Wave Structure (SWS). This SWS
   was used in a high power Cerenkov-transition based oscillator/amplifier
   working in sub-mm/THz frequency regime. The SWS allows electron beams to
   travel axially in it, facilitating the beam-wave interaction required
   for the desired signal generation. Two coaxial transitions are used as
   input and output for the proposed device. The analysis of the proposed
   device was done using a combined Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) /
   Particle In Cell (PIC) simulation. Using the FDTD thin wire model,
   coaxial transitions were modeled to feed/extract the input/generated
   signals. To show the potential of the proposed device, two design
   examples; one for the amplifier and the other for the oscillator, are
   presented.}},

   The effect of processing parameters on machining depth was studied, and

   under SEM which shows a resolidified thin layer with minimal heat
   affected zones. However, for high cutting speeds, that is, for short

   PVdF-HFP/organically-modified-silicate (OMMT) nanocomposite electrolyte
   delivered a higher discharge capacity and showed an improved cyclability

Abstract = {{A novel sulfur/polyacrylonitrile/graphene nanocomposite has been
   synthesized via a simple combination of ballmilling with low temperature
   heat-treatment. The nanocomposite was examined as a cathode for high
   performance lithium/sulfur batteries. The SEM and TEM observations
   revealed that sulfur/polyacrylonitrile particles are incorporated into
   graphene networks homogenously. Charge/discharge tests and ac impedance
   spectroscopy have shown improved conductivity and electrochemical
   properties of the composite with the addition of graphene. The lithium
   cell with this ternary composite cathode delivered a discharge capacity
   of 612 mAh g(-1) in the second cycle at 0.1 C, and retained about 77\%
   of this value over 100 cycles. Even up to 4 C rate, the lithium cell
   demonstrated an excellent rate capability, delivering a highly
   reversible discharge capacity of 360 mAh g(-1). (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Recent advances in nanotechnology have made it possible
   to mass-produce ultrathin silicon membranes with pore sizes in the range
   of nanometers. In this study, we investigate the possibility of
   employing ultrathin nanoporous silicon membranes with pore diameters of
   5 and 20 nm for dialysis of human whole blood by performing in vitro
   clearance and hemocompatibility assessments. Methods: A mini blood
   dialyzer is fabricated by mounting nanoporous silicon membranes on a
   Teflon structure. Clearance is calculated based on the concentration of
   sodium, chloride, ionized calcium, total CO 2, glucose, creatinine and
   hematocrit measured before and after dialysis. Blood activation is
   assessed by flow cytometry. Results: Blood contact with the nanoporous
   membranes induces considerable leukocyte activation. Coating of the
   membranes with polyethylene glycol significantly improves
   hemocompatibility without blocking the nanopores. Conclusion: Silicon
   nanoporous membranes are potential candidates for fabrication of
   miniaturized blood dialyzers. Their mechanical strength and
   hemocompatibility can be further improved. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger

   devices}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{3840-3846}},
Abstract = {{Droplet-based microfluidics is an emerging high-throughput screening
   technology finding applications in a variety of areas such as life
   science research, drug discovery and material synthesis. In this paper
   we present a cost-effective, scalable microwave system that can be
   integrated with microfluidic devices enabling remote, simultaneous
   sensing and heating of individual nanoliter-sized droplets generated in
   microchannels. The key component of this microwave system is an
   electrically small resonator that is able to distinguish between
   materials with different electrical properties (i.e. permittivity,
   conductivity). The change in these properties causes a shift in the
   operating frequency of the resonator, which can be used for sensing
   purposes. Alternatively, if microwave power is delivered to the sensing
   region at the frequency associated with a particular material (i.e.
   droplet), then only this material receives the power while passing the
   resonator leaving the surrounding materials (i.e. carrier fluid and chip
   material) unaffected. Therefore this method allows sensing and heating
   of individual droplets to be inherently synchronized, eliminating the
   need for external triggers. We confirmed the performance of the sensor
   by applying it to differentiate between various dairy fluids, identify
   salt solutions and detect water droplets with different glycerol
   concentrations. We experimentally verified that this system can increase
   the droplet temperature from room temperature by 42 degrees C within
   5.62 ms with an input power of 27 dBm. Finally we employed this system
   to thermally initiate the formation of hydrogel particles out of the
   droplets that are being heated by this system.}},

Abstract = {{The employment of contrast agents in photoacoustic imaging has gained
   significant attention within the past few years their biomedical
   applications. In this study, the use of silica-coated superparamagnetic
   iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (SPION) was investigated as a contrast
   agent in biomedical photoacoustic imaging. SPIONs have been widely used
   as Food-and-Drug-Administration (FDA)-approved contrast agents for
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are known to have an excellent
   safety profile. Using our frequency-domain photoacoustic correlation
   technique ({''}the photoacoustic radar{''}) with modulated laser
   excitation, we examined the effects of nanoparticle size, concentration
   and biological medium (e.g. serum, sheep blood) on its photoacoustic
   response in turbid media (intralipid solution). Maximum detection depth
   and minimum measurable SPION concentration were determined
   experimentally. The detection was performed using a single element
   transducer. The nanoparticle-induced optical contrast ex vivo in dense
   muscular tissues (avian pectus) was evaluated using a phased array
   photoacoustic probe and the strong potential of silica-coated SPION as a
   possible photoacoustic contrast agent was demonstrated. This study opens
   the way for future clinical applications of nanoparticle-enhanced
   photoacoustic imaging in cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, samples are collected on-site (i.e., in the field) and
   are shipped to a lab for chemical analysis. An alternative is offered by
   using portable chemical analysis instruments that can be used on-site
   (i.e., in the field).
   Many analytical measurements by optical emission spectrometry require
   use of light-sources and of spectral lines that are in the Ultra-Violet
   (UV, similar to 200 nm-400 nm wavelength) region of the spectrum. For
   such measurements, a portable, battery-operated, fiber-optic
   spectrometer equipped with an un-cooled, linear, solid-state detector
   may be used. To take full advantage of the advanced measurement
   capabilities offered by state-of-the-art solid-state detectors, cooling
   of the detector is required. But cooling and other thermal management
   hamper portability and use on-site because they add size and weight and
   they increase electrical power requirements. To address these
   considerations, an alternative was implemented, as described here.
   Specifically, a microfabricated solid-state detector for measurement of
   UV photons will be described. Unlike solid-state detectors developed on
   crystalline Silicon, this miniaturized and low-cost detector utilizes
   amorphous Selenium (a-Se) as its photosensitive material. Due to its low
   dark current, this detector does not require cooling, thus it is better
   suited for portable use and for chemical measurements on-site. In this
   paper, a microplasma will be used as a light-source of UV-photons for
   the a-Se detector. For example, spectra acquired using a microplasma as
   a light-source will be compared with those obtained with a portable,
   fiber-optic spectrometer equipped with a Si-based 2080-element detector.
   And, analytical performance obtained by introducing ng-amounts of
   analytes into the microplasma will be described.}},

Abstract = {{A humidity fiber optic sensor based on phase-shifted (PS) fiber Bragg
   Gratings (FBG) is demonstrated in this paper. The sensor (PS-FBG) is
   coated with a moisture sensitive polyimide. When this thin coating is
   exposed to moisture its swells, hence inducing tensile stress on the
   PS-FBG and affecting its Bragg wavelength. Due to its intrinsic
   properties, the PS-FBG sensor presents the same trend of wavelength
   variation as standard fiber Bragg Grating sensor but with higher
   measurement resolution, and reliable measurements can be obtained in
   different humidity and temperature environments. This paper assesses the
   suitability, including sensitivity and response time, of the
   phase-shifted FBG sensor approach for humidity sensing. By monitoring
   this change, it is demonstrated that the humidity level of the
   environment can be accurately monitored.}},

   inclusions. The method comprised four steps. In the first step, the
   feasibility of the design is checked through a set of constraints. The
   second and third steps provide an iterative procedure to capture the
   desired magnetic properties. Finally, the geometrical elements, i.e.,
   the area and perimeter of inclusions, are calculated. The technique is
   applied to design of an AMM structure based on Rose curve resonators.
   The design based on the proposed methodology is verified by the

Abstract = {{In order to improve the performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) based
   detectors, it is beneficial to operate the device at high electric field
   (>= 10 V/mu m). Increasing the electric field reduces the ionization
   energy and increases the hole mobility within the a-Se detector. In
   order for a practical a-Se detector to be capable of working at a high
   electric field, injection of holes from the positively biased electrode
   and injection of electrons from the negatively biased electrode should
   be prevented. We have investigated different organic materials with high
   ionization potential as hole-blocking contacts for a-Se based
   photodetectors. The effect of the organic layer thickness on the dark
   current and photocurrent performance of the detector was examined. It
   was found that the injection of holes could be reduced at high electric
   fields by increasing the thickness of the organic layer.}},

   generation and re-absorption of characteristic x rays, spreading due to
   Compton scattering and high-energy secondary electron transport, and
   drift and diffusion of electron-hole pairs under the applied external
   electric field. The transport of electron-hole pairs is achieved with a
   spatiotemporal model that accounts for recombination and trapping of
   carriers and Coulombic effects of 3D spatial charge distribution. The
   location information for each detected electron and hole over millions
   of simulation histories are used to build the detector point response. A
   range of incident x-ray energies are simulated from 10 to 100 keV. The
   simulated detector point response can be used to study the spatial

   ease of fabrication (no p(+) layer), and faster speed at the cost of
   slightly reduced responsivity. The experimental results of dark and
   photocurrent measurements as well as the responsivity for two in-house

Abstract = {{Cost and accessibility are major barriers to x-ray medical diagnostic
   screening in low- to mid-income countries. The cost of traditional
   medical-grade x-ray imaging systems is prohibitively large except to
   major hospitals in urban centers, preventing the early diagnosis of many
   curable diseases. Sputum, blood and urine tests are slower, and
   difficult to administer in remote locations, having high associated
   transportation and storage costs. A low-cost, tuberculosis-specific,
   teleradiology-enabled, digital x-ray imaging system is proposed that
   will make diagnosis fast, accessible and inexpensive. A system of this
   type would ideally cost below \$10,000 and is achievable today using a
   combination of commodity and industrial products, region-of-interest
   imaging, and an optimization of resolution and sensitivity requirements
   for the task of screening pulmonary tuberculosis.
   In this research, we report preliminary investigations we have carried
   out on the x-ray detector, a PerkinElmer (XRD 0820) industrial-grade,
   8{''}x8{''} flat-panel, amorphous silicon array with 200 micron pixels.
   Detective quantum efficiency (DQE), modulation transfer function (MTF)

   the filler metal and Pt-Ag nanoparticle, which is important for the
   joint strength and normally does not occur during joining. The minimum

Abstract = {{A new idea is presented which develops a general model predicting the
   deflection profile of clamped circular diaphragm of Capacitive
   Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) in order to calculate its
   capacitance. The CMUTs we consider is made of silicon nitride material
   which is widely used because of its low intrinsic stress. And the
   general model proposed in this paper is highly accurate in predicting
   the deformed membranes and exhibits excellent agreement with 3D-FEA
   results in capacitance deviation less than 1\%. These new established
   deflection functions can be used to implement a much higher accurate
   design methodology for CMUTs and other MEMS-based capacitive type
   sensors built with circular diaphragm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new MEMS capacitive temperature sensor is presented
   which is based on a circular silicon plate with a gold annulus deposited
   on top forming a novel bimaterial structure. The bimaterial structure is
   anchored to a substrate on its edge and forms the top electrode of a
   capacitor. A stationary silicon electrode beneath the bimaterial
   structure forms the second electrode. The PolyMUMPs (R) foundry process
   has been used to fabricate the device. Experiments show that for an
   effective area of about 0.1 mm(2) this MEMS capacitive temperature
   sensor achieves a sensitivity of 0.75 +/- 0.25 fF/degrees C over the
   temperature range of 25 to 225 degrees C, which shows an improvement of
   more than 25\% over equivalent microcantilever devices with the same
   effective area. Numerical modeling is used to show that the new design
   exhibits high flexibility in tailoring its thermomechanical response
   over the desired temperature range. The simplicity of its design and
   flexibility of the materials from which it can be constructed also makes
   this new MEMS sensor a good on-chip temperature measurement device for
   MEMS characterization.}},

Abstract = {{We designed a dual-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) which

   ranged from 8.3 to 11 A m(-2) of membrane surface area for chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) loading rate 0.3-6.3 kg COD/m(3) d. Hydrogen
   recovery (from coulombs to H-2) was as high as 93 +/- 25\% in the MEC,
   and hydrogen production rate ranged from 66.4 +/- 18.0 to 137.2 +/- 14.4
   L H-2/m(2) d at an applied voltage of similar to 1.2 V. As a result, H-2

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Number = {{2329}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an empirical study focusing on identifying the main
   factors that affect the capacity and free-flow speed (FFS) of urban
   freeways under inclement winter weather conditions. The weather and road
   surface condition factors examined include air temperature, wind speed,
   hourly snow intensity, visibility, snow on ground, and road surface
   condition describing the road slipperiness caused mainly by snow events.
   Data on traffic operations and the associated weather and road
   conditions observed at two freeway locations over the 2010-2012 winter
   seasons were used in an extensive statistical analysis. Linear
   regression models were calibrated for both capacity and FFS reductions
   as related to various weather and road condition variables. It was found
   that visibility and road surface conditions had a statistically
   significant effect on both capacity and FFS. Snow intensity was found to
   be significant only when the visibility factor was excluded; this
   finding suggests a refutation of these two factors on capacity and FFS.
   The modeling results were compared with those recommended by the Highway
   Capacity Manual 2010, showing that, in many cases, the manual could
   underestimate or overestimate the effects of winter weather conditions
   and that the proposed models provided a more reasonable estimate at a
   higher level of granularity.}},

Abstract = {{The support of delay-sensitive applications like VoIP, video
   conferencing, video streaming, etc. on scheduled mesh networks requires
   careful configuration of routing and scheduling. We formulate a
   delay-optimal joint routing and scheduling optimization problem that
   minimizes the maximum average delay perceived by any flow under the
   physical interference model.
   Due to the non-convex nature of this proposed problem, we cannot find
   the globally optimal joint routing and scheduling that minimizes the
   maximum per flow average delay. We overcome this issue by fixing the
   routing which makes the problem convex and then compute the optimal
   scheduling that results in minimum delay. We investigate several
   different routing strategies and compare the per flow average min-max
   delay when the scheduling is computed optimally. Based on these results,
   we provide engineering insights on configuring a wireless network for
   delay-sensitive applications.}},

Abstract = {{User data may be stored in a cloud to take advantage of its scalability,
   accessibility, and economics. However, data of a sensitive nature must
   be protected from being read in the clear by an untrusted cloud
   provider. It is also beneficial to provide finite time limits on access
   to the data by users. A key management scheme is proposed where
   encrypted key shares are stored in the cloud and automatically deleted
   based on passage of time or user activity. The accessibility of the data
   gradually expires and revocation occurs as a result of the loss of
   sufficient key shares. The process does not require additional
   coordination by the data owner, which is of advantage to a very large
   population of resource-constrained mobile users. The rate of expiration
   may be controlled through the initial allocation of shares and the
   heuristics for removal. Subscription to user data is maintained through
   regular re-generation of shares. A simulation of the scheme and also its
   implementation on commercial mobile and cloud platforms demonstrate its
   practical performance.}},

Abstract = {{We report a micro-scale microbial fuel cell (MFC), having an
   ultramicroelectrode (UME) as its anode, aiming for a miniaturized energy
   converter of carbon-neutral renewable energy. Micro-scale MFCs have been
   studied for many years, yet the power density of them is orders of
   magnitude lower than that of macro-scale counterparts. In order to
   address this limitation, this work utilizes a ring-shape UME, which aims
   to enhance the diffusion of ions at the vicinity of micro-organisms,
   forming their biofilm on the UME. Areal and volumetric power densities
   of 7.72 W/m(2) and 3,658 W/m(3) are obtained, respectively; both are the
   highest ever reported among all MFCs to date, regardless of their sizes.
   In addition to the power densities, coulombic efficiency (CE) of 70 \%
   and energy efficiencies of 20 \% are marked, which makes the micro-scale
   MFC an attractive alternative in existing energy conversion portfolio.}},

   investigates the mobility models for multiple mobile sensor's motion
   strategy. After discussing several state-of-the-art approaches in the

   anti-flocking (AF) mobility model. This model mimics the social
   behaviours of solitary animals. Extensive experiments based on a
   multi-agent simulation system with differing numbers of mobile sensors

Abstract = {{Inferring causal dependences in a family of dynamic systems from a
   finite set of observations is a problem encountered in many applications
   that arise in a diverse variety of fields; ranging from economics and
   finance to climatology and neuroscience. Given a set of random
   processes, the objective is to determine whether one process is
   influenced by the others and to investigate the nature of this influence
   in case a dependence relation is identified. The notion of
   Granger-causality may be used in this context to measure and quantify
   causal structures. Ideally, in order to infer the complete
   interdependence structure of a complex system, one should simultaneously
   consider the dynamic behaviour of all the processes involved. However,
   for large networks, such a method becomes exceedingly complicated. In
   this paper, we consider an interdependent group of jointly wide sense
   stationary real-valued stochastic processes and investigate the problem
   of determining Granger-causality by identifying pairwise causal
   relations. It is seen that while such methods may not reveal all details
   of a system, they can nonetheless provide useful and reasonably accurate
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Delay/Disruption tolerant networks (DTNs) are self-organized wireless
   ad-hoc networks, where end-to-end connectivity can not be guaranteed and
   communications rely on the assumption that the nodes are willing to
   store-carry-and-forward bundles in an opportunistic way. However, this
   assumption would be easily violated due to the selfish nodes which are
   unwilling to consume precious wireless resources by serving as bundle
   relays. To apply conventional reputation based incentive schemes in DTNs
   is extraordinarily challenging due to the unique network
   characteristics. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose
   SUCCESS, a secure user-centric and social-aware reputation based
   incentive scheme for DTNs. Different from conventional reputation
   schemes which rely on neighboring nodes to monitor the traffic and keep
   tracks of each other's reputation, SUCCESS allows a node to manage its
   reputation evidence and demonstrate its reputation whenever necessary.
   Two concepts, self-check and community-check, are defined for reputation
   evaluation according to the candidate's forwarding competency and the
   sufficiency of the evidence shown by the node itself, and for speeding
   up reputation establishment and forming consensus views towards targets
   in the same community, respectively. Extensive performance analysis and
   simulations are given to demonstrate the security, effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A high-speed data-search mechanism, called a synchronous overlapped
   search mechanism (SOSM) that enables a next-word search after searching
   just a few bits of the current word by simple pre-computation in most
   cases, is introduced for a content-addressable memory (CAM). Since there
   are no delay elements in the proposed hardware based on the SOSM, the
   hardware is robust against timing variation, maintaining high-throughput
   computing under serious process variation. A 128x64-bit CAM is designed
   with considering 30\% variations of threshold voltages under a 45nm CMOS
   technology and operates at 4.2x faster throughput than that of a
   conventional CAM with 12.3\% energy overhead.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel technique for simultaneous linearity and
   efficiency enhancement of class-D amplifiers by combining a low
   frequency sinusoid, known as dither, with a bandpass signal. The
   proposed technique improves the linearity due to dither averaging
   effect, and power efficiency, due to the reduction of reactive loss. The
   feasibility of the idea is verified through realization and measurement
   of a 65nm TSMC CMOS voltage mode class-D amplifier operating at 1 GHz.
   The drain efficiency is enhanced from 19.2 to 37 percent, while

Abstract = {{Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed as a tool in order to
   demonstrate yet another application of the technique, and, most
   importantly, to show that results from the statistical multivariate
   technique do make physico-chemical sense. The operation of a typical
   emulsion copolymerization of acrylonitrile and butadiene (nitrile
   butadiene rubber, NBR) is used as an example of process troubleshooting.
   In more general terms, a statistical tool is used to aid process data
   analysis and process operation (recipe, product property)
   troubleshooting. The goal is to produce consistent Mooney Viscosity (MV)
   among different batches. The observation is that varying induction times
   lead to Mooney Viscosity inconsistencies. Firstly, we show results from
   the application of PCA to process data. Secondly, we deal with an even
   more important (and often ignored) question by examining whether the

Pages = {{1681-1691}},
Abstract = {{The Lake Athabasca drainage area in northern Canada encompasses
   ecologically rich and sensitive ecosystems, vast forests, glacier-clad
   mountains, and abundant oil reserves in the form of oil sands. The basin
   includes the Peace-Athabasca Delta, recognized internationally by UNESCO
   and the Ramsar Convention as a biologically rich inland delta and
   wetland that are now under increasing pressure from multiple stressors.
   In this study, streamflow variability and trends for rivers feeding Lake
   Athabasca are investigated over the last half century. Hydrological
   regimes and trends are established using a robust regime shift detection
   method and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, respectively. Results show that
   the Athabasca River, which is the main contributor to the total lake
   inflow, experienced marked declines in recent decades impacting lake
   levels and its ecosystem. From 1960 to 2010 there was a significant
   reduction in lake inflow and a significant recession in the Lake
   Athabasca level. Our trend analysis corroborates a previous study using
   proxy data obtained from nearby sediment cores suggesting that the lake
   level may drop 2 to 3m by 2100. The lake recession may threaten the
   flora and fauna of the Athabasca Lake basin and negatively impact the
   ecological cycle of an inland freshwater delta and wetland of global
   importance.}},

Abstract = {{A linear piston hydraulic angular-velocity-based control knee joint was
   designed for people with knee-extensor weakness to engage knee-flexion
   resistance when knee-flexion angular velocity reaches a preset
   threshold, such as during a stumble, but to otherwise allow free knee
   motion. During mechanical testing at the lowest angular-velocity
   threshold, the device engaged within 2 degrees knee flexion and resisted
   moment loads of over 150 Nm. The device completed 400,000 loading cycles
   without mechanical failure or wear that would affect function. Gait
   patterns of nondisabled participants were similar to normal at walking
   speeds that produced below-threshold knee angular velocities. Fast
   walking speeds, employed purposely to attain the angular-velocity
   threshold and cause knee-flexion resistance, reduced maximum knee
   flexion by approximately 25 degrees but did not lead to unsafe gait
   patterns in foot ground clearance during swing. In knee collapse tests,
   the device successfully engaged knee-flexion resistance and stopped knee
   flexion with peak knee moments of up to 235.6 Nm. The outcomes from this
   study support the potential for the linear piston hydraulic knee joint
   in knee and knee-ankle-foot orthoses for people with lower-limb
   weakness.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{28-40}},
Abstract = {{The structural reliability analysis is typically based on a model that
   describes the response, such as maximum deformation or stress, as a
   function of several random variables. In principle, reliability can be
   evaluated once the probability distribution of the response becomes
   available. The paper presents a new method to derive the probability
   distribution of a function of random variables representing the
   structural response. The derivation is based on the maximum entropy
   principle in which constraints are specified in terms of the fractional
   moments, in place of commonly used integer moments. In order to compute
   the fractional moments of the response function, a multiplicative form
   of dimensional reduction method (M-DRM) is presented. Several examples
   presented in the paper illustrate the numerical accuracy and efficiency
   of the proposed method in comparison to the Monte Carlo simulation

Title = {{Estimation of parameters of degradation growth rate distribution from
   noisy measurement data}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{60-69}},
Abstract = {{An accurate estimation of the degradation growth rate is necessary for
   reliability analysis and fitness-for-service assessment of engineering
   components and structures. The growth rate analysis is based on repeated
   measurements of flaw sizes created by a degradation process over time in
   a component population. The flaw size measurements by inspection tools
   invariably include noise or sizing error, which complicates the
   estimation of growth rate. Most engineering models dealing with this
   issue do not properly account for the probabilistic structure of noisy
   data. Furthermore, the fact that the prediction of future degradation
   should be consistent with the model of underlying degradation process is
   often overlooked.
   This paper presents a comprehensive two-stage hierarchical model of
   noisy degradation measurement data, and formulates the associated
   maximum likelihood function. The parameter estimation is subsequently
   carried out in the spirit of well-known empirical Bayes method. The
   analysis is further extended to the prediction of the distributions of
   future degradation, remaining lifetime and reliability of components in
   both inspected and un-inspected component populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel technique for simultaneous linearity and
   efficiency enhancement of class-D amplifiers by combining a low
   frequency sinusoid, known as dither, with a bandpass signal. The
   proposed technique improves the linearity due to dither averaging
   effect, and power efficiency, due to the reduction of reactive loss. The
   feasibility of the idea is verified through realization and measurement
   of a 65nm TSMC CMOS voltage mode class-D amplifier operating at 1 GHz.
   The drain efficiency is enhanced from 19.2 to 37 percent, while
   providing ACPR of - 33dBc for the first adjacent WCDMA channel.}},

Abstract = {{Surface morphology, surface wettability, and size distribution of
   biomaterials affect their in vitro and in vivo bone regeneration
   potential. Since nano-hydroxyapatite has a great chemical and structural
   similarity to natural bone and dental tissues, incorporated biomaterial
   of such products could improve bioactivity and bone bonding ability. In
   this research, nano-hydroxyapatite (23 +/- 0.09 nm) and its composites
   with variety of chitosan content {[}2, 4, and 6 g (45 +/- 0.19, 32 +/-
   0.12, and 28 +/- 0.12 nm, respectively)] were prepared via an in situ
   hybridization route. Size distribution of the particles, protein
   adsorption, and calcium deposition of powders by the osteoblast cells,
   gene expression and percentage of new bone formation area were
   investigated. The highest degree of bone regeneration potential was
   observed in nano-hydroxyapatite powder, while the bone regeneration was
   lowest in nano-hydroxyapatite with 6 g of chitosan. Regarding these
   data, suitable size distribution next to size distribution of
   hydroxyapatite in bone, smaller size, higher wettability, lower surface
   roughness of the nano-hydroxyapatite particles and homogeneity in
   surface resulted in higher protein adsorption, cell differentiation and
   percentage of bone formation area. Results obtained from in vivo and in
   vitro tests confirmed the role of surface morphology, surface
   wettability, mean size and size distribution of biomaterial besides
   surface chemistry as a temporary bone substitute.}},

   blind source separation}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{423-438}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel damage detection algorithm is developed based on
   blind source separation in conjunction with time-series analysis. Blind
   source separation (BSS), is a powerful signal processing tool that is
   used to identify the modal responses and mode shapes of a vibrating
   structure using only the knowledge of responses. In the proposed method,
   BSS is first employed to estimate the modal response using the vibration
   measurements. Time-series analysis is then performed to characterize the
   mono-component modal responses and successively the resulting
   time-series models are utilized for one-step ahead prediction of the
   modal response. With the occurrence of newer measurements containing the
   signature of damaged system, a variance-based damage index is used to
   identify the damage instant. Once the damage instant is identified, the
   damaged and undamaged modal parameters of the system are estimated in an
   adaptive fashion. The proposed method solves classical damage detection
   issues including the identification of damage instant, location as well
   as the severity of damage. The proposed damage detection algorithm is
   verified using extensive numerical simulations followed by the full
   scale study of UCLA Factor building using the measured responses under
   Parkfield earthquake.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Computing Resource Allocation for Mobile Cloud Computing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing (MCC) enables mobile devices to outsource their
   computing, storage and other tasks onto the cloud to achieve more
   capacities and higher performance. One of the most critical research
   issues is how the cloud can efficiently handle the possible overwhelming
   requests from mobile users when the cloud resource is limited. In this
   paper, a novel MCC adaptive resource allocation model is proposed to
   achieve the optimal resource allocation in terms of the maximal overall
   system reward by considering both cloud and mobile devices. To achieve
   this goal, we model the adaptive resource allocation as a semi-Markov
   decision process (SMDP) to capture the dynamic arrivals and departures
   of resource requests. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate
   that our proposed model can achieve higher system reward and lower
   service blocking probability compared to traditional approaches based on
   greedy resource allocation algorithm. Performance comparisons with
   various MCC resource allocation schemes are also provided.}},

Pages = {{215-219}},
Abstract = {{Myopia is a refractive error of the eye and is characterized by an
   increase in the axial length of the eye. The exact mechanisms for the
   axial elongation are still unknown. Higher intraocular pressure (TOP)
   has been associated with myopia and could be involved in eye enlargement
   along with other factors. However, studying the creep behaviour of the
   scleral tissue of the eye due to increased TOP and extraocular muscle
   forces is difficult. The present study develops a finite element (FE)
   model of the chick eye to study the development of refractive error in
   the eye due to external mechanical forces and TOP. Chick eyes were
   harvested from young chickens. The TOP inside the eye was increased
   using a specialized apparatus. The deformation of the eyes was measured
   in the axial and radial directions using digital photographs. A chick
   eye was frozen, sliced, and photographed. The images were aligned and
   segmented. A three-dimensional geometric model of the corneo-scleral
   shell was built from the segmented images. A FE model of the chick eye
   was then developed. Hyperelastic material properties were used to model
   the cornea and scleral tissues. The pressure inside the FE model was
   increased and the resulting deformation of the model was measured. The
   results were compared with the experimental measurements. The
   deformation modes of the FE model were similar to those observed in
   experiments. The FE model of the eye was elongated in the axial
   direction and contracted in the radial direction, similar to the eyes in
   the experiment. The developed FE model can be used to study the
   development of myopia due to mechanical forces.}},

Abstract = {{A novel compact low-profile frequency selective surface (FSS) with

   consists of a stacked periodic array of square loops and complementary
   apertures, respectively centered within a wire grid and an aperture
   grid, which can create three transmission poles and two transmission
   zeros. Controllable triband performance is achieved, allowing the FSS to
   transmit the signal at 4 GHz while reflecting the signals at 6 and 9.5
   GHz. Due to the compact and low-profile structure, the designed FSS has
   a reduced sensitivity to the incident angle compared to traditional
   triband FSSs. An equivalent circuit model is proposed for predicting and
   analyzing the frequency characteristics of this structure. For
   demonstration, a prototype of the proposed FSS is fabricated and

Abstract = {{The risk of CO2 leakage and the very slow rate of CO2 dissolution in
   brine present major technical challenges for secure implementation of
   CO2 sequestration at large scale in saline aquifers. To tackle these
   issues, a new technology based on Ex-Situ Dissolution Approach (ESDA)
   was developed recently aiming at dissolving CO2 in brine phase prior to
   injection into the aquifer to eliminate or minimize the risk of leakage
   and accelerate CO2 dissolution rate in brine. The ESDA is based on the
   mass transfer from CO2 droplets into brine in cocurrent pipeline flow.
   This paper presents mass transfer modeling associated with the ESDA
   process concerning the evolution of the droplet size and the pressure
   change along the pipeline. In addition, a technical and economic
   feasibility of the ESDA in comparison with the standard carbon capture
   and storage (CCS) technologies is presented. Various aspects such as CO2
   displacement, geochemical reactions, CO2 leakage, pressure build-up,
   well spacing, and dissolution efficiency for the ESDA are also
   discussed. This study enables the evaluation of the ESDA process for CO2
   sequestration through a systematic way.}},

Title = {{Optimization of slicing direction in laminated tooling for volume
   deviation reduction}},
Journal = {{ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{139-148}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Due to an uncertainty between actual model and assembled
   slices, there is always an extra material on assembled slices in
   laminated tooling. Therefore, a post processing, usually CNC machining,
   is required to remove this extra material and reach the near net shape
   surface for final product. One of the issues in laminated tooling is to
   minimize the amount of this extra material and reduce the cost of the
   post processing. Direction of slicing is an important parameter in this
   issue. This research aims to introduce a method to find the best slicing
   direction based on CAD model surface geometry and minimize the amount of
   the extra material in the assembled slices. Researches on the best
   slicing direction investigation so far were mostly based on the extra
   volume calculation for a number of candidate directions. Since the time
   needed for the extra volume calculation is proportionally high, the
   number of candidate directions to be investigated was usually limited,
   whereas, in the proposed method, the best slicing direction is found
   based on CAD model surface geometry and there is no need to find the
   actual amount of the extra volume. Moreover, the suggested method is
   developed to the cases where having more than one slicing direction is
   desirable for more reduction in the amount of the extra volume. The
   proposed optimization method can be used to find the best slicing
   direction in laminated tooling. Moreover, the ability to suggest
   multiple slicing directions can provide more reduction for the amount of
   the extra material. However, the number of candidate directions in the
   case of multiple slicing directions is limited due to joining problems
   in laminated tooling.
   Design/methodology/approach - The investigation is based on the
   situation of normal vectors on CAD model surface. The CAD model surface
   is considered as a combination of planar tiles and all normal vectors of
   these tiles are considered as the candidate directions. This provides a
   number of candidates that can cover almost all possible slicing
   directions. The best slicing direction is then found by estimating the
   amount of the extra material produced on the tiles by each normal
   vector.
   Findings - The proposed method applied to some examples. The case
   studies included the simple predictable models to qualify the
   reliability of the proposed method. Also more applicable examples were
   provided to show how the suggested method acts in real cases.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed method can be applied
   to each and every CAD model. Therefore, there is no limitation with
   regard to the type of model which can be investigated by the proposed
   method. However, there is limitation on the number of times the building
   direction can be changed in laminated tooling.
   Practical implications - The proposed method can be employed to reduce
   the post processing time in laminated tooling.
   Originality/value - Following the prior study researchers conducted in
   optimization of laminated dies, another parameter, slicing direction, is
   considered in this research. This brings a new approach on laminated
   dies optimization to reduce the production cost.}},

Abstract = {{The alizarin-TiO2 system has drawn much attention in studying the dye
   sensitizing mechanism for developing cost-effective dye sensitized solar
   cells (DSSC). In this study theoretical investigations are performed on
   an alizarin-anatase complex consisting of one alizarin molecule and a
   TiO2 cluster which contains seven titanium atoms. The ground states were
   optimized for the alizarin molecule, TiO2 cluster and alizarin-anatase
   complex using the first principle approach. To study the dye sensitizing
   process and its pH dependency, electronic-structural transitions of
   these neutral and anion alizarin-anatase clusters from their HOMO
   (highest occupied molecular orbital, denoted as H) level to the
   respective LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, denoted as L)
   level are investigated by means of the time dependent density functional
   theory (TDDFT). These sensitizing processes corresponding to three
   different clusters are found being theoretically distinguishable under
   various pH conditions. The two dominant electronic transitions for the
   neutral cluster are found being H - 2 -> L + 8 and H - 1 -> L + 4, while
   the latter becomes important for larger alizarin-anatase clusters. For
   two anion clusters the primary electronic transitions are found being H
   -> L - 1 and H - 1 -> L - 1.}},

Abstract = {{A functional structure of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-on-polyaniline nanocomposites
   with high dielectric absorbing properties and electromagnetic shielding
   effectiveness at low frequencies was successfully fabricated through a
   facile in situ emulsion polymerization. Polyaniline (PANI) was doped
   with hydrochloric acid to improve its electrical properties and
   interactions with ferrite nanoparticles. The electrostatic force,
   paramagnetic force and hydrogen bonding strongly bonded or assembled
   ferrite nanoparticles on the polyaniline surface and improved the
   thermal stability of the polyaniline nanostructure. Polyaniline
   nanofibers were found to have an average diameter of 100 nm and length
   of 500 nm, consisting of a bundle of smaller individual units, whereas
   ferrite nanoparticles were of spherical shape with an average diameter
   30 nm. The research findings show that ferrite particles overcome the
   common problem of aggregation and evenly dispersed on the surface of
   polyaniline. The ferrite-grafted polyaniline nanostructures were
   demonstrated as a promising functional material for the absorbing of
   electromagnetic microwaves because of a large amount of dipole
   polarizations in the polymer backbone and at the interfaces of the
   ferrite nanoparticles and polyaniline nanofibers. Both the complex
   permittivity and shielding effectiveness of the ferrite-grafted
   polyaniline nanocomposites increased with the increasing weight
   percentage of PANI. There is also a good match of real and imaginary
   parts of the complex permittivity, giving rise to almost an equal
   dielectric loss angle tangent in the measured frequency (30 MHz to 1
   GHz). This superior property allows the nanocomposites to function
   within an extended absorbing band.}},

   series system reliability analysis that can be solved using the
   distribution of maximum output error. To derive this distribution,
   fractional moments of the output error are estimated from a small
   simulated sample of trajectories of mechanism motion which serve as
   constraints in the minimization of cross entropy. The proposed method is
   illustrated by analyzing the reliability slider-crank and a four-bar
   function generator. The comparison of the results with those obtained
   from the Monte Carlo simulations confirms the high accuracy of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical stimulation is a key technique used for controlling the
   mechanical properties of tissue engineered articular cartilage
   constructs proposed for defect repair. The present study introduces a
   new technical method and device for `hydromechanical' stimulation of
   tissue engineered articular cartilage constructs. The stimulation
   consists of simultaneous cyclic compression, frictional shear from a
   sliding indenter contact and direct pressurized fluid perfusion. Each of
   these modes of mechanical loading has been shown by other research
   groups to effectively stimulate tissue engineered constructs. A device
   for applying these conditions was designed, developed and tested. Two
   sets (high and low perfusion flow rates) of three experiments were
   performed, each with two samples subjected to hydromechanical
   stimulation conditions (compression and friction forces along with
   perfusion). Two other samples from each set were subjected to just
   compression and dynamic frictional shear forces, and two more were used
   as controls (not stimulated). The average amount of glycosaminoglycan
   retained in the constructs after 3 weeks ranked from low to high as
   follows: controls, hydromechanical conditions with the low-flow rate,
   hydromechanical conditions with the high-flow rate and just compression
   plus dynamic frictional shear. Statistically significant differences
   were not detected. However, future studies would focus on
   glycosaminoglycan production in the superficial zone, measuring the
   glycosaminoglycan released to the nutrient media, and address altering
   the hydromechanical stimulation parameters using the results of the
   present study as guidance, in attempts to achieve statistically
   significant increases in glycosaminoglycan production compared with the
   controls.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a unified static framework to study the interplay of user
   association and resource allocation in heterogeneous cellular networks.
   This framework allows us to compare the performance of three channel
   allocation strategies: Orthogonal deployment, Co-channel deployment, and
   Partially Shared deployment. We have formulated joint optimization
   problems that are non-convex integer programs, are NP-hard, and hence it
   is difficult to efficiently obtain exact solutions. We have, therefore,
   developed techniques to obtain upper bounds on the system's performance.
   We show that these upper bounds are tight by comparing them to feasible
   solutions. We have used these upper bounds as benchmarks to quantify how
   well different user association rules and resource allocation schemes
   perform. Our numerical results indicate that significant gains in
   throughput are achievable for heterogeneous networks if the right
   combination of user association and resource allocation is used. Noting
   the significant impact of the association rule on the performance, we
   propose a simple association rule that performs much better than all
   existing user association rules.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{We investigate channel-coded physical-layer network coding in a two-way
   relaying scenario, where the end nodes A and B choose their symbols, S-A
   and S-B, from a small non-binary field, F, and adopt a non-binary PSK
   modulation. The relay then directly decodes the network-coded
   combination aS(A) + bS(B) over F from the noisy received superimposed
   channel-encoded packets. The advantage of working over non-binary fields
   is that it offers the opportunity to decode according to multiple
   decoding coefficients (a, b). As only one of the network-coded
   combinations needs to be successfully decoded, a key advantage is then a
   reduction in error probability by attempting to decode against all
   choices of (a, b). In this paper, we compare different mappings between
   F and the PSK constellation, and prove that many have identical
   performance in terms of frame error rate (FER). Moreover, we derive a
   lower bound on the performance of decoding the network-coded
   combinations. Simulation results show that if we adopt either i)
   concatenated Reed-Solomon and convolutional coding or ii) low-density
   parity check codes, our non-binary constellations can outperform the
   binary case significantly in the sense of minimizing the FER and, in
   particular, the ternary constellation has the best FER performance among
   all considered cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel micro-domain force estimation method for
   applications in a magnetic-haptic micromanipulation platform (MHMP). The
   MHMP employs the magnetic levitation technology in micro-domain worlds
   for ultra-high precision micromanipulation. In the MHMP, a microrobot
   that consists of a magnetic head and a body that includes electronic
   parts and an end-effector is manipulated by regulating an external
   magnetic field. The MHMP has been equipped with a haptic technology to
   allow a human operator to feel micro-domain environments and to
   intervene in dexterous tasks due to the poor knowledge from
   micro-worlds. To preserve a high feeling of a micro-domain environment
   for a human operator, the applied force/torque from the environment to
   the microrobot are required to be directly measured by specific sensors.
   Due to the size restriction, attaching force sensors to our microrobot
   is impractical. Therefore, we use a combination of Hall-effect sensor in
   the structure of the MHMP to estimate a single-axis force, eliminating
   the need for sensors on the microrobot. The Hall-sensors measure the
   magnetic flux and determine the location of the horizontally zero
   magnetic field gradient, B-max location. It was realized that the
   applied force from the environment to the microrobot is linearly
   proportional to the distance of the microrobot from the B-max location.
   The magnetic force which is equal to the environment force is calibrated
   using a cantilever deflection. The developed micro-domain force
   estimation method is verified experimentally, and it was demonstrated
   that this method has promising potential in estimating the environmental
   force applied to the microrobot in a non-contact way.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets and graphene sheets (NiCo2O4-G) are
   combined as a hybrid material via a one-pot synthesis process to
   demonstrate excellent bi-functional catalytic activity towards both the
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
   Physical characterizations have confirmed the formation of NiCo2O4
   nanoplatelets created by selective adsorption of PVP onto specific
   crystal orientations, which provides spatial confinement for an
   anisotropic growth into 2-dimensional nanostructures. In addition, the
   decomposition of surface adsorbed PVP during the calcination process
   creates uniformly distributed meso-sized pores in the NiCo2O4
   nanoplatelets. The beneficial hybrid and PVP effects are investigated
   via half-cell testing with NiCo2O4-G in comparison to graphene-free
   NiCo2O4 and PVP-free NiCo2O4-G, respectively, where much lower
   activation energy and higher current densities are observed with the
   mesoporous NiCo2O4-G hybrid for both ORR and OER. Furthermore, the
   positive impact of Ni incorporation was exclusively demonstrated,
   whereby NiCo2O4-G outperformed Co3O4-G in terms of onset potential and
   current densities for both ORR and OER. This is attributed to the
   increased electrical conductivity and the creation of new active sites
   with much lower activation energy due to the incorporation of Ni cations
   into the octahedral sites of the spinel crystal structure. This cost
   effective and highly efficient bi-functional catalyst is highly suitable

Abstract = {{Fullerene (C-60) is known for its strong radical scavenging properties.
   Its applications in aqueous environments can be enhanced by grafting
   hydrophilic polymers to fullerenes. The radical scavenging kinetics of
   four water-soluble fullerene polymeric systems (C-60-PAA-C-60, PAA-C-60,
   PEO-b-PAA-C-60 and PDMA-C-60) were characterized using the
   1,1-diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) colorimetric assay. The radical
   scavenging process displayed a 2-stage kinetic trend, which correlates
   to the self-assembly behaviour of fullerene-polymer systems in aqueous
   solutions. Since a mixture of unimers and micelles exists, the first
   kinetic process is attributed to the scavenging property of the more
   accessible unimers, while the second stage corresponds to the scavenging
   behaviour of micelles. The rate of the micellar scavenging reaction is
   determined by the size of the micelle: the larger the micelle, the
   faster the reaction, as there is a larger number of fullerenes available
   for the scavenging reaction. These findings demonstrate the effect of
   nanostructure on the antioxidant efficiency of fullerene polymer
   solutions. Such knowledge will facilitate the design of optimally
   efficient radical scavenging fullerene-polymer systems.}},

Abstract = {{To improve vehicle fuel economy and crash worthiness the automotive
   industry has been redesigning parts from advanced high strength steels
   such as dual-phase and martensitic steels. These steels have high
   strengths with the higher formability characteristics when compared to
   lower strength conventional steels of similar ductility. These steels
   derive their unique properties from their complex microstructures
   containing ferrite and martensite. During assembly welding, the
   martensite within the sub-critical region of the heat-affected zone
   tempers, which locally reduces mechanical properties. Although this
   phenomenon is well studied, it has yet to be quantified. The present
   work proposes a technique to measure the softening kinetics of
   dual-phase and martensite steels using rapid isothermal tempering. The
   resulting model was then validated by predicting the heat-affect zone
   softening that occurs in laser and resistance spot welds as well as by
   comparing the microstructures of the rapid tempered samples to the
   microstructures found in the sub-critical heat-affected zone of welded
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{The role that water vapor plays in atmospheric phenomena is extremely
   important. Saturation of moist air at a given temperature and pressure
   occurs if its mixing ratio is such that the moist air can coexist in a
   stable condition with an associated condensed phase at the same
   temperature and pressure. The saturation mixing ratio is useful to
   calculate the relative humidity which is a ratio, expressed in percent,
   of the amount of water vapor in the air (actual mixing ratio) compared
   to the amount of water vapor the air can hold (saturation mixing ratio).
   In this work, an attempt has been made to develop a simple-to-use
   Arrhenius-type function to estimate the mixing ratio for saturated air
   over water as a function of pressure and temperature. Estimations have
   been found to be in excellent agreement with the data reported in the

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Microbial communities play a critical role in degrading organic
   contaminants in treatment wetlands; however, an understanding of the
   different roles played by rhizospheric, gravel-associated and
   interstitial microbial communities is deficient due to a lack of data
   directly comparing these microbial communities. Community level
   physiological profiling (CLPP) was used to compare the catabolic
   capabilities of rhizospheric, gravel-associated and interstitial
   microbial communities in vertical-flow planted and unplanted wetland
   mesocosms. Wetland mesocosms were decommissioned to gather microbial
   community samples associated with the roots and gravel bed media taken
   from the top (10 cm depth), middle (30 cm depth) and bottom (60 cm
   depth). The catabolic capabilities of the rhizospheric microbial
   communities were seen to be much greater than those of the
   gravel-associated communities. A decrease in catabolic capability was
   seen with increasing depth, suggesting that communities near the surface
   play a larger role in the degradation of carbon-based compounds. A
   general difference in catabolic profiles based on plant presence/absence
   was observed for the interstitial water and all gravel-associated
   samples at all depths, suggesting that the presence of roots within part
   of the mesocosm not only has a localized effect on the attached
   microbial population, but also on gravel-associated microbial
   communities throughout the mesocosms.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{270-276}},

Abstract = {{A key characteristic in the theory of the induced charge electrokinetic
   flow is the vortices generated by the interaction of the applied
   electric field with the induced dipolar electric double layers around an
   electrically conducting surface. The vortices can significantly
   influence the electrokinetic motion of a particle with an electrically
   conducting surface. This paper provides the visual evidence of the
   vortices in the induced charge electrokinetic flow in a ``DC field{''}
   around a metal surface that is ``not an active electrode{''}. According
   to authors' knowledge, this is the first experimental proof of
   induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena for DC electric field while all
   the literatures employed the AC field as the acting force during the
   experiments. Moreover, former studies had mostly reported the vortices
   around active electrode, used as a conducting surface. Current paper
   reports the induced vortices around a non-electrode conducting surface.
   In addition, the experimental results of this paper show that the
   measured velocity of the electrokinetic motion of particles with a metal
   hemisphere in a microchannel is much higher than that of the
   non-conducting polymer particles of the same size under the electric
   field. These experimental data agree well with the theoretical
   prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   liquid elastomers like polydimethylsiloxane on the SWCNT film, curing
   and peeling off the substrate. The replication strategy can produce
   elastic conductors with a flat or a desirable patterned surface. The
   resultant elastic conductors had excellent stability under repeated

   conductance even after 10 tape tests. Using the SWCNT-inlaid stretchable

Abstract = {{Dissolved air flotation (DAF) has been used for several decades in water
   treatment systems. It is a unit operation for the separation of solid
   and semisolid (floc) particles from a liquid phase that has been used
   for the clarification of potable water. The removal is achieved by
   dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then
   releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank or basin.
   The increased dissolved air concentration in water at elevated pressure
   is the fundamental principle that allows the formation of microbubbles.
   In this article a simple predictive tool is developed to estimate air
   saturated concentration in dissolved air flotation (DAF) systems.
   Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in
   the literature with average absolute deviation being around 0.5\%. The
   tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for
   process engineers to have a quick check of air concentration in
   dissolved air flotation systems (DAF) at various conditions without
   opting for any experimental trials. In particular, water practitioners
   and process engineers would find the proposed approach to be
   user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex
   expressions. (C) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

Abstract = {{The paper considers the problem of single-link failure localization in
   all-optical mesh networks. Our study follows a generic monitoring
   approach using supervisory lightpaths (S-LPs), in which a set of
   bi-directional monitoring trails (bm-trails) are defined and closely
   monitored, such that the network controller can achieve unambiguous
   failure localization (UFL) for any single link by collecting the flooded
   alarms from the affected bm-trails. With a target of minimizing the
   number of bm-trails (or the length of alarm codes) required for
   single-link UFL, the paper provides optimal (or essentially optimal)
   solutions to the bm-trail allocation problem on a number of well known
   topologies. First we demonstrate that the theoretical lower bound of
   inverted right perpendicularlog(2)(vertical bar E vertical
   bar+1)inverted left perpendicular bm-trails can be achieved in any 2 .
   inverted right perpendicularlog(2) (vertical bar E vertical bar +
   1)inverted left perpendicular connected graph, where vertical bar E
   vertical bar is the number of links. Next, we prove an essentially
   optimal solution for 1-by-N grid topologies (also known as chocolate bar
   graphs), where inverted right perpendicular0.42 + log(2) (vertical bar E
   vertical bar + 2)inverted left perpendicular bm-trails can be achieved.
   Based on the solution for chocolate bars, we further investigate
   bm-trail solutions to general 2-dimensional (2D) grid topologies, and
   the developed solution requires no more than 3 + inverted right
   perpendicularlog(2)(vertical bar E vertical bar + 1)inverted left
   perpendicular bm-trails for UFL. Such an optimal (or essentially
   optimal) logarithmic behavior, although has been well observed in
   general topologies in our previous studies {[}1], {[} 2], is formalized
   for the first time in this paper via a suite of polynomial-time
   deterministic constructions that consume less than a few seconds of
   running time in topologies of thousands of nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Capitalizing on the immense theoretical energy storage densities of
   metal-air batteries requires the development of high performance air
   electrode materials. These materials must simultaneously meet the
   criteria of high surface areas, excellent oxygen reduction reaction
   activity and low cost. Herein, catalyst materials with exemplary surface
   areas (2980 m(2) g(-1)) and ORR activity were developed by innovatively
   coupling KOH activation of exfoliated graphene with ammonia induced
   nitrogen doping (N-a-ex-G). Specifically, ORR activity approaching that
   of commercial platinum based catalysts was observed (ca. 45 mV lower
   onset potential), and these unique materials were found to provide
   excellent practical metal-air battery performance. In particular,
   N-a-ex-G provided a 60\% higher discharge current (on a catalyst mass
   basis at a cell voltage of 1.0 V) in a zinc-air battery single cell,
   along with higher discharge voltages and a 42\% capacitance increase in
   comparison with pure carbon black based electrodes in a Li-oxygen
   battery single cell. These promising results, attributed to the
   favourable properties of N-a-ex-G, including high surface areas and
   inherent ORR activity indicate their practicality as air cathode
   electrocatalysts.}},

Journal = {{PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{52-64}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Physical properties of soil vary from point to point in space and
   exhibit great uncertainty, suggesting random field as a natural approach
   in modelling and synthesizing these properties. The significance of
   considering spatial variability and uncertainty of soil properties is
   greatly manifested in the probabilistic seismic risk analysis of
   soil-structural system (nonlinear dynamic analysis under earthquake
   loading), where modelling and synthesis of the spatial variability and
   uncertainty of soil properties are necessary. This paper introduces a
   meshfree-Galerkin approach within the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion
   scheme for representation of spatial soil properties modelled as the
   random fields. The meshfree shape functions are introduced and employed
   as a set of basis functions in the Galerkin scheme to obtain the
   eigen-solutions of integral equation of K-L expansion. An optimization
   scheme is proposed for the resulting eigenvectors in treating the
   compatibility between the target and analytical covariance models.
   Assessments of the meshfree-Galerkin method are conducted for the
   resulting eigen-solutions and the representation of covariance models
   for various homogeneous and nonhomogeneous random fields. The accuracy
   and validity of the proposed approach are demonstrated through the
   modelling and synthesis of the spatial field models inferred from the
   field measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured magnesium nickel oxide (Mg0.6Ni0.4O) was synthesized by a
   self-propagating high temperature synthesis method followed by heat
   treatment. The particles of the resulting oxide were used as additives
   to prepare the sulfur/polyacrylonitrile/Mg0.6Ni0.4O (S/PAN/Mg0.6Ni0.4O)
   composite via wet ballmilling. The SEM observation revealed that the
   composite morphology was drastically changed by the addition of
   Mg0.6Ni0.4O, from smooth bulky particles of S/PAN to rough
   nanostructured agglomerates with two times the increase in the specific
   surface area, favouring the reactivity of the composite, and a
   homogeneous component distribution. Cyclic voltammetry, discharge-charge
   tests and ac impedance spectroscopy have shown improved conductivity and
   electrochemical properties of the composite by the addition of
   Mg0.6Ni0.4O, leading to high sulfur utilization and interfacial
   stabilization in a Li/S cell upon discharge-charge cycling. The cell
   demonstrated enhanced reversibility, resulting in a discharge capacity
   of about 1223 mA h g(-1) at the second cycle and retained about 100\% of
   this value over 100 cycles. Furthermore, the S/PAN/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite

   with a bandwidth of 22 MHz and demonstrates a tuning range of 110 MHz,
   while the quality factor is better than 374 (1300-374 over the tuning

Title = {{Fouling control and optimization of a drinking water membrane filtration
   process with real-time model parameter adaptation using fluorescence and
   permeate flux measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of fouling control strategies is crucial for the
   effective maintenance and long-term application of ultrafiltration (UF)
   membranes in drinking water treatment. Membrane cleaning methods such as
   membrane back-washing protocols are typically employed to remove the
   build-up of natural water species (foulants) on the surface and/or in
   the pores of the membranes, which causes membrane fouling, contributes
   to increased trans-membrane pressure and shortens membrane lifetime. In
   a previous work by the authors, a fluorescence-based principal component
   (PC) modelling approach, which was able to forecast membrane fouling
   behaviour of a bench-scale UF membrane set-up over a future time
   horizon, was introduced. This approach also proved suitable for
   estimating the optimum future membrane back-washing times required for
   controlling fouling and minimizing the energy demand for drinking water
   production. In this study, the forecasting ability of this model was
   improved by updating the model parameters with current process
   measurements. The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach was used to
   achieve this objective. The EKF approach accomplished real-time adaptive
   estimation of key model parameters based on either real-time UF flux
   measurements or PC scores related to fluorescence measurements of
   membrane permeate. The model predictions and the corresponding
   experimental UF flux data for different membrane fouling situations
   revealed that on-line permeate flux-based parameter adaptation showed
   improved model predictions as compared to PC score-based adaptation,
   especially for longer filtration times. The improvements in the accuracy
   of the fluorescence-based model forecasts also aided the estimation of
   optimum back-washing times with better accuracy resulting in
   considerable energy savings compared to back-washing estimates obtained
   without real-time parameter adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We develop a novel localization theory for networks of nodes that
   measure each other's bearing, i.e., we assume that nodes do not have the
   ability to perform measurements expressed in a common reference frame.
   We begin with some basic definitions of frame localizability and
   orientation localizability. Based on some key kinematic relationships,
   we characterize orientation localizability for planar networks with
   angle-of-arrival sensing. We then address the orientation localization
   problem in the presence of noisy measurements. Our first algorithm
   computes a least-squares estimate of the unknown node orientations in a
   ring network given angle-of-arrival sensing. For arbitrary connected
   graphs, our second algorithm exploits kinematic relationships among the
   orientations of nodes in loops in order to reduce the effect of noise.
   We establish the convergence of the algorithm, and through some
   simulations we show that the algorithm reduces the mean-square error due
   to the noisy measurements in a way that is comparable to the amount of
   noise reduction obtained by the classic least-square estimator. We then
   consider networks in 3-dimensional space and we explore necessary and
   sufficient conditions for orientation localizability in the noiseless
   case. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes with unique structures were
   fabricated from a mixture of a PTFE emulsion and a poly(vinyl alcohol)
   (PVA) aqueous solution. The formation of the micro-nano structures in
   the PTFE membrane was ascribed to PTFE crystallization. By controlling
   the cooling rate during membrane formation, various PTFE membranes with
   different structures and properties prepared, which showed a
   super-hydrophobicity with a water static contact angle (155 degrees) and
   a sliding angle (8.3 degrees) owing to their micro-nano structures. The
   results of DSC thermal analysis, XRD and polarized light microscope
   examination revealed that the micro-nano structures in the membrane were
   derived from improved PTFE crystallization during the cold-stretching
   process, resulting in a crystalline phase comprising of the micro
   aggregates and an amorphous phase comprising of the nano structures. The
   resulting membrane was shown to be highly porous while still maintaining
   a super-hydrophobicity. A critical transmembrane pressure of as high as
   0.65 MPa was achieved because of the super-hydrophobicity of the
   membrane. The membranes were further investigated for use in vacuum
   membrane distillation (VMD), and the effects of membrane structures on
   the water vapour flux were studied. The VMD flux increased obviously
   with the increase in membrane pore size when the membrane suffered
   stretching.}},

Abstract = {{Silicone hydrogel (SiHy) contact lenses were introduced on the market
   over 10 years ago, and several multipurpose solutions (MPS) have since
   been developed for their cleaning and disinfection. Depending on the
   combination of lens and solution, clinical and retrospective studies
   have shown that different combinations may be more biocompatible than
   others. In vivo, sodium fluorescein is used to assess the corneal
   response, whereas in vitro studies typically investigate MPS toxicity by
   incubating diluted MPS with cells. This difference between in vivo and
   in vitro measurements makes it difficult to gain a better understanding
   of the biocompatibility of SiHy-solution combinations. This review
   discusses the recent progress in characterizing the interactions between
   sodium fluorescein and corneal epithelial cells and in vitro MPS
   cytotoxicity using solution on both monolayer and stratified epithelial
   models. As interactions between MPS and contact lens materials lead to
   uptake and release of various solution components, in vitro models that
   take into account the effect of lens material are also presented. With
   the improvement of advanced characterization methods and new in vitro
   models, we are moving in the right direction, but more effort is
   required to fully elucidate the interactions between contact lens,
   disinfecting solution, and the cornea.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal issues associated with electric vehicle battery packs can
   significantly affect performance and life cycle. Fundamental heat
   transfer principles and performance characteristics of commercial
   lithium-ion battery are used to predict the temperature distributions in
   a typical battery pack under a range of discharge conditions. Various
   cooling strategies are implemented to examine the relationship between
   battery thermal behavior and design parameters. By studying the effect
   of cooling conditions and pack configuration on battery temperature,
   information is obtained as to how to maintain operating temperature by
   designing proper battery configuration and choosing proper cooling
   systems. It was found that a cooling strategy based on distributed
   forced convection is an efficient, cost-effective method which can
   provide uniform temperature and voltage distributions within the battery
   pack at various discharge rates. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{1985-1996}},
Abstract = {{As dry adhesives resembling the gecko lizard's dry adhesion,
   double-level nanopillars of extremely high aspect-ratio (27.5-225) are
   fabricated from a rigid low-surface energy fluoropolymer (Teflon AF) by
   a replica-molding method. Upon infiltration of Teflon AF melt into
   anodic aluminium oxide nanopores as the mold, the polymer melt fingers
   over the pore walls. The fingerlike structure formed during
   infiltration, subsequently collapses after removal of the mold,
   developing a unique sheet-like nanostructure on top of the base
   nanopillars. Concurrent fabrication of the terminating nanostructure
   helps the fabrication of extremely high aspect-ratio nanopillars which,
   up to an aspect-ratio of 185, neither collapse at the tip nor bundle. In
   order to fabricate nanopillars of different topographical properties,
   the height of the nanopillars as well as the size and density of the
   terminating nanostructure are carefully controlled by adjusting the
   processing temperature. However, although gecko and other gecko-inspired
   adhesives mainly rely on van der Waals interactions for their
   performance, the adhesion of the fabricated dry adhesives for the most
   part arises from electrostatic interactions of the applied polymer. In
   other words, Teflon AF has an exceptional potential to develop electric
   charges at its surface upon contact with other materials via the
   so-called contact electrification phenomenon, leading to elevated
   electrostatic interactions at its surface upon contact. The unique
   electrostatically driven adhesion of Teflon AF nanopillars helps them to
   generate extremely large adhesion forces, even up to similar to 100
   times larger than those attainable by van der Waals forces. The
   nanopillars of specific geometrical properties have achieved remarkable
   adhesion and friction strengths of similar to 1.6 N cm(-2) and 12 N
   cm(-2), respectively (up to similar to 1.6 and 1.2 times larger than
   those of a gecko toe pad).}},

Abstract = {{The brazeability of AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy and steel sheet with a

   configuration has been investigated. The macro- and microstructure,
   element distribution, and interfacial phases of the joints were studied
   by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
   Wetting of the steel by the Mg-Al brazing alloy was improved
   significantly through the addition of a Ni electroplated interlayer.
   Bonding between the magnesium brazing alloy and the steel was
   facilitated by the formation of a transition layer composed of a solid
   solution of Ni in Fe on the steel followed by a layer of alpha-Mg +
   Mg2Ni eutectic. A band of AlNi intermetallic compound with different
   morphologies also formed along the steel-fusion zone interface, but was
   not directly responsible for bonding. Ni electroplating was found to
   significantly improve the brazeability and mechanical performance of the
   joint. The average fracture shear strength of the bond reached 96.8 MPa
   and the joint efficiency was 60\% with respect to the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy
   base metal. In all cases, failure occurred in the fusion zone very close
   to the steel-fusion zone interface.}},

   were studied. Simple compression testing revealed that an
   elastic-plastic representation of the mechanical behavior was possible
   for all specimens. Both elastic and plastic moduli were higher for the
   P-TIPS, for higher polymer concentration, and might be somewhat higher
   for dry as opposed to wet specimens. For F-TIPS specimens, permanent
   deformation occurred successively during cyclic deformation but a
   ``memory effect{''} simplified the behavior. Although F-TIPS

   the particles and the matrix, void nucleation can be accurately
   represented and the void growth and coalescence models are improved
   through knowledge of the stress state within the matrix. The performance
   of this loosely coupled model is analytically evaluated using idealized
   composite materials that contain inclusions of various shapes to
   elucidate the influence of the inclusion morphology on damage evolution
   and coalescence. The present work provides an efficient, albeit
   approximate, algorithm that can be readily included into existing
   damage-based constitutive models to improve their predictions of damage
   evolution, particularly related to void nucleation.}},

Abstract = {{To assist in assessing a potential contaminated sediment threat near a
   drinking water intake in a large lake, a technique known as the
   fingerprint analysis of leachate contaminants (FALCON), was investigated
   and enhanced to help draw more statistically significant definitive
   conclusions. This represents the first application of this approach,
   originally developed by the USEPA to characterize and track leachate
   penetration in groundwater and contaminant migration from waste and
   landfill sites, in a large lake from the point-of-view of source water
   protection. FALCON provided valuable information regarding contaminated
   sediment characterization, source attribution, and transport within a
   surface water context without the need for knowledge of local
   hydrodynamic conditions, potentially reducing reliance on complicated
   hydrodynamic analysis. A t-test to evaluate the significance of
   correlations was shown to further enhance the FALCON procedure. In this
   study, the sensitivity of FALCON was found to be improved by using
   concentration data from both conserved organics and heavy metals in
   combination. Furthermore, data analysis indicated that it may be
   possible to indirectly assess the success of remediation efforts (and
   the corresponding need to plan for a treatment upgrade in the event of
   escalating contaminant concentrations) by examining the temporal change
   in correlation between the source and intake sediment fingerprints over
   time. This method has potential for widespread application in situations
   where conserved contaminants such as heavy metals and higher molecular
   weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are being or have
   previously been deposited in sediment somewhere in, or within range of,
   an intake protection zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a graph-theoretic characterization of controllability and
   observability of linear systems over finite fields. Specifically, we
   show that a linear system will be structurally controllable and
   observable over a finite field if the graph of the system satisfies
   certain properties, and the size of the field is sufficiently large. We
   also provide graph-theoretic upper bounds on the controllability and
   observability indices for structured linear systems (over arbitrary
   fields). We then use our analysis to design nearest-neighbor rules for
   multi-agent systems where the state of each agent is constrained to lie
   in a finite set. We view the discrete states of each agent as elements
   of a finite field, and employ a linear iterative strategy whereby at
   each time-step, each agent updates its state to be a linear combination
   (over the finite field) of its own state and the states of its
   neighbors. Using our results on structural controllability and
   observability, we show how a set of leader agents can use this strategy
   to place all agents into any desired state (within the finite set), and
   how a set of sink agents can recover the set of initial values held by
   all of the agents.}},

Abstract = {{The work by Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman (the HRU paper) on safety in the
   context of the access matrix model is widely considered to be
   foundational work in access control. In this paper, we address two
   errors we have discovered in the HRU paper. To our knowledge, these
   errors have not been previously reported in the literature. The first
   error regards a proof that shows that safety analysis for
   mono-operational HRU systems is in NP. The error stems from a faulty
   assumption that such systems are monotonic for the purpose of safety
   analysis. We present a corrected proof in this paper. The second error
   regards a mapping from one version of the safety problem to another that
   is presented in the HRU paper. We demonstrate that the mapping is not a
   reduction, and present a reduction that enables us to infer that the
   second version of safety introduced in the HRU paper is also undecidable
   for the HRU scheme. These errors lead us to ask whether the notion of
   safety as defined in the HRU paper is meaningful. We introduce other
   notions of safety that we argue have more intuitive appeal, and present
   the corresponding safety analysis results for the HRU scheme.}},

Abstract = {{SRAM has become the dominant block in modern ICs and constitutes more
   than 50\% of the die area. The increase of process variations with
   continued CMOS technology scaling is considered one of the major
   challenges for SRAM designers. This process variations increase causes
   the SRAM cells to functionally fail and reduces the chip functional
   yield considering the static noise margin stability failures (i.e., cell
   flips when accessed), write failures (i.e., cell is not written within
   the write window), and read access failures (i.e., incorrect read
   operation). In this paper, novel negative capacitance circuits are
   developed, for the first time, to statistically improve the SRAM read
   access yield under process variations by reducing the bitlines parasitic
   capacitance. Post layout simulation results, referring to an industrial
   hardware-calibrated TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology, show that the adoption
   of the negative capacitance circuit to a 512 SRAM cells column is
   capable of improving the read access yield from 61.9\% to 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{The scalar dissipation rate is a key quantity in turbulent combustion
   modelling, in particular for Conditional Moment Closure (CMC). In Large
   Eddy Simulation (LES), a subgrid-scale (SGS) mixing model must be
   provided to determine the SGS mixture fraction variance needed for the
   filtered scalar dissipation rate and the filtered density function.
   Multiple Mapping Conditioning (MMC) is selected as a SGS mixing model
   and the deterministic form is implemented for the first time in LES. The
   objective of the present study is to assess the capabilities of MMC to
   model the turbulent mixing field and the conditionally filtered scalar
   dissipation rate, (N vertical bar n) over tilde needed in CMC.
   The MMC transport equation is implemented in a LES code coupled with CMC
   to simulate a lifted jet flame in a vitiated coflow. The MMC formulation
   and computational details are presented. MMC predictions are compared
   with LES for the turbulent mixing field using instantaneous and time
   averaged data, and experimental values are included whenever available.
   Reasonable agreement between MMC, LES and experimental data is found.
   Best fit is obtained close to the fuel exit and some discrepancies can
   be seen further downstream. The SGS variance is underpredicted for many
   parts of the jet. A thorough analysis is performed to assess the
   modelling and numerical assumptions. The two proposed sources of
   discrepancy are the linear model and neglect of a transverse component
   for convection in MMC. The MMC profiles of (N vertical bar n) over tilde
   are significantly different from those of AMC and are sensitive to the
   SGS variance. Future work is suggested. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Pages = {{212-223}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a method to assimilate data from a visual/infrared
   (VIS/IR) sensor for the purpose of estimating sea ice concentration is
   investigated. A novel forward model is presented which allows the
   reflectances and brightness temperatures from the VIS/IR sensor to be
   assimilated. The VIS/IR data are assimilated in combination with ice
   concentration retrievals from a passive microwave sensor using 3D
   variational data assimilation into a 5 km x 5 km grid of sea ice
   concentrations. Results are compared with those from an experiment which
   assimilates only the ice concentration retrievals. It is found that the
   VIS/IR data have a positive impact as ice on the sea ice state through
   comparison with independent data. The proportion of points correctly
   identified asice or open water increased in each region studied by
   including the AVHRR data, with the largest increase being from 0.921 to
   0.935. This positive impact is due to the higher resolution of the
   VIS/IR data as compared with the passive microwave data, that improves
   the representation of open water in bays and coastal polynyas. There is
   however, a degradation in the accuracy of the sea ice state in some
   regions of the analysis from assimilating the VIS/IR data. Possible ways
   of improving the impact from VIS/IR data are discussed. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{This article focuses on important aspects related to the production of
   acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (nitrile rubber or NBR) emulsions using a
   train of eight continuously stirred tank reactors. The first aspect we
   discuss concerns miscellaneous operating procedures, targeted toward
   achieving desired properties of the NBR emulsion and at the same time
   reducing the amount of off-spec material during the transient period. In
   one of the operating procedures discussed, the first reactor is started
   full of batch recipe, whereas the remaining reactors in the train are
   half full with all reaction ingredients. In another case, we discuss an
   alternative design scenario, where the first reactor in the train is of
   a much smaller volume compared with the following reactors. The benefits
   of these two operating (production) scenarios are illustrated by
   comparison of different polymer and latex properties obtained with the
   commonly used procedures. Second, we discuss a novel criterion that can
   quantitatively distinguish between Cases I and II kinetics emulsion
   polymerization behavior with respect to continuous reactor stability
   (oscillatory behavior). Finally, additional feed policies are addressed,
   such as splitting the more reactive monomer and/or other reaction
   ingredients among the reactors of the train for better control of
   certain desired properties. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2013. (c) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{Purpose: To perform a rigorous technological assessment and statistical
   validation of a software technology for anatomic delineations of the
   prostate on MRI datasets.
   Methods and Materials: A 3-phase validation strategy was used. Phase I
   consisted of anatomic atlas building using 100 prostate cancer MRI data
   sets to provide training data sets for the segmentation algorithms. In
   phase II, 2 experts contoured 15 new MRI prostate cancer cases using 3
   approaches (manual, N points, and region of interest). In phase III, 5
   new physicians with variable MRI prostate contouring experience
   segmented the same 15 phase II datasets using 3 approaches: manual, N
   points with no editing, and full autosegmentation with user editing
   allowed. Statistical analyses for time and accuracy (using Dice
   similarity coefficient) endpoints used traditional descriptive
   statistics, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and pooled
   Student t test.
   Results: In phase I, average (SD) total and per slice contouring time
   for the 2 physicians was 228 (75), 17 (3.5), 209 (65), and 15 seconds
   (3.9), respectively. In phase II, statistically significant differences
   in physician contouring time were observed based on physician, type of
   contouring, and case sequence. The N points strategy resulted in
   superior segmentation accuracy when initial autosegmented contours were
   compared with final contours. In phase III, statistically significant
   differences in contouring time were observed based on physician, type of
   contouring, and case sequence again. The average relative timesaving for
   N points and autosegmentation were 49\% and 27\%, respectively, compared
   with manual contouring. The N points and autosegmentation strategies
   resulted in average Dice values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. Pre- and
   postedited autosegmented contours demonstrated a higher average Dice
   similarity coefficient of 0.94.
   Conclusion: The software provided robust contours with minimal editing
   required. Observed time savings were seen for all physicians
   irrespective of experience level and baseline manual contouring speed.

Abstract = {{Although extensive research work has been carried out on the drag
   reduction (DR) behaviour of polymers and surfactants alone, little
   progress has been made on the synergistic effects of combined polymers
   and surfactants. In this work, the interactions between drag-reducing
   anionic polymer (copolymer of acrylamide and sodium acrylate, referred
   to as PAM) and drag-reducing cationic surfactant
   (octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, OTAC) are studied. Solutions are
   prepared using both deionised (DI) water and tap water. The measurement
   of the physical properties such as electrical conductivity and viscosity
   are used to determine the surfactantpolymer interactions. The addition
   of surfactant to the polymer solution has a significant effect on the
   properties of the system. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of
   the mixed surfactantpolymer system is found to be different from that of
   the surfactant alone. With the addition of surfactant to a polymer
   solution, a substantial decrease in the viscosity occurs. The observed
   changes in the viscosity of mixed polymersurfactant system are explained
   in terms of the changes in the extension of polymeric chains, resulting
   from polymersurfactant interactions. The anionic PAM chains tend to
   collapse upon the addition of cationic OTAC. The pipeline flow behaviour
   of PAM/OTAC mixtures is found to be consistent with the bench scale
   results. The DR ability of PAM is reduced upon the addition of OTAC. At
   low concentrations of PAM, the effect of OTAC on the DR behaviour is
   more pronounced. The DR behaviour of polymer solutions is strongly
   influenced by the nature of water (DI or tap). (c) 2011 Canadian Society

Abstract = {{Turbulent drag reduction behaviour of a mixed nonionic polymer/cationic
   surfactant system was studied in a pipeline flow loop to explore the
   synergistic effects of polymeric and surfactant drag reducing additives.
   The nonionic polymer used was polyethylene oxide (PEO) at three
   different concentrations (500, 1000, and 2000?ppm). The surfactant used
   was cationic octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (OTAC) at concentration
   levels of 1000 and 2500?ppm. Sodium salicylate (NaSal) was used as a
   counter-ion for the surfactant at a molar ratio of 2
   (MR?=?Salt/OTAC?=?2). Relative viscosity and surface tension were
   measured for different combinations of PEO and OTAC. While the relative
   viscosities demonstrated a week interaction between the polymer and the
   surfactant, the surface tension measurements exhibited negligible
   interaction. The pipeline results show a considerable synergistic
   effect, that is, the mixed polymersurfactant system gives a
   significantly higher drag reduction (lower friction factors) as compared
   with pure polymer or pure surfactant. The addition of surfactant to the
   polymer always enhances drag reduction. However, the synergistic effect
   in mixed system is stronger at low polymer concentrations and high
   surfactant concentrations. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical

   with a single classifier by using a piecewise division. The algorithm
   also incorporates feature selection for the individual classifiers in

Abstract = {{We present a new approach for electroporating cells through a
   CNT-featured microfluidic device. Micro-devices have become a promising
   approach for cell manipulation systems. Among cell manipulations
   techniques, cell electroporation requires relatively higher power to
   disrupt membrane of cells. This requirement opposes integration of cell
   electroporation with other on-chip functions to achieve a
   full-functional point-of-care testing machine. Here we present a new
   approach for electroporating cells with a microfluidic chip featured by
   CNT on one electrode. A new methodology for embedding aligned CNT on
   microchannel has been presented. In the CNT-embedded device, CHO cells
   are passed through a forest of aligned CNTs so that the enhanced
   electric field near the tip of CNTs get the cells electroporated.
   Calcein AM dye has been used to indicate electroporation. The results
   show that with an operational voltage as low as 3 V CHO cells are
   electroporated while the yield rate of electroporation is 72\% higher
   compared to a no-CNT device. This achievement is considerable progress
   toward integration of cell electroporation with other low-voltage
   on-chip mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{A promising new application area for humanoid robots is in the area of
   assistive device testing. Humanoid robots can facilitate the
   experimental evaluation of assistive devices by providing repeatable,
   measurable, human-like motion while removing the difficulties and
   potential safety hazards associated with human trials. To ensure that
   the humanoid robot is providing a valid test platform, the robot must
   move in a similar way as a human while wearing the assistive device.
   This challenge is made difficult due to the inherent variability in
   human motion. In this paper, we propose an approach for a quantitative
   comparison between human and robot motion that identifies both the
   difference magnitude and the difference location, and explicitly handles
   both spatial and temporal variability of human motion. The proposed
   approach is demonstrated on data from robot gait and sagittal plane
   lifting.}},

   proposes an automatic error recovery procedure that allows the robot to
   handle both known and unknown error states using a Petri net

   directly adjust the sequencing of actions using the Petri net
   representation to complete the task, while for unknown error states, the
   robot can learn how to perform error recovery from a human demonstrator
   by extending the existing Petri net. The proposed method is verified on

Abstract = {{Warning data dissemination using vehicular networks is envisioned in
   Intelligent Transportation System applications. Due to extended
   connectivity of roadway vehicles and consequent extension of region of
   data propagation, data may be accessed in some geographical areas where
   it is neither relevant nor effectively beneficial. Moreover, propagating
   data to irrelevant regions increases communication cost. Therefore it is
   crucial to limit the warning data dissemination to a certain region.
   This research strives to address the above challenges by proposing an
   effective warning data dissemination which restricts data dissemination
   to a Region of Interest (RoI). Among the factors influencing the RoI
   determination, the type of warning message is considered so that the
   more severe the incident, the wider the RoI. Also, in order to reduce
   message overhead during data dissemination, the strategy which assigns
   the responsibility of packet retransmission to only certain vehicles
   (relays) is deployed. In the selection of the relay point, border relay
   area where the relay point is placed, is adapted to the traffic density
   so that the higher the traffic density, the narrower the relay area. The
   proposed scheme informs the vehicles located in the immediate vicinity
   of an incident, reduces message overhead, and prevents unnecessary and
   inappropriate message dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and its variants are effective and popular
   descriptors for texture classification. Most LBP like descriptors have
   disadvantages including sensitiveness to noise and inability to capture
   long distance texture information. In this paper we propose a simple,
   efficient, yet robust multi- resolution descriptor to texture
   classification - Binary Rotation Invariant and Noise Tolerant (BRINT).
   The proposed descriptor is very fast to build, very compact while
   remaining robust to illumination variations, rotation changes and noise.
   We develop a novel and simple strategy - averaging before binarization -
   to compute a local binary descriptor based on the conventional LBP
   approach. Points are sampled in a circular neighborhood, but keeping the
   number of bins in a single-scale LBP histogram constant and small by
   averaging over several contiguous pixels in the circle. There is no need
   for pre-training, no texton dictionary, and no tuning of parameters to
   deal with different datasets. Experiments on the Outex test suite
   demonstrate that the proposed approach is very robust to noise and
   significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of classifying
   noise corrupted textures.}},

Abstract = {{A new video standard called High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is now
   being finalized. In comparison with the H.264/AVC video coding standard,
   HEVC further improves video coding rate distortion (RD) performance, but
   at the price of significant increase in its encoding complexity,
   especially in its motion estimation (ME). To reduce the ME complexity in
   HEVC while maintaining its RD performance, in this paper, we first
   formulate ME as a statistical inference problem and then propose a
   confidence interval based ME method. It is shown by experiments that,
   for the four test sequences with higher searching complexity under low
   delay main, our proposed ME method further reduces the integer level ME
   time of the fast search in HEVC by 73.49\% on average with only 1.22\%

Abstract = {{Quantization table design is revisited for image/video coding where soft
   decision quantization (SDQ) is considered. Unlike conventional
   approaches where quantization table design is bundled with a specific
   encoding method, we assume optimal SDQ encoding and design a
   quantization table for the purpose of reconstruction. Under this
   assumption, we model transform coefficients across different frequencies
   as independently distributed random sources and apply the Shannon lower
   bound to approximate the rate distortion function of each source. We
   then show that a quantization table can be optimized in a way that the
   resulting distortion complies with certain behavior. Lastly, guided by
   this new theoretical result, we propose an efficient
   statistical-model-based algorithm using the Laplacian model to design
   quantization tables for JPEG encoding. Compared with the state of the
   art, the proposed algorithm provides an average 0.5 dB gain in PSNR with
   computational complexity reduced by a factor of more than 2000 when SDQ
   is off, and a 0.1 dB performance gain with 85\% of the complexity
   reduced when SDQ is on.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of an islanded microgrid proximity to voltage
   instability is essential for its operation with an adequate security
   margin. This paper presents an algorithm for determining the worst case
   loading margin of droop-controlled islanded microgrids. The problem is
   formulated as an optimization problem to determine the shortest distance
   to voltage instability (i.e. the closest saddle node bifurcation point).
   A detailed microgrid model is adopted to reflect the special features of
   droop controlled islanded microgrid systems where; 1) the system
   frequency is a power flow variable, and 2) the power produced by the
   different DG units is dependent on the system power flow variables and
   cannot be pre-specified. The optimization problem is subject to
   different system operational constraints including; the power flow
   constraints, voltage and frequency regulation constraints and unit
   capacity constraints. Different numerical case studies have been carried
   out to test the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) plays a critical role in power
   system operation. The accuracy of the STLF is very important since it
   affects the generation scheduling and the electricity prices and hence
   an accurate STLF method should be used. This paper presents a new
   variant of genetic programming namely: Multi-Gene Genetic Programming
   (MGGP) for the problem of STLF. In order to demonstrate this technique
   capability, the MGGP has been compared with the RBF network and the
   standard single-gene Genetic Programming (GP) in terms of the
   forecasting accuracy. The data used in this study is a real data set of
   the Egyptian electrical network. The weather factors represented by the
   minimum and the maximum daily temperature have been included in this
   study. The MGGP has successfully forecasted the future load with high
   accuracy compared to that of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network and
   that of the standard single-gene Genetic Programming (GP).}},

Abstract = {{Distributed generation (DG) units are widely spread in most electrical
   power systems. Such large extensive presence attracted many researchers
   to optimally exploit the available DG units in order to enhance the
   overall performance of the main power system grid. In this work a
   repetitive control-based technique is applied to operate the DG unit as
   an active power supplier and power quality enhancer. The enhancement
   provided to power quality is summarized in filtering load current
   harmonics and supporting reactive power sharing as well. The main
   advantage of the repetitive control is simplicity. Current filtering,
   and active and reactive powers sharing control are done directly in the
   abc frame. There is no need for the dq, and its inverse, transformation.
   However, the applied technique shows a high quality performance under
   normal conditions and fast, robust performance under sudden load
   changing.}},

Abstract = {{We study a setting where a set of players simultaneously invest in a
   shared resource. The resource has a probability of failure and a return
   on investment, both of which are functions of the total investment by
   all players. We use a simple reference dependent preference model to
   capture players with heterogeneous risk attitudes (risk seeking, risk
   neutral and risk averse). We show the existence and uniqueness of a pure
   strategy Nash equilibrium in this setting and examine the effect of
   different risk attitudes on players' strategies in the presence of
   uncertainty. In particular, we show that at the equilibrium, risk averse
   players are pushed out of the resource by risk seeking players. We
   compare the failure probabilities in the decentralized (game-theoretic)
   and centralized settings, and show that our proposed game belongs to the
   class of best response potential games, for which there are simple
   dynamics that allow all players to converge to the equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Tracing is a well-established method for debugging programs. Current
   approaches aim only at preserving functional correctness during the
   instrumentation. Preservation of functional correctness is a necessary
   feature of all instrumentation tools. However, few existing
   instrumentation tools preserve extra-functional properties of a program.
   Specific classes of software are unable to leverage software
   instrumentation; e.g., timing for real-time systems, memory consumption
   for embedded software, and tracing bandwidth for on-board software.
   We present the first instrumentation framework, INSTEP, that preserves
   logical correctness and a rich set of extra-functional properties.
   INSTEP derives instrumentation alternatives based on the developer's
   instrumentation intent (II), abstracts the program and prunes the search
   space, and then instruments the program based on constraints and cost
   models of competing properties. We demonstrate and experiment with a
   fully automated framework of INSTEP with different IIs and
   extra-functional properties. We also experiment with a large automotive

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a procedure for monitoring the status of the
   turn-to-turn insulation subjected to steep front impulse voltage using
   the line-to-ground leakage current as a signature. Medium voltage motor
   coils with rated voltage of 4kV are tested using steep front impulse
   voltages with rise time of 100ns. It has been found that the signature
   of the ground current is unique for a specific coil and it is voltage
   independent. Moreover, it has been observed that the recorded
   turn-to-ground current is more sensitive to turn-to-turn insulation
   damage than the applied impulse voltage waveform. Hence, by analyzing
   the line-to-ground leakage current the turn-to-turn insulation failures
   can be assessed.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of strategic network formation among a set of nodes
   where each node forms links with other nodes in the network to maximize
   some utility. While previous work in this area has considered the
   formation of a single edge set between the nodes, we consider the
   problem of the strategic formation of multiple edge sets between the
   nodes, corresponding to different types of relationships. We start by
   considering the case where one edge set is chosen to minimize distances
   between nodes that are neighbors in another edge set. This corresponds
   to a generalization of distance-based utility functions studied in the
   literature. In this setting, we characterize efficient networks (that
   are optimal with respect to a global utility function), and pairwise
   stable networks (where individual nodes cannot benefit from the addition
   or removal of incident edges). We then generalize existing concepts of
   pairwise stability and improving paths for network formation to the
   multi-layer setting with arbitrary utility functions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of linear system stabilization using a set of
   decentralized controllers that communicate with the plant's sensors over
   a network that employs linear network coding. Our analysis is built upon
   an existing algebraic description of deterministic relay networks, which
   is able to model broadcast transmissions and multiple access channel
   constraints. Since these networks can be described as linear
   time-invariant systems with specific transfer functions, this network
   representation allows us to reason about the control system and network
   (and their interaction) using a common mathematical framework. In this
   paper we characterize algebraic and topological stabilizability
   conditions for a wide class of these networks. Our analysis shows that
   the (algebraic) structure of a network required for stabilization of a
   dynamical plant can be related to the plant's dynamics; in particular,
   we prove that the geometric multiplicities of the plant's unstable
   eigenvalues play a key role in the ability to stabilize the system over
   such networks.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes a study into understanding the mechanism by which
   alumina tri-hydrate suppresses dry-band arcing erosion of silicone
   rubber under DC. Commercial silicone elastomers filled with alumina
   tri-hydrate to 25 and 58 wt \% are exposed to the inclined plane
   tracking/erosion tests while simultaneously monitoring surface
   temperature. During the early stages of testing, a surface residue is
   formed, which promotes stable dry-band arcing. An earlier inception of
   the stable discharge, thus initiation of deep erosion at a temperature
   approaching 400 degrees C, is obtained with 25 wt\% alumina trihydrate.
   A lower temperature rise is obtained for the 58 wt\% filled specimens as
   compared to the 25 wt\% filled specimens. Differential scanning
   calorimetry shows a larger enthalpy of dehydration for 58 wt\% alumina
   tri-hydrate filled samples. To verify the role of dehydration on
   reducing the surface temperature and erosion, the erosion of liquid
   silicone rubber specimens is compared for samples filled with alumina
   trihydrate and silica, both at 30 wt\%. As a measurement parameter, the
   time-to-erosion is compared between the specimens showing a reduced time
   for the silica filled specimens as compared to the alumina tri-hydrate
   filled specimens, thereby verifying the influence of the water of
   hydration to suppress surface temperature and erosion. The paper
   provides an experimental approach by which the suppression of erosion by
   alumina tri-hydrate can be investigated, employing simultaneous leakage
   current and temperature measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a promising addition to our future
   intelligent transportation systems, which supports various safety and
   infotainment applications. The high node mobility and frequent topology
   changes in VANETs impose new challenges on maintaining a long-lasting
   connection between vehicular nodes. As a result, the lifetime of
   communication links is a crucial measure in VANET development and
   operation. This paper presents a probabilistic analysis of the
   communication link lifetime in VANETs. Firstly, we propose a stochastic
   microscopic mobility model that captures time variations of
   inter-vehicle distances (distance headways), using a discrete-time
   finite-state Markov chain with state dependent transition probabilities.
   Secondly, the proposed stochastic model and first passage time analysis
   are used to derive the probability distribution of the communication
   link lifetime. Finally, numerical results are presented to evaluate the
   proposed model, which demonstrate a close agreement between analytical
   and simulation results.}},

   state transition and observation of nonlinear/non-Gaussian systems, and
   samples degeneracy is the main issue of particle filters. In this paper,
   a novel PF - selectively iterative particle filter (SIPF) is proposed
   for target tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There are two
   novel strategies in SIPF, the statistics based threshold and particles
   refining. The key insight of SIPF is from an experimental observation
   that, the more suitable divergence of particles can yield the better
   estimation. The performance of the proposed SIPF is tested on two
   theoretical models, and then it is used in a target tracking issue in
   WSN in the distributed model. Experimental results show that the
   proposed SIPF can greatly improve the accuracy of object tracking, and
   in theoretical models the estimation error is only about 10\%, while in
   practical models is only about 25\% compared to other existing 9
   filtering methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a patient-centric personal health information
   (PHI) sharing and access control scheme, SPS. Proposed SPS encompasses
   identity based cryptography to ensure security and privacy of PHI by
   using short digital signature and patient's pseudo-identity. SPS
   relieves the health service provider's (HSP) additional burden for PHI
   storage, management, and maintenance by incorporating cloud storage
   services to electronic Health (eHealth) care system. SPS adopts
   attribute based encryption and assigns different attributes to PHI
   access requesters based on their roles and relation to the patient. To
   ensure authenticated PHI access with minimum computation, SPS introduces
   multi-parties proxy re-encryption protocol. Light weight partial and
   block PHI audits make the scheme efficient to ensure stored PHI
   integrity and availability. Extensive performance and security analyses
   demonstrate that SPS is able to achieve desired security requirements
   with acceptable computation and storage costs.}},

   and discuss the drawbacks of current compressive sensing (CS) based
   encrypted image compression. Then we propose a novel lossy encrypted
   image compression method, which is based on the CS, dictionary coding,
   and recent sparse couple reconstruction theories. The experiment results
   show that compared to state-ofthe- art encrypted image compression
   methods and classical JPEG/ JPEG2000 compression methods, the proposed
   scheme can achieve much higher compression ratio of JPEG2000 with the
   similar reconstruction quality, meanwhile can obtain much better

Abstract = {{With the deployment of smart meters at individual households, smart grid
   can collect metering data of users' power consumption. However, users'
   power usage patterns would also be revealed. To preserve the users'
   privacy, metering data is mostly encrypted by cryptographic algorithms.
   When data mining is needed to support decision making or ensure
   reliability, to find useful information from the encrypted data is very
   important for smart grid. Most of the traditional keyword searching
   schemes rarely consider both users' data privacy and requesters' query
   privacy. In particular, the power system data in smart grid has
   multidimensional attributes; thus, how to query over the encrypted
   multidimensional data on all dimensions is a challenging issue in smart
   grid. To achieve finer grained conjunctive query, this paper proposes an
   Efficient Conjunctive Query (ECQ) scheme. Specificly, the ECQ
   incorporates the idea of public key encryption and conjunctive keywords
   search to achieve conjunctive query without data and query privacy
   leakage. Security analysis demonstrates that the ECQ can achieve the
   security requirements, namely, data confidentiality, integrity and
   privacy, as well as query privacy. In addition, simulation results show
   that the ECQ can reduce users' computation cost and total communication
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Supporting a massive number of machine-type communication (MTC) devices
   has been considered as an essential requirement in machine to machine
   (M2M) communications. Meanwhile, cyber security is of paramount
   importance in MTC; if MTC devices cannot securely access the networks
   through efficient authentication, all applications involving MTC cannot
   be widely accepted. One of research challenges in MTC is group
   authentication. A large number of MTC devices accessing the network
   simultaneously will cause a severe authentication signaling congestion.
   To solve this problem and reduce authentication overhead of the previous
   schemes based on public key cryptosystems, we propose a novel
   lightweight group authentication protocol for MTC in the long term
   evolution (LTE) networks based on aggregate message authentication codes
   (MACs), called LGTH, which can not only authenticate all MTC devices
   simultaneously, but also minimize the authentication overhead. Through
   security analysis, we conclude that the proposed LGTH can provide robust
   security, and avoid the authentication signaling congestion in the LTE
   networks. In addition, performance evaluations in terms of communication

Abstract = {{E-healthcare is an emerging and promising healthcare system to meet the
   increasing medical demand from aging population. It requires extensive
   data storage, pervasive data access, and reliable computing resources to
   support the real-time communication of critical health information and
   the real-time diagnosis. Recently, cloud computing, including public
   cloud and private cloud, with both scalability and accessibility is
   proposed to be integrated in the e-healthcare system. However, in
   meeting stringent medical requirements, private clouds lack necessary
   reliability, whereas public clouds suffer from communication delay. In
   this paper, we first introduce a cooperation framework to address the
   distinct challenger facing different clouds. It is inspired by the fact
   that private clouds are geographically deployed and public clouds can be
   regarded to possess infinite computing resources. In our framework,
   private clouds are designed to serve parts of local requests to public
   clouds, and rewarded by receiving help with excess requests. We adopt
   stochastic control theory to address the failure minimization issues for
   private clouds under random demand process. We prove the optimality of a
   policy constructed through recursion. Numerical and simulation results
   are presented to demonstrate that our proposed scheme can improve the
   reliability of private clouds, as well as reduce average delay of public
   clouds.}},

   applied to transform the original resource allocation problem to a
   two-machine non-preemptive scheduling problem. As ship routes are
   relatively stable, the global information in terms of release time,
   deadline and other time indices of video packets, as well as the
   schedules of vessels is known a priori. We propose two offline
   scheduling algorithms, namely Time-capacity mapping based two phase
   (TMTP) algorithm, and Interval graph theory based job relay selection
   (IGTJRS) algorithm. Both algorithms achieve a time complexity of
   O(n(2)). The performance of proposed algorithms is evaluated through
   simulation based on actual ship route traces obtained from dedicated
   Navigation software BLM-Ship.}},

Abstract = {{In a heterogeneous wireless access medium, multi-homing video
   transmission can improve the achieved video quality. However, due to the
   mobile terminal (MT) battery energy limitation, an energy management
   strategy is required in order to ensure a sustainable video transmission
   over different radio interfaces for the entire call duration. Towards
   this end, we aim to provide a statistical guarantee for the video
   quality that can be achieved in a multi-homing scenario given the MT
   available energy at the beginning of the call, the available bandwidth
   and time varying channel conditions at different radio interfaces, the
   call duration, and the video packet characteristics in terms of
   distortion impact, delay deadlines, and packet encoding statistics.
   Hence, the MT can support at least a target video quality lower bound
   for the entire call duration with a preset success probability.
   Numerical results are presented to investigate different performance
   trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have a great potential in enhancing
   the public safety standards and providing a safer environment for people

   how the VeMAC protocol can deliver both periodic and event-driven safety
   messages in VANETs, and presents a detailed delivery delay analysis,
   including queueing and service delays, for both types of safety
   messages. The probability mass function of the service delay is first
   derived, then the D/G/1 and M/G/1 queueing systems are used to calculate
   the average queueing delay of the periodic and event-driven safety
   messages respectively. Simulation results are presented to study the
   accuracy of the delay analysis under simplified assumptions. The delay

Abstract = {{Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) standard with Carrier Aggregation
   (CA) is emerging as a promising technology for 4G mobile communication
   systems to fulfill tremendous growth of high-data-rate demand. However,
   in LTE-A systems with CA, the uplink Radio Resource Management (RRM)
   performance is greatly limited by the insufficient user transmission

   cross-layer carrier selection and power control strategy for LTE-A
   uplink with CA to improve the average user throughput, while dealing
   with the above limitations. Specifically, we first propose a novel
   estimation method to effectively predict the average bandwidth that a
   newly admitted user can obtain from each carrier. The time-variability
   of carrier load conditions is carefully taken into account. Then, an
   optimal carrier subset and power allocation values are determined for
   each arrived user to improve the average user throughput by solving a
   user-power-utilization maximization problem, with considering the user
   power constraints and offset effects. Extensive simulations validate the

Abstract = {{An online charging strategy is an efficient approach to provide charging
   plans for electric vehicles (EVs) from a global point of view, aiming to
   improve energy efficiency while avoiding overloading of an electric
   power system. However, designing an efficient online charging strategy
   to achieve optimal energy utilization remains a challenging problem,
   especially when the coordinated behaviors of both EVs and charging
   stations are taken into consideration. In this paper, we first introduce
   an intelligent power distribution system which utilizes vehicular ad-hoc
   networks (VANETs) to enable communication among EVs on roads, road-side
   units (RSUs), and a vehicle-traffic server. Then, we propose a globally
   optimal online EV charging strategy, which not only improves energy
   utilization of the whole system but also prevents charging stations from
   overloading, which may cause a voltage drop in the power distribution
   system. Lagrange duality optimization techniques are exploited to
   address the associated optimal EV charging problem. The performance of
   our proposed strategy is evaluated by extensive simulations, and the
   results are compared with that of the traditional autonomous offline

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting is emerging as a promising technology to extend the
   lifetime of wireless sensor networks, which is referred to as
   rechargeable sensor networks (RSNs). This paper is concerned with the
   network utility maximization problem of static-routing RSNs with limited
   battery capacity. In specific, to calculate the energy consumption rate,
   one node's sampling rate is coupled with some other nodes. Moreover,
   because the energy consumption rate is constrained by the energy
   harvesting rate and current battery level to avoid depletion or
   overcharge of the battery, it is also coupled across the time horizon.
   In this paper, we will globally optimize the network utility. By dual
   decomposition, we decouple it into separable subproblems, which can be
   distributively solved without the need to coordinate with other nodes or
   time horizon. We then propose a distributed algorithm in the context of
   joint rate and battery control, which converges to the globally optimal
   solution. Numerical results, based on the real solar data, demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithm always achieves higher network utility than
   existing approaches.}},

   order to cancel the interference happened at the destination due to
   simultaneous transmissions by the relay and users, we design a decoding
   scheme and derive a close-form expression of achievable transmission
   rate for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward cooperative

Abstract = {{We propose a technique that can be used to improve the throughput
   offered to cellular users, in particular cell-edge users. Often, base
   stations (BSs) of different network operators are not co-located.
   Because of this, more spatial diversity is available by considering
   multiple cellular networks. Users who do not have a high SINR in their
   home network might see a much better SINR in another network because of
   the spatial diversity. Hence, to improve the performance of their
   celledge users, network operators can ``swap{''} (exchange) them. In
   essence, we want to allow roaming between operators for other reasons
   than pure coverage. This paper aims at quantifying the gains that can be
   obtained by such swapping techniques. We propose a swapping scheme,
   ``Operator-Based Swapping{''}, in which a central controller decides
   which users should be exchanged between two operators assuming the
   number of users served by an operator does not change. Although
   implementing such a centralized scheme would be difficult, it helps us
   to understand the potential gain of such a ``swapping{''} technique. Our
   numerical results show that high throughput gains (e.g., 80\%) are
   achievable for the 10\% worst users for both operators if the two
   networks are spatially diverse. We then propose a second swapping
   technique, called ``BS-Based Swapping{''}, that restricts the number of
   exchanged users to be equal on a pair of BS-basis. We believe that this
   scheme might be easier to implement. We compare the performance of this
   scheme under different configurations representing different levels of
   spatial diversity and allocated resources including time and frequency.
   Our numerical results show that this second swapping technique works
   almost as well as the first one. Our results show the potential of a
   technique based on a generalization of roaming as a mean to improve user
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in bioinformatics have provided researchers with a large influx
   of novel sequences, thus making the analysis of the sequences for
   inherent biological knowledge crucial. By using pattern discovery and
   pattern synthesis on protein family sequences, conserved protein
   segments can be represented by Aligned Pattern Clusters (APC), which is
   more knowledgerich in statistical association comparing to probabilistic
   models. Such representation enabled us to exploit their co-occurrence on
   the same protein sequence to identify functional regions. In this paper,
   we developed an efficient algorithm to identify the frequently
   co-occurring patterns using only homologous protein sequences as input.
   We applied our algorithm to triosephosphate isomerase and ubiquitin for
   a detailed study. We found that the discovered co-occurring patterns are
   close in spatial distance in most cases, by comparing to corresponding
   3D structures. We also found that the co-occurrence of patterns are
   biologically significant. Residues which play important and co-operative
   roles in the glycolytic pathway of triosephosphate isomerase and
   residues which are responsible for ubiquitination and ubiquitinbinding
   of ubiquitin are all covered in our co-occurring APCs. These results
   demonstrate the power of our algorithm to reveal the concurrent distant
   functional and structural relation of proteins sequences based on
   co-occurrence clusters of APCs.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of a large number of processing nodes in a parallel and
   distributed computing environment enables sophisticated real time
   processing over high speed data streams, as required by many emerging
   applications. Sliding window stream joins are among the most important
   operators in a stream processing system. In this paper, we consider the
   issue of parallelizing a sliding window stream join operator over a
   shared nothing cluster. We propose a Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP)
   framework, based on a fixed or predefined sequence of communication, to
   distribute the join processing loads over a shared-nothing cluster. We
   consider various processing and communication overheads while scaling
   over a large number of nodes, and propose solution methodologies to cope
   with the issues. We implement the algorithm over a cluster using a
   message passing system, and present the experimental results showing the
   effectiveness of the join processing algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Power consumption is an important consideration in deploying wireless
   networks, especially for battery-powered mobile devices such as
   smartphones. Radio interface is the main source of energy consumption in
   mobile devices. Medium access control (MAC) directly controls the radio
   interface operation; therefore, an efficient MAC protocol can
   significantly decrease the energy consumption. This paper presents a new
   energy efficient MAC scheme for fully connected wireless networks. Time
   is divided into beacon intervals and a temporary coordinator node
   manages transmission in each beacon interval. The proposed scheme
   reduces energy consumption by putting radio interfaces in the sleep
   state periodically and reducing transmission collision. Simulation
   results show that the proposed scheme has lower power consumption,
   higher throughput and lower delay than existing power saving MAC

   routing protocol (iCAR) for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to enable
   infotainment and interactive applications, as well as multi-hop Internet

   consideration real-time vehicular traffic information and the
   experienced packet delivery delay per road, in order to improve the
   routing performance by dynamically selecting roads with a guaranteed
   connectivity and a reduced delivery delay. This is achieved by deploying
   a microscopic view of vehicles location to proactively estimate roads
   connectivity and the minimum link lifetime per road. Detailed analysis
   and simulation-based evaluations show that iCAR significantly improves
   the network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end

Abstract = {{Conventional all-optical restoration strategies like p-cycle achieve
   very fast restoration with high spare capacity consumption. In contrast,
   failure dependent protection (FDP) can achieve near-optimal capacity
   efficiency at the cost of high signaling/control complexity (so as for
   long restoration time). In this paper, we investigate a previously
   reported all-optical restoration framework that aims to yield a
   restoration speed similar to p-cycle while achieving near optimal
   resource consumption as FDP. In particular, we propose a simple yet
   efficient heuristic for joint allocation of monitoring trails and
   protection lightpaths, which serves as the key to enable the all-optical
   restoration. The resultant all-optical restoration framework is further
   examined by extensive simulations regarding the network resource

Abstract = {{Deployment of femtocells faces a significant challenge emanating from
   the interference from the overlay of macros to the underlay of femtos.
   This paper focuses on the mitigation of this cross-tier interference in
   the downlink by limited coordination between femtocells and macrocell.
   Contesting the natural strategy of orthogonalized transmission thereby
   eliminating the interference, we propose a spectrum splitting strategy
   which is based on coordinating this cross-tier interference in a way
   that the resultant interference is effectively exploited thereby
   improving the system performance. The problem is posed as a single-agent
   control problem. Macro base station (BS) is an agent that dynamically
   swaps its macro users/constellations on its bandwidth to manage the
   interfering constellations that it produces to its femtocell users. The
   agent learns the optimal interfering constellation strategy using
   information from its femto BSs using reinforcement-learning with a
   Q-learning implementation. Simulation results illustrate the sum rate
   gain brought about by the proposed strategy of managing interfering
   constellations for their subsequent exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Social Networks (MSN), as an emerging social networking platform,
   facilitates social interaction and information sharing among users in
   the proximity. Spam filtering protocols are extremely important to
   reduce communication and storage overhead when many spam packets without
   specific destinations are diffused in MSNs. In this paper, we propose an
   effective social based updatable filtering protocol (SAFE) with privacy
   preservation in MSNs. Specifically, we firstly construct a filter Hash
   tree based on the properties of Merkle tree. Then, we exploit social
   relationships, and select those users with more than a specific number
   of common attributes with the filter creator. The selected users are
   able to store filters in order to block spams or relay regular packets.
   Furthermore, we develop a cryptographic filtering scheme without
   disclosing the creator's private information or interests. In addition,
   we propose a filter update mechanism to allow users to update their
   distributed filters in time. The security analysis demonstrates that the
   SAFE can protect user's private information from filter's disclosure to
   other users and resist filter forgery attack. Through extensive
   trace-driven simulations, we show that the SAFE is effective and
   efficient to filter spam packets in terms of delivery ratio, average
   delay, and communication overhead.}},

Abstract = {{The current coding standard employs differential coding to reduce the
   coding rate. Decoding error may propagate in the following frames after
   a loss-unrecoverable frame. Since most of the current electronic devices
   are implemented with multiple interfaces, such as the 3G and WiFi, one
   way to solve the error propagation problem is to use cooperative
   strategies, which leverage on the `uncorrelatedness' of the clients'
   channels (different channels may experience different channel losses).
   The cooperative strategies helping to repair the primary network's (base
   station to client) losses via the neighboring clients' packets sharing
   (client to client) through the second network interface and optimally
   allocating the modulation and coding schemes to the limited network
   resource can improve the clients' received quality massively. The
   inherent problem is how to solve the resource allocation problem with
   the cooperative strategies. In this paper, we jointly consider the
   resource allocation and the cooperative repair for the video streaming.
   We formulate the problem into the optimization problem, i.e. maximizing
   the clients' received video quality, and apply the structured network
   coding to further improve the overall performance. Simulation results
   show that the proposed approach outperforms the other competing schemes
   by at least 1.5dB in term of the received video quality in typical
   network scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency of the wireless local area network (WLAN)/femtocell
   interworking system essentially relies on the efficiency of the resource
   allocation protocol employed in the system. Efficiency of the resource
   allocation protocol depends on whether it has been designed considering
   physical layer and medium access control layer technologies of different
   networks in the interworking system. Therefore, in this paper, we
   formulate a resource (user, subcarrier, and power) allocation problem
   for maximizing the sum of weighted rates of the interworking system
   considering multi-homing capable users and the main features of IEEE
   802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) and orthogonal frequency
   division multiple access (OFDMA) based femtocell networks. Solving this
   problem optimally is prohibitively complex as it is a non-convex
   problem. Thus, the problem is suboptimally solved by dividing it to two
   sub-problems. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for user and subcarrier
   allocation while an optimal and fast converging power allocation
   algorithm is derived based on dual decomposition and the characteristics
   of Lagrangian. Simulation results have shown that the proposed resource
   allocation protocol achieves results close to the optimum.}},

Abstract = {{The Long Term Evolution -Advanced (LTE-A) standard is widely accepted
   for the 4th generation mobile systems to satisfy the explosive growth of
   high-data-rate demand. Carrier Aggregation (CA) is considered as one of
   the most momentous techniques adopted in LTE-A standard. Many studies
   have been done to analyze the performance of LTE-A systems with CA in
   terms of average user throughput. However, the system-level capacity
   analysis of LTE-A systems has not been well studied. In this paper, we
   explore the downlink admission control process in LTE-A systems with CA
   to compare the capacities between LTE users and LTE-A users, based on
   the metric - equivalent capacity. Specifically, taking into account the
   user heterogeneity, the system evolution is modeled as a birth-death
   process for each user class based on an effective user traffic
   generation model. A closed-form relationship between the equivalent
   capacity and system bandwidth is then derived for a single-carrier LTE-A
   system with the help of binomial-normal approximation. The relationship
   is further extended to multi-carrier case for both LTE users and LTE-A
   users. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our analytical
   ones, and demonstrate that the equivalent capacity of LTE-A users
   surpasses that of LTE users significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The booming smart grid produces a large amount of data that should be
   transmitted to the utility control center (UCC), typically by means of
   the cellular network. This may pose a prohibitive transmission cost and
   choke the cellular network. As an effort to address this issue, we
   propose a vehicle assisted data delivery method to offload the cellular
   network, in which vehicles are utilized to carry and deliver the data
   from distributed locations to the UCC through the deployed roadside
   units. Two data forwarding schemes are developed based on the theory of
   optimal stopping rules to increase the data delivery probability.
   Simulation results are given to demonstrate that the proposed method can
   achieve high data delivery ratio through the roadside network so that it
   can efficiently offload the cellular network and reduce the
   communication cost.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for
   improving communication reliability and throughput in wireless networks.
   In a recent study, a cooperative MAC scheme called Cooperative ADHOC MAC
   (CAH-MAC) has been proposed to increase the network throughput by
   reducing the wastage of time slots under a static network scenario.
   Particularly, neighbor nodes cooperate to increase the transmission
   reliability by utilizing unreserved time slots for retransmission of
   failed packets. In this paper, we focus on a mobile networking scenario
   and study the effects of time slot reservation on the performance of
   CAH-MAC under highly dynamic vehicular environments. We find out that
   the introduction of time slot reservation results in cooperation
   collisions, degrading the system performance. To tackle this challenge,
   we present an enhanced CAH-MAC (eCAH-MAC) that is able to avoid
   cooperation collisions and thus efficiently utilize a time slot. In
   eCAH-MAC, the cooperative relay transmission phase is delayed, so that
   cooperation collisions can be avoided and time slots can be efficiently
   reserved. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that eCAH-MAC
   uses time slot more efficiently than CAH-MAC in direct and/or
   cooperative transmissions and in reserving time slots in the presence of
   relative mobility among nearby nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Sharing radio resources of multiple wireless networks with overlapped
   coverage areas has a potential of improving the transmission throughput.
   However, the improvement cannot be achieved in congestion scenarios
   using independent congestion control procedures among the end-to-end
   paths. Although various network characteristics make the congestion
   control complex, this variety can be useful for congestion avoidance if
   the networks cooperate with each other. In this way, the traffic can be
   shifted from a congested network to non-congested ones, and the overall
   transmission throughput does not degrade in a congestion scenario. In
   this paper, first, a cooperative congestion control algorithm is
   proposed in which the state of an end-to-end path is provided at the
   destination terminal by measuring the queuing delay and estimating the
   congestion level. Second, the decision on when to start/stop cooperation
   is determined based on the network characteristics, instantaneous
   traffic condition, and requested quality of service (QoS). Simulation
   results demonstrate the throughput improvement of the proposed scheme
   over non-cooperative congestion control.}},

   The proposed scheme thwarts location privacy attacker who exploits
   positioning systems to localize users. To the best of our knowledge, our
   scheme is the first to apply obfuscation techniques for a user's exact
   location, rather than a wide area applied with current location privacy
   schemes. Our analysis shows that the fake point scheme ensures higher
   MNN's location privacy. In addition, the extensive simulations
   demonstrate that our proposed scheme can practically be implemented due
   to the high possibility of having many MNNs select the same fake point,

   recent psychological study of human visual speed perception, where the
   perceptual prior probability distribution of the speed of motion is
   measured through a series of psychovisual experiments. Second, the

Abstract = {{The significant role dust aerosols play in the earth's climate system
   and microbial nutrition cycles have lead to increased efforts in
   employing remote sensing to monitor their genesis, transport and
   deposition. In this contribution we considerably refine our earlier
   statistical models for aerosol detection and atmospheric transport that
   rely on latent Gaussian Markov random fields for inference. Based on
   explicitly satisfying the so-called integrated continuity equation we
   develop a Bayesian generalized linear model intrinsically expressing the
   divergence of the field as a multiplicative factor covering physical
   aspects such as compressibility and column projection. Alongside
   employing surface emissivity estimates for improved genesis detection,
   we conduct a simulation study clearly showing a reduction of errors in
   the estimated flow field. We conclude with a case study that relates
   this experimental finding back to a dust event over northern Africa.}},

Abstract = {{A sparse texture dictionary learning method for unsupervised land cover
   classification is presented. The method takes the stance that land cover
   in remote sensing data is best analysed in texture patches rather than
   localized pixels. To this end, a feature vector is designed that
   describes local texture information in a spatially coherent manner. This
   texture model is extracted for each pixel in the scene. A sparse
   dictionary of global texture models is then learned to characterize the
   underlying texture distribution of the scene in a simplified manner. An
   unsupervised classifier is learned using these global texture models for
   grouping pixels exhibiting high similarity. Being an unsupervised
   classifier, the class labels that are learned are unbiased toward human
   interpretation of the scene, and rather are learned according to the
   texture information. The method is validated using polarimetric SAR data
   over a Flevoland, Netherlands agriculture scene, but may be generalized
   to any remote sensing data. Promising experimental results show how the
   proposed method retains the spatial coherence of crops, and attains
   higher accuracy than recent unsupervised and supervised classification
   methods using the same data.}},

Abstract = {{We study the transmission of a pair of correlated sources over a
   Gaussian multiple access channel with weak time asynchronism between the
   encoders. In particular, we assume that the maximum possible offset
   d(max)(n) between the transmitters grows without bound as the block
   length n -> infinity while the ratio d(max)(n)/n of the maximum possible
   offset t. o t8 he block length asymptotically vanishes. For such a joint
   source-channel coding problem, we derive the capacity region and also
   show that separate source and channel coding achieves optimal
   performance. Specifically, we first derive an outer bound on the source
   entropy content as our main result. Then, using Slepian-Wolf source
   coding combined with the channel coding introduced in {[}1], we show
   that the thus achieved inner bound matches the outer bound.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the design of optimal vector quantization given
   channel and error statistics by inclusion of cyclic redundancy checks
   (CRC) into the consideration. Given a broadcast system with
   multiresolution vector quantization (MRVQ) and error detection
   availability for each resolution, a closed-form formula for the weighted
   end-to-end distortion (EED) is first derived under a random index
   assignment. Based on the closed-form formula, an iterative algorithm is
   then proposed for designing optimal MRVQ to minimize the EED with CRC.
   Experiments show that for a wide range of channel error probability, the
   inclusion of CRC indeed reduces the EED. Finally, the best tradeoff
   between the number of bits for quantization and those for CRC is also
   investigated by experiments.}},

   Access Channel (MAC) with peak constraints at the transmitters. It is
   shown that there exist an infinite number of sum-rate-optimal points on
   the boundary of the capacity region. In contrast to the Gaussian MAC
   with power constraints, we verify that Time Division (TD) can not
   achieve any of the sum-rate-optimal points in the Gaussian MAC with peak
   constraints. Using the so-called I-MMSE identity of Guo et. al, the
   largest achievable sum-rate by Orthogonal Code Division (OCD) is
   characterized where it is shown that Walsh-Hadamard spreading codes of
   length 2 are optimal. In the symmetric case where the peak constraints
   at both transmitters are similar, we verify that OCD can achieve a
   sum-rate that is strictly larger than the highest sum-rate achieved by
   TD. Finally, it is demonstrated that there are values for the maximum
   peak at the transmitters such that OCD can not achieve any of the

Abstract = {{It is well-know that the so-called Shannon Achievable Region (SAR) in a
   collocated two-user Gaussian TwoWay Channel (GTWC) does not depend on
   the self-interference that is due to the leakage of the signal
   transmitted by each user at its own receiver. This is simply because
   each user can completely remove its self-interference. In this paper, we
   study a class of GTWCs where each user is unable to cancel the self
   interference due to random erasures at its receiver. The mixture of the
   intended signal for each user and its self-interference is erased
   independently from transmission slot to transmission slot. It is assumed
   that both users adopt PAM constellations for transmission purposes. Due
   to the fact that both users are unaware of the erasure pattern, the
   noise plus interference at each user is mixed Gaussian. To analyze this
   setup, a sequence of upper and lower bounds are developed on the
   differential entropy of a general mixed Gaussian random variable where
   it is shown that the upper and lower bounds meet as the sequence index
   increases. Utilizing such bounds, it is shown that the achievable rate
   for each user is monotonically increasing in terms of the level of
   selfinterference and eventually saturates as self-interference grows to
   infinity. This saturation effect is justified analytically by showing
   that as self-interference increases, each user is enabled to extract the
   erasure pattern at its receiver. Treating the erasure pattern as side
   information, both users are able to cancel self-interference and decode
   the useful information at higher transmission rates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we revisit the concept of fractionally spaced
   equalization (FSE) for broadband single-carrier amplify-and-forward
   (AaF) cooperative systems. Particularly, we investigate fractionally
   spaced frequency domain equalization (FS-FDE) for cooperative
   multi-relay systems. Our motivation stems from the elegant properties
   reported for the FSE in the point-to-point communication systems (i.e.,
   its robustness to sampling phases and potential in achieving the optimum
   performance) and the scalability of the FDEs. In particular, we propose
   a T-S/2-spaced equalizer that transforms the temporal sample sequence of
   the received signal to the frequency domain, applies
   linear/decision-feedback equalization, and returns the resulting signal
   back to the time domain for detection. The vital importance of using
   FS-FDE method in cooperative systems is disclosed in practical scenarios
   where the transmitted signals have non-zero roll-off components and
   sampling phase error may occur in relay(s) and destination terminals.
   Our results demonstrate that, under specific channel realizations and
   sampling errors, the cooperative systems with symbol spaced FDE (SS-FDE)
   fail to harvest the available cooperative diversity and the performance
   approaches to that of no relay scenario. On the other hand, the
   performance of cooperative system with FS-FDE method becomes independent
   of sampling phase errors and full benefit of cooperation is retained.}},

   selective surface (FSS) is presented. The FSS consists of a
   two-dimensional periodic array of metallic square loops and

   overall thickness of 0.007 lambda(1), 0.013 lambda(2) or 0.0195
   lambda(3) where lambda(1), lambda(2) and lambda(3) are the free space
   wavelengths of the three bands respectively, supports this whole
   structure. The proposed FSS provides: 1) three passbands separated by
   transmission zeros, 2) advantage of low profile, and 3) insensitivity to
   incident angles and polarizations. An equivalent circuit model is given
   for predicting and analyzing the frequency characteristics of this
   structure. Furthermore, a tri-band FSS with uniform band spacing is
   fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the simulated and

Abstract = {{A waveguide switch with six states involving seven ports is presented in
   this paper. It consists of a common port that feeds perpendicularly six
   output routing branches placed in the same plane. The switch is based on
   actuating short circuit loads in six ridge waveguide branches. It avoids
   the use of complex rotary systems to provide path switching, resulting
   in an extremely compact profile and simplifying the manufacturing. The
   concept is presented based on rigorous full-wave simulations and
   experimental results of a Ku-band SP6T, which is designed, built and
   tested. The experimental proof of this new switch integrates the
   transitions to SMA outputs and the short-circuit loads. It shows
   measured return loss better than 25 dB in a 12\% fractional bandwidth in
   the best state and 20 dB in an 8\% bandwidth in the worst state. The
   isolation of this prototype is at least 32 dB, with insertion loss of

Abstract = {{In this paper, audio, heart rate, steering wheel, gas, clutch, and brake
   pedals positions are used to determine the level of fatigue for the
   driver. The system consists of three main modules. One decides the
   fatigue level based on the audio signal, another decides the fatigue
   level based on the heart rate and the other signals, and the last one
   combines the decisions from the first two modules using a Bayesian
   network. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier is used to model the
   fatigue for both audio module and other signals module. The experimental
   results show that HMM performs better than Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   for both audio and other signals modules. The results also show that
   combining more than one decision improves the performance of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile web browsing is one of the most commonly used and wide-spread
   application (app) among smartphone apps. However, the complexity of
   web-pages is increasing especially if the web-pages are designed for
   desktop computers. The existence of advertisements (ads) in web-page
   leads to even higher complexity of the web-pages. This complexity in
   smartphone's environment where the resources are limited (e.g., battery
   and bandwidth) is reflected in longer loading time, more energy
   consumed, and more bytes transferred. In this paper, we classify the web
   contents into: (i) core information, and (ii) forced ``unwanted{''}
   information, namely ads. Then, we evaluate resources used for web
   advertising. Based on the measurements of the cost of web advertising,
   we propose a framework for mobile browsing that adapts the web-pages
   delivered to the smartphone, based on the smartphone's current battery
   level and the network type. The adaptation of the web content is in the
   form of controlling the amount of ads to be displayed on the web-page.
   Our system aims to (i) extend smartphone battery life and (ii) preserve
   the bandwidth needed to download the web-pages while balancing the
   satisfaction of the publishers of web-pages as well as the end users.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the critical resource constraints of wireless sensor nodes such
   as processing speed, memory size and energy supply, implementing
   security mechanisms, in particular key management schemes, is quite
   challenging. Motivated by the conference key establishment scheme
   proposed by Harn and Gong in {[}11], we propose LPKM (Lightweight
   Polynomial-based KeyManagement Protocol), a key management scheme for
   distributed WSNs. LPKM enables sensor nodes to establish different types
   of keys to bootstrap trust and secure one-to-one and one-to-many
   communications in a flexible, reliable, and non-interactive way.
   Moreover, LPKM can effectively mitigate or thwart the most common
   attacks to WSNs such as node clone attacks, node impersonation attacks,
   etc. In addition, LPKM can tolerate changes of network topology and
   incurs little computational and communication overhead. Our experimental
   results on MICAz motes show that LPKM can be efficiently implemented on
   low-cost sensor nodes. In particular, a MICAz mote running at a
   frequency of 8MHz can generate required group keys of 128-bit in a few
   milliseconds, at a cost of 6.12 KBytes ROM and 68 Bytes RAM.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, Ni/YSZ pattern anodes with well-defined 2-D structure were
   employed to investigate the electrochemical oxidation of H-2, CO and
   syngas. Electrochemical tests revealed that polarization resistance
   (R-p) depended on applied overpotenital and gas compositions. In H-2/H2O
   environment, R-p decreases when increasing overpotential, H-2 and H2O
   partial pressure. In CO/CO2 environment, R-p experiences a minimum value
   when increasing the overpotential from 0 to 0.3 V, and the minimum R-p
   appears when the overpotential is 0.1 V. R-p decreases with an increase
   in partial pressure of CO2, but increases when increasing partial
   pressure of CO. Charge transfer reactions contribute to the main
   electrode process in both (H2H2O)-H-/ and CO/CO2 environments.}},

Abstract = {{A hot stamping die-set was developed with in-die heating to form a
   hat-shaped beam section with tailored properties. Based on the die
   configuration, the as-formed beam section can be assembled to create a
   lab-scale side impact beam and an axial crush member with tailored
   regions for improved impact performance. In this work, hot stamping
   finite element (FE) simulations of the hat-shaped beam used for the side
   impact beam and axial crush member were conducted to predict the
   as-quenched microstructures resulting from the new die-set. For the side
   impact beam, the punch and female die cavity were cooled while the
   binder and clamp die were heated to 700 degrees C in order to tailor the
   properties of the flange. The axial crush member was hot stamped with
   half of the beam member (along the length) consisting of martensite,
   while the remaining half was tailored using a heated die temperature of
   700 degrees C. The FE models predict that bainite forms in the tailored
   regions with as-quenched hardness levels of around 250 HV. A backing
   plate was added to the mesh of the as-formed side impact beam member and
   a three-point bend impact model was generated to load the part
   quasi-statically. For the axial crush member, two of the as-formed beam
   part meshes were spot welded together (using nodal constraints) to form
   the continuous cross-section axial crush member assembly that was
   crushed quasi-statically in the axial direction. The results for side
   impact member show tailoring reduces energy absorption by 15\%, but
   lowers the force experienced by the part throughout the simulation. The
   results demonstrate that tailoring the axial crush member improves its
   crash response, as opposed to the non-tailored axial crush member, and
   increased the amount of energy absorption by approximately 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{A Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator was used to quench and
   simultaneously deform austenized boron steel specimens at sub-critical
   cooling rates to examine the formation of bainite and ferrite. Samples
   were quenched at constant cooling rates of 10 degrees C/s, 15 degrees
   C/s, and 30 degrees C/s. Additional samples were quenched at the same
   cooling rates but simultaneously deformed in tension (-20\%) at a
   temperature of 600 degrees C. Deformation during quenching facilitated
   the formation of both bainite and ferrite in the as-quenched
   microstructure compared to the un-deformed specimens. LS-OPT was used
   with LS-DYNA's hot stamping material model to optimize the activation
   energy parameters and improve the model's prediction of the final
   as-quenched microstructure. A new feature of this hot stamping material
   model is the addition of a parameter to scale the activation energies as
   a function of plastic strain during quenching. This parameter was also
   optimized using LS-OPT to determine these activation energy scaling
   parameters. The optimized parameters have improved the predictive
   capability of the model for both the un-deformed and deformed samples at
   the three cooling rates.}},

Abstract = {{Precise knowledge of the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the blank /

   This paper describes hot forming die quenching (HFDQ) experiments
   conducted on Usibor (R) 1500P boron steel samples quenched with heated
   dies. An inverse heat conduction algorithm is used to convert measured
   blank and die temperatures into a HTC while taking into account the
   effect of thermocouple response time. The HTC during the approach phase
   of an HFDQ experiment is a function of the die temperature. In the
   stamping phase, the HTC increases exponentially as the temperature
   difference between the blank and die surfaces decreases. The HTC
   increase during the stamping phase depends on the pressure and die
   temperature, whereas the equilibrium HTC measured when the blank and die
   surface temperatures become equal increases with the stamping pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a strain rate sensitive constitutive model has been developed
   to predict the crash response of hot stamped (and tailored) components
   with varying as-quenched volume fractions of martensite, bainite and
   ferrite. However, failure criteria are also required for tailored hot
   stamped components, which is the motivation for the current work. Here,
   boron steel blanks were quenched to produce fully martensitic and
   bainitic microstructures. Miniature tensile specimens were cut from the
   quenched blanks with varying notch geometries that imposed different
   stress triaxialities during tensile loading. Digital image correlation
   (DIC) analysis was used to measure the strain distribution during
   testing and identify the fracture strain. Finite element (Fh) models of
   the experiments were developed and successfully validated against the
   experiments. These models were then used to predict the stress
   triaxiality and Lode parameter for each notch geometry. The results
   showed that when the average triaxiality was increased from similar to
   0.33 to similar to 0.54, the strain at failure reduced from 1.1 to 0.6
   for the bainitic material and 0.8 to 0.3 for the martensitic material
   condition. The Lode parameter also indicated that the stress-state
   transitioned from uniaxial tension to a combined tensile/shear
   stress-state for the most severe specimen notch geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networking (VANET) is an emerging paradigm that is
   expected to increase the public safety standards and enhance the safety
   level of drivers/passengers and pedestrians on roads through a variety
   of applications. We have recently proposed VeMAC, a medium access
   control protocol that supports a reliable one-hop broadcast service
   necessary for high priority safety applications in VANETs. This paper
   explains how the VeMAC protocol can deliver both periodic and
   event-driven safety messages in vehicular networks and presents a
   detailed delivery delay analysis, including queueing and service delays,
   for both types of safety messages. The probability mass function of the
   service delay is first derived; then, the D/G/1 and M/G/1 queueing
   systems are used to calculate the average queueing delay of the periodic
   and event-driven safety messages, respectively. In addition, a
   comparison between the VeMAC protocol and IEEE 802.11p standard is
   presented via extensive simulations using the network simulator ns-2 and
   the microscopic vehicle traffic simulator VISSIM. A real city scenario
   is considered and different performance metrics are evaluated, including
   the network goodput, protocol overhead, channel utilization, protocol
   fairness, probability of a transmission collision, and message delivery
   delay.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid, envisioned as an indispensable power infrastructure, is
   featured by real-time and two-way communications. How to securely
   retrieve and audit the communicated metering data for validation testing
   is, however, still challenging for smart grid. In this paper, we propose
   a novel privacy-preserving range query (PaRQ) scheme over encrypted
   metering data to address the privacy issues in financial auditing for
   smart grid. Our PaRQ allows a residential user to store metering data on
   a cloud server in an encrypted form. When financial auditing is needed,
   an authorized requester can send its range query tokens to the cloud
   server to retrieve the metering data. Specifically, the PaRQ constructs
   a hidden vector encryption based range query predicate to encrypt the
   searchable attributes and session keys of the encrypted data. Meanwhile,
   the requester's range query can be transferred into two query tokens,
   which are used to find the matched query results. Security analysis
   demonstrates that in the PaRQ, only the authorized requesters can obtain
   the query results, while the data confidentiality and query privacy are
   also preserved. The simulation results show that our PaRQ can
   significantly reduce communication and computation costs.}},

   studied through determination of its Forming Limit Diagram (FLD).
   Limiting dome height experiments were performed at elevated temperatures

   were determined at three different temperatures (50 degrees C, 150
   degrees C and 250 degrees C) along the sheet rolling direction (RD) and
   transverse direction (TD). The experiments showed that temperature has a
   significant effect on formability; an increase in temperature from 50
   degrees C to 250 degrees C resulted in a formability gain of more than
   200\%.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative approach is proposed to utilize symmetric yield functions
   for modeling the tension-compression asymmetry commonly observed in hcp
   materials. In this work, the strength differential (SD) effect is
   modeled by choosing separate symmetric plane stress yield functions (for
   example, Barlat Yld 2000-2d) for the tension i.e., in the first quadrant
   of principal stress space, and compression i.e., third quadrant of
   principal stress space. In the second and fourth quadrants, the yield
   locus is constructed by adopting interpolating functions between
   uniaxial tensile and compressive stress states. In this work, different
   interpolating functions are chosen and the predictive capability of each
   approach is discussed. The main advantage of this proposed approach is
   that the yield locus parameters are deterministic and relatively easy to
   identify when compared to the Cazacu family of yield functions commonly
   used for modeling SD effect observed in hcp materials.}},

Abstract = {{The edge failure of a dual phase steel, DP780, under hole expansion
   (stretch flange) deformation conditions is examined. In order to assess
   the effect of damage processes without the presence of notches due to
   shearing, machined holes with a smooth edge condition were expanded with
   a conical punch. Images of the expansion as well as punch
   load-displacement were recorded during the tests. The GISSMO damage
   based failure criteria was implemented in a finite element model to
   predict the load-displacement of the punch and the initial crack
   formation. This failure criteria was calibrated using the effective
   plastic failure strain versus triaxiality data obtained from a set of
   uniaxial and notched tensile samples. The predicted punch
   load-displacement curve was found to be in agreement with observations
   including the load drop at the onset of failure. The predicted peak load
   of 23.4kN compared favorably to the observed peak of 24.4kN. The model
   predicted a hole expansion ratio of 53.4\% and compared well to the
   experimentally observed ratio of 51.0\% +/- 10.0\%.}},

   layout of optical components, to date experimentalists have had no way
   to predict the performance of a given beam arrangement. This paper shows
   how the mathematical properties of the coefficient matrix are related to
   the information content of the attenuation data, which, in turn, forms a
   basis for a beam arrangement design algorithm that minimizes the
   reliance on additional assumed information about the concentration
   distribution and thus increases reconstruction accuracy. The performance
   of this algorithm is assessed by comparing the reconstruction error
   obtained from an optimized beam arrangement to that obtained from beam
   arrangements presented in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy alternatives for off-grid northern communities are
   investigated via a specific case study of Fort Hope, Ontario. The
   current energy systems in most off-grid communities consist of diesel
   generators, which can be both financially and environmentally
   unsustainable. In lieu of this, a hybrid system comprised of a 636 kW
   run-of-the-river hydropower, existing 650 and 375 kW diesel generators,
   and 150 kg hydrogen storage and 100 kW fuel cell system is proposed. The
   design achieves a renewable energy penetration of 54\%, a levelised cost
   of energy 41\% less than the baseline model, and a reduction of 2,000
   tonnes in annual diesel generator emissions. The HOMER model developed
   for the design is compared to RETScreen results; total power output
   deviated by 2\%, however, renewable energy penetration varied largely
   due to monthly versus hourly modelling techniques and different controls
   on the dispatch strategy in each modeling software. Total capital costs
   and annual operating costs of the proposed design are \$4.6 million and
   \$990,000, respectively. Renewable energy systems can be considered a
   solution to humanitarian concerns due to increasing utility costs,
   emissions and load constraints. Renewable energy systems in remote
   communities require further research and development to lower equipment
   costs and enhance policy to achieve financial viability.}},

Title = {{Controlled root targeted delivery of fertilizer using an ionically
   crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel matrix}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Aims: The recent increases in food prices caused by the corresponding
   increases in fertilizer costs have highlighted the demand for reducing
   the overuse of fertilizers in industrial agriculture. There has been
   increasing interest in developing plant root-targeted delivery (RTD) of
   fertilizers in order to address the problem of inefficient fertilizer
   use. The aim of this study is to develop a low cost controlled release
   device to deliver fertilizers to plant roots and thereby increase
   fertilizer use efficiency.
   Methods: The Root Targeted Delivery Vehicle (RTDV) is formed by
   dissolving Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) chains in water, mixing it with
   liquid fertilizer and crosslinking using iron and calcium salts. Basic
   measurements quantifying nutrient release and green house growth trials
   were carried out to evaluate fertilizer use efficiency on wheat growing
   in nutrient depleted soil media.
   Results: Growing wheat in nutrient depleted media showed that the RTDV
   permits a 78\% reduction in the amount of fertilizer needed to achieve
   similar levels of plant yield in these conditions. Quantifying the
   losses associated with the RTDV synthesis showed that optimizing
   manufacturing could possibly increase this value as high as 94\%.
   Furthermore, the delivery device showed a similar lifetime in soil to
   the plant's growth cycle, delivering fertilizer over the course of the
   plant's growth before removal from soil by degradation.
   Conclusions: These results illustrate the importance of fertilizer
   delivery in facilitating absorption and may have potential to vastly
   increase the use efficiency of fertilizers in soil, resulting in a
   significant reduction of costs and environmental damage. With more in
   depth study to quantify the fertilizer release and refine the device,
   there is great potential for the use of the RTDV as an effective means
   to increase fertilizer use efficiency in agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Although fuzzy-filtered neural networks (FFNN) have been used in pattern
   classification because of their unique characteristics in feature
   extraction, they usually have poor performance in forecasting
   applications due to their structure complexities especially in their
   consequent reasoning part. In this paper, an enhanced FFNN, EFFNN, is
   proposed for time series forecasting and material fatigue prognosis. A
   novel neural network scheme is developed to facilitate computation
   implementation. A new conjugate technique is proposed to improve
   training efficiency. The effectiveness of the developed EFFNN scheme and
   the related training technique is demonstrated by a series of simulation
   tests. The EFFNN is also implemented for material fatigue prognosis.
   Test results show that the developed EFFNN predictor is an effective
   forecasting tool; it can capture system dynamics effectively and track

Abstract = {{Real-time embedded systems are increasingly being built using
   commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components such as mass-produced
   peripherals and buses to reduce costs, time-to-market, and increase
   performance. Unfortunately, COTS-interconnect systems do not usually
   guarantee timeliness, and might experience severe timing degradation in
   the presence of high-bandwidth I/O peripherals. Moreover, peripherals do
   not implement any internal priority-based scheduling mechanism, hence,
   sharing a device can result in data of high priority tasks being delayed
   by data of low priority tasks. To address these problems, we designed a
   real-time I/O management system comprised of 1) real-time bridges with
   I/O virtualization capabilities, and 2) a peripheral scheduler. The
   proposed framework is used to transparently put the I/O subsystem of a
   COTS-based embedded system under the discipline of real-time scheduling,
   minimizing the timing unpredictability due to the peripherals sharing
   the bus. We also discuss computing the maximum delay due to buffered I/O
   data transactions as well as determining the buffer size needed to avoid
   data loss. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that our prototype
   real-time I/O management system successfully exports multiple virtual
   devices for a single physical device and prioritizes I/O traffic,
   guaranteeing its timeliness.}},

Abstract = {{The content of the antinutrient, phytic acid, of soy protein was
   analyzed during their extraction and purification by a series of

   their ash content as an indication of their mineral content. The
   extraction of soy proteins was conducted by using a 2(3) factorial
   experimental design, pH (7.5 or 9), solvent (0.06 M KCl or water), and
   temperature (25 degrees C or 50 degrees C). The most promising
   extraction conditions were 0.06 M KCl/pH 9.0/25 degrees C for the lowest
   phosphorus to protein ratio (12.2 +/- 0.1 mg P/g protein) and H2O/pH
   9.0/50 degrees C for the combination of low phosphorus to protein ratio
   and the lowest ash content (13.9 +/- 1.2 mg P/g protein, 9.6 +/- 0.8\%
   w/w ash content). After extraction, soy proteins were purified by
   sequential ultrafiltration (UF) with a volume concentration ratio (VCR)
   of 5 and diafiltration (DF) with volume diafiltration ratio (VD) of 4.
   Extracts were purified with no pH adjustment or with pH adjustment to
   6.5 between the UF and the DF steps. The extraction conditions 0.06 M
   KCl/pH 9.0/25 degrees C and the purification conditions UF pH 9.0/DF pH
   6.5 showed the lowest phosphorus to protein ratio (4.4 +/- 0.3 mg P/g

Abstract = {{Antenna arrays are used in communication applications where directive
   beams are required.In this article, we show analytically and
   experimentally that the gain of an antenna array can be further
   increased by covering it with a high refractive index superstrate. For
   the experimental demonstration, a corporate-fed 4 x 1 microstrip patch
   array is fabricated and the electromagnetic pattern measurements are
   performed on the array covered with a magneto-dielectric metamaterial. A
   fast analytical solution for the radiation fields of the
   superstrate-covered microstrip antenna array is also proposed. The
   analytical solution is based on the reciprocity theorem in conjunction
   with the transmission line analogy and the cavity model. The artificial
   superstrate is designed using broadside coupled split ring resonator
   inclusions and is placed at approximately one-tenth of a wavelength
   apart from the patch array operating at 2.2 GHz. A directivity increase
   of about 3.4 dB is achieved after covering the antenna array with the
   engineered magnetic superstrate. A comparison of results using the
   analytical model, the full-wave simulations and measurements show good
   agreement. The proposed analytical formulation requires only 2.5\% of
   the time required by full-wave analysis. The superstrate-based
   directivity enhancement method can be used in commercial antennas to
   combat some of the downsides of the existing systems such as gain
   decrease due to surface waves and dielectric losses. (C) 2012 Wiley

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) adopt the Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for their security. In any
   PKI system, the authentication of a received message is performed by
   checking if the certificate of the sender is included in the current
   CRL, and verifying the authenticity of the certificate and signature of
   the sender. In this paper, we propose an Expedite Message Authentication
   Protocol (EMAP) for VANETs, which replaces the time-consuming CRL
   checking process by an efficient revocation checking process. The
   revocation check process in EMAP uses a keyed Hash Message
   Authentication Code (HMAC), where the key used in calculating the HMAC
   is shared only between nonrevoked On-Board Units (OBUs). In addition,
   EMAP uses a novel probabilistic key distribution, which enables
   nonrevoked OBUs to securely share and update a secret key. EMAP can
   significantly decrease the message loss ratio due to the message
   verification delay compared with the conventional authentication methods
   employing CRL. By conducting security analysis and performance
   evaluation, EMAP is demonstrated to be secure and efficient.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{200}},

Pages = {{139-161}},
Abstract = {{New CO2 legislation forces the petroleum refining industry to review its
   operations and processes to cope with the new limitations of allowable
   CO2 emissions. Simultaneously, petroleum refineries, which are extremely
   complex entities, face another challenge represented by clean fuel
   products (low sulfur content) regulations. In an attempt to provide
   operational solutions to these issues, a CO2 management model was
   incorporated with an existing hydrogen management model that we have
   recently developed. To this end, this article presents an overall
   integrated model that solves simultaneously the refinery planning,
   hydrogen, and CO2 management problems. It addresses the optimum CO2
   strategy selection through integration of refinery planning with the
   hydrogen network and CO2 emissions. The overall model was formulated as
   a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The model consists of the
   refinery emission sources and the considered mitigation options. Model
   performance was tested through different case studies with various
   reduction targets. The optimization results showed that the integration
   of the planning, hydrogen, and CO2 models lead to better profit margins
   and that CO2 mitigation options worked successfully together to meet a
   given reduction target. The obtained results also showed that the load
   shifting option can contribute up to a 3\% reduction of CO2 emissions,
   while the fuel switching option can provide a 20\% reduction. To achieve
   greater than 30\% reductions, a CO2 capture technology must be employed
   in the petroleum refining industry.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the economical feasibility of drilling a horizontal well,
   engineers need reliable methods to estimate its productivity. In this
   work, a simple-to-use method is developed to rapidly estimate a

   found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the

   tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for
   petroleum engineers to make a quick check on a pseudo-steady-state
   horizontal well's productivity at various conditions without opting for
   any field trials. The predictive tool is simple and straightforward, and
   it can be readily implemented in a standard spreadsheet program. The
   prime application of the method is as a quick-and-easy evaluation tool
   in conceptual development and scoping studies where horizontal wells are
   being considered. The method may also serve as a benchmark in numerical

Abstract = {{The study was aimed at evaluating the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of high-speed fiber laser welded high strength low alloy
   (HSLA) and DP980 dual-phase steel joints with varying weld geometries.
   Fusion zone (FZ) consisted of martensitic structure, and heat-affected
   zone (HAZ) contained newly-formed martensite in both steels and
   partially tempered martensite in DP980. While HAZ-softening was present
   in DP980, it was absent in HSLA. A distinctive ``suspension
   bridge{''}-like hardness profile with the FZ hardness as a ``pylon{''}
   appeared in the fiber laser welded joints. Both HSLA and DP980 joints
   showed a superior tensile strength, with a joint efficiency of 94-96\%
   and 96-97\%, respectively, despite a reduced elongation in DP980 joints.
   Fatigue strength was higher in DP980 joints than in HSLA joints at
   higher stress amplitudes, but had no obvious difference at lower stress
   amplitudes. DP980 multiple linear welds exhibited a larger scatter and
   lower fatigue strength. Fatigue failure of HSLA joints occurred in the
   base metal at a stress amplitude above 250 MPa, and at weld concavity at
   a lower stress amplitude below 250 MPa. Fatigue crack in DP980 joints
   initiated predominantly from the weld concavity at both high and low
   levels of stress amplitudes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For this article, an analytical study has been conducted on the flow and
   energy transfer of unsteady compressible oscillating flow through
   channels filled with porous medium representing stack in thermoacoustic
   engines/refrigerators. The flow in the porous material is described by
   the Darcy momentum equation. Analytical expressions for oscillating
   velocity, temperature in the porous layer, complex Nusselt number, and
   energy flux density are obtained after simplifying and solving the
   governing differential equations with reasonable approximations (such as
   long wave, short stack, small amplitude oscillation, etc.). The result
   for heat transfer between the porous medium and the channel wall is
   expressed as a dimensionless Nusselt number. For the limiting case of
   nonporous medium, the Nusselt number obtained in the present study
   matches quantitatively with the expression available in the existing
   literature. The results reveal that the Nusselt number in oscillating
   flow is significantly enhanced (almost an order of magnitude) by
   employing sufficiently large thermal conductivity of porous media in a
   channel. The system of equations developed in the present study is a
   helpful tool for thermal engineers to design porous stacks for

   Flexible Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{12}},
Abstract = {{The primary objective of this paper is to study the dynamic responses of
   a flexible multiple degree-of-freedom structure coupled with the
   three-dimensional motions of a nonlinear pendulum tuned mass damper
   (PTMD). The three-dimensional motions consist of both planar and
   spherical motions of the PTMD. The optimal damper parameters obtained by
   using the three-dimensional model are compared with those predicted by
   models in which PTMD motion is linearized to the planar direction. The
   effect of and sensitivity to frequency and auxiliary damping detuning
   are considered for various levels of primary to auxiliary mass ratios.
   The performance of the PTMD is evaluated by using a finite element
   representation of an actual tower structure equipped with a PTMD,
   together with the responses obtained by using the high frequency base
   balance method from a boundary layer wind tunnel. The results are
   compared for linearized and three-dimensional PTMDs and the effect of
   directional coupling introduced by the nonlinear three-dimensional PTMD
   on the response estimates is studied by using the numerical model.
   Finally, a procedure is presented for conducting a condition assessment
   of existing PTMDs.}},

   analysis of dual-energy contrast-enhanced mammography}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{In contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), the dual-energy dual-exposure
   technique, which can leverage existing conventional mammography
   infrastructure, relies on acquiring the low- and high-energy images
   using two separate exposures. The finite time between image acquisition
   leads to motion artifacts in the combined image. Motion artifacts can
   lead to greater anatomical noise in the combined image due to increased
   mismatch of the background tissue in the images to be combined, however
   the impact has not yet been quantified. In this study we investigate a
   method to include motion artifacts in the dual-energy noise and
   performance analysis. The motion artifacts are included via an extended
   cascaded systems model. To validate the model, noise power spectra of a
   previous dual-energy clinical study are compared to that of the model.
   The ideal observer detectability is used to quantify the effect of
   motion artifacts on tumor detectability. It was found that the
   detectability can be significantly degraded when motion is present
   (e.g., detectability of 2.5 mm radius tumor decreased by approximately a
   factor of 2 for translation motion on the order of 1000 mu m). The
   method presented may be used for a more comprehensive theoretical noise
   and performance analysis and fairer theoretical performance comparison
   between dual-exposure techniques, where motion artifacts are present,
   and single-exposure techniques, where low- and high-energy images are
   acquired simultaneously and motion artifacts are absent.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the preparation of hydrogenated amorphous carbon
   nanoparticles whose spectral characteristics include an absorption band
   at 217.5 nm with the profile and characteristics of the interstellar
   217.5 nm feature. Vibrational spectra of these particles also contain
   the features commonly observed in absorption and emission from dust in
   the diffuse interstellar medium. These materials are produced under
   ``slow{''} deposition conditions by minimizing the flux of incident
   carbon atoms and by reducing surface mobility. The initial chemistry
   leads to the formation of carbon chains, together with a limited range
   of small aromatic ring molecules, and eventually results in carbon
   nanoparticles having an sp(2)/sp(3) ratio approximate to 0.4.
   Spectroscopic analysis of particle composition indicates that
   naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives are important constituents of
   this material. We suggest that carbon nanoparticles with similar
   composition are responsible for the appearance of the interstellar 217.5
   nm band and outline how these particles can form in situ under diffuse
   cloud conditions by deposition of carbon on the surface of silicate
   grains. Spectral data from carbon nanoparticles formed under these
   conditions accurately reproduce IR emission spectra from a number of
   Galactic sources. We provide the first detailed fits to observational
   spectra of Type A and B emission sources based entirely on measured
   spectra of a carbonaceous material that can be produced in the
   laboratory.}},

Title = {{Controlled joining of Ag nanoparticles with femtosecond laser radiation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We show that it is possible to tailor the gap separation and interface
   geometry between adjacent Ag nanoparticles (NPs) by controlling fluence
   when irradiating with pulses from a fs laser. Unirradiated samples
   extracted from aqueous solution consist of networks of Ag NPs coated
   with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). At low laser fluence, bonding between
   NPs occurs via the formation of an intervening hydrogenated amorphous
   carbon (alpha-C:H) layer resulting from the laser-induced decomposition
   of PVP. This occurs when electrons are emitted at hot-spots created by
   the trapping of plasmons. The thickness of the alpha-C:H layer
   determines the minimum separation between NPs. Ag NPs with different
   contact geometries can be produced by irradiation of the networks in
   solution at fluences exceeding the threshold for the formation of
   alpha-C:H. At fluences between 200 and 380 mu J/cm(2), the alpha-C:H
   interface layer is replaced with a metallic neck. Surface enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) has been used to quantify the electromagnetic field
   enhancement in joined NP samples. We find that Ag NPs bonded by
   alpha-C:H and exhibiting a narrow gap possess the highest SERS
   enhancement. (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{NH3 pulsing adsorption and SCR reactions over a Cu-CHA SCR catalyst}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS TODAY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{197}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In pass ive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) applications, NH3 is
   generated on an upstream catalyst to reduce NOx on a downstream SCR
   catalyst. Therefore, there is no continuous input of reductant, and in
   most cases the NH3 comes to the SCR catalyst as a pulse. In this paper
   NH3 adsorption profiles on a Cu chabazite (CHA) SCR catalyst were
   measured as a function of different NH3 pulse parameters, NH3 migration
   after adsorption was investigated and standard and fast SCR reactions on
   the catalyst precovered with different levels of NH3 were characterized.
   The data show that when pulsing times are short, but the upstream
   portion of the catalyst was still far from saturated, the amount of NH3
   adsorbed decreased from inlet to outlet. As the quantity of input
   ammonia increased, the adsorption profiles leveled out in the front as
   that part of catalyst approached saturation. Also, the NH3 inlet
   concentration had a significant effect on the NH3 adsorption profile,
   when the catalyst was far from saturated. For the same amount of input
   NH3, a high NH3 inlet concentration with shorter pulsing time would
   result in steeper NH3 adsorption profiles. Catalyst aging and higher
   temperature reduced the catalyst's ability to adsorb NH3. Ammonia was
   observed migrating after NH3 was removed from the inflow. There were at
   least two kinds of adsorbed NH3: weakly adsorbed NH3 and strongly
   adsorbed NH3. Weakly adsorbed NH3 migrated out of the catalyst channel
   within several seconds, while strongly adsorbed NH3 did not, at least at
   250 degrees C and 300 degrees C. Catalyst aging had little effect on
   strongly adsorbed NH3, but reduced the catalyst's ability in adsorbing
   weakly adsorbed NH3 and enhanced weakly adsorbed NH3 migration. The
   effect of temperature on NH3 migration was as expected; higher
   temperature enhanced NH3 migration but had less effect on strongly
   adsorbed NH3. NH3 adsorption profiles were compared with NOx consumption
   profiles during the fast SCR reaction. NOx consumption profiles were
   found to be flatter than their corresponding NH3 adsorption profiles due
   to the effect of NH3 migration after an NH3 pulse. The standard and fast
   SCR reactions on the SCR catalyst pre-covered with NH3 of similar
   distribution were compared at 250 degrees C and it was found that there
   was no significant difference between NO and NOx consumption profiles.

Title = {{Nonparametric methods for drought severity estimation at ungauged sites}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{The objective in frequency analysis is, given extreme events such as
   drought severity or duration, to estimate the relationship between that
   event and the associated return periods at a catchment. Neural networks
   and other artificial intelligence approaches in function estimation and
   regression analysis are relatively new techniques in engineering,
   providing an attractive alternative to traditional statistical models.
   There are, however, few applications of neural networks and support
   vector machines in the area of severity quantile estimation for drought
   frequency analysis. In this paper, we compare three methods for this
   task: multiple linear regression, radial basis function neural networks,
   and least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR). The area selected
   for this study includes 32 catchments in the Canadian Prairies. From
   each catchment drought severities are extracted and fitted to a Pearson
   type III distribution, which act as observed values. For each
   method-duration pair, we use a jackknife algorithm to produce estimated
   values at each site. The results from these three approaches are
   compared and analyzed, and it is found that LS-SVR provides the best
   quantile estimates and extrapolating capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between negatively charged nanocrystalline cellulose
   (NCC) and a cationic surfactant, tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
   (TTAB) was examined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),
   conductometric and potentiometric titrations and surface tensiometry.
   The interaction is controlled by electrostatic and hydrophobic
   interactions. ITC and surface tension measurements confirmed the
   formation of electrostatically driven NCC-TTAB complexes in the bulk and
   at the interface, which was followed by hydrophobically driven
   polymer-induced micellization of TTAB on NCC rods. The critical micelle
   concentration (CMC) of TTAB was shifted from 1.1 to 1.3 g/L in the
   presence of 0.655 g/L NCC. The settling and phase separation
   characteristics were quantified by determining the height of NCC flocs
   as a function of time, which describe the stability of NCC in the
   presence of TTAB. Zeta potential results revealed a charge reversal from
   negative to positive values with increasing TTAB concentration,
   confirming the formation of NCC-TTAB complexes in aqueous solutions.
   Based on the results, a physical mechanism on the interaction of NCC and
   TTAB is proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by stabilizing a hydrophilic surface condition of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and improving its zeta potential, several
   reported methods for treating PDMS surface were evaluated using two or
   more of the following techniques: capillary flow in dryly stored
   channels, static contact angle measurement, current monitoring technique
   and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (ATR-FTIR). The surface treatment methods that were evaluated include
   four groups: pre-doping PDMS with acrylic acid, extraction of uncured
   PDMS (oligomer). and monomer grafting using 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
   (HEMA) and monomer grafting using polyethylene glycol (PEG). This study
   also proposed a modified PEG grafting method. It was observed that the
   extraction and monomer grafting methods were capable of changing
   hydrophobic PDMS to the stable hydrophilic state. However, none of the
   evaluated methods were able to increase the zeta potential of PDMS to a
   value higher than that treated with a one-step plasma treatment based on
   the current monitoring measurement, where 1X Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE)
   buffer was used as the liquid sample. It was found that combining
   extraction and one-step plasma treatment was the best approach to
   maintain the stable hydrophilic state of PDMS and gain a relatively high
   zeta potential. In addition, it was found that the extraction method
   provided the most consistent outcome in modified PDMS surfaces compared
   to other methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents mathematical optimization models of residential
   energy hubs which can be readily incorporated into automated decision
   making technologies in smart grids, and can be solved efficiently in a
   real-time frame to optimally control all major residential energy loads,
   storage and production components while properly considering the
   customer preferences and comfort level. Novel mathematical models for
   major household demand, i.e., fridge, freezer, dishwasher, washer and
   dryer, stove, water heater, hot tub, and pool pumps are formulated.
   Also, mathematical models of other components of a residential energy
   system including lighting, heating, and air-conditioning are developed,
   and generic models for solar PV panels and energy storage/generation
   devices are proposed. The developed mathematical models result in Mixed
   Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problems with the
   objective functions of minimizing energy consumption, total cost of
   electricity and gas, emissions, peak load, and/or any combination of
   these objectives, while considering end-user preferences. Several
   realistic case studies are carried out to examine the performance of the
   mathematical model, and experimental tests are carried out to find
   practical procedures to determine the parameters of the model. The
   application of the proposed model to a real household in Ontario, Canada
   is presented for various objective functions. The simulation results
   show that savings of up to 20\% on energy costs and 50\% on peak demand
   can be achieved, while maintaining the household owner's desired comfort
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient detection of magnetic fields is central to many areas of
   research and technology. High-sensitivity detectors are commonly built
   using direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices or
   atomic systems. Here we use a single artificial atom to implement an
   ultrasensitive magnetometer with micron range size. The artificial atom,
   a superconducting two-level system, is operated similarly to atom and
   diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre-based magnetometers. The high
   sensitivity results from quantum coherence combined with strong coupling
   to magnetic field. We obtain a sensitivity of 3.3 pT Hz(-1/2) for a
   frequency of 10 MHz. We discuss feasible improvements to increase
   sensitivity by one order of magnitude. The intrinsic sensitivity of this
   detector at frequencies in the 100 kHz-10MHz range compares favourably
   with direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices and
   atomic magnetometers of equivalent spatial resolution. This result
   illustrates the potential of artificial quantum systems for sensitive
   detection and related applications.}},

Title = {{Direct formation of gasoline hydrocarbons from cellulose by hydrothermal
   conversion with in situ hydrogen}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{228-239}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new process based on aqueous-phase dehydration/hydrogenation (APD/H)
   has been developed to directly produce liquid alkanes (C7-9), which are
   the main components of fossil gasoline, from cellulose in one single
   batch reactor without the consumption of external hydrogen (H-2). In
   this new process, part of the cellulose is first converted to in situ
   H-2 by steam reforming (SR) in the steam gas phase mainly; and, in the
   liquid water phase, cellulose is converted to an alkane precursor, such
   as 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMP). In the final reaction step, in situ
   H-2 reacts with HMF to form liquid alkanes through APD/H. Accordingly,
   this new process has been named SR(H-2)-APD/H. Experimental results show
   that the volumetric ratio of the reactor headspace to the reactor (H/R)
   and an initial weakly alkaline condition are the two key parameters for
   SR(H-2)-APD/H. With proper H/R ratios (e.g., 0.84) and initial weakly
   alkaline conditions (e.g., pH = 7.5), liquid alkanes are directly formed
   from the SR(H-2)-APD/H of cellulose using in situ H-2 instead of
   external H-2. In this study, compared with pyrolysis and hydrothermal
   liquefaction of cellulose at the same temperatures with same retetion
   time, SR(H-2)-APD/H greatly increased the liquid alkane yields, by
   approximately 700 times and 35 times, respectively. Based on this
   process, direct formation of fossil gasoline from renewable biomass
   resources without using external H-2 becomes possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Very active 40\%Ir-10\%V-3\%Mo/C and 40\%Ir-10\%V-10\%Mo/C (in weight)
   catalysts, as novel, suitable anode electrode materials in polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), have been synthesized by an
   ethylene glycol (EG) reduction method. The nanostructured catalysts have
   been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ir nanoparticles, after
   modification with V and further with Mo, show a narrow particle size
   distribution centered at 2 nm, and are uniformly dispersed on Vulcan
   XC-72 supports. Investigation of the catalytic activity by means of
   linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) employing a rotating disk electrode (RDE)
   has revealed that 40\%Ir-10\%V-10\%Mo/C catalyst exhibited very high
   electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).
   About 77\% higher current density was obtained for 40\%Ir-10\%V-10\%Mo/C
   compared to that of 40 wt.\% commercial carbon-supported platinum
   catalyst (Pt/C), and 282\% higher current density compared to that of
   the pure 40 wt.\% Ir/C at 0.1 V versus RHE. The performance of a
   membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with the
   40\%Ir-10\%V-10\%Mo/C as the anode catalyst generated a maximum power
   density of 598.4 mW cm(-2) at 70 degrees C, which is 26.4\% higher than
   that of commercially available Pt/C under air/H-2 testing condition. The
   ternary 40\%Ir-10\%V-10\% Mo/C catalyst was also tested for 10 ppm CO
   tolerance, and the results showed that the 40\% Ir-10\%V-10\%Mo/C has
   much better CO tolerance than commercial Pt/C catalyst. The mechanism of
   the ternary 40\%Ir-10\%V-10\%Mo/C catalyst may be a bi-functional
   mechanism. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Novel combline resonators and filters with enhanced dual-band
   characteristics are introduced in this paper. The proposed resonator is
   made up of three metallic conductors: an inner post, an intermediate
   conductor, and an enclosure. This structure provides two asynchronous
   resonant modes that can be used for realizing compact microwave
   dual-band filters. Such dual-band filters offer the low cost, compact
   size, and ease of manufacturing features of traditional combline
   resonator filters, with additional size reduction due to the fact that a
   single physical cavity provides two electrical resonators. In addition,
   the new cavity introduces a transmission zero in the guard-bands
   enhancing the filter selectivity, while keeping a simple and compact
   inline topology. The design of filters based on this novel resonator is
   discussed, starting with the resonator circuit model, the coupling
   scheme, and the complete filter design methodology. Simulations as well
   as experimental results of a tenth-order (2 x 5) dual-band filter with a
   measured rejection level in excess of 100 dB in the guard-band are
   presented to show the concept.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring trail (m-trail) has been proposed as an effective approach
   for link failure localization in all-optical wavelength division
   multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. Previous studies in failure
   localization rely on alarm dissemination via control plane signaling
   such that the network controller can collect the flooded alarms to form
   an alarm code for failure identification. Such cross-layer signaling
   effort obviously leads to additional control complexity. This paper
   investigates a novel m-trail failure localization scenario, called
   network-wide local unambiguous failure localization (NWL-UFL), where
   each node can perform UFL based on locally available ON-OFF state of
   traversing m-trails, such that alarm dissemination in the control plane
   can be completely avoided. The paper first defines and formulates the
   m-trail allocation problem under NWL-UFL and conducts a series of bound
   analysis on the cover length required for localizing any single-link
   failure. This is the first study on monitoring trail allocation problem
   that aims to gain understanding on the consumed cover length via
   analytical approaches due to the special feature of the NWL-UFL
   scenario. A novel heuristic algorithm based on random spanning tree
   assignment (RSTA) and greedy link swapping (GLS) is developed for
   solving the formulated problem. Extensive simulation on thousands of
   randomly generated network topologies is conducted to verify the
   proposed scheme by comparing it to a naive counterpart and with the
   derived lower bounds. We also demonstrate the impact of topology
   diversity on the performance of the proposed scheme as well as its
   scalability regarding network sizes.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{508-514}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When a building is heated to a steady internal temperature, equilibrium
   is established in which the heat power into the building equals the rate
   at which heat is lost from the building. A good approximation of heat
   losses can be determined using the conventional generic equations which
   give a relatively accurate value of the heat loss; however these
   equations can be inaccurate, especially in applications where radiative
   heating is used. In this article simple predictive tools are developed
   to estimate the characteristic temperature ratios for both panel
   radiator and high temperature radiant strip systems. The calculated
   results can be used in follow up calculations for a model, which fully
   takes into account the radiation heat transfer occurring within a room
   space.
   The results of the proposed method are found to be in excellent
   agreement with reported data in the literature with average absolute
   deviation being around 0.2\%.
   The predictive tool is simple and straightforward and it can be readily
   implemented in a standard spreadsheet program. The prime application of
   the method is as a quick-and-easy evaluation tool in conceptual
   development and scoping studies where a panel radiator system and a high
   temperature radiant strip system are being considered. The method may
   also serve as a benchmark in numerical and rigorous simulation studies.

Abstract = {{In this study, a neuro-fuzzy model has been developed to predict the
   mass of extract in the process of supercritical fluid extraction of
   Pimpinella anisum L seed. In this case first, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference system (ANFIS) technique was trained with the recorded data
   from kinetic experiments at pressures of 8, 10, 14 and 18 MPa and
   constant temperature of 303.15 K. The performance of this proposed model
   was validated with experimental data and excellent predictions with root
   mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0235 were observed.
   In the next step of study, mass transfer coefficient in terms of
   Sherwood number was estimated by a neuro-fuzzy network. The estimated
   mass transfer coefficient was embedded in mathematical model. The
   proposed gray box (hybrid) model was validated with the experimental
   data and RMSE of 0.0523 proved that equipping mathematical model with
   neuro-fuzzy network has significantly improved performance of the model.
   Then, neuro-fuzzy and gray box models were compared with previously
   published artificial neural network and mathematical models. It was
   found that ANFIS model has the best performance compared to all modeling
   techniques.
   Finally, extrapolation ability of ANFIS, white box, and gray box models
   were studied. The mass of extracted was predicted up to 300 min (beyond
   the training range). It was observed that again ANFIS model is the best
   model for extrapolation purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Timing yield analysis considering process-induced temperature and supply

Journal = {{MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{956-961}},

Abstract = {{Process variations cause fluctuations in the threshold voltage of
   integrated circuits (ICs). The variations, in turn, lead to
   uncertainties in the leakage current, drawn off the power grid that the
   underlying circuit is connected to. Because of the interdependency
   between the leakage power and temperature, process variations impose
   statistical behavior on the nodes' supply voltage and also on the
   temperature. In addition, the resistivity of the interconnects increases
   with temperature. Consequently, the imposed variations significantly
   impact the performance of devices and interconnects.
   This paper presents a statistical analysis of the timing yield by taking
   into account both the process and environmental variations. By
   considering the statistical profile of the temperature and supply
   voltage, the process variations are mapped to the delay variations
   across a die. This helps to accurately estimate the timing yield and
   check the robustness of the circuits early in the design process and
   avoid over-design. Monte-Carlo simulations on ISCAS89 benchmarks verify
   the accuracy of the proposed methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fe-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst materials are
   considered promising nonprecious alternatives to traditional
   platinum-based catalysts. These catalyst materials are generally
   produced by high-temperature pyrolysis treatments of readily available
   carbon, nitrogen, and iron sources. Adequate control of the structure
   and active site formation during pyrolysis methods is nearly impossible.
   Thus, the chemical nature, structure, and ORR mechanism of catalytically
   active sites in these materials is a subject of significant debate. We
   have proposed a method, utilizing CN- ions as ORR inhibitors on Fe-based
   catalysts, to provide insight into the exact nature and chemistry of the
   catalytically active sites. Moreover, we propose two possible
   catalytically active site formation mechanisms occurring during
   high-temperature pyrolysis treatments, dependent on the specific type of
   precursor and synthesis methods utilized. We have further provided
   direct evidence of our proposed active site formations using ToF-SIMS
   negative and positive ion imaging. This knowledge will be beneficial to
   future work directed at the development of Fe-based catalysts with
   improved ORR activity and operational stabilities for fuel cell and

Abstract = {{Rework is a persistent problem in construction. Reducing field rework is
   widely regarded as an effective way of improving construction
   performance in terms of productivity, cost, and schedule. Although much
   literature exists concerning rework reduction, there is a need for
   further analysis, validation, and improvement of rework reduction
   methods. This paper presents a generalized model for a rework reduction
   program (RRP), which is intended to reduce rework by managing a
   continuous improvement loop with four functional processes: (1) rework
   tracking and cause classification, (2) evaluation of rework and its
   causes, (3) corrective action planning, and (4) integration of changes
   into the total management system. Analysis is conducted to examine and
   verify the functional mechanisms and effectiveness of the generalized
   model, by investigating a rework reduction program implemented in
   practice for a series of dozens of small projects executed by three
   contractors that represents the generalized model, and by analyzing the
   impact trends on rework in terms of frequency, cost, and labor hours
   over a considerable time period. The paper's primary contribution to the
   overall body of knowledge is that it provides statistical evidence that
   the occurrence and impact of rework can be reduced significantly with
   such a program. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000552. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Second-order reaction rate constants of micropollutants with ozone
   (k(O3)) and hydroxyl radicals (k(OH)) are essential for evaluating their
   removal efficiencies from water during ozonation and advanced oxidation
   processes. Kinetic data are unavailable for many of the emerging
   micropollutants. Twenty-four micropollutants with very diverse
   structures and applications including endocrine disrupting compounds,
   pharmaceuticals, and personal care products were selected, and their
   k(O3) and k(OH) values were determined using bench-scale reactors (at pH
   7 and T = 20 degrees C). Reactions with molecular ozone are highly
   selective as indicated by their k(O3) values ranging from 10(-2)-10(7)
   M-1 s(-1). The general trend of ozone reactivity can be explained by
   micropollutant structures in conjunction with the electrophilic nature
   of ozone reactions. All of the studied compounds are highly reactive
   with hydroxyl radicals as shown by their high k(OH) values (10(8)-10(10)
   M-1 s(-1)) even though they are structurally very diverse. For compounds
   with a low reactivity toward ozone, hydroxyl radical based treatment
   such as O-3/H2O2 or UV/H2O2 is a viable alternative. This study
   contributed to filling the data gap pertaining kinetic data of organic
   micropollutants while confirming results reported in the literature
   where available. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have a large potential to
   reduce greenhouse gases emissions and increase fuel economy and fuel
   flexibility. PHEVs are propelled by the energy from both gasoline and
   electric power sources. Penetration of PHEVs into the automobile market
   affects the electrical grid through an increase in electricity demand.
   This paper studies effects of the wide spread adoption of PHEVs on peak
   and base load demands in Ontario, Canada. Long-term forecasting models
   of peak and base load demands and the number of light-duty vehicles sold
   were developed. To create proper forecasting models, both linear
   regression (LR) and non-linear regression (NLR) techniques were
   employed, considering different ranges in the demographic, climate and
   economic variables. The results from the LR and NLR models were compared
   and the most accurate one was selected. Furthermore, forecasting the

Abstract = {{In this letter, we study a two-user Gaussian Interference Channel (GIC)
   with constellation-based transmitters where both transmitters utilize
   PSK signaling and both receivers treat interference as noise. It is
   verified that if one user rotates its constellation appropriately
   compared to the constellation of the other user, the achievable sum-rate
   in the network considerably increases. Due to the fact that the noise
   plus interference at each receiver is mixed-Gaussian, there is no closed
   formula for the sum-rate. Using Fano's inequality, a lower bound is
   developed on the sum-rate in the network. The lower bound is tight in
   the sense that it identifies the optimal value for the angle of
   rotation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed lower bound can
   be larger than the exact value of sum-rate achieved by random Gaussian
   codes or Time-Division-Multiplexing (TDM).}},

   CONDITION FOR GAS MIXTURES}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A prescribed pressure is the most common flow boundary condition used in
   flow simulations. In the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method,
   boundary pressure is controlled by the number flux of the simulating
   molecules entering the domain. In the conventional DSMC algorithm, this
   number flux is calculated iteratively using sampled values of velocity
   and number density by means of an expression derived from the Maxwell
   distribution function. It is known that this procedure does not work
   well for low speed flows which are of interest in most micro-flow
   applications and the statistical scatter of the DSMC results is
   generally stated to be the main reason. However, the Maxwell
   distribution used in the pressure boundary treatment is valid for
   equilibrium conditions, and therefore, current implementations of the
   DSMC pressure boundary treatment are limited to boundaries with
   sufficiently small rarefaction erects. This is not the case for some
   practical problems in which highly rarefied flows through the boundaries
   lead to considerable nonequilibrium effects. In this study, an
   expression for the species number flux is derived using the
   Chapman-Enskog velocity distribution to improve the pressure boundary
   condition. The resulting algorithm is then used for modeling a
   micro-channel binary gas mixture flow with prescribed pressure boundary
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The heat transfer that occurs during bottom water jet impingement on a
   hot steel plate has been investigated in terms of the effect inclination
   angle and flow rate. This research was carried out to develop
   quantitative knowledge of the heat transfer, which occurs on the runout
   table, a crucial component in the hot rolling production of advanced
   high strength steels. Industrially produced hot-rolled steel samples
   were instrumented with numerous subsurface thermocouples installed close
   to the quench surface. The experimental measurements were used in
   conjunction with an inverse heat conduction (IHC) model to quantify
   boiling characteristics as well as heat extraction histories for the
   different nozzle inclination angles and flow rates. It was found that,
   as nozzle inclination angle increased, the degree of asymmetry of the
   cooled region on the surface of the sample was increased and the overall
   rate of heat extraction decreased. The angle of inclination had a
   significant effect on overall heat extraction; a vertical nozzle was the
   most efficient from a perspective of heat transfer under the nozzle. As
   expected, as flow rates increased, the amount of heat energy extracted
   increased for all the conditions studied, regardless of the nozzle
   inclination. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007127]}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of the thermal and mechanical properties of the
   negative photoresist KMPR and the influence of processing conditions on
   those properties. The process parameters chosen all relate to the
   cross-linking level of the photoresist: the UV exposure dose, the baking
   temperature and the bake length. The stability of KMPR at high
   temperatures was also examined. The glass transition temperature was
   measured using dynamic mechanical analysis, with a maximum measured
   value of 128 degrees C achieved in our tests. Relating the glass
   transition temperature to the cross-linking level of the material,
   exposure doses higher than 2 J cm(-2) were shown to have a negligible
   effect on the cross-linking (for 80 mu m thick films). Using
   thermogravitmetric analysis, KMPR has been shown to lose significant
   mass when heated above 200 degrees C. Young's modulus of KMPR was
   measured to be between 2.0 GPa for samples hard-baked at 100 degrees C
   and 2.7 GPa for samples baked at 150 and 200 degrees C. Creep behavior
   for KMPR held under strain was studied for samples prepared under a
   range of processing temperatures. Finally the thermally-induced
   cross-linking of unexposed KMPR was studied, with samples post-exposure
   baked at 150 degrees C, or 120 degrees C for at least an hour,
   cross-linking sufficiently to prevent development.}},

Abstract = {{Highly parallel VLSI implementations of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
   decoders have a large number of interconnections, which can result in
   designs with low logic density. Bit-serial architectures have been
   developed that reduce the number of wires needed, however, they do not
   fully realize the potential for deeply pipelined serial data processing.
   Digit-online arithmetic allows operations to be performed in a serial,
   digit-by-digit manner, making it ideal for use in implementing a
   digit-serial LDPC decoder. Digit-online circuits for the primitive
   operations required for an offset min-sum LDPC decoder are simple, and
   allow deep pipelining at the digit level. A new hardware architecture
   for LDPC decoding is demonstrated, using redundant number systems for
   the internal representation of values.
   We present post-layout decoder results for the (2048, 1723) 10GBASE-T
   LDPC code in a general-purpose 65 nm CMOS technology. The decoder
   requires a core area of 10.89 mm(2) and operates at a clock frequency of

Abstract = {{Many applications in rehabilitation and sports training require the
   assessment of the patient's status based on observation of their
   movement. Small wireless sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes,
   can be utilized to provide a quantitative measure of the human movement
   for assessment. In this paper, a kinematics-based approach is developed
   to estimate human leg posture and velocity from wearable sensors during
   the performance of typical physiotherapy and training exercises. The
   proposed approach uses an extended Kalman filter to estimate joint
   angles from accelerometer and gyroscopic data and is capable of
   recovering joint angles from arbitrary 3D motion. Additional joint limit
   constraints are implemented to reduce drift, and an automated approach
   is developed for estimating and adapting the process noise during online
   estimation. The approach is validated through a user study consisting of
   20 subjects performing knee and hip rehabilitation exercises. When
   compared to motion capture, the approach achieves an average
   root-mean-square error of 4.27 cm for unconstrained motion, with an
   average joint error of 6.5 degrees. The average root-mean-square error
   is 3.31 cm for sagittal planar motion, with an average joint error of
   4.3 degrees.}},

   controlled levels of protein display, in this case, eGFP. To achieve
   this characterization, a number of data processing steps were needed to
   ensure that the observed phenomena were indeed capturing differences in
   the phages produced. Phage display of eGFP resulted in altered side
   scatter and fluorescence profile, and sub-populations could be
   identified within what would otherwise be considered uniform
   populations. Surprisingly, this study has found that side scatter may be

Abstract = {{In many applications it is necessary to calculate heat transfer between
   aerosolized nanoparticles and the surrounding gas, for example when
   inferring particle sizes from time-resolved laser-induced incandescence
   (TiRe-LII) data. Under transition regime conditions the heat transfer
   rate from the aerosolized nanoparticles is often approximated using
   Fuchs's boundary-sphere method, in which the problem domain is
   subdivided into a collisionless shell surrounding the nanoparticle that
   represents the Knudsen layer, surrounded by a continuum gas.
   Traditionally the collisionless shell thickness is set equal to the mean
   free path at the boundary sphere temperature, but recently several LII
   practitioners have adopted a more complex treatment that accounts for
   particle curvature and the directional distribution of incident gas
   molecules. This paper assesses this approach using Direct Simulation
   Monte Carlo (DSMC): while this approach accurately represents the true
   Knudsen layer thickness, it does not improve the accuracy of heat
   conduction rates under conditions typical of LII experiments. (C) 2012

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{49-62}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, boron steel sheet metal blanks were austenized and
   quenched at five different cooling rates ranging from 14 degrees C/s to
   50 degrees C/s, which resulted in as-quenched microstructures that
   ranged from bainitic to martensitic respectively. Micro-hardness tests
   revealed a linear relationship between the Vickers hardness and percent
   area fraction of martensite and bainite present in the quenched
   specimens. Miniature tensile specimens were machined from the quenched
   blanks and tested in tension at four strain rates from 0.003 s(-1) to
   1075 s(-1). For the 0.003 s(-1) tests, the ultimate tensile strength
   (UTS) increased from 816 MPa to 1447 MPa for the 14 degrees C/s and 50
   degrees C/s quench condition respectively. By elevating the strain rate
   from 0.003 s(-1) to 1075 s(-1), the UTS of the 14 degrees C/s specimens
   increased by 134 MPa, while the increase in UTS of the 50 degrees C/s
   specimens was measured to be 170 MPa for an equivalent change in loading
   rate. The percent area reduction of the fracture surface was 70\% for
   the 14 degrees C/s specimens and decreased to 58\% for the 50 degrees
   C/s specimens. The true stress versus effective plastic strain (flow
   stress) curves were used to develop the ``Tailored Crash Model{''} (TCM)
   which is a constitutive model that is a function of strain. strain rate,
   and as-quenched Vickers hardness (or area fraction martensite/bainite).
   Scanning electron microscope and optical microscope images of the
   fracture surfaces revealed a transition from ductile to shear fracture
   behaviour as the quench condition increased from 14 degrees C/s to 50
   degrees C/s. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{A great fraction of the world's energy requirements are presently met
   through the unfettered use of fossil-derived fuels. However, due to the
   anticipated demise of these energy sources and the environmental and
   socioeconomic concerns associated with their use, a recent paradigm
   shift is to displace conventional fuels with renewable energy sources.
   Among various alternatives, biomasses have garnered tremendous interests
   as potential feedstock for clean energy production. While numerous
   biorefinery schemes and conversion technologies exist for the
   transformation of biomass into usable energy forms, they are not
   cost-efficient and economically viable to compete with the existing
   petroleum-refinery technologies. In particular, the recalcitrant nature
   of several feedstock presents a major technological obstacle for their
   processing and transformation. Providentially, the synergistic
   integration of various biochemical and bioprocessing technologies is
   aiding in the establishment of future biomass energy programs. This
   article reviews the state of the art and future challenges in the recent
   development of biomass and associated transformation technologies for
   clean production of biofuels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Perfusion decellularisation is a promising technique in scaffold
   production for tissue engineering. The similarity of decellularised
   extracellular matrix to native matrix is attractive for the development
   of compatible and functional constructs for therapeutic applications.
   Here, whole organs were processed for tissue culture with an emphasis on
   production staging. Adult rat hearts were perfusion-decellularised on a
   modified chromatography system that facilitated the study of flow
   properties and effluent material to better understand the transport
   processes of decellularisation. Tracer pulse experiments confirmed gross
   integrity of the ECM, and suggested the accumulation of debris in tissue
   lumen at late decellularisation. The rate of protein loss matched visual
   indications of decellularisation, slowing to zero as the tissue achieved
   a uniform appearance. Decellularised hearts were cryopreserved for up to
   1 year before reconditioning including disinfection and soluble protein
   perfusion to remove adsorbed detergents. Canine blood outgrowth
   endothelial cells were seeded and cultured in a novel recellularisation
   apparatus with bubble-free aeration. After 9 days of culture, cells
   seeded in the lumen remained viable and exhibited well-attached
   morphology. This work presents approaches for the process analysis and
   non-destructive evaluation of decellularising tissue and demonstrates
   that cells may be successfully cultured on whole decellularised organs
   following long-term storage. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical

   performance of SCMCR were investigated. A multi-objective optimisation
   problem was solved at the operating stage using state-of-the-art
   AI-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with jumping genes
   adaptations (NSGA-II-JG), which resulted in Pareto Optimal solutions. It

Abstract = {{The oxidation of NO, CO and hydrocarbons (HC) individually, in mixtures,
   and with NO2 were investigated over a monolith-supported Pt/Al2O3
   catalyst under oxidising conditions. Although competitive adsorption and
   inhibition by other species on oxidation reactions is a relatively
   well-known phenomenon, this study represents a more comprehensive
   examination of such effects between key components in vehicle exhaust
   gases. NO7 was completely reduced by CO and C3H6, under NO2 limited
   conditions, at temperatures as low as 110 degrees C and at temperatures
   above 140 degrees C with dodecane and m-xylene. NO2 was then again
   observed once the extent of oxidation of the other species by oxygen was
   significant. Under the conditions tested, NO, CO and HC oxidation was
   inhibited by NO2 in the feed gas mixture. HC were also found to inhibit
   the oxidation of NO and other HC species due to site adsorption
   competition. For CO, HC did not change the onset of oxidation, but did
   inhibit the extent after their light off began. At low temperatures, CO
   was initially found to inhibit NO oxidation, but at higher temperatures,
   once CO oxidation was significant, CO promoted NO conversion to NO2. The
   observed inhibition effects of the different gases on HC oxidation were
   not additive, indicating one species would cause inhibition, but once
   its inhibition ended, another species could still then cause inhibition.
   The combined effect of C3H6, NO and NO2 on CO conversion was found to be
   additive. This is because CO oxidation started prior C3H6. (c) 2011

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{365}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Density functional theory (OFT) calculations were performed to study the
   dissociation properties of CH4 on Ni (1 00), Ni (1 1 1), and Ni (5 5 3)
   surfaces. The transition states for methane sequential dissociations on
   the three surfaces were identified. The adsorption properties of the CH,
   (x = 0-3) and H species on Ni (1 0 0), Ni (1 1 1), and Ni (5 5 3)
   surfaces were also studied. The results show that the adsorption of CHx
   (x = 1-3) and H species is favored on less packed surfaces, e.g., Ni (1
   0 0) and Ni (5 5 3). Among the surface species, carbon atom shows the
   most significant differences in adsorption energies between the
   different surfaces investigated: its adsorption strength follows the
   order Ni (1 0 0) > Ni (5 5 3) > Ni (1 1 1). Projected density of state
   for the carbon and surface Ni atoms on the three surfaces revealed that
   this decrease in atomic C adsorption strength for Ni (1 0 0), Ni (5 5
   3), and Ni (1 1 1) originates from the reduction in the average energy
   of the d-band center of the surface Ni atoms. The analysis of the
   energetics for CH4 successive dehydrogenations on the various surfaces
   shows that on Ni (1 1 1), CH dehydrogenation proceeds with a barrier of
   1.38 eV and was found to be the rate-determining step for CH4
   dissociation on Ni (1 1 1). On Ni (1 0 0) and Ni (5 5 3), CH4
   dissociative adsorption, CH4 -> CH3 + H, was found to be the
   rate-determining step with barrier heights of 1.23 eV and 1.08 eV,
   respectively. The results showed that the Ni (5 5 3) and Ni (1 0 0)
   promote the dissociation of CH x species by lowering the activation
   barriers when compared to Ni (1 1 1) due to their high average energy of
   the d-band center. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of 15 different
   pharmaceuticals in the presence or absence of UV was comparatively
   studied using titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase and rutile nanowires as
   well as commercially available TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles. Both anatase
   and rutile nanowires were grown under environmentally benign
   hydrothermal conditions. The kinetic adsorption studies demonstrate
   adsorption is usually complete within 20-40 min. The nanomaterials
   evaluated differed in photocatalytic efficiency by compound, with the
   UV-exposed anatase-phased nanowires being more effective at degrading
   venlafaxin, atorvastatin, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, lincomycin,
   norfluoxetine, diclofenac, and trimethoprim, while the rutile-phased
   nanowires were more effective for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. The sole
   exposure to 265 nm UV leads to effectively decay sulfamethoxazole (SFX)
   and atrazine. Intermediate analysis unveils a higher mineralization of
   SFX is obtained with TiO2 photocalytic degradation compared to the
   photolysis with a UVC at 254 nm. These initial studies provide
   mechanistic insight into the effectiveness of TiO2 nanowires and

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{65-76}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The stochastic gamma process has been widely used to model uncertain
   degradation in engineering systems and structures. The optimization of
   the condition-based maintenance (CBM) policy is typically based on the
   minimization of the asymptotic cost rate. In the financial planning of a
   maintenance program, however, a more accurate prediction interval for
   the cost is needed for prudent decision making. The prediction interval
   cannot be estimated unless the probability distribution of cost is
   known. In this context, the asymptotic cost rate has a limited utility.
   This paper presents the derivation of the probability distribution of
   maintenance cost, when the system degradation is modelled as a
   stochastic gamma process. A renewal equation is formulated to derive the
   characteristic function, then the discrete Fourier transform of the
   characteristic function leads to the complete probability distribution
   of cost in a finite time setting. The proposed approach is useful for a
   precise estimation of prediction limits and optimization of the
   maintenance cost. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, performance assessment of a novel system based on
   parabolic trough solar collectors and an organic Rankine cycle for
   combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) is presented. In this system,
   a portion of the waste heat is used for heating through a heat exchanger
   and the other portion is used for cooling through a single-effect
   absorption chiller. This study considers three modes of operation: a
   solar mode, which is characterized by a low-solar radiation; a solar and
   storage mode, which is characterized by a high-solar radiation; and a
   storage mode, which is the operation of the system at night time through
   a thermal storage tank subsystem. To assess the performance improvement
   of the present system, three further cases are considered: electrical
   power, cooling-cogeneration, and heating-cogeneration. This system is
   designed to produce 500 kW of electricity. Different output parameters
   efficiency, net electrical power, and electrical to heating and cooling
   ratios are examined in this study. This study reveals that the maximum
   electrical efficiency for the solar mode is 15\%, for the solar and
   storage mode is 7\%, and for the storage mode is 6.5\%. Alternatively,
   when CCHP is used, the efficiency increases significantly. The maximum
   CCHP efficiency for the solar mode is 94\%, for the solar and storage
   mode is 47\%, and for the storage mode is 42\%. Furthermore, this study
   shows that the electrical to cooling ratio is sensitive to the change in
   the ORC pump inlet temperature. Therefore, the variation in this
   temperature could be used as a good control for the amount of the
   cooling power needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A broadband digital beamforming algorithm is proposed for directional
   filtering of temporally-broadband bandpass space-time plane-waves at
   radio frequencies (RFs). The enhancement of desired waves, as well as
   rejection of undesired interfering plane-waves, is simulated. A
   systolic- and wavefront-array architecture is proposed for the real-time
   implementation of second-order spatially-bandpass (SBP) 2-D infinite
   impulse response (IIR) beam filters having potential applications in
   broadband beamforming of temporally down-converted RF signals. The
   higher speed of operation and potentially reduced power consumption of
   the asynchronous architecture of wavefront-array processors (WAPs) in
   comparison to the conventional synchronous hardware has emerging
   applications in radio-astronomy, radar, navigation, space science,
   cognitive radio, and wireless communications. Further, the bit error
   rate (BER) performance improvement along with the reduced computational
   complexity of the 2-D IIR SBP frequency-planar digital filter over
   digital phased array feed (PAF) beamformer is provided. A nominal BER
   versus signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) gain of 10-16 dB compared to
   case where beamforming is not applied, and a gain of 2-3 dB at
   approximately half the number of parallel multipliers to digital PAF,
   are observed. The results of application-specific integrated circuit
   (ASIC) synthesis of the digital filter designs are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive body biasing (ABB) is a popularly used technique to mitigate
   the increasing impact of manufacturing process variations on leakage
   power dissipation. The efficacy of the ABB technique can be improved by
   partitioning a design into a number of ``body-bias islands,{''} each
   with its individual body-bias voltage. In this paper, we propose a
   system-level leakage variability mitigation technique to partition a
   multiprocessor system into body-bias islands at the processing element
   (PE) granularity at design time, and to optimally assign body-bias
   voltages to each island post-fabrication. As opposed to prior gate-and
   circuit-level partitioning techniques that constrain the global clock
   frequency of the system, we allow each island to run at a different
   speed and constrain only the relevant system performance metrics-in our
   case the execution deadlines. Experimental results show the efficacy of
   the proposed methodology; we demonstrate up to 40\% and 60\% reduction
   in the mean and standard deviation of leakage power dissipation
   respectively, compared to a baseline system without ABB. Furthermore,
   the proposed design-time partitioning is, on average, 38x faster than a
   previously proposed Monte Carlo-based technique, while providing similar
   reductions in leakage power dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{Azo dyes that consist of a large quantity of dye wastewater are toxic
   and persistent to biodegradation, while they should be removed before
   being discharged to water body. In this study, Alizarin Yellow R (AYR)
   as a model azo dye was decolorized in a combined bio-system of
   membrane-free, continuous up-flow bio-catalyzed electrolysis reactor
   (UBER) and subsequent aerobic bio-contact oxidation reactor (ABOR). With
   the supply of external power source 0.5V in the UBER, AYR decolorization
   efficiency increased up to 94.8 +/- 1.5\%. Products formation
   efficiencies of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and 5-aminosalicylic acid
   (5-ASA) were above 90\% and 60\%, respectively. Electron recovery
   efficiency based on AYR removal in cathode zone was nearly 100\% at HRTs
   longer than 6h. Relatively high concentration of AYR accumulated at
   higher AYR loading rates (>780 g m(-3) d(-1)) likely inhibited acetate
   oxidation of anode-respiring bacteria on the anode, which decreased
   current density in the UBER; optimal AYR loading rate for the UBER was
   680 g m(-3) d(-1) (HRT 2.5 h). The subsequent ABOR further improved
   effluent quality. Overall the Chroma decreased from 320 times to 80
   times in the combined bio-system to meet the textile wastewater
   discharge standard II in China. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of powder composition on in situ TiC formation
   within an Fe-based matrix coating during laser cladding was studied.
   Different atomic ratios of C:Ti (45\% and 55\%) were selected in order
   to adjust the matrix from an Fe-Ti-based composition to an Fe-C-based
   one. Fe percentages of 70, 60, 50 and 10 wt\% were explored to increase
   the volume fraction of TiC in the clad. Results showed that chemical
   composition affects the TiC morphology as well as the TiC distribution
   and hardness profile in the clad. By increasing the C: Ti ratio from 45
   at\% to 55 at\%, the volume fraction of the formed TiC increases. A
   higher volume fraction of TiC in the clad resulted in increases clad
   hardness. SEM and EDS analyses were used to characterize the phases in
   the clad, while increasing the C ratio promoted the formation of excess
   graphite in the Fe matrix. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The central challenge that has limited the development of catalytic
   hydrogenation of diene-based polymer latex (i.e., latex hydrogenation)
   in large-scale production pertains to how to accomplish the optimal
   interplay of accelerating the hydrogenation rate, decreasing the
   required quantity of catalyst, and eliminating the need for an organic
   solvent. Here, we attempt to overcome this dilemma through decreasing
   the dimensions of the polymer substrate (such as below 20 nm) used in
   the hydrogenation process. Very small diene-based polymer nanoparticles
   were synthesized and then used as the substrates for the subsequent
   latex hydrogenation. The effects of particle size, temperature, and
   catalyst concentration on the hydrogenation rate were fully
   investigated. An apparent first-order kinetic model was proposed to
   describe the rate of hydrogen uptake with respect to the concentration
   of the olefinic substrate (C?C). Mass transfer of both the hydrogen and
   catalyst involved in this solid (polymer)liquid (water)gas (hydrogen)
   three-phase latex system is discussed. The competitive coordination of
   the catalyst between the C?C and acrylonitrile units within the
   copolymer was elucidated. It was found that (1) using very small
   diene-based polymer nanoparticles as the substrate, the hydrogenation
   rate of polymer latex can be increased vastly to achieve a high
   conversion of 95\% while a quite low level of catalyst loading is
   required; (2) this latex hydrogenation process was completely free of
   organic solvent and no cross-linking was found; (3) the mass transfer of
   hydrogen is not a rate-determining step in the present hydrogenation
   reactions; (4) the catalyst was dispersed homogeneously within the
   polymer nanoparticles; (5) for the reaction that has reached about 95
   mol \% conversion, the kinetic study shows that the reaction is
   chemically controlled with an apparent activation energy of 100110
   kJ/mol; (6) the strong coordination of C{[}tbond]N to the catalytically
   active species RhH2Cl(PPh3)2 imposed a negative effect on the
   hydrogenation activity. The present research provides a comprehensive
   study to appreciate the underlying chemistry of latex hydrogenation of
   diene-based polymer nanoparticles and more importantly shows great
   promise toward the commercialization of a green catalytic hydrogenation
   operation of a diene-based polymer latex in industry. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Poly(butadiene-co-acrylonitrile) (NBR) nanoparticles were synthesized in
   a semibatch emulsion polymerization system using Gemini surfactant
   trimethylene-1,3-bis (dodecyldimethylammonium bromide), referred to as
   Gemini-type surfactant (GS) 12-3-12, as the emulsifier. In this
   polymerization system, an enhanced decomposition rate of initiator
   ammonium persulfate was achieved even under the low temperature of 50
   degrees C which is attributed to the acidic initiation environment
   provided using GS 12-3-12. The microstructure and copolymer composition
   of the polymer nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier-transformed
   infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The effects of
   the surfactant concentration on the particle size, zeta potential,
   polymerization conversion, copolymer composition, molecular weight, and
   glass transition temperature (Tg) were investigated. It was found that
   the particle diameter can be controlled by the surfactant concentration
   and monomer/water ratio and particle sizes below 20 nm can be reached.
   The obtained latex particles exhibit a spherical morphology. A kinetic
   study of the copolymerization reaction was carried out, which indicated
   that an azeotropic composition was produced. The synthesized fine NBR
   nanoparticles can be employed as the nano substrate for a subsequent
   hydrogenation process so as to overcome the challenge involved in the

Abstract = {{In this paper, bifurcation and chaotic behavior of the
   two-enzyme-two-compartment acetylcholine (ACh) neurocycle model
   developed earlier (Mustafa, Elkamel, et al., 2009; Mustafa, Ibrahim, et
   al., 2009; Mustafa et al., 2012) are investigated considering the
   partial dissociation of acetic acid in both presynaptic and postsynaptic
   neurons as well. The two-parameter continuation technique is used to
   investigate static and dynamic solutions of the ACh cholinergic
   neurocycle system based on feed choline concentration as the main
   bifurcation parameter. A detailed bifurcation analysis is carried out in
   order to uncover some important features of the system, such as static
   bifurcation, dynamic bifurcation and chaotic behavior. These findings
   are related to the real phenomena occurring in the neurons, like
   periodic stimulation of neural cells and non-regular functioning of ACh
   receptors. It is found that pH exists in the range of 7.05-7.75 which is
   inside the physiological range of pH in the brain taking into
   consideration partial dissociation of the acetic acid. The disturbances
   and irregularities (chaotic attractors) occurring in the ACh cholinergic
   system may be good indications to cholinergic diseases such as the
   Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published

Abstract = {{Product formulation design involves selecting a few ingredients from a
   large set through screening based on several criteria, and using the
   optimal proportion in the formulation. The limitation in the traditional
   strategy for chemical product formulation design is to carry out a large
   number of trials, which in most practical cases, either economically
   infeasible or a very slow process. Furthermore, the presence of
   constraints, sometimes contradictory to some extent, further complicates
   the formulation design process. Such traditional trail-and-error and
   one-factor-at-a-time methodologies can be very cumbersome. They can also
   lead to a slow and high-cost process. The outcome of following such
   techniques does not usually lead to optimal designs: In this work, a
   methodology that deals with the complexity of product formulation design
   problem with contradictory constraints is presented and illustrated in a
   real case study. This methodology starts. with defining needs for a new
   product and generating ideas. It then screens the candidate ingredients,
   using design of experiment techniques, and develops a model for each
   response. It then inverts the models using a nonlinear optimization
   technique, and obtains, an optimal design for the product based on the
   desired properties. This methodology is proven to be more effective,
   faster, and less expensive in the development of new products or
   improvements on the existing ones. Furthermore, the final product is an
   optimal formulation, with respect to a preset performance measure and
   desired properties. The procedure is illustrated and tested on the case
   of disinfectant formulations. The optimized formulation was prepared,
   tested, and compared to an existing formulation. The optimized
   formulation faired significantly better than the existing product, in
   terms of technical and economic preference.}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference has emerged as a powerful tool in biological and
   pharmaceutical research; however, the enzymatic degradation and
   polyanionic nature of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) lead to their poor
   cellular uptake and eventual biological effects. Among nonviral delivery
   systems, cell-penetrating peptides have been recently employed to
   improve the siRNA delivery efficiency. Here we introduce an 18-mer
   amphipathic, amino-acid-pairing peptide, C6, as an siRNA delivery
   carrier. Peptide C6 adopted a helical structure upon coassembling with
   siRNA. The C6-siRNA coassembly showed a size distribution between 50 and
   250 nm, confirmed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force
   microscopy. The C6-siRNA interaction enthalpy and stoichiometry were 8.8
   kJ.mol(-1) and 6.5, respectively, obtained by isothermal titration
   calorimetry. A minimum C6/siRNA molar ratio of 10:1 was required to form
   stable coassemblies/complexes, indicated by agarose gel shift assay and
   fluorescence spectroscopy. Peptide C6 showed lower toxicity and higher
   efficiency in cellular uptake of siRNA compared with Lipofectamine 2000.
   Fluorescence microscopy images also confirmed the localization of
   C6-siRNA complexes in the cytoplasm using Cy3-labeled siRNAs. These
   results indicate high capabilities of C6 in forming safe and stable
   complexes with siRNA and enhancing its cellular uptake,}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative communication has been recently applied to vehicular
   networks to enable coverage extension and enhance link reliability
   through distributed spatial diversity. In this study, the authors
   investigate the performance of a cooperative vehicular network over a
   doubly selective (i.e. frequency-selective and time-selective) fading
   channel. Under the assumption of amplify-and-forward relaying with
   orthogonal cooperation protocol, the authors derive a pairwise error
   probability (PEP) expression and demonstrate the achievable diversity
   gains. The authors' results demonstrate that, through proper linear
   constellation precoding, the cooperative vehicular scheme is able to
   extract the maximum available diversity in frequency (through multipath
   diversity), time (through Doppler diversity) and spatial (through
   cooperative diversity) dimensions. The effect of imperfect channel state
   information is also studied through an asymptotical PEP analysis. The
   authors further conduct Monte-Carlo simulations to confirm the
   analytical derivations and present the error rate performance of the
   vehicular scheme under various mobility conditions and scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid numerical simulation method is presented to model and analyze
   integrated terahertz (THz) photomixer antennas. The proposed
   computational method combines an optoelectronic solver and a full-wave
   electromagnetic solver to rigorously model continuous wave (CW) THz
   photomixer sources. In this hybrid computational approach, the
   photomixer source is modeled in a rigorous manner without any
   approximation. The optoelectronic solver is used to find absorbed
   optical intensity and optical carrier generation rate inside the fast
   photoconductive region through solving an optical scattering problem.
   Then, the equations governing the charge carrier transport inside the
   photoconductor are solved to give THz photo-current by considering
   realistic material parameters. Finally, through a full-wave
   electromagnetic solver, and using calculated photo-current from the
   optoelectronic simulator, antenna parameters and radiated THz power are
   obtained. Using the proposed hybrid simulation method the effects of
   photomixer parameters on the THz photo-current and radiated power is
   rigorously investigated for several geometries. Moreover, results of a
   parametric study on various factors such as carrier lifetime of
   material, incident optical power density, applied bias voltage, THz beat
   frequency, and the gap size are presented. The method can be used for
   accurate design refinement at pre-fabrication stage.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying climate-driven trends in river flows on a global basis is
   hampered by a lack of long, quality time series data for rivers with
   relatively undisturbed regimes. This is a global problem compounded by
   the lack of support for essential long-term monitoring. Experience
   demonstrates that, with clear strategic objectives, and the support of
   sponsoring organizations, reference hydrologic networks can constitute
   an exceptionally valuable data source to effectively identify, quantify
   and interpret hydrological change-the speed and magnitude of which is
   expected to a be a primary driver of water management and flood
   alleviation strategies through the future-and for additional
   applications. Reference hydrologic networks have been developed in many
   countries in the past few decades. These collections of streamflow
   gauging stations, that are maintained and operated with the intention of
   observing how the hydrology of watersheds responds to variations in
   climate, are described. The status of networks under development is
   summarized. We suggest a plan of actions to make more effective use of

Abstract = {{Reference hydrologic networks (RHNs) can play an important role in
   monitoring for changes in the hydrological regime related to climate
   variation and change. Currently, the literature concerning hydrological
   response to climate variations is complex and confounded by the
   combinations of many methods of analysis, wide variations in hydrology,
   and the inclusion of data series that include changes in land use,
   storage regulation and water use in addition to those of climate. Three
   case studies that illustrate a variety of approaches to the analysis of
   data from RHNs are presented and used, together with a summary of
   studies from the literature, to develop approaches for the investigation
   of changes in the hydrological regime at a continental or global scale,
   particularly for international comparison. We present recommendations
   for an analysis framework and the next steps to advance such an
   initiative. There is a particular focus on the desirability of
   establishing standardized procedures and methodologies for both the
   creation of new national RHNs and the systematic analysis of data
   derived from a collection of RHNs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of structure and motion recovery from
   uncalibrated image sequences. It has been empirically proven that image
   measurement uncertainties can be modeled spatially and temporally by
   virtue of reprojection residuals. Consequently, a
   spatial-and-temporal-weighted factorization (STWF) algorithm is proposed
   to handle significant noise contained in the tracking data. This paper
   presents three novelties and contributions. First, the image
   reprojection residual of a feature point is demonstrated to be generally
   proportional to the error magnitude associated with the image point.
   Second, the error distributions are estimated from a different
   perspective, that of the reprojection residuals. The image errors are
   modeled both spatially and temporally to cope with different kinds of
   uncertainties. Previous studies have considered only the spatial
   information. Third, based on the estimated error distributions, an STWF
   algorithm is proposed to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of
   traditional approaches. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed
   technique does not require prior information of image measurement and is
   easy to implement. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real
   images validate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Image alignment is an important step in various biometric authentication
   applications such as palmprint recognition. Most of the existing
   palmprint alignment methods make use of some key points between fingers
   or in palm boundary to establish the local coordinate system for region
   of interest (ROI) extraction. The ROI is consequently used for feature
   extraction and matching. Such alignment methods usually yield a coarse
   alignment of the palmprint images, while many missed and false matches
   are actually caused by inaccurate image alignments. To improve the
   palmprint verification accuracy, in this paper, we present an efficient
   palmprint alignment refinement method. After extracting the principal
   lines from the palmprint image, we apply the iterative closest point
   method to them to estimate the translation and rotation parameters
   between two images. The estimated parameters are then used to refine the
   alignment of palmprint feature maps for a more accurate palmprint
   matching. The experimental results show that the proposed method greatly
   improves the palmprint recognition accuracy and it works in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Manganese borohydride (Mn(BH4)(2)) was successfully synthesized by a
   mechano-chemical activation synthesis (MCAS) from lithium borohydride
   (LiBH4) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) by applying high energy ball
   milling for 30 mm. For the first time a wide range of molar ratios n =
   1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 23 in the (nLiBH(4) + MnCl2) mixture was investigated.
   During ball milling for 30 mm the mixtures release only a very small
   quantity of H-2 that increases with the molar ratio n but does not
   exceed similar to 0.2 wt.\% for n = 23. However, longer milling duration
   leads to more H-2 released. For the equimolar ratio n = 1 the principal
   phases synthesized are Li2MnCl4, an inverse cubic spinel phase, and the
   Mn(BH4)(2) borohydride. For n = 2 a LiCl salt is formed which coexists
   with Mn(BH4)(2). With the n increasing from 3 to 23 LiBH4 is not
   completely reacted and its increasing amount is retained in the
   microstructure coexisting with LiCl and Mn(BH4)(2). Gas mass
   spectrometry during Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) up to 450
   degrees C shows the release of hydrogen as a principal gas with a
   maximum intensity around 130-150 degrees C accompanied by a miniscule
   quantity of borane B2H6. The intensity of the B2H6 peak is 200-600 times
   smaller than the intensity of the corresponding H-2 peak. In situ
   heating experiments using a continuous monitoring during heating show no
   evidence of melting of Mn(BH4)(2) up to about 270-280 degrees C. At 100
   degrees C under 1 bar H-2 pressure the ball milled n = 2 and 3 mixtures
   are capable of desorbing quite rapidly similar to 4 wt.\% H-2 which is a
   very large amount of H-2 considering that the mixture also contains 2
   mol of LiCl salt. The H-2 quantities experimentally desorbed at 100 and
   200 degrees C do not exceed the maximum theoretical quantities of H-2
   expected to be desorbed from Mn(BH4)(2) for various molar ratios n. It
   clearly confirms that the contribution from B2H6 evolved is negligibly
   small (if any) when desorption occurs isothermally in the practical
   temperature range 100-200 degrees C. It is found that the ball milled
   mixture with the molar ratio n = 3 exhibits the highest rate constant k
   and the lowest apparent activation energy for dehydrogenation, E-A
   similar to 102 kJ/mol. Decreasing or increasing the molar ratio n below
   or above 3 increases the apparent activation energy. Ball milled
   mixtures with the molar ratio n = 2 and 3 discharge slowly H-2 during
   storage at room temperature and 40 degrees C. The addition of 5 wt.\%
   nano-Ni with a specific surface area of 60.5 m(2)/g substantially
   enhances the rate of discharge at 40 degrees C. Copyright (C) 2012,

Abstract = {{Bond tests were conducted on 10 concrete beams strengthened with
   near-surface mounted (NSM) prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer
   (CFRP) rods under different fatigue load levels. In the NSM technique,
   grooves are cut on the tension side of the beams. The CFRP rods are then
   placed inside the grooves and prestressed. Then an epoxy adhesive is
   placed inside the groove to provide a bond between the concrete and the
   CFRP rod. The test variables included the type of CFRP rod (spirally
   wound or sand-coated) and the fatigue load level. The beams were tested
   in four-point bending. Unlike the bond failures for beams strengthened
   with nonprestressed CFRP rods, bond failure for beams strengthened with
   prestressed CFRP rods and tested under fatigue loading was by slipping
   between the CFRP rod and the epoxy that started at the support and
   propagated inward toward the loading point. The sand-coated rods showed
   a better bond fatigue performance than the spirally wound rods, where at
   a given load level the beams strengthened with sand-coated rods had
   longer fatigue lives than the beams strengthened with spirally wound
   rods. Also, for a given number of cycles, the beams strengthened with
   prestressed CFRP rods failed in bond at a lower applied load range than
   the beams strengthened with a nonprestressed CFRP rod. At onset of
   excessive slip (failure), the force distribution in the CFRP rod in the
   end region was the same for a given rod type. Thus, the shear stress
   value and distribution in the region close to the support was the same
   at onset of excessive slip (failure) for a given rod type regardless of
   the applied load level. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000298. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, the imaging capability of our wide-spectrum
   frequency-domain photoacoustic (FD-PA) imaging alias ``photoacoustic
   radar{''} methodology for imaging of soft tissues is explored. A
   practical application of the mathematical correlation processing method
   with relatively long (1 ms) frequency-modulated optical excitation is
   demonstrated for reconstruction of the spatial location of the PA
   sources. Image comparison with ultrasound (US) modality was investigated
   to see the complementarity between the two techniques. The obtained
   results with a phased array probe on tissue phantoms and their
   comparison to US images demonstrated that the FD-PA technique has strong
   potential for deep subsurface imaging with excellent contrast and high
   signal-to-noise ratio. FD-PA images of blood vessels in a human wrist
   and an in vivo subcutaneous tumor in a rat model are presented. As in
   other imaging modalities, the employment of contrast agents is desirable
   to improve the capability of medical diagnostics. Therefore, this study
   also evaluated and characterized the use of Food and Drug Administration

Abstract = {{Unwanted exposures to high-energy or ionizing radiation can be hazardous
   to health. Prolonged or accumulated radiation dosage from either
   particle-emissions such as alpha/beta, proton, electron, neutron
   emissions, or high-energy electromagnetic waves such as X-rays/gamma
   rays, may result in carcinogenesis, cell mutations, organ failure, etc.
   To avoid occupational hazards from these kinds of exposures, researchers
   have traditionally used heavy metals or their composites to attenuate
   the radiation. However, protective gear made of heavy metals are not
   only cumbersome but also are capable of producing more penetrative
   secondary radiations which requires additional shielding, increasing the
   cost and the weight factor. Consequently, significant research efforts
   have been focused toward designing efficient, lightweight,
   cost-effective, and flexible shielding materials for protection against
   radiation encountered in various industries (aerospace, hospitals, and
   nuclear reactors). In this regard, polymer composites have become
   attractive candidates for developing materials that can be designed to
   effectively attenuate photon or particle radiation. In this paper, we
   review the state-of-the-art of polymer composites reinforced with
   micro/nanomaterials, for their use as radiation shields.}},

Abstract = {{Object-oriented frameworks are widely used to develop new applications.
   They provide reusable concepts that are instantiated in application code
   through potentially complex implementation steps such as subclassing,
   implementing interfaces, and calling framework operations.
   Unfortunately, many modern frameworks are difficult to use because of
   their large and complex APIs and frequently incomplete user
   documentation. To cope with these problems, developers often use
   existing framework applications as a guide. However, locating concept
   implementations in those sample applications is typically challenging
   due to code tangling and scattering. To address this challenge, we
   introduce the notion of concept-implementation templates, which
   summarize the necessary concept-implementation steps and identify them
   in the sample application code, and a technique, named FUDA, to
   automatically extract such templates from dynamic traces of sample
   applications. This paper further presents the results of two experiments
   conducted to evaluate the quality and usefulness of FUDA templates. The
   experimental evaluation of FUDA with 14 concepts in five widely used
   frameworks suggests that the technique is effective in producing
   templates with relatively few false positives and false negatives for
   realistic concepts by using two sample applications. Moreover, we
   observed in a user study with 28 programmers that the use of templates
   reduced the concept-implementation time compared to when documentation
   was used.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies radio resource allocation for mobile terminals (MTs)
   in a heterogeneous wireless access medium. Unlike the existing solutions
   in literature, we consider the simultaneous presence of both
   single-network and multi-homing services in the networking environment.
   In single-network services, an MT is assigned to the best wireless
   access network available at its location. On the other hand, in
   multi-homing services, an MT utilizes all available wireless access
   networks simultaneously. The objective of the radio resource allocation
   is of twofold: to determine the optimal assignment of MTs with
   single-network service to the available wireless access networks, and to
   find the corresponding optimal bandwidth allocation to the MTs with
   single-network and multi-homing services. We develop a sub-optimal
   decentralized implementation of the radio resource allocation, which
   relies on network cooperation to perform the allocation in a dynamic
   environment in an efficient manner. The MT plays an active role in the
   resource allocation operation, whether by selecting the best available
   wireless network for single-network services or by determining the
   required bandwidth share from each available network for multi-homing
   services. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed algorithm.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Periodic tilted nanostructures over large area have various
   applications. In this work tilted nanostructures were created by SEM
   scanning of electron beam resists with the substrate tilted at 45
   degrees. The key to the process is the usage of the dynamic focus
   function that is available for most SEM systems for imaging purpose (but
   not for lithography), as otherwise the tilted substrate will be out of
   focus of the electron beam. The pattern created by this method is
   limited to periodic pillar or hole array using negative or positive
   resist, respectively, with the number of pillars or holes per scan given
   by the image resolution (e. g., 1024 x 768). The diameter of the pillars
   or holes was determined by the exposure dose, which is in turn
   determined by the beam current and scan speed (scanning time per frame).
   The array period is controlled by the magnification (that determines
   image area, e. g., 1 mm(2)) and image resolution. The pillar or hole
   pattern in the resist can be further transferred to another material
   such as Au by electroplating. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{The domain of risk analysis is expanded to consider strategic
   interactions among multiple participants in the management of extreme
   risk in a system of systems. These risks are fraught with complexity,
   ambiguity, and uncertainty, which pose challenges in how participants
   perceive, understand, and manage risk of extreme events. In the case of
   extreme events affecting a system of systems, cause-and-effect
   relationships among initiating events and losses may be difficult to
   ascertain due to interactions of multiple systems and participants
   (complexity). Moreover, selection of threats, hazards, and consequences
   on which to focus may be unclear or contentious to participants within
   multiple interacting systems (ambiguity). Finally, all types of risk, by
   definition, involve potential losses due to uncertain events
   (uncertainty). Therefore, risk analysis of extreme events affecting a
   system of systems should address complex, ambiguous, and uncertain
   aspects of extreme risk. To accomplish this, a system of systems
   engineering methodology for risk analysis is proposed as a general
   approach to address extreme risk in a system of systems. Our
   contribution is an integrative and adaptive systems methodology to
   analyze risk such that strategic interactions among multiple
   participants are considered. A practical application of the system of
   systems engineering methodology is demonstrated in part by a case study
   of a maritime infrastructure system of systems interface, namely, the

Abstract = {{In electrostatic atomization, the input electrical energy causes
   breaking up of the droplet surface by utilizing a mutual repulsion of
   net charges accumulating on that surface. In this work a number of key
   parameters controlling the bio-oil droplet breakup process are
   identified and these correlations among the droplet size distribution,
   specific charges of droplets and externally applied electrical voltages
   are quantified. Theoretical considerations of the bag or strip breakup
   mechanism of biodiesel droplets experiencing electrostatic potential are
   compared to experimental outcomes. The theoretical analysis suggests the
   droplet breakup process is governed by the Rayleigh instability
   condition, which reveals the effects of droplets size, specific charge,
   surface tension force, and droplet velocities. Experiments confirm that
   the average droplet diameters decrease with increasing specific charges
   and this decreasing tendency is non-monotonic due to the motion of
   satellite drops in the non-uniform electrical field. The measured
   specific charges are found to be smaller than the theoretical values.
   And the energy transformation from the electrical energy to surface
   energy, in addition to the energy loss, Taylor instability breakup,
   non-excess polarization and some system errors, accounts for this
   discrepancy. The electrostatic force is the dominant factor controlling
   the mechanism of biodiesel breakup in electrostatic atomization.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sea-ice images
   are systematically processed every year in support of operational
   activities such as ship navigation and environmental monitoring. An
   automated approach that generates pixel-level sea-ice image
   classification is required since manual pixel-level classification is
   not feasible. Currently, using a standardized approach, trained ice
   analysts manually segment full SAR scenes into smaller polygons to
   record ice types and concentrations. Using these data, pixel-level
   classification can be achieved by initial unsupervised segmentation of
   each polygon, followed by automatic sea-ice labeling of the full scene.
   A fully automated Markov random field model that is used to assign
   labels to all segmented regions in the full scene has been designed and
   implemented. This approach is the first known successful end-to-end
   process for operational SAR sea-ice image classification. In addition, a
   novel performance evaluation framework has been developed to validate
   the segmentation and labeling of SAR sea-ice images. A trained sea-ice
   expert has conducted an arms length evaluation using this framework to
   generate a set of full-scene reference images used for testing. Testing
   demonstrates operational success of the labeling approach.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a hybrid finite element boundary integral algorithm
   to solve the problem of scattering from finite and infinite arrays of
   two-dimensional overfilled cavities engraved in a perfectly electric
   conducting flat screen. The solution region is divided into interior
   regions containing the cavities and their protruding portions, and the
   region exterior to the overfilled cavities. The finite element
   formulation is applied only inside the interior regions to derive a
   linear system of equations associated with field unknowns. Using
   two-boundary formulation, the surface integral equation employing the
   half-space Green's function is applied on the boundary located at the
   interface of protruding portions of the cavities and the half-space as a
   boundary constraint to truncate the solution region. Placing the
   truncation boundary on the protruding portions of the cavities results
   in highly efficient solution in terms of computational resources, which
   makes the algorithm well suited for the optimization problems involving
   scattering from grating surfaces. The near fields are generated for
   finite and infinite arrays of overfilled cavities with different
   dimensions. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We consider a network in which every node has a value that it wishes to
   disseminate to all other nodes, despite an attack by an adversary that
   can falsify messages on a number of the links. To achieve this
   objective, we study a class of linear iterative strategies in which, at
   each time-step, each node in the network broadcasts a value to its
   neighbors that is a linear combination of its previous value and the
   values received from its neighbors. We take the number of unreliable
   links to be bounded, in that the number of incoming unreliable links to
   any node plus the total number of other nodes with incoming unreliable
   links is no greater than some nonnegative integer f. We show that the
   linear iterative strategy will be resilient to the unreliable links if
   and only if the vertex connectivity is at least 2f + 1. If this
   condition is satisfied, we show that almost any choice of weights in the
   linear combinations will suffice to provide resilience. We Further show
   that each node can identify the exact set of unreliable links that
   directly enter that node, and can communicate this information to the
   other nodes via the linear strategy. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Neuraminidase enzymatic assay is an inexpensive, reliable, and quick
   method of detecting viruses. However, the assay in conventional
   laboratories requires a large amount of samples and reagents and
   multiple steps, which makes the conventional assay labor intensive and
   time consuming. This article reports a novel and simple method for
   conducting the neuraminidase enzymatic assay on a microfluidic chip. By
   using 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D-neuraminic acid as the
   fluorescent substrate and applying an electric field, the newly
   developed assay is simple, fast, and automatic. Fluorescence of the
   enzymatic reaction product was recorded as the assay result, and the
   fluorescence intensity quantitatively indicates the concentration of the
   sample, which proves that the novel assay on a microfluidic chip has a
   potential to be developed into a portable device for on-site detection
   of environmental samples. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow and heat transfer in the entrance region of rectangular
   microchannels of various aspect ratios are numerically investigated in
   the slip-flow regime with particular attention to thermal creep effects.
   Uniform inlet velocity and temperature profiles are prescribed in
   microchannels with constant wall temperature. An adiabatic section is
   also employed at the inlet of the channel in order to prevent
   unrealistically large axial temperature gradients due to the prescribed
   uniform inlet temperature as well as upstream diffusion associated with
   low Reynolds number flows. A control-volume technique is used to solve
   the Navier-Stokes and energy equations which are accompanied with
   appropriate velocity slip and temperature jump boundary conditions at
   the walls. Despite the constant wall temperature, axial and peripheral
   temperature gradients form in the gas layer adjacent to the wall due to
   temperature jump. The simultaneous effects of velocity slip, temperature
   jump and thermal creep on the flow and thermal patterns along with the
   key flow parameters are examined in detail for a wide range of
   cross-sectional aspect ratios, and Knudsen and Reynolds numbers. Present
   results indicate that thermal creep effects influence the flow field and
   the temperature distribution significantly in the early section of the

Abstract = {{Effects of the electrical flame off (EFO) and ultrasound (US) parameters
   on the work hardening behavior of Pd coated Cu (PCC) free air ball (FAR)
   are presented and compared to those of bare Cu reported in the
   literature. The FABs are characterized using an online deformability
   method that measures in situ deformed ball height (H-DEF). The levels of
   EFO current (I-EFO) of 65, 100 and 160 mA with adjusted EFO time
   (t(EFO)) are used to make 40 mu m diameter FABs in two different
   shielding gases, resulting in six experimental conditions. In a first
   experiment, a total of 135 samples are produced for each condition and
   then deformed under a 400 mN deformation force (F-D) without
   superimposing US. PCC FABs produced in nitrogen gas using I-EFO and
   t(EFO) of 160 mA and 0.120 ms, respectively, are more deformable, having
   H-DEF 7.1-9.2\% less compared to those produced with I-EFO = 100 mA and
   t(EFO) = 0.218 ms. However, the FABs produced with the higher current
   vary more than those with lower current, and FABs produced with forming
   gas vary least. H-DEF of PCC FABs made in forming gas is independent of
   I-EFO in the range from 65 to 160 mA. In a second experiment, the same
   conditions are used except for a 20\% US level (equivalent to 29 mW US
   power) superimposed on F-D during the deformation. The values of H-DEF
   with US is 5.7-11.7\% and 6.5-9.0\% smaller than those of without US for
   the I-EFO ranging from 65 to 160 mA in nitrogen and forming gas,
   respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable management of groundwater resources is vital for development
   of areas at risk from water-resource over-exploitation. In northeast
   Thailand, the Phu Thok aquifer is an important water source,
   particularly in the Thaphra area, where increased groundwater
   withdrawals may result in water-level decline and saline-water upconing.
   Three-dimensional finite-difference flow models were developed with
   MODFLOW to predict the impacts of future pumping on hydraulic heads.
   Four scenarios of pumping and recharge were defined to evaluate the
   system response to future usage and climate conditions. Primary model
   simulations show that groundwater heads will continue to decrease by
   4-12 m by the year 2040 at the center of the highly exploited area,
   under conditions of both increasing pumping and drought. To quantify
   predictive uncertainty in these estimates, in addition to the primary
   conceptual model, three alternative conceptual models were used in the
   simulation of sustainable yields. These alternative models show that,
   for this case study, a reasonable degree of uncertainty in
   hydrostratigraphic interpretation is more impactful than uncertainty in
   recharge distribution or boundary conditions. The uncertainty-analysis
   results strongly support addressing conceptual-model uncertainty in the
   practice of groundwater-management modeling. Doing so will better assist
   decision makers in selecting and implementing robust sustainable
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, cognitive routing coupled with spectrum sensing and
   sharing in a multi-channel multi-hop cognitive radio network (CRN) is
   investigated. Recognizing the spectrum dynamics in CRN, we propose an
   opportunistic cognitive routing (OCR) protocol that allows users to
   exploit the geographic location information and discover the local
   spectrum access opportunities to improve the transmission performance
   over each hop. Specifically, based on location information and channel
   usage statistics, a secondary user (SU) distributedly selects the next
   hop relay and adapts its transmission to the dynamic spectrum access
   opportunities in its neighborhood. In addition, we introduce a novel
   metric, namely, cognitive transport throughput (CTT), to capture the
   unique properties of CRN and evaluate the potential relay gain of each
   relay candidate. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to reduce the
   searching complexity of the optimal selection of channel and relay.
   Simulation results are given to demonstrate that our proposed OCR well
   adapts to the spectrum dynamics and outperforms existing routing
   protocols in CRN.}},

Abstract = {{An X-ray photon-quantum-noise-limited voltage-controlled oscillator
   (VCO)-based pixel architecture in amorphous-silicon (a-Si) technology is
   reported for large-area digital medical imaging applications. In this
   research, the X-ray generated input charge on the input capacitor is
   converted into an oscillating frequency signal output at the pixel
   level. The VCO pixel is fabricated in-house using a-Si technology, and
   experimental results are presented. Readout circuitry is proposed which
   can be optimized to reduce the fixed pattern noise and fringing effects
   in an imaging array containing many such VCO pixels. The phase noise and
   stability performance of the single-pixel VCO are measured and analyzed.
   This architecture has the lowest input referred noise among all reported
   a-Si pixel architectures and is the first photon-quantum-noise-limited
   pixel architecture in a-Si technology. The pixel's valid input range is
   measured to be 120 e(-) all the way to 5 x 10(6) e(-). This shows that
   the pixel has a very high dynamic range. The proposed architecture is
   particularly promising for large-area photon-quantum-noise-limited
   digital imaging applications (e.g., protein crystallography) due to its
   small input referred electronic noise, high sensitivity, and ease of
   fabrication in large-area a-Si technology.}},

Abstract = {{An organic liquid polymer based on methyltriethoxysilane has been

   in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film transistor (TFT)
   based large area imaging arrays as an inter-level dielectric between the
   TFT and pixel levels. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
   shows prominent peaks of Si-CH3 stretch and Si-O stretch modes. The
   dielectric constant (k) of the film was found to decrease with
   increasing curing temperature (T-cure). However;k values were < 3 for
   T-cure < 260 degrees C;which is the upper limit for our a-Si:H process.
   Thermogravimetric analysis showed that major weight loss takes place for
   up to 200 degrees C;and the film stabilizes thereafter. The stress in
   the films was found to be compressive;and increased from 50 to 220 MPa
   when T-cure was increased from 250 to 450 degrees C. The low stress for
   low T-cure is a desirable property for film integration. (C) 2012

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology based on theoretical, numerical,
   and experimental studies for condition assessment of wood poles using
   ultrasonic tests. Conventional ultrasonic testing of wood poles is based
   only on wave velocity measurements. Whereas in the new methodology, the
   condition assessment of a wood pole is represented by statistical
   quantities called dissimilarity indices; which are computed from
   ultrasonic measurements. These measurements include compressional wave
   velocities, transmission factors, and elastic moduli in the radial and
   tangential directions. The dissimilarity index is computed by comparing
   the measured parameters in a given pole section with the corresponding
   expected values and standard deviations for a sound pole. Four
   ultrasonic transmitters, with nominal frequency of 50 kHz, are evenly
   spaced around the circumference of the cross-section of the pole. For
   each transmitter location, an array of five receivers at different
   angles from the transmitter is used to measure the response of the wood
   pole to the ultrasonic excitation. Thus, a total of 14 independent
   raypaths across the section are defined for each test. Laboratory
   results show that for an area of decay of 30\% of the cross-section, the
   wave velocity and the transmission factor decrease by 51\% and 96\%,
   respectively. Whereas the average elastic moduli in the radial and
   tangential directions are 80\% and 43\% smaller than the expected values
   for a sound pole. The observed deterioration pattern in a blind test is
   in perfect agreement with the predicted condition using the new
   methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An energy optimization model is presented that includes nuclear energy
   and water management into the oil sands industry. The proposed model
   determines the most suitable configuration of energy commodities and oil

   using data reported in the literature for the future oil sands
   operations in 2030. Likewise, the proposed integrated energy
   optimization model was used to determine the 2030 oil sands operations
   using recent information reported in the literature. The results show
   that the energy model is a practical tool that can be used to evaluate
   future oil production scenarios, identify the key parameters that affect
   the oil sands operations, and can also be used for planning and

Abstract = {{Early-stage embryos must reshape the tissues of which they are made into
   organs and other life-sustaining structures; and if non-mammalian
   embryos fail to complete these tasks before the energy provided by their
   yolk runs out, they die. The aim of this study is to use a cell-level
   computational model to investigate the energetic cost of a variety of
   mechanisms that can drive an in-plane reshaping pattern known as
   convergent extension-a motif in which a tissue narrows in one in-plane
   direction and expands in another. Mechanisms considered include oriented
   lamellipodia, directed mitosis, stress fibers, and anisotropic external
   tension. Both isolated patches of tissue and actively contracting
   tissues that deform adjacent passive areas are considered. The
   cell-level finite element model used here assumes that the cell membrane
   and its associated proteins generate a net tension gamma along each
   cell-cell interface and that the cytoplasm and its embedded networks and
   structures have an effective viscosity mu. Work costs are based
   exclusively on mechanical considerations such as edge lengths and
   tensions, and because a traditional mechanical efficiency cannot be
   calculated, mechanisms are compared on the basis of the work they must
   do to the tissue to cause a specified rate of in-plane reshaping.
   Although the model contains a number of simplifications compared to real
   embryonic tissues, it is able to show that the work requirements for
   tissue reshaping by mitoses and by lamellipodia are of the same order.
   Lamellipodia are energetically most effective when their tensions are
   approximately twice as large as the interfacial tensions in the
   surrounding cells. The model also shows that stress fibers or other
   direct stretch or compression mechanisms are at least five times more
   efficient for tissue reshaping than are mitoses or lamellipodia and that
   the work needed to deform a typical cellular tissue is more than thirty
   times greater than if it did not contain cell boundaries. Collectively,
   these findings indicate that common tissue reshaping mechanisms have
   mechanical efficiencies of less than one percent and that mechanical
   efficiency is not the primary determinant of which mechanism(s) an
   embryo uses to reshape its tissues.}},

   0.8-1.3 GHz band is demonstrated. The sensor is etched in the ground
   plane of a microstrip line to effectively create a stopband filter. The
   frequencies at which minimum transmission and minimum reflection are
   observed depend on the permittivity of the sample under test. The
   minimum transmission frequency shifts from 1.3 to 0.8 GHz as the sample
   permittivity changes from 1 to 10. The structure is fabricated using
   printed circuit board technology. Numerical findings are experimentally

Abstract = {{Pore-forming agents are an effective way to engineer porosity in a
   sintered compact. When adding graphite to tape cast nickel oxide (NiO)
   and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composites, the amount of porosity
   created is similar to the volume of graphite added. The sintering
   characteristics of NiO/YSZ composites with varying graphite loadings are
   similar to the sintering characteristics of the graphite-free
   composites. Below a critical graphite loading of 20 vol\% graphite of
   the pressed green volume, the volumetric sintering shrinkage increases
   slightly with increasing graphite loading because of the higher organic
   material content in the tape. Above a graphite loading of 20 vol\%,
   swelling in the composite thickness is severe thus introducing greater
   linear sintering shrinkage anisotropy. The sintering anisotropy is
   attributed to the delamination of the tape cast layers caused by the
   large volume of exit gases formed during the graphite burnout.}},

Abstract = {{When modeled with ideal joints, many vehicle suspensions contain closed
   kinematic chains, or kinematic loops, and are most conveniently modeled
   using a set of generalized coordinates of cardinality exceeding the
   degrees-of-freedom of the system. Dependent generalized coordinates add
   nonlinear algebraic constraint equations to the ordinary differential
   equations of motion, thereby producing a set of differential-algebraic
   equations that may be difficult to solve in an efficient yet precise
   manner. Several methods have been proposed for simulating such systems
   in real time, including index reduction, model simplification, and
   constraint stabilization techniques. In this work, the equations of
   motion for a double-wishbone suspension are formulated symbolically
   using linear graph theory. The embedding technique is applied to
   eliminate the Lagrange multipliers from the dynamic equations and obtain
   one ordinary differential equation for each independent acceleration.
   Symbolic computation is then used to triangularize a subset of the
   kinematic constraint equations, thereby producing a recursively solvable
   system for calculating a subset of the dependent generalized
   coordinates. Thus, the kinematic equations are reduced to a
   block-triangular form, which results in a more computationally efficient
   solution strategy than that obtained by iterating over the original
   constraint equations. The efficiency of this block-triangular kinematic
   solution is exploited in the real-time simulation of a vehicle with
   double-wishbone suspensions on both axles, which is implemented in a
   hardware- and operator-in-the-loop driving simulator.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The evaluation of the lateral stability of steel frames subject to
   elevated temperatures is different from that at ambient temperature.
   This is because the degradation of the Young's Modulus of steel
   associated with elevated temperature will lead to the loss of column
   lateral stiffness. In this study, the lateral stability of unbraced
   steel frames subjected to elevated temperature is investigated based on
   the concept of storey based buckling. First, to simulate a steel column
   exposed to the elevated temperature, an analytical model was proposed to
   examine the effects of axial loading, elevated temperature, and thermal
   boundary restraints on the lateral stiffness of steel columns in
   unbraced frames. Then, a method of evaluating the stability capacity of
   unbraced steel frames at elevated temperature is proposed. Numerical
   examples are presented to demonstrate the evaluation procedure of the
   proposed method and investigate the frame stability subjected to
   different scenarios of frame members exposed to the elevated
   temperature. The validity of the proposed method is verified by the
   numerical analysis with the use of finite element analysis. Crown

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations with second-moment approximation of
   tight-binding potential were applied to study the sintering dynamics and
   thermal stability for novel configurations of Ag clusters. Simulations
   under elevated temperatures utilizing various configurations indicated
   that sintering processes were strongly affected by temperature and
   initial design configurations. Ag clusters realigned themselves at the
   onset of sintering, forming clear necks of varying stabilities and
   different matter diffusion routes between clusters due to differences in
   initial design configurations. Notably, different Ag cluster design
   configurations displayed variable melting temperatures. The methodical
   simulation of design configurations can elucidate strategies to maintain
   desirable nanocluster structure during sintering processes. (c) 2012

   angle measurement and water sorption uptake, using dense films of
   PVAm-PVA/CNTs, to determine the effects of CNTs on the intermolecular

   degrees of swelling of the PVAm-PVA/CNT membranes. The effects of feed
   water concentration, temperature and CNT content in the membrane on the
   separation performance were investigated. The incorporation of CNTs into
   the membrane was shown to increase the permeation flux and separation
   factor, and the improvement in the separation performance was
   particularly significant at low feed water concentrations. At a feed
   water concentration of 1 wt\%, a permeation flux of 146 g/(m(2) h) and a

Abstract = {{Cold gas dynamic spraying at low pressure (1 MPa gage or 150 psig) was
   used to fabricate Al-Al2O3 metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings onto
   6061 Al alloy. The powder contained Al powder admixed with -10 mu m
   Al2O3 in fractions up to 90 wt.\%. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   Vickers microhardness testing, and image analysis were conducted to
   determine the microstructure, properties, and volume fraction of
   reinforcing particles in the coatings. The coatings were then
   friction-stir processed (FSP) at tool rotation speeds of 894 or 1723 RPM
   using a flat cylindrical tool. The Al2O3 content and hardness of the
   final MMC coatings increased with increasing fractions of Al2O3
   particles in the feedstock powder, resulting in a maximum Al2O3 content
   of 48 wt.\% and a hardness of 85 HV of the as-sprayed coating when 90
   wt.\% Al2O3 was used in the feed powder blend. After FSP, the hardness
   of the MMC increased to a maximum of 137 HV. The as-sprayed coatings
   contained Al2O3 particles that were segregated between the Al particles,
   and FSP was effective in dispersing these Al2O3 particles and decreasing
   their mean free path. It was suggested that this re-distribution and
   Al2O3 particle size refinement during FSP improved the hardness of the
   MMC coatings. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Vertical silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays were fabricated in square

   was achieved for 1.1 mu m long SiNWs with diameter of 115 nm arranged
   400 nm apart. An oscillatory behaviour in the Raman intensity was also
   observed with increasing diameter, which is a result of constructive and
   destructive interferences within the array. A maximum Raman enhancement
   per unit volume (REV) of 838 was achieved for 115 nm diameter SiNWs with
   a length of 1.1 mu m. The experimental REV results were supported and
   modelled quantitatively using finite difference time domain simulations.

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are typically made of an ensemble of electrically small
   resonators such as metallic loops. The fact that such particles resonate
   individually to generate a bulk material behavior having enhanced

   collectors when a resistive load is inserted within the particle's gap.
   A proof of concept is provided using a 5.8 GHz field and a split-ring

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{202}},
Pages = {{58-72}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Accessibility/controllability are very important concepts in the design
   of fuzzy logic control systems (FLCS) from both theoretical and
   practical perspectives. This paper proposes a systematic methodology
   that utilizes differential geometry/Lie Algebra, that has not been
   investigated in the literature, for analyzing the
   accessibility/controllability of TS FLCS. First, we linearize TS FLCS
   and show that this process, although it is straightforward, has
   limitations when analyzing some FLCS structures. Thus, we propose a
   novel algorithm by consolidating the linearization and Lie Algebra
   techniques that provides a systematic approach to assess
   accessibility/controllability. The advantage of the proposed algorithm
   is that in the case of nonaccessibility, those associated trajectories
   are found. The proposed approach is generic and does not require
   assumptions on FLCS's rules or structures as is common with the few
   existing fuzzy systems controllability analysis methods in the
   literature. Moreover, we show that unlike exiting methods, our approach
   is not limited to small rule bases, but is also applicable for systems
   with large number of rules. To validate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method, we present several illustrative benchmark examples that
   will be of practical use to control engineers and can, as well, enable
   wider scale use of FLCS in various engineering applications. (C) 2012

   demonstrate that the growth of subcritical clusters into overcritical

Abstract = {{Vertical silicon nanowire arrays were fabricated leading to an enhanced
   photoluminescence (PL) emission and second-order nonlinear optical
   response. PL from the nanowires was increased by a factor of 50 as

   in second-harmonic generation and rotational anisotropic measurements.
   Enhancement by at least a factor of 80 was achieved as compared to bulk
   silicon for the p-polarized input and s-polarized output. These
   enhancements in the silicon characteristics should enable highly desired
   applications using a silicon platform, such as nonlinear and active

Abstract = {{A new aqueous rechargeable battery combining an intercalation cathode
   with a metal (first order electrode) anode has been developed. The
   concept is demonstrated using LiMn2O4 and zinc metal electrodes in an
   aqueous electrolyte containing two electrochemically active ions (Li+
   and Zn2+). The battery operates at about 2 V and preliminarily tests
   show excellent cycling performance, with about 90\% initial capacity
   retention over 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Use of cation-doped LiMn2O4
   cathode further improves the cyclability of the system, which reaches
   95\% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. The energy density for a
   prototype battery, estimated at 50-80 Wh kg(-1), is comparable or
   superior to commercial 2 V rechargeable batteries. The combined
   performance attributes of this new rechargeable aqueous battery indicate
   that it constitutes a viable alternative to commercial lead-acid system
   and for large scale energy storage application. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   how the mathematical properties of the coefficient matrix are related to
   the information content of the attenuation data, which, in turn, forms a
   basis for a beam-arrangement design algorithm that minimizes the
   reliance on additional assumed information about the concentration

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate a variable-resolution approach to video
   compression based on Conditional Random Field and statistical
   conditional sampling in order to further improve compression rate while
   maintaining high-quality video. In the proposed approach, representative
   key-frames within a video shot are identified and stored at full
   resolution. The remaining frames within the video shot are stored and
   compressed at a reduced resolution. At the decompression stage, a
   region-based dictionary is constructed from the key-frames and used to
   restore the reduced resolution frames to the original resolution via
   statistical conditional sampling. The sampling approach is based on the
   conditional probability of the CRF modeling by use of the constructed
   dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed
   variable-resolution approach via statistical conditional sampling has
   potential for improving compression rates when compared to compressing
   the video at full resolution, while achieving higher video quality when

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to sea ice segmentation in synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) intensity images by combining an edge-preserving
   region (EPR)-based representation with region-level MRF models. To
   construct the EPR-based representation of a SAR image, edge strength is
   measured using instantaneous coefficient of variation (ICOV) upon which
   the watershed algorithm is applied to partition the image into primitive
   regions. In addition, two new metrics for quantitative assessment of
   region characteristics (region accuracy and region redundancy) are
   defined and used for parameter estimation in the ICOV extraction process
   towards desired region characteristics. In combination with a
   region-level MRF, the EPR-based representation facilitates the
   segmentation process by largely reducing the search space of
   optimization process and improving parameter estimation of feature
   model, leading to considerable computational savings and less
   probability of false segmentation. The proposed segmentation method has
   been evaluated using a synthetic sea ice image corrupted with varying
   levels of speckle noise as well as real SAR sea ice images. Relative to
   the existing region-level MRF-based methods, testing results have
   demonstrated that our proposed method substantially improves the
   segmentation accuracy at high speckle noise and achieves on average 29\%
   reduction of computational time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the design of beamforming weights for a multi-antenna
   secondary transmitter in an underlay cognitive setting that
   simultaneously maximizes the secondary received-power while limiting the
   primary interference to some threshold epsilon. With perfect channel
   state information (CSI), a closed-form expression for the maximum
   secondary received-power is found. Under imperfect CSI and when the
   beamforming weights are computed using the channel estimates, the actual
   secondary received-power, G, and the actual primary interference-power,
   I, are derived. We show that the mean E{[}G] has a term that grows
   linearly with the number of secondary antennas, N, and additional terms
   dependent on epsilon. Consequently, we obtain tradeoffs between E{[}G]
   and epsilon. Under perfect CSI, we show that small increases in epsilon
   from zero lead to moderate enhancements in E{[}G] for small N. However,
   increasing N reduces the enhancements. Under imperfect CSI, the gain in
   E{[}G] is less compared to the perfect CSI case. Furthermore, we show
   that the dominant parts of E{[}I] are independent of N. Thus, we
   conclude that there is no significant loss for the secondary to perform
   null-steering beamforming instead. Moreover, it can employ additional
   antennas to improve E{[}G] without generating significant extra
   interference on the primary.}},

Abstract = {{Green energy is emerging as a promising alternative energy source to
   power network devices in next-generation wireless networks.Different
   from traditional energy, green energy is replenished from nature, e.g.,
   solar and wind, and is highly dependent on the capacities and locations
   of the electronic devices.As such, the fundamental design criterion in
   the network deployment and management is shifted from energy efficiency
   to energy sustainability due to the sustainable nature of green
   energy.In this paper, we study the network resource management issues in
   next-generation wireless networks with sustainable energy supply.Our
   objective is to deploy the minimal number of green RNs, i.e., RNs
   powered by green energy, and optimize resource allocation to ensure full
   network connectivity and users' Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
   can be fulfilled with the harvested energy based on the cost
   threshold.To this end, the RN placement and sub-carrier allocation
   (RNP-SA) issues are jointly formulated into a mixed integer non-linear
   programming problem.Two low-complexity heuristic algorithms, namely
   RNP-SA with top-down/ bottom-up algorithms (RNP-SA-t/b), are presented
   to solve the non-linear programming problem in different network
   scenarios.Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms
   provide simple yet efficient solutions and offer important guidelines on
   network deployment and resource management in a green radio network with
   sustainable energy sources.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To demonstrate the ability of high speed, ultrahigh-resolution
   optical coherence tomography (UHR-OCT) to measure and characterize in
   vivo visual stimulus-specific pupil dynamics in birds.
   METHODS. Ten two-week old White Leghorn (Gallus gallus domesticus)
   chickens were imaged in this study. The chickens were dark-adapted for 1
   hour and anesthetized with 2\% isoflurane prior to the imaging
   procedure. Blue, green, and red single flash visual stimuli of 7 ms
   duration were used to evoke pupillary responses. UHR-OCT cross-sectional
   images of the pupil were acquired prior, during, and for several seconds
   after the visual stimuli onset. Images were processed with a novel
   custom automatic algorithm, designed to determine the pupil diameter
   changes over time.
   RESULTS. Results from this study show that the pupillary constriction
   begins with the onset of the visual stimuli; however, maximum pupil
   constriction occurs similar to 150 ms later. No statistically
   significant variation in the timing of the maximum pupillary
   constriction was observed for stimuli of different colors. However,
   significant variation was observed in the maximum pupil constriction
   amplitudes, between red-green and red-blue stimuli, but not between
   blue-green stimuli. Furthermore, the magnitude of the maximum pupil
   constriction decreased monotonically with time under isoflurane
   anesthesia.
   CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrated, for the first time, measurements of
   visually evoked pupillary dynamics in animals using high speed UHR-OCT.
   The results suggest dependence of the pupillary dynamics on the color of
   the visual stimulus, and adverse effects of isoflurane anesthesia on the
   visually evoked pupillary responses in chickens. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis

Abstract = {{Pervious concrete pavement (PCP) is an appropriate means to meet growing
   environmental demands. To apply pervious concrete as a pavement, its
   performance should be studied over its life span. This research aims to
   develop empirical performance models based on a proposed condition index

   condition index has been developed for PCP to date, first, a condition
   index is developed. The condition index is proposed as a combination of
   two indices: a surface distress index and a functional performance
   index. Two sources of data have been collected to develop performance
   models including panel rating and field investigations. Performance
   models are developed in two phases using regression analysis techniques.
   In phase I, performance models are presented as functions of a surface
   distress index and a functional performance index, while in phase II,
   performance models are correlated with pavement age and successfully
   validated.}},

Abstract = {{A simple experiment of transient, one-dimensional diffusion of pure
   butane vapor into bitumen was designed that permitted direct measurement
   of bitumen swelling and butane uptake with time. The experimental
   results showed significant swelling as a result of butane uptake by the
   viscous liquid. A mathematical model that rigorously accounts for the
   dependence of both density and mutual diffusion coefficient on liquid
   composition was developed and used to interpret the experimental data.
   Given the dependence of mixture density on composition, the
   concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient of butane in
   bitumen was determined using least-squares nonlinear regression. It was
   found that the dependence of diffusion coefficient on concentration
   cannot be ascertained from butane uptake or bitumen swelling data alone.
   In isolation, either set of experimental data (bitumen swelling or
   butane uptake) can be fitted equally well with rather different
   functions describing the dependence of diffusion coefficient on
   composition. Validation against experimental data not used to fit model
   parameters, however, suffices for discriminating between candidate
   concentration-dependent diffusivities. These findings improve our
   ability to accurately measure the diffusivity of light n-alkanes in
   bitumen, information that is relevant to the understanding of in situ
   heavy oil recovery using hydrocarbon solvents.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the effect of light exposure on ITO/organic
   interface in organic optoelectronic devices, including organic light
   emitting devices (OLEDs), organic photo-detectors (OPDs) and organic
   solar cells (OSCs). The results show that irradiation by light in the
   visible and UV range leads to a gradual deterioration in charge
   injection and extraction across the interface. A correlation between the
   performance stability of the devices and the photostability of the
   ITO/organic contacts is established. Studies also show that this
   photo-induced degradation can be significantly reduced by means of ITO
   surface treatment or through the insertion of interfacial layers between
   ITO and the organic layers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
   measurements reveal detectable changes in the interface characteristics
   after irradiation, indicating that the photo-degradation of the
   ITO/organic contacts is chemical in nature. Changes in XPS
   characteristics after irradiation suggest a possible reduction in bonds
   between ITO and its adjacent organic layer. The results shed light on a
   new material degradation mechanism that appears to have a wide presence
   in ITO/organic contacts in general, and which may play a key role in
   limiting the stability of various organic optoelectronic devices such as
   OLEDs, OSCs and OPDs. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   broadband impedance matching. A 90-W GaN broadband Doherty amplifier was
   designed and fabricated and achieved an average peak output power of
   49.9 dBm, an average gain of 15.3 dB, and average peak and 6-dB back-off
   efficiencies of 67.3\% and 60.6\%, respectively, from 700 to 1000 MHz
   (35.3\% bandwidth). The amplifier is shown to be highly linearizable
   when driven with 20-MHz WCDMA and long-term evolution signals, achieving
   adjacent channel power ratio of better than -48 dBc after digital
   predistortion.}},

Abstract = {{Aims The effect of amplicon length on the ability of propidium
   monoazide-PCR (PMA-PCR) to reliably quantify viable cells without
   interference from dead cells was tested on heat- and ultraviolet
   (UV)-killed Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni, two important
   enteric pathogens of concern in environmental, food and clinical
   samples. Methods and Results PMA treatment followed by quantitative PCR
   (qPCR) amplification of short DNA fragments (<200 bp) resulted in
   incomplete signal inhibition of heat-treated Salm. enterica (3 log
   reduction) and Camp. jejuni (1 log reduction), whereas PCR amplification
   of a long DNA fragment (1.5 and 1.6 kb) completely suppressed the dead
   cell signal. PMA pretreatment of UV-irradiated cells did not affect PCR
   amplification, but long-amplicon PCR was shown to detect only viable
   cells for these samples, even without the addition of PMA. Conclusions
   The long-amplicon PMA-PCR method was effective in targeting viable cells
   following heat and UV treatment and was applicable to enteric pathogens
   including Salmonella and Campylobacter that are difficult to enumerate
   using culture-based procedures. Significance and Impact of the Study PCR
   amplicon length is important for effective removal of the dead cell

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1468-1476}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a novel method for
   measuring the modulus of contact lenses in their as-received,
   variable-thickness form and to determine whether modulus varies with
   location within commercial lenses and whether it is dependent on lens
   geometry and temperature.
   Methods. The thickness profiles of lenses having powers from -8 diopters
   (D) to +4 D were measured using a Rehder electronic thickness gauge.
   Strip-shaped specimens having a width of 5.5 mm were then cut from the
   lenses. Graphite particles were sprinkled on the specimen surface so
   that its motions could be tracked using digital image-correlation
   techniques. The specimens were mounted in a BioTester test system using
   BioRakes (rather than clamps) and stretched uniaxially until all parts
   of the lens between the attachment points had elongated by at least
   10\%. This procedure allowed local modulus values to be determined at
   110 locations over the surface of each lens and any property variations
   within the lenses to be characterized. Tests were performed at 5, 23,
   and 37 degrees C.
   Results. Material modulus was found to be essentially constant within
   any given lens and was independent of the optical power of the lens.
   Young's Modulus values ranged from 0.3 to 1.9 MPa, depending on the lens
   manufacturer and product, and some lens materials showed a decrease in
   modulus with temperature. For the materials tested, those with lower
   water content had a tendency to exhibit higher moduli.
   Conclusions. Testing of the kind reported here is important for
   assessing the efficacy of current and proposed contact lens materials
   and designs, especially if such designs make use of variable properties
   to enhance function or fit. (Optom Vis Sci 2012; 89:1468-1476)}},

Abstract = {{The presented work pertains to a homogenization-modeling technique
   developed for structures of repeated pattern to predict their dynamic

   equations for the equivalent one-dimensional model are derived. The
   method is applied to a planar truss structure, and the natural-frequency
   results are validated against the experimental values as well as the
   finite element results. The advantage of the present work over the
   previously established homogenization methods that employ the
   energy-equivalence technique is that the effects of strain components
   are included in the kinetic energy of the fundamental elements, which
   results in improved accuracy in the frequency estimations.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture of porous ductile materials subjected to simple shear
   loading is numerically investigated using three-dimensional unit cells
   containing voids of various shapes and lengths of the inter-void
   ligament (void spacing). In shear loading, the porosity reduction is
   minimal while the void rotates and elongates within the shear band. The
   strain at coalescence was revealed to be strongly related to the initial
   void spacing and void shape. It is observed that a transitional spacing
   ratio for shear coalescence exists with coalescence being unlikely at
   spacing ratios lower than 0.35. Initially prolate voids are particularly
   prone to shear coalescence while initially oblate (flat) voids are most
   resistant to shear failure. The cell geometry becomes sensitive to shear
   coalescence for increasing void aspect and spacing ratios. In addition,
   the macroscopic shear stress response becomes independent of the void
   shape at high spacing ratios while showing a weak dependence on the void
   shape when the voids are far apart.}},

Abstract = {{Although ceramic membranes are of increasing interest for drinking water
   treatment, there is little information available regarding their fouling
   behavior in this context. The objective of the current investigation was
   to understand the fouling behavior of ceramic membranes on a fundamental
   level with foulants that have been identified as problematic for
   polymeric membranes in drinking water treatment. All solutions showed
   cake filtration except humic acid and the combination of humic acid and
   bovine serum albumin (BSA), which showed intermediate and complete
   blocking filtration, respectively. Silica played a substantial role in
   increasing rates of flux decline. BSA was the only foulant that
   significantly increased the hydrophobicity of the membrane, suggesting
   that the contact angle of the fouled membrane is not an indication of
   fouling severity or reversibility. Synergistic fouling effects were
   observed when model solutions were combined. These results will be
   helpful for the application of ceramic membranes in drinking water
   treatment.}},

Title = {{Residual Stress Measurements in an Autofrettage Tube Using Hole Drilling

Abstract = {{Relieved strains due to drilling hole in a ring sample cut from an
   autofrettage cylinder are measured. Measured strains are then
   transformed to residual stresses using calibration constants and
   mathematical relations of elasticity based on ASTM standard
   recommendations (American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM E
   837-08, 2008, ``Standard Test Method for Determining Residual Stresses
   by the Hole-Drilling Strain-Gage Method,{''} American Society for
   Testing and Materials). The hydraulic autofrettage is pressurizing a
   closed-end long cylinder beyond its elastic limits and subsequently
   removing the pressure. In contrast to three-dimensional stress state in
   the autofrettage tube, the stress measurement in hole drilling method is
   performed on a traction free surface formed from cutting the ring
   sample. The process of cutting the ring sample from a long autofrettaged
   tube is simulated using finite element method (FEM) and the
   redistribution of the residual stress due to the cut is discussed.
   Hence, transformation of the hole drilling measurements on the ring
   slice to the autofrettage residual stresses is revealed. The residual
   stresses are also predicted by variable material properties (VMP) method
   (Jahed, H., and Dubey, R. N., 1997, ``An Axisymmetric Method of
   Elastic-Plastic Analysis Capable of Predicting Residual Stress
   Field,{''} Trans. ASME J. Pressure Vessel Technol., 119, pp. 264-273)
   using real loading and unloading behavior of the test material.
   Prediction results for residual hoop stress agree very well with the
   measurements. However, radial stress predictions are less than measured
   values particularly in the middle of the ring. To remove the discrepancy
   in radial residual stresses, the measured residual hoop stress that
   shows a self-balanced distribution was taken as the basis for
   calculating residual radial stresses using field equations of
   elasticity. The obtained residual stresses were improved a lot and were
   in good agreement with the VMP solution. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007072]}},

   The improvement in all thermal stability parameters was recorded by

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{227-237}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{While ridges and furrows on the surface of rock glaciers are probably
   the most characteristic morphological features of this expression of
   creeping mountain permafrost, this is the first study that examines the
   utility of texture filters in detecting rock glacier flow structures.
   Texture features were derived from a Gabor filterbank applied to two
   panchromatic IKONOS orthoimages from the Chilean Andes, and terrain
   attributes were obtained in order to narrow down the area of interest
   and as additional predictor variables. Four classification methods of
   different complexity (generalized linear model. GLM; generalized
   additive model. GAM; support vector machine, SVM; Bundling) were applied
   to three sets of predictor variables (texture attributes, terrain
   attributes, and the combination of both), and predictive performances
   were estimated using two spatial cross-validation strategies in terms of
   the median area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve
   (AUROC). Overall, classifiers utilizing texture attributes alone or,
   usually even better, in combination with terrain attributes outperformed
   terrain attributes alone, and Bundling (in most cases followed by SVM)
   showed the overall best performance as a classification method.
   Cross-validated median AUROC values were mostly between 0.70 and 0.80,
   or ``fair,{''} in this focused pilot study, but much better results are
   to be expected at the landscape scale. Permutation-based spatial
   variable importance measures indicate that Gabor features corresponding
   to texture wavelengths between 10 and 30 m are the most important
   predictors, which is consistent with typical ridge spacing on rock
   glaciers. Confounding occurred mostly in areas with linear erosion
   features and ridges or scarps in morainic and thermokarst terrain. We
   suggest that texture filters and the chosen methodological approach are
   relevant not only for rock glacier mapping but also for delineating
   debris-covered glaciers and characterizing glacier surfaces, as well as
   for other geomorphological and cryospheric applications. (c) 2012

   sequential and parallel computation, and their composition. We extend
   ASMs to support the specification of timing requirements, which we call
   timed constructs. We also describe the composition of timed constructs
   with sequential and parallel computation. A key contribution of this
   paper is the extension of the force-directed scheduling algorithm to
   support both parallel and timed constructs. We implement the synthesis
   back-end in synASM that targets FPGAs. Our experiments show improvements

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks, adversaries can make use of the traffic
   information to locate the monitored objects, e. g., to hunt endangered
   animals or kill soldiers. In this paper, we first define a hotspot
   phenomenon that causes an obvious inconsistency in the network traffic
   pattern due to the large volume of packets originating from a small
   area. Second, we develop a realistic adversary model, assuming that the
   adversary can monitor the network traffic in multiple areas, rather than
   the entire network or only one area. Using this model, we introduce a
   novel attack called Hotspot-Locating where the adversary uses traffic
   analysis techniques to locate hotspots. Finally, we propose a
   cloud-based scheme for efficiently protecting source nodes' location
   privacy against Hotspot-Locating attack by creating a cloud with an
   irregular shape of fake traffic, to counteract the inconsistency in the
   traffic pattern and camouflage the source node in the nodes forming the
   cloud. To reduce the energy cost, clouds are active only during data
   transmission and the intersection of clouds creates a larger merged
   cloud, to reduce the number of fake packets and also boost privacy
   preservation. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that our
   scheme can provide stronger privacy protection than routing-based
   schemes and requires much less energy than global-adversary-based
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, distributed data storage has gained increasing popularity for
   reliable access to data through redundancy spread over unreliable nodes
   in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, without any protection to
   guarantee the data integrity and availability, the reliable data storage
   cannot be achieved since sensor nodes are prone to various failures, and
   attackers may compromise sensor nodes to pollute or destroy the stored
   data. Therefore, how to design a robust sensor data storage scheme to
   efficiently guarantee the data integrity and availability becomes a
   critical issue for distributed sensor storage networks. In this paper,
   we propose a distributed fault/intrusion-tolerant data storage scheme
   based on network coding and homomorphic fingerprinting in volatile WSNs
   environments. For high data availability, the proposed scheme uses
   network coding to encode the source data and distribute encoded
   fragments with original data pieces. With secure, compact, and efficient
   homomorphic fingerprinting, our scheme can fast locate incorrect
   fragments and then initialize data maintenance. Extensive theoretical
   analysis and simulative results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency
   of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal modeling of the direct-chill casting process requires accurate
   knowledge of (1) the different boundary conditions in the primary mold
   and secondary direct water-spray cooling regimes and (2) their
   variability with respect to process parameters. In this study, heat
   transfer in the primary cooling zone was investigated by using
   temperature measurements made with subsurface thermocouples in the mold
   as input to an inverse heat conduction algorithm. Laboratory-scale
   experiments were performed to investigate the primary cooling of AA3003
   and AA4045 aluminum alloy ingots cast at speeds ranging between 1.58 and
   2.10 mm/s. The average heat flux values were calculated for the
   steady-state phase of the casting process, and an effective
   heat-transfer coefficient for the global primary cooling process was
   derived that included convection at the mold surfaces and conduction
   through the mold wall. Effective heat-transfer coefficients were
   evaluated at different points along the mold height and compared with
   values from a previously derived computational fluid dynamics model of
   the direct-chill casting process that were based on predictions of the
   air gap thickness between the mold and ingot. The current experimental
   results closely matched the values previously predicted by the air gap
   models. The effective heat-transfer coefficient for primary cooling was
   also found to increase slightly with the casting speed and was higher
   near the mold top (up to 824 W/m(2)center dot K) where the molten
   aluminum first comes in contact with the mold than near the bottom (as
   low as 242 W/m(2)center dot K) where an air gap forms between the ingot
   and mold because of thermal contraction of the ingot. These results are
   consistent with previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the issues of Base stationUser Association and
   Resources Allocation (BUA-RA) in OFDM-TDMA based broadband wireless
   access (BWA) networks under passive optical networks (PON)-WiMAX
   integration. With the powerful coordination capability at the optical
   line terminal (OLT), a key technology of inter-cell cooperative
   transmission (CT) is incorporated in the integrated network
   architecture, which is called cooperative PON-WiMAX network (CPWN). To
   achieve an efficient integration and inter-cell cooperative transmission
   in the CPWNs, the BUA-RA scheme is critical to the Quality of Service
   (QoS) provisioning for each user. In order to minimize the network
   resource usage, we provide three new BUA-RA schemes which first time
   employ the cooperative transmission in a multi-cell BWA network. The
   three schemes are designed for three kinds of subscribers with different
   moving types, and can be adaptively applied based on the network load.
   Simulations are conducted to verify the proposed BUA-RA schemes by
   comparing with those without cooperative transmission technology. Our
   results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schemes, which are
   based on mathematical formulations and linearization. Copyright (c) 2010

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic analysis based on the principle of minimising the Gibbs
   free energy is performed for hydrogen production from glycerol. When the
   operating parameters such as water/glycerol ratio (WGR), oxygen/glycerol
   ratio (OGR) and operating temperature (T) are carefully chosen, the
   energy self-sufficient conditions can be achieved. Two levels of energy
   self-sufficient, (i) within the reformer and (ii) within the overall
   system, are considered. Unlike the consideration in the reformer level
   reported in most works in literature, the consideration in the overall
   system level represents more realistic results based on the fact that
   some energy is required for heating up the feeds to a desired operating
   temperature. The obtained results demonstrate that the maximum hydrogen
   production significantly decreases from 5.65?mol H2/mol glycerol for the
   reformer level to 3.31?mol H2/mol glycerol for the system level,
   emphasising the significant demand of energy for feed preheating. (c)

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for high-flux asymmetric hollow fibre membrane was
   developed considering the effect of permeate pressure build-up inside
   the fibre bore. A new solution technique was developed to solve the
   model equations, which constitute a boundary value problem. The ordinary
   differential equations were solved as an initial value problem in two
   successive steps using the Gear's BDF method. The technique is
   advantageous since it requires minimum computational time and effort
   with improved solution stability, and the computational complexity does
   not multiply as the number of components increases. The model
   predictions and the robustness of the numerical technique were validated
   with experimental data for several membrane systems with different flow
   configurations. The model and the solution technique were applied to
   evaluate the separation characteristics of air using representative
   membranes with different configurations, including single-stage,
   single-stage with permeate recycle, single-stage with retentate recycle,
   air blending, and two stages in series. The study demonstrates that the
   new solution technique can conveniently handle the high-flux hollow
   fibre membrane problems with different module configurations. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{This article describes physical, chemical, and mechanical
   characterizations of porous titanium implants made by an additive
   manufacturing method to gain insight into the correlation of process
   parameters and final physical properties of implants used in
   orthopedics. For the manufacturing chain, the powder metallurgy
   technology was combined with the additive manufacturing to fabricate the
   porous structure from the pure tanium powder. A 3D printing machine was
   employed in this study to produce porous bar samples. A number of
   physical parameters such as titanium powder size, polyvinyl alcohol
   (PVA) amount, sintering temperature and time were investigated to
   control the mechanical properties and porosity of the structures. The
   produced samples were characterized through porosity and shrinkage
   measurements, mechanical compression test and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The results showed a level of porosity in the samples
   in the range of 31-43\%, which is within the range of the porosity of
   the cancelluous bone and approaches the range of the porosity of the
   cortical bone. The results of the mechanical test showed that the
   compressive strength is in the wide range of 56-509 MPa implying the
   effect of the process parameters on the mechanical strengths. This
   technique of manufacturing of Ti porous structures demonstrated a low
   level of shrinkage with the shrinkage percentage ranging from 1.5 to

Abstract = {{The removal of salt from crude oil for oil-field processing has been and
   still is a mandatory requirement. Salt in crude oil is, in most cases,
   found dissolved in the remnant brine within the oil. The chemical
   composition of these salts varies, but the major portion is nearly
   always sodium chloride. This remnant water exists in the crude oil as a
   dispersion of very fine droplets highly emulsified in the bulk of oil.
   In this work, a simple predictive tool for practical correlation for
   salt content in crude oil as a function of brine quantity that remains
   in the oil, its salinity (in vol\% of sodium chloride concentration) and
   temperature using an exponential function has been formulated. The
   proposed method predicts the amount of salt in the crude oil for
   temperatures up to 373 K and sodium chloride concentrations up to
   250,000 ppm (25\% by volume). Estimations from the proposed correlation
   are found to be in excellent agreement with the reported data in the
   literature with average absolute deviation being 0.3\%. The tool
   developed in this study-can be of immense practical value for the
   engineers to have a quick check on the salt content in the crude oil at
   various conditions without opting for any experimental measurements. In
   particular, petroleum and field engineers would find the approach to be
   user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex
   expressions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the variations in the current, drawn off the power grid. By considering
   the process-induced statistical profile of the temperature and, the
   power yield is estimated for a chip. This helps check the robustness of
   the circuits early in the design process. The experimental results on
   the ISCAS89 benchmarks indicate a significant yield loss, if the
   statistical measures of the temperature and voltage drop are ignored.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive and rational approach of
   synthesizing spatially correlated earthquake ground motions. The
   physically compliant seismological spectra, which have been used in
   simulating ground motion at a single location, is extended to synthesize

   then related to Vector-valued Seismic Hazard Deaggregation, based on
   which a simulation framework is proposed to resolve the problem that a
   number of simulations need to be carried out for ground motion
   generation based on uniform hazard spectra. The proposed approach of
   synthesizing SVGMs accounts for local site effect, including
   consideration of random and spatially variable soil profiles, combined
   P-wave, shear horizontal (SH) wave and shear vertical (SV) wave motions
   for simulating tri-directional SVGMs, and the effect of degree of water

Abstract = {{Low temperature interconnection processes for lead-free packaging and
   flexible electronics are currently of great interest. Several studies
   have focused on bonding using silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) or copper
   nanoparticles (Cu NPs). However, pressure assistance is generally
   necessary for bonding with nanomaterial pastes, which limits its
   industrial applications. Here, a unique method for bonding of copper
   wires using Ag NP and nanowire binary pastes is examined, in which
   joining is accomplished from 60 to 200 A degrees C and yet without the
   application of pressure. Bonding is facilitated by solid state sintering
   of Ag nanomaterials and metallic bonding between Cu and Ag interfaces.
   The effects of different additions of Ag nanowires in bonded joints are
   studied, in which addition of 20 vol\% Ag nanowires improves bonding
   strength after low temperature sintering by 50-80 \% compared with Ag
   nanoparticle paste. A mechanical reinforcement effect due to
   introduction of Ag nanowires has been confirmed by observation of the
   fracture path propagation, where necking, breakage and pullout of
   nanowires occur on loading. This low temperature pressureless bonding
   technology has the potential for wide use for interconnection in
   lead-free microcircuits and flexible electronic packaging.}},

Abstract = {{The present study intends to examine various cyclic plasticity models in
   fatigue assessment of 304 and 1045 steels based on the critical
   plane-energy damage approach developed earlier. Cyclic plasticity models
   of linear hardening, nonlinear, multi-surface, and two-surface were
   chosen to study fatigue damage and life of materials under proportional
   and non-proportional loading conditions. The effect of additional
   hardening induced due to non-proportional loading in 1045 steel and
   particularly in 304 steel was further evaluated as different
   constitutive models were employed. In the present study, the plasticity
   models were calibrated by the equivalent cyclic stress-strain curves.
   The merits of the models were then investigated to assess materials
   deformation under proportional and non-proportional loading conditions.
   Under non-proportional loading, the cyclic plasticity models were found
   to be highly dependent upon the employed hardening rule as well as the
   materials properties/coefficients.
   The stress and strain components calculated through constitutive laws
   were then used as input parameters to evaluate fatigue damage and assess
   the fatigue life of materials based on the critical plane-energy
   approach.
   The calculated values of stress components based on constitutive laws
   resulted in a good agreement with those of experimentally obtained under
   various loading paths of proportional and non-proportional conditions in
   1045 steels. In 304 steel, the calculated stress components were however
   found in good agreement when plasticity models were employed for
   proportional loading conditions. Under non-proportional loading, the
   application of the multi-surface plasticity model in conjunction with
   the fatigue damage approach resulted in more reasonable results as
   compared with other plasticity models. This can be attributed to the
   motion of the yield surface in deviatoric stress space in the
   multi-surface model encountering additional hardening effect through
   estimated higher stress values under non-proportional loading
   conditions.
   Predicted fatigue lives based on the critical plane-energy damage
   approach showed such range of agreements as +/- 1.05-+/- 3.0 factors in
   1045 and 304 steels as compared with experimental life data when various
   constitutive plasticity models were employed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes that
   damages the retina and leads to sight loss if treated late. In its
   earliest stage DR can be diagnosed by the presence of a microaneurysm
   (MA). Although some algorithms have been developed thus far, the
   accurate detection of MA in a color retinal image is still a challenging
   problem. By locating a blood vessels' width, color, reflectivity,
   tortuosity, and abnormal branching, one can deduce the existence of DR.
   In this paper we propose new methods to detect MA based on Dictionary
   Learning (DL) with Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC), and extract
   retinal blood vessels using SRC. For MA detection we first locate all
   possible MA candidates with Multi-scale Gaussian Correlation Filtering
   (MSCF), and then classify these candidates with Dictionary Learning (DL)
   via SRC. Particularly, two dictionaries one for the MA and one for the
   non-MA are learned from example MA and non-MA structures, and are used
   in the SRC process. Experimental results on the ROC database show that
   the proposed method can well distinguish MA from non-MA objects. Vessel
   extraction is based on Multi-scale Production of Matched Filter (MPMF)
   and SRC. First, we locate vessel center-line candidates using
   Multi-scale Matched Filtering, scale production, double thresholding and
   center-line detection. Then, the candidates which are center-line pixels
   are classified using SRC. Two dictionary elements of vessel and
   non-vessel are used in the SRC process. Experimental results on two
   public databases show that the proposed method is good at distinguishing
   vessel from non-vessel objects, and is even able to extract the
   center-line of small vessels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   are conducted to evaluate the solution chemistry of the
   Zn(II)-NH4Cl-NH3-H2O system as well as the feasibility of zinc
   electrorecovery at different pH values. Titanium, Glassy Carbon and 316L
   Stainless Steel substrates are used as cathode materials. At any region
   of pH, multiple Zn(II) complexes coexist in solution, but only one
   predominates. While chloro- (ZnCl42-), ternary (ZnNH3Cl3- and
   Zn(NH3)(3)Cl+) and amino-complexes (Zn(NH3)(4)(2+)) dominate the region
   of low, neutral and alkaline pH, respectively, the solubility of the
   system is limited by the formation of two solids. Zn(NH3)(1.6)Cl-0.4(s)
   and ZnO(s) at neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. The
   thermodynamic and electrochemical evaluations reveal that the potential
   required to deposit Zn-(s) becomes more negative as the pH value is
   increased, whereby the reduction of amino-complexes demand a larger
   amount of energy compared to the chloro-complexes. This effect is
   accounted for different ligand substitution mechanisms operating for the
   chloro- and amino-complexes of Zn(II). The onset of the zinc deposition
   relies on the cathode material and is accompanied by the HER regardless
   of the substrate utilized. The surface of Stainless Steel electrode
   exhibits the smallest overpotential, followed by the Glassy Carbon, and
   Ti cathodes where the TiO2(s) (native film) plays a determining role
   during the deposition. Higher current efficiencies are obtained on every
   substrate as the pH value is increased. Experimental conditions around
   neutral pHs (5.5 < pH < 8) are potentially suitable to perform the zinc
   electrodeposition for this system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Although it may seem obvious that mechanical forces are required to
   drive metastatic cell movements, understanding of the mechanical aspects
   of metastasis has lagged far behind genetic and biochemical knowledge.
   The goal of this study is to learn about the mechanics of metastasis
   using a cell-based finite element model that proved useful for advancing
   knowledge about the forces that drive embryonic cell and tissue
   movements. Metastasis, the predominant cause of cancer-related deaths,
   involves a series of mechanical events in which one or more cells
   dissociate from a primary tumour, migrate through normal tissue,
   traverse in and out of a multi-layer circulatory system vessel and
   resettle. The present work focuses on the dissemination steps, from
   dissociation to circulation. The model shows that certain surface
   tension relationships must be satisfied for cancerous cells to
   dissociate from a primary tumour and that these equations are analogous
   to those that govern dissociation of embryonic cells. For a dissociated
   cell to then migrate by invadopodium extension and contraction and
   exhibit the shapes seen in experiments, the invadopodium must generate a
   contraction equal to approximately twice that produced by the
   interfacial tension associated with surrounding cells. Intravasation
   through the wall of a vessel is governed by relationships akin to those
   in the previous two steps, while release from the vessel wall is
   governed by equations that involve surface and interfacial tensions. The
   model raises a number of potential research questions. It also
   identifies how specific mechanical properties and the sub-cellular
   structural components that give rise to them might be changed so as to
   thwart particular metastatic steps and thereby block the spread of
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of the interactions between natural
   colloidal/particulate- and protein-like matter is important for
   understanding their contribution to different physiochemical phenomena
   like membrane fouling, adsorption of bacteria onto surfaces and various
   applications of nanoparticles in nanomedicine and nanotoxicology.
   Precise interpretation of the extent of such interactions is however
   hindered due to the limitations of most characterization methods to
   allow rapid, sensitive and accurate measurements. Here we report on a
   fluorescence-based excitation-emission matrix (EEM) approach in
   combination with principal component analysis (PCA) to extract
   information related to the interaction between natural
   colloidal/particulate- and protein-like matter. Surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) analysis and fiber-optic probe based surface
   fluorescence measurements were used to confirm that the proposed
   approach can be used to characterize colloidal/particulate-protein
   interactions at the physical level. This method has potential to be a
   fundamental measurement of these interactions with the advantage that it
   can be performed rapidly and with high sensitivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{We study the effect of exposure to light on a wide range of
   organic/metal contacts that are commonly used in organic optoelectronic
   devices and found that irradiation by light in the visible and UV range
   results in a gradual deterioration in their electrical properties. This
   photo-induced contact degradation reduces both charge injection (i.e.,
   from the metal to the organic layer) and charge extraction (i.e., from
   the organic layer to the metal). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   measurements reveal detectable changes in the interface characteristics
   after irradiation, indicating that the photo-degradation is chemical in
   nature. Changes in XPS characteristics after irradiation suggests a
   possible reduction in bonds associated with organic-metal complexes.
   Measurements of interfacial adhesion strength using the four-point
   flexure technique reveal a decrease in organic/metal adhesion in
   irradiated samples, consistent with a decrease in metal-organic bond
   density. The results shed the light on a new material degradation
   mechanism that appears to have a wide presence in organic/metal
   interfaces in general, and which likely plays a key role in limiting the
   stability of various organic optoelectronic devices such as organic
   light emitting devices, organic solar cells, and organic
   photo-detectors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In this study, an antibacterial ultrafiltration (UF) membrane was
   developed by depositing polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto a microporous
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane surface via the electrostatic
   self-assembly followed by immobilization of copper (II) ions on the
   membrane surface. The resulting PAN-PEI-Cu membrane showed an improved
   separation performance, copper stability and antibacterial properties.
   The filtration experiments indicated that the resulting membrane
   exhibited a steady-state flux of 63 L/(m(2) h) and a rejection of 91\%
   for a feed containing 5 mg/L humic acid (HA) at 0.16 MPa. In addition,
   an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) was used to monitor the
   release of copper ions from the membrane driven by various chelating
   solutions. It was found that copper on the membrane could still act
   effectively as a biocide for long-tem operation in raw seawater.
   Furthermore, the membrane exhibited an antibacterial efficiency of
   71.5\% against Escherichia coli. This modification technique is simple
   and practical because dilute solutions are used for surface treatment
   and commercial membrane units can be modified in their original modules.
   The membrane is considered to be suitable for such applications as
   ultrafiltration for pretreatment of seawater desalination. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify the effect of fiber laser welding
   (FLW) on the microstructure, hardness, tensile properties and fatigue
   performance of high-strength (UTS >= 980 MPa) DP980 dual-phase steel
   with single linear and multiple linear joint geometry. While FLWed
   joints showed tempered martensite at the outer heat-affected zone (HAZ)
   which caused softening in the welds, a lower extent of martensite
   tempering and higher hardness value were observed in the narrower HAZ of
   the FLWed joint than in the wider HAZ of the diode laser welded (DLWed)
   joint due to a higher power density, faster welding speed, lower heat
   input, and faster cooling rate. A characteristic ``suspension
   bridge{''}-like hardness profile with the fusion zone (FL) hardness as a
   ``pylon{''} appeared in the FLW due to the formation of almost fully
   martensitic structure in the FL. Despite the lower ductility after FLW,
   a joint efficiency of about 96-97\% was achieved with the yield strength
   essentially unchanged. At higher stress amplitudes, fatigue life of the
   FLWed joints was equivalent to that of BM, but at lower stress
   amplitudes no direct improvement in the fatigue resistance was observed
   due to the presence of soft zone and weld concavity. Multiple linear
   welds appeared to increase the probability of premature dynamic fatigue
   failure at lower stress amplitudes as a result of increasing number of
   weld concavities and soft zones. Fatigue crack initiation occurred from
   the specimen surface where the weld concavity met with a soft zone, and
   crack propagation was mainly characterized by the typical fatigue
   striations along with secondary cracks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An integrated bioprocess for effective production and purification of
   penicillin G acylase (PAC) was developed. PAC was overexpressed in a
   genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain, secreted into the
   cultivation medium, harvested, and purified in a single step by
   anion-exchange chromatography. The cultivation medium developed in this
   study had a sufficiently low conductivity to allow direct application of
   the extracellular fraction to the anion-exchange chromatography column
   while providing all of the required nutrients for sustaining cell growth
   and PAC overexpression. It was contrived with the purposes of (i)
   providing sufficient osmolarity and buffering capacity, (ii) minimizing
   ionic species to facilitate the binding of extracellular proteins to
   anion-exchange media, and (iii) enhancing PAC expression level and
   secretion efficiency. Employing this medium recipe the specific PAC
   activity reached a high level at 871 U/g DCW, of which more than 90\%
   was localized in the extracellular medium. In addition, the osmotic
   pressure and induction conditions were found to be critical for optimal
   culture performance. The formation of inclusion bodies associated with
   PAC overexpression tended to arrest cell growth, leading to potential
   cell lysis. Clarified culture medium was applied to a strong
   anion-exchange (Q) column and PAC was purified by non-retentive
   separation, where most contaminant proteins bound to the chromatographic
   media with PAC being collected as the major component in the
   flow-through fraction. After removing the contaminant oligopeptides
   using ultrafiltration, purified PAC with a specific activity of 16.3
   U/mg was obtained and the overall purification factor for this one-step
   downstream purification process was up to 3 fold. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{In this work we have carried out systematic studies to identify the
   critical role of a coenzyme (beta-NADPH) to synthesize silver
   nanoparticle. Interestingly, both roles of reducing and stabilizing
   agents are played by beta-NADPH. Nanoparticles obtained by this route
   exhibit a good crystallinity, a narrow size distribution and excellent
   stability in aqueous solution. The most advantageous points of this
   single-step environmentally friendly approach are that it takes place at
   nearly room temperature (20 degrees C), overcomes many limitations
   encountered in other biological methods (such as the restricted
   concentration of AgNO3, maintenance and manipulation of microorganisms,
   preparing extracts and contamination from residual reactants), bypasses
   the use of surfactants or capping agents and does not necessitate pH
   adjustment. The nano-Ag were characterized using transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), zeta potential, UV-vis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDX). DLS, TEM and XRD measurements showed the formation of nano-Ag
   with an average diameter of 20.77 +/- 0.67 nm. XRD studies confirmed the
   nanocrystalline nature of the silver particles. Zeta potential
   measurements revealed that the particles are surrounded with negatively
   charged groups (-41 +/- 5 mV) making them stable in an aqueous medium.
   The EDX spectrum of the silver nanoparticles confirmed the presence of
   elemental silver signal in high percentage. In addition to the easy and
   ecofriendly method of synthesis, beta-NADPH can be regenerated by
   enzymatic means through glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, potentially
   making the synthesis more cost effective. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

   copolymerizations, 8.08.5 mol \%
   N-tert-butyl-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl) free nitroxide
   relative to BB was added. The S/AN copolymers exhibited narrow,
   monomodal molecular weight distributions (MWDs) with low
   polydispersities {[}weight-average molecular weight (Mw)/number-average
   molecular weight (Mn) = 1.141.26], and the Mn versus monomer conversion
   (X) plots were relatively linear (Mn = 18.1 kg/mol, X approximate to
   0.7); this suggested that pseudo-living behavior was approached. AN
   proved to be an effective controlling comonomer for tBMA because the
   tBMA/AN copolymers exhibited narrow monomodal MWDs with Mw/Mn = 1.171.50
   and relatively linear Mn versus X plots to reasonably high X values (Mn
   = 15.6 kg/mol, X approximate to 0.6). The AN and S monomer reactivity

   rAN = 0.10 +/- 0.01 and rS = 0.28 +/- 0.02 (KelenTudos), respectively;
   these values were in good agreement with conventional free-radical
   polymerization. Error-in-variables model (EVM) analysis indicated that
   the use of cumulative composition S/AN data was more effective than
   typical approaches using low-X data with the MayoLewis model. The AN and
   tBMA reactivity ratios {[}rAN = 0.07 +/- 0.01 and rtBMA = 1.24 +/- 0.20
   (FinemanRoss) and rAN = 0.14 +/- 0.01 and rtBMA = 0.89 +/- 0.19

   methacrylate/AN conventional radical copolymerizations. EVM analysis
   suggested significant experimental error was associated with the tBMA/AN
   system, and this warrants further investigation. (C) 2012 Wiley

   light-weight hybrid light amplification for detection and ranging
   (LADAR) system was developed to enable semi-automatic targeted data

   for parts of the workspace critical for an on-going operation. To
   further improve the precision of separating needed data from background
   and irrelevant data, using this custom-designed system, the
   relationships were investigated among the amplitude of data points, the
   scanning distance, time-of-flight, and the grayscales of objects. Thus,
   positive control of scanning position, orientation, field of view and
   amplitude is enabled. For construction robotics applications in confined
   spaces such as power plants, such positive control is a critical
   capability. The evaluation results indicate the efficiency and

   reducing the scanning time and data size, and the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Calibration is a process of comparing model results with field data and
   making the appropriate adjustments so that both results agree.
   Calibration methods can involve formal optimization methods or manual
   methods in which the modeler informally examines alternative model
   parameters. The development of a calibration framework typically
   involves the following: (1) definition of the model variables,
   coefficients, and equations; (2) selection of an objective function to
   measure the quality of the calibration; (3) selection of the set of data
   to be used for the calibration process; and (4) selection of an
   optimization/manual scheme for altering the coefficient values in the
   direction of reducing the objective function. Hydraulic calibration
   usually involves the modification of system demands, fine-tuning the
   roughness values of pipes, altering pump operation characteristics, and
   adjusting other model attributes that affect simulation results, in
   particular those that have significant uncertainty associated with their
   values. From the previous steps, it is clear that model calibration is
   neither unique nor a straightforward technical task. The success of a
   calibration process depends on the modeler's experience and intuition,
   as well as on the mathematical model and procedures adopted for the
   calibration process. This paper provides a summary of the Battle of the
   Water Calibration Networks (BWCN), the goal of which was to objectively
   compare the solutions of different approaches to the calibration of
   water distribution systems through application to a real water
   distribution system. Fourteen teams from academia, water utilities, and
   private consultants participated. The BWCN outcomes were presented and
   assessed at the 12th Water Distribution Systems Analysis conference in
   Tucson, Arizona, in September 2010. This manuscript summarizes the BWCN
   exercise and suggests future research directions for the calibration of
   water distribution systems. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000191. (C)

Title = {{Distribution of Delay in Signalized Intersections: Day-to-Day
   Variability in Peak-Hour Volumes}},

Abstract = {{The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and other analytical methods provide a
   point estimate of average vehicle delay for a specified lane group over
   a defined time period (e. g., peak hour). The estimated delay is a
   function of a number of factors, including geometrAy, signal timings,
   and approach volumes. Some of these factors, particularly, peak hour
   volume, can be considered to be random variable, and therefore the
   distribution of intersection delay is a function of the distribution of
   these random factors. This paper presents findings of a study that
   addresses the variability in estimated HCM delay as a function of the
   variation of peak hour volumes. For protected movements, the
   distribution of delay is analytically determined as a function of the
   distribution of the peak hour volume and the HCM delay equation
   characteristics. A numerical method is proposed to find the distribution
   of delay for permitted movements for which capacity changes as a result
   of variability in the opposing volume. The proposed methods are
   demonstrated through application to a hypothetical intersection. The
   results indicate that when the degree of saturation for the average peak
   hour volume is not far from 1, the HCM point estimate of average delay
   is not sufficient for evaluating the quality of service or designing the
   intersection signal timing plan. For example, the results from the
   hypothetical intersection examined in this paper suggest that for a
   permitted left turn with an average degree of saturation of 0.77 and an
   average delay of 37.8 s/vehicle (level of service D), there is
   approximately 20\% probability that the lane group operates at a level
   of service of E or worse (i.e., delay > 55 s/vehicle). DOI:

Title = {{Dynamic simulation of MEA absorption process for CO2 capture from power
   plants}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{295-309}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction from combustion fossil fuel
   power plants is a key aspect in the stabilization of global climate
   change. Post-combustion CO2 capture from fossil fuel power plants using
   amine-based solvents, typically monoethanolamine (MEA), is one of the
   most promising technologies for the abatement of CO2 gas. In this work,
   a dynamic MEA absorption process model has been developed to predict the
   dynamic behaviour of the CO2 capture process. The resulting dynamic
   model was used to study the transient response of the MEA absorption
   process to changes in the flue gas flow rate and the reboiler heat duty.
   The changes in flue gas flow rate and reboiler heat duty are key process
   variables that affect the lean loading, liquid to gas ratio and
   percentage of CO2 removal. To represent the actual operation of a power
   plant, the dynamic response of the MEA absorption process to a
   sinusoidal change in the flue gas flow rate was also considered in the
   present analysis. The results show that the changes between the reboiler
   heat duty and CO2 removal follows a ratio of approximately 1:1.4. Also,
   the lean loading stream entering the absorber unit is key to maintain
   the feasible operation of the system. Moreover, the energy performance
   of the process (Joules per mole of CO2 captured) is directly affected by
   the operation of the reboiler. The outcomes from this study provide
   insights regarding the dynamic behaviour of this process and can be used
   as the basis to develop other aspects related to the dynamic operation
   of this plant, e.g., to develop control strategies for this system. (c)

Abstract = {{Rigid fracture fixation plates offer stability to the fractured bone,
   but are known to result in stress shielding of the bone. This stress
   shielding results in bone resorption; which in-turn results in
   re-fracture of the bone after the bone-plate is removed. The aim of this
   research was to design a stiffness graded bone-plate to reduce the
   stress shielding erect. Stiffness grading of bone plate model was
   achieved by tapering the bone-plate along its length. A 3D finite
   element model of human femoral diaphysis and bone-plates with
   traditional design and tapered design were constructed using commercial
   finite element software Abaqus. These models were loaded in combined
   compression and bending, similar to the loads during walking. Stress
   distribution and the location of neutral axis were obtained for (a) Bone
   (b) Bone with traditional bone-plate and (c) Bone with tapered
   bone-plate. Results showed that tapered bone-plate results in
   substantial reduction in stress shielding in bone when compared to
   traditional bone-plate. The taper was optimized for reduction in stress
   shielding and adequate mechanical strength. We recommend tapered
   bone-plate instead of traditional uniform bone-plate for fracture
   fixation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two attribute-oriented authentication and
   transmission schemes for secure and privacy-preserving health
   information sharing in health social networks (HSNs). HSN users are
   tagged with formalized attributes. The attribute-oriented authentication
   scheme enables each HSN user to generate an attribute proof for itself,
   where its sensitive attributes are anonymized. By verifying provided
   attribute proof, other users are able to know what attributes an HSN
   user has. The attribute-oriented transmission scheme enables an HSN user
   to encrypt his/her health information into a ciphertext bonded with a
   customized access policy. The access policy is defined by a target set
   of attributes. Only users who satisfy the access policy are able to
   decrypt the ciphertext. Through security analysis, we show that the
   proposed schemes can effectively resist various attacks including
   forgery attack, attribute-trace attack, eavesdropping attack, and
   collusion attack. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate
   that both schemes can offer satisfactory performance in helping HSN
   users to share health information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The concentrations of several pharmaceuticals and personal care products

   (Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation) model. PPCPs that
   were previously measured in the Grand River watershed were selected as
   the target compounds for this study. The application of the PhATE model
   was adapted to account for Canadian climatic conditions and its seasonal
   variability. In this regard, seasonal hydrological parameters (i.e.,
   stream flow and velocity) were estimated based on historical data.
   Chemical loss parameters, including in-stream decay, human loss, and
   removal efficiency of treatment plants, were initially extracted from
   the literature and then calibrated to the site data. In general, the
   adapted PhATE model reasonably simulated pharmaceuticals with continuous
   use by humans such as ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and
   gemfibrozil. Validation, which was performed only for ibuprofen,
   naproxen, and carbamazepine suggests that the calibrated model is able
   to reliably simulate concentrations. The model is the most accurate in
   validation when simulating carbamazepine which is the most persistent
   substance tested in this study, and as such, variations in its
   concentration primarily follow variation in stream flow.}},

Abstract = {{The research described in this paper examines changes in the hydrologic

   focuses on temperature, precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration and

   the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF)
   reanalysis climate data (ERA-40). Both data sets were used to estimate
   runoff and evapotranspiration. The resulting hydrological variables were
   assessed for trends on a monthly and annual basis using the Mann-Kendall
   non-parametric trend test. The results reveal a general pattern of
   warming temperatures, and increasing precipitation and
   evapotranspiration. However, an overall decrease in runoff and in
   storage were detected for results derived from the Environment Canada
   data set while an overall increase in runoff and in storage were
   detected for results derived from the ECMWF data set. The sensitivity of
   mean annual runoff to changes in climate was also estimated using a
   non-parametric estimator. The results of the analysis can be used to
   better prepare for the potential impacts of climate change on water
   availability and water resource infrastructure in the MRB.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate data dissemination in delay tolerant
   networks (DTNs) via roadside wireless local area networks (RS-WLANs).
   The data dissemination service is destined to a group of nomadic nodes
   roaming in a large network region with a low node density. The local
   nodes within the coverage area of an RS-WLAN can provide packet caching
   and relaying capabilities. We consider a cooperative data dissemination
   approach where information packets are first pre-downloaded to the local
   nodes within the RS-WLAN before the visit of a pedestrian nomadic node,
   and then opportunistically scheduled to transmit to the nomadic node
   upon its arrival. In order to resolve the channel contention among
   multiple direct/relay links and exploit the predictable traffic
   characteristics as a result of packet pre-downloading, a double-loop
   receiver-initiated medium access control (DRMAC) scheme is proposed. The
   MAC scheme can achieve spatial and temporal diversity via the outer-loop
   and inner-loop MAC, respectively. A receiver initiated mechanism is used
   to reduce the signalling overhead, where the ACK message is used as an
   invitation of channel contention. An analytical model is established to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed MAC scheme. Numerical results
   demonstrate that the proposed MAC scheme can significantly improve the
   number of delivered packets from an RS-WLAN to a nomadic node as
   compared with the existing MAC schemes.}},

Title = {{Insertable system for fast turnaround time microwave experiments in a
   dilution refrigerator}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Microwave experiments in dilution refrigerators are a central tool in
   the field of superconducting quantum circuits and other research areas.
   This type of experiments relied so far on attaching a device to the
   mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. The minimum turnaround time
   in this case is a few days as required by cooling down and warming up
   the entire refrigerator. We developed a new approach, in which a
   suitable sample holder is attached to a cold-insertable probe and
   brought in contact with transmission lines permanently mounted inside
   the cryostat. The total turnaround time is 8 h if the target temperature
   is 80 mK. The lowest attainable temperature is 30 mK. Our system can
   accommodate up to six transmission lines, with a measurement bandwidth
   tested from zero frequency to 12 GHz. This bandwidth is limited by
   low-pass components in the setup; we expect the intrinsic bandwidth to

Abstract = {{We use phase-field models to characterize the microstructure present in
   magnesium AZ31 alloy solidified under welding conditions. We focus our
   attention on the study of the conditions under which a
   columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) is observed in resistance spot
   welds. Our simulations show how the size and shape of the columnar and
   equiaxed regions depend on factors such as cooling rate, temperature
   gradient and the nature of inoculant particles. Our results are compared
   with experimental observations. In addition, we contrast our findings
   with predictions from a previously developed steady-state model for the
   CET. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Energy and exergy analyses of a biomass trigeneration system using an

Abstract = {{In this study, energy and exergy analyses of a biomass trigeneration
   system using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) are presented. Four cases
   are considered for analysis: electrical-power, cooling-cogeneration,
   heating-cogeneration and trigeneration cases. The results obtained
   reveal that the best performance of the trigeneration system considered
   can be obtained with the lowest ORC evaporator pinch temperature
   considered, T-pp = 20 K, and the lowest ORC minimum temperature, T-9 =
   345 K. In addition, this study reveals that there is a significant
   improvement when trigeneration is used as compared to only electrical
   power production. This study demonstrates that the fuel utilization
   efficiency increases, average, from 12\% for electrical power to 88\%
   for trigeneration. Moreover, the maximum exergy efficiency of the ORC is
   13\% and, when trigeneration is used, it increases to 28\%. Furthermore,
   this study reveals that the electrical to cooling ratio can be
   controlled through changing the ORC evaporator pinch point temperature
   and/or the pump inlet temperature. In addition, the study reveals that
   the biomass burner and the ORC evaporator are the main two sources of
   exergy destruction. The biomass burner contributes to 55\% of the total
   destructed exergy whereas the ORC evaporator contributes to 38\% of the
   total destructed exergy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
