Abstract = {{In delay and disruption tolerant networks, the contacts among nodes are
   intermittent. Because of the importance of data access, providing
   efficient data access is the ultimate aim of analyzing and exploiting
   disruption tolerant networks. Caching is widely proved to be able to
   improve data access performance. In this paper, we consider caching
   schemes for broadcasting and multicasting to improve the performance of
   data access. First, we propose a caching algorithm for broadcasting,
   which selects the community central nodes as relays from both network
   structure perspective and social network perspective. Then, we
   accommodate the caching algorithm for multicasting by considering the
   data query pattern. Extensive trace-driven simulations are conducted to
   investigate the essential difference between the caching algorithms for
   broadcasting and multicasting and evaluate the performance of these
   algorithms. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-particle model is developed and applied to the data from
   galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments with
   varying pulse currents and relaxation periods on a LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2
   -LiMn2O4 (NMC-LMO) blended lithium-ion electrode. The good agreement
   between the simulated and experimental potential-time curves shows that
   the model is applicable for all GITT conditions considered, but more
   accurate for the case of small current pulse discharges with long
   relaxation times. Analysis of the current contribution and the
   solid-state surface concentration of each active component in the
   blended electrode shows a dynamic lithiation/delithiation interaction
   between the two components and between micron and submicron NMC
   particles during the relaxation periods in the GITT experiments. The
   interaction is attributed to the difference in the equilibrium
   potentials of the two components at any given stoichiometry which
   redistributes the lithium among LMO and NMC particles until a common
   equilibrium potential is reached. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study systematically assessed intracellular electron transfer (IET)
   and extracellular electron transfer (EET) kinetics with respect to anode
   potential (E-anode) in a mixed-culture biofilm anode enriched with
   Geobacter spp. High biofilm conductivity (0.96-1.24 mS cm(-1)) was
   maintained during E-anode changes from -0.2 to +0.2 V versus the
   standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), although the steady-state current
   density significantly decreased from 2.05 to 0.35 Am-2 in a microbial
   electrochemical cell. Substantial increase of the Treponema population
   was observed in the biofilm anode at E-anode = +0.2 V, which reduced
   intracellular electron-transfer kinetics associated with the maximum
   specific substrate-utilization rate by a factor of ten. This result
   suggests that fast EET kinetics can be maintained under dynamic E-anode
   conditions in a highly conductive biofilm anode as a result of shift of
   main EET players in the biofilm anode, although E-anode changes can
   influence IET kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation mechanism is compared in organic light-emitting devices
   (OLEDs) fabricated by solution-coating to that in vacuum-deposited
   OLEDs. Devices comprising various host materials made by
   vacuum-deposition or solution-coating are investigated. Changes in
   devices electroluminescence (EL) spectra during prolonged electrical
   driving are compared and analyzed. Hole-only devices are also utilized,
   and employed to study the effects of charges and excitons, separately
   and combined. The results reveal that the faster degradation of
   solution-processed devices relative to their vacuum-deposited
   counterparts under electrical stress is due to a faster aggregation of
   the host materials. Interactions between excitons and polarons in the
   emitting layers of the devices induce this aggregation phenomenon.
   Although this phenomenon affects both vacuum-deposited and
   solution-coated emitting layers, it is found to occur much faster in the
   later. The findings shed light on the root causes of the limited

Abstract = {{Detector-device-independent quantum key distribution (DDI-QKD) held the
   promise of being robust to detector side channels, a major security
   loophole in quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations. In contrast
   to what has been claimed, however, we demonstrate that the security of
   DDI-QKD is not based on postselected entanglement, and we introduce
   various eavesdropping strategies that show that DDI-QKD is in fact
   insecure against detector side-channel attacks as well as against other
   attacks that exploit devices' imperfections of the receiver. Our attacks
   are valid even when the QKD apparatuses are built by the legitimate
   users of the system themselves, and thus, free of malicious
   modifications, which is a key assumption in DDI-QKD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents several robust model predictive controllers that

   an automotive air-conditioning/refrigeration (A/C-R) system with a

   control-oriented model of the A/C-R system is briefly introduced.
   Accordingly, a discrete Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is designed
   based on the proposed model for an A/C-R system with a three-speed
   compressor. A proper terminal weight is chosen to guarantee its
   robustness under both regular and frost conditions. A case study is
   conducted under various heating load conditions. Two hybrid controllers
   are made, which combine the advantages of both the on/off controller and
   discrete MPC such that they will be more efficient under any ambient
   heating condition. In addition, a continuous MPC is developed for
   systems with continuous variable components. Finally, the experimental
   and simulation results of the new controllers and the conventional
   on/off controller are provided and compared to show that the proposed
   controllers can save up to 23\% more energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The authors developed an efficient flue gas desulfurization (FGD)
   process employing a hydrophobic polypropylene hollow fiber membrane
   contactor (HFMC) using deionized water as scrubbing liquid. A novel
   mathematical reactor model for gas absorption accompanied by a
   reversible reaction in an HFMC was developed for the first time. This
   new model employed the resistance-in-series theory, along with partial
   pore wetting, and a chemical enhancement factor for an instantaneous
   reversible reaction. This model was validated agreeably with
   experimental data. The validated reactor model was then employed to
   investigate the resistance distribution along the main axis and the
   effects of temperature on SO2 removal efficiency. It was shown that the
   reactor model with the assumption of non-wetted pores overestimated the
   absorption efficiency, and a wetted pore length between 6.25-9.75\%
   would yield a very good agreement with the experimental data. The
   deviations between the predicted and experimental values were less than
   +/- 3.0\% with an exception of 3.4\% at the highest gas rate for gas
   flow rates ranging from 1.38x10(-4) to 3.01x10(-4) m(3) s(-1), liquid
   flow rates between 3.00x10(-6)-8.00x10(-6) m(3) s(-1), and the inlet SO2
   concentration of 2000 ppmv. Furthermore, the reactor model described the
   impact of inlet SO2 concentration on the SO2 removal efficiency within
   +/- 0.5\% of measured values for liquid rates between 4.35x10(-6) and
   5.50x10(-6) m(3) s(-1) under a gas flow rate of 1.90x10(-4) m(3) s(-1).
   The resistances of shell side, fiber side and membrane are all important
   due to high solubility of SO2 and partial pore wetting. The SO2 removal
   efficiency decreased gradually as the temperature increased from 283 to
   333 K based on model predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The economic assessment of expected air pollution levels and its
   associated health impact requires different investigational stages,
   including an analysis of specific air pollutants and their emission
   rates, calculations of air shed concentrations, measurements of
   exposure, correlations with human health risk responses to air
   pollutants' exposure changes, and a monetization of human health risks.
   The study aims to assess the monetary value of pollutant concentrations
   and the expected risks of those pollutants on human mortality and
   morbidity as path of a cost analysis. The pollutants carbon monoxide
   (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particles (PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide
   (SO2) from a sample natural gas fueled combined cycle power plant were
   chosen based on their emission rates and their severity on the health
   impacts with which they are associated. The SCREEN3 dispersion model was
   used to obtain pollutant concentration estimates, and an air pollutant
   health impact matrix was established based on health data pooled
   throughout the study period. To lessen the health impact from natural
   gas fuel, hydrogen-enriched natural gas (HENG) was used to fuel the
   combined cycle power plant. The desired hydrogen was collected from
   renewable energy sources through the electrolysis process in an energy
   hub system. The Health Canada's Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool was
   used for monetizing the impacts of pollutants on health by taking into
   account a range of morbidity and mortality outcomes as well as their
   dollar value, when the natural gas and the hydrogen enriched natural gas
   fuels were used. The total hidden costs of health impacts associated
   with producing electricity averaged CAD\$33.50 per megawatt hour based
   on the selected area and year in which the scenario was run. It was
   found that fuelling combined cycle power plant with hydrogen-enriched
   natural gas up to 5\% hydrogen concentrations could save CAD\$1.15 per
   megawatt hour in terms of health impact costs. The health impact cost of
   PM2.5 had the highest value followed by NO2, SO2, and CO. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{High efficient fabrication of nanoscale surface structure has been
   achieved by line focusing a low repetition (1 kHz) femtosecond laser
   using a cylindrical lens. The results showed that this cylindrical lens
   increased fabrication rate by 10 times compared with a spherical lens.
   Both periodic ripple and random nanoparticle covered surface structures
   were obtained by optimizing the defocus distance and scanning speed.
   Strong time-dependent water contact angle (CA) was found in both laser
   patterned Cu and Ni surfaces. The random nanoparticle covered surface
   was superhydrophilic (around 1 degrees) immediately after laser
   processing, but increased to similar to 25 in the first day after
   exposed in air. The CA of periodic ripple surface showed a more obvious
   time dependency, in which a significant CA increasing (50 degrees for Cu
   and 100 degrees for Ni) was observed. The surface chemical analysis
   showed that absorption of hydrophobic functional groups changed the
   surface from the Wenzel state wetting to the Cassie state wetting, which
   was responsiblefor the hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition. (C) 2016

Title = {{Development of electrically conductive-superoleophobic micropillars for
   reducing surface adhesion of oil at low temperatures}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{389}},
Pages = {{623-631}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Electrically conductive and superoleophobic micropillars have been
   developed through the construction of biomimetic micropillars using
   Ag-filled epoxy composites and the incorporation of FDTS on the
   micropillar surface. These micropillars are found to be superoleophobic
   with an oil contact angle of 140 degrees, demonstrating excellent
   self-cleaning properties. The conductivity of micropillars allows for
   the Joule-heating effect to actively reduce the adhesion and even
   unfreeze the frozen oil droplets by passing electrical current.
   Electrical resistance of the composite micropillars was modulated by two
   orders of magnitudes by varying the contents of Ag flakes from 45 wt\%
   to 65 wt\%. The effectiveness of conductive micropillars for surface
   un-freezing was investigated by applying DC current to decrease the
   adhesion strength of frozen oil droplets on surfaces. The results showed
   a pronounced reduction of frozen oil adhesion force by 60\% when the
   resistance increased from 7.5 Omega to 877 Omega after applying DC
   current for 2 min. By continuously applying DC current for 3 min, the
   frozen oil adhesion decreased to 0.05 N, reaching zero when the surface
   was heated up to -10 degrees C after applying DC current for 5 min. In
   contrast, when the droplet was heated up to -5 degrees C by hot air,
   there is still a substantial force of adhesion. The research findings
   demonstrate the use of constructing conductive-superoleophobic composite
   micropillars at surface for eliminating the frozen oil from surfaces at
   low temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A CO2 in water nanoparticle stabilized Pickering emulsion is used to
   template micrometer sized hollow porous nitrogen doped carbon particles
   for high rate performance lithium sulfur battery. For the first time,
   nanoparticles serve the dual role of an emulsion stabilizer and a pore
   template for the shell, directly utilizing in situ generated CO2 bubbles
   as template for the core. The minimalistic nature of this method does
   not require expensive surfactants or additional core templates. Upon
   polymerization of melamine formaldehyde onto CO2, a robust
   polymer/silica composite shell is formed and transformed into a porous
   shell upon washing. The micrometer-sized hollow morphology in
   combination with its nitrogen rich porous shell demonstrates impressive
   rate capabilities of 670 and 500 mAh g(-1) even at a high rate of 7C and
   9C, respectively. This material also possesses excellent cycle
   durability, exhibiting a low capacity decay of 0.088\%/ cycle over 300
   cycles. Measurement of the shuttle current and impedance provides
   interesting insight into the polysulfide mass transfer mechanism of
   hollow structured sulfur hosts.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for materials and devices with dimensions on the nanometer
   scale continues to increase. To meet this demand, high-throughput,
   cost-effective methods for depositing nanoscale thin films are needed.
   In the past few years, atmospheric pressure spatial atomic layer
   deposition (AP-SALD) has emerged as a potential nanomanufacturing method
   that is scalable, open air, and operates at modest temperatures that are
   compatible with flexible substrates. In this Perspective, we compare
   AP-SALD to other high-throughput techniques for depositing
   nanometer-scale thin films, including gravure printing, screen printing,
   knife-over-edge coating, slot-die coating, inkjet printing, spray
   deposition, as well as high throughput sputtering and evaporation.
   Although AP-SALD does not provide the same patterning capabilities as
   some of these printing techniques, it offers multiple advantages: it
   produces continuous, conformal coatings with few defects; it requires
   minimal thermal treatment of the deposited materials; it provides atomic
   scale thickness control; it facilitates tuning of material properties;
   and no vacuum chamber is required, which simplifies maintenance
   requirements and minimizes the operating cost. Areas for further
   development are identified, which will allow these advantages to be
   leveraged: new precursors need to be developed to enable deposition of a
   wider variety of materials, precursor recycling should be examined, and
   AP-SAID systems that are high-throughput (roll-to-roll coating speeds of
   tens or hundreds of meters per minute) and low-maintenance need to be
   further developed and tested.}},

Abstract = {{Wide-field lensfree on-chip microscopy, which leverages holography
   principles to capture interferometric light-field encodings without

Abstract = {{Ranging has been regarded as one of the fundamental enabling
   technologies for a multitude of applications that require high accurate
   position information, such as automated navigation, vehicle platooning,
   asset management, etc. Among various ranging techniques, impulse-radio
   ultra-wideband is one of the most competitive technologies for
   high-precision ranging, because of its capability of achieving
   centimeter-level ranging accuracy, even for dense urban, indoor or cave
   like environments. However, two main challenges arise when fully
   exploiting the ranging capability of impulse-radio ultrawide-band: (i)
   the extremely high sampling rate to acquire the received multipath
   signal, and (ii) the optimal thresholding strategy to differentiate the
   first path. To efficiently tackle those challenges, in this work, we
   propose a ranging approach under the compressed sensing framework.
   Specifically, the received ranging signal is acquired by low-rate
   compressed sampling through parallel random projections. Then, an
   algorithm named matching-pursuit search-back is proposed to detect the
   first arrival path, which integrates a backward iterative search and
   thresholding process starting from the peak path. The detection
   threshold is dynamically adjusted in each iteration to asymptotically
   minimize the averaged detection errors over false alarm and missed
   detection. Extensive simulations and experiments with field data are
   provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve
   high-precision ranging with far fewer samples compared with the
   traditional Nyquist-sampling based ones. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Increasing use of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) necessitates a
   novel method for hazard risk assessment. In this work, we investigated
   the interaction of several types of commercial SWCNTs with
   single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA oligonucleotides
   (20-mer and 20 bp). Based on the results achieved, we proposed a novel
   assay that employed the DNA interaction potency to assess the hazard
   risk of SWCNTs. It was found that SWCNTs in different sizes or different
   batches of the same product number of SWCNTs showed dramatically
   different potency of interaction with DNAs. In addition, the same SWCNTs
   also exerted strikingly different interaction potency with ss-versus
   ds-DNAs. The interaction rates of SWCNTs with DNAs were investigated,
   which could be utilized as the indicator of potential hazard for acute
   exposure. Compared to solid SWCNTs, the SWCNTs dispersed in liquid
   medium (2\% sodium cholate solution) exhibited dramatically different
   interaction potency with DNAs. This indicates that the exposure medium
   may greatly influence the subsequent toxicity and hazard risk produced
   by SWCNTs. Based on the findings of dose-dependences and
   time-dependences from the interactions between SWCNTs and DNAs, a new
   chemistry based assay for hazard risk assessment of nanomaterials
   including SWCNTs has been presented.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate submicron thick platform integrating amorphous silicon
   nanowires and thin-films achieving vivid colors in transmission and
   reflection. The platform nearly doubles the absorption efficiency
   compared to the starting thin-film without much compromising with color
   diverseness. The structural colors can be changed over a wide range by
   changing the diameters of the nanowires while still keeping the
   absorption efficiency higher than starting thin-film. The optical
   response of the platform is conceptually understood for different
   diameters combined with different thin-film thicknesses indicating the
   presence of leaky waveguide modes and coupled cavity modes. Our proposed
   platform can enable architectural low price colorful solar cells on
   transparent substrates.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally assessed the kinetics and thermodynamics of electron
   transfer (ET) from the donor substrate (acetate) to the anode for a
   mixed-culture biofilm anode. We interpreted the results with a modified
   biofilm-conduction model consisting of three ET steps in series: (1)
   intracellular ET, (2) non-Ohmic extracellular ET (EET) from an outer
   membrane protein to an extracellular cofactor (EC), and (3) ET from the
   EC to the anode by Ohmic-conduction in the biofilm matrix. The
   steady-state current density was 0.82 +/- 0.03 A/m(2) in a miniature
   microbial electrochemical cell operated at fixed anode potential of
   -0.15 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode. Illumina 16S-rDNA
   and-rRNA sequences showed that the Geobacter genus was less than 30\% of
   the community of the biofilm anode. Biofilm conductivity was high at
   2.44 +/- 0.42 mS/cm, indicating that the maximum current density could
   be as high as 270 A/m(2) if only Ohmic-conduction EET was limiting. Due
   to the high biofilm conductivity, the maximum energy loss for
   Ohmic-conduction EET was negligible, 0.085 mV. The energy loss in the
   second ET step also was small, only 20 mV, and the potential for the EC
   involved in the second ET was -0.15 V, a value documenting that >99\% of
   the EC was in the oxidized state. Monod kinetics for utilization of
   acetate were relatively slow, and at least 87\% of the energy loss was
   in the intracellular step. Thus, intracellular ET was the main kinetic
   and thermodynamic bottleneck to ET from donor substrate to the anode for
   a highly conductive biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{Membranes are vital and touch every aspect of our daily lives. For
   instance, they ensure that clean or pure drinking water can be produced,
   or they can purify our air. However, there is no one-membrane material
   that can perform all these objectives, and they must be catered for each
   specific application. As more traditional membrane materials are either
   polymer based or inorganic/ceramic based, each application will require
   a different material that can use one or both of these components.
   Currently, much research is dedicated to combining both polymer and
   inorganic based materials to form hybrid membranes that could ``have the
   best of both worlds{''}. The most common form of hybrid membranes are
   mixed matrix membranes, or MMM. However, their synthesis normally
   involves the direct addition of inorganic particles into an existing
   polymeric solution, leading to composite materials without strong
   interaction between organic and inorganic moieties. In this work, we
   explore the reversal of this process; that is, the formation of the
   polymeric component directly from the surface of these particles using
   surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization, or si-ATRP. Such
   a method intends to provide a high intimacy between polymers and
   ceramics, and strong interconnection via covalent bonds. Using a latex
   based solution of these functionalized titania particles, we present two
   pathways, known as ``Coating Onto{''} and ``Grafting From{''} pathways,
   in which these latexes can be applied to larger, tubular membrane
   coatings. These latexes were first analyzed by TGA to determine their
   functionalization densities and degree of polymerization. SEM was then
   employed to visually assess the membrane surfaces to determine the final
   optimal conditions used for preliminary gas separation tests. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This work proposes an EMPC (Economic Model Predictive Control) algorithm
   that integrates RTO (Real Time Optimization) and EMPC objectives within
   a single optimization calculation. Robust stability conditions are
   enforced on line through a set of constraints within the optimization
   problem.
   A particular feature of this algorithm is that it constantly calculates
   a set point with respect to which stability is ensured by the
   aforementioned constraints while searching for economic optimality over
   the horizon. In contrast to other algorithms reported in the literature,
   the proposed algorithm does not require terminal constraints or penalty
   terms on deviations from fixed set points that may lead to conservatism.
   Changes in model parameters over time are also compensated for through
   parameter updating. The latter is accomplished by including the
   parameters' values as additional decision variables within the
   optimization problem.
   Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the algorithm's
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on the effect of
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapping on the fatigue performance and
   bond strength of reinforced concrete beams containing a lap splice at a
   constant moment region under cyclic loading. In addition, the study
   presents the slip response of the steel bars. Fifteen beams were
   investigated that were divided into three groups, namely: unwrapped,
   glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) wrapped, and carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) wrapped. The test variables were the
   presence or absence of FRP wrapping, the type of the FRP wrapping (GFRP
   or CFRP), the type of loading (monotonic or fatigue loading), and the
   fatigue load range. The results of the tests under monotonic load showed
   a significant increase in load and deflection for the FRP-wrapped beams
   compared to the unwrapped beams. The increase in the unwrapped beams
   load deflection results for the CFRP-wrapped beams was greater than that
   for the GFRP-wrapped beams. Also, the FRP-wrapped beams had higher
   fatigue strengths than the unwrapped beams. The bond stress slip
   response under monotonic and fatigue loading is compared. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper explores a cyber-physical system (CPS) that enables a
   billboard viewer to instantaneously obtain the snapshot of the displayed
   media content upon a smartphone gesture. We first define an add-on
   device mounted to each billboard/signage, called media processing and
   content access box (MP-CAB), which collaborates with the content
   management server and the viewers' smartphones for achieving the desired
   applications. The detailed design of the MP-CAB will be presented,
   followed by introducing a simple yet efficient multicast scheduling
   approach in presence of lossy WiFi link and multiple viewers of
   heterogeneous receiving modes. We model the response delay of the
   proposed CPS which jointly considers a set of key parameters, such as
   file size, percentage of receiver modes, and length of snapshot cycles.
   Extensive case studies are conducted to provide in-depth analysis and
   gain insights into the proposed CPS and employed scheduling approach
   regarding the relationship among several operation parameters.
   Specifically, we look into the network operation and multicast
   scheduling settings for achieving minimal expected response delay and
   maximal image size, aiming to gain sufficient understanding of the

   2:1, the difference of adsorption capacity of MC/CABs between 20 and 60
   degrees C reached 20.48 mg g(-1). The effects of temperature, time and
   initial MB concentration on adsorption performance were investigated in
   detail. The MB adsorption on MC/CABs followed the pseudo-second-order
   kinetic model. The equilibrium data was fitted well with Langmuir
   isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity of 336.70 mg g(-1) exhibited
   MC/CABs had a good adsorption capability. Thermodynamic analyses showed
   high temperature was not favorable to MB adsorption, and MC/CABs had a

Abstract = {{Offloading cellular mobile users' (MUs') data traffic to small-cell
   networks is a cost-effective approach to relieve congestion in macrocell
   cellular networks. However, as many small-cell networks operate in the
   unlicensed bands, the data offloading might suffer from a security
   issue, i.e., some eavesdropper could overhear the offloaded data over
   unlicensed spectrums. This motivates us to investigate a secrecy-based
   energy-efficient uplink data offloading scheme. Specifically, we
   consider the recent paradigm of traffic offloading via dual
   connectivity, which enables an MU to simultaneously deliver traffic to a
   macro base station (mBS) over the licensed channel and a small-cell
   access point (sAP) over the unlicensed channel. We formulate an MU's
   joint optimization of traffic scheduling and power allocation problem,
   with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption while
   meeting both the MU's traffic demand and secrecy requirement. Despite
   the non-convex nature of the joint optimization problem, we propose an
   efficient algorithm to compute the optimal offloading solution. By
   evaluating the impact of the MU's secrecy requirement and the
   eavesdropper's channel condition, we quantify the conditions under which
   the optimal offloading solution corresponds to the full-offloading and
   zero-offloading, respectively. Numerical results validate the optimal
   performance of our proposed algorithm, and show that the optimal
   offloading can significantly reduce the total power consumption compared
   with some fixed offloading schemes. Based on the optimal offloading
   solution for each MU, we further analyze the scenario of multiple MUs
   and sAPs, and investigate how to optimally exploit the sAPs' total
   offloading capacity to serve the MUs while accounting for the MUs'
   corresponding power consumptions for offloading data. To this end, we
   formulate a total network-benefit maximization problem that accounts for
   the reward for serving the MUs successfully, the mBS's bandwidth usage,
   and the MUs' power consumptions. Numerical results show that the optimal
   solution can improve the total network benefit compared with some
   heuristic sAP-selection scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study resource management and allocation for energy
   harvesting cognitive radio sensor networks (EHCRSNs). In these networks,
   energy harvesting supplies the network with a continual source of energy
   to facilitate the self-sustainability of the power-limited sensors.
   Furthermore, cognitive radio enables access to the underutilized
   licensed spectrum to mitigate the spectrum-scarcity problem in the
   unlicensed band. We develop an aggregate network utility optimization
   framework for the design of an online energy management, spectrum
   management, and resource allocation algorithm based on Lyapunov
   optimization. The framework captures three stochastic processes: energy
   harvesting dynamics, inaccuracy of channel occupancy information, and
   channel fading. However, a priori knowledge of any of these processes
   statistics is not required. Based on the framework, we propose an online
   algorithm to achieve two major goals: first, balancing sensors' energy
   consumption and energy harvesting while stabilizing their data and
   energy queues; second, optimizing the utilization of the licensed
   spectrum while maintaining a tolerable collision rate between the
   licensed subscriber and unlicensed sensors. The performance analysis
   shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal aggregate
   network utility while guaranteeing bounded data and energy queue
   occupancy. The extensive simulations are conducted to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the impact of various
   network parameters on its performance.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limited battery power of sensor nodes and harsh deployment
   environment, it is of fundamental importance and a great challenge to
   achieve high energy efficiency and strong robustness in large-scale
   wireless sensor networks (LS-WSNs). To this end, we propose two
   self-organizing schemes for LS-WSNs. The first scheme is the
   energy-aware common neighbor scheme, which considers the neighborhood
   overlap in link establishment. The second scheme is energy-aware low
   potential-degree common neighbor (ELDCN) scheme, which considers both
   neighborhood overlap in topology formation and the potential degrees of
   common neighbors. Both schemes generate clustering-based and
   scale-free-inspired LS-WSNs, which are energy-efficient and robust.
   However, the ELDCN scheme shows higher energy efficiency and stronger
   robustness to node failures, because it avoids establishing links to
   hub-nodes with high potential connectivity. Analytical and simulation
   results demonstrate that our proposed schemes outperform the existing
   scale-free evolution models in terms of energy efficiency and
   robustness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) models with
   switching parameters and pulse control. The classical virus dynamics
   model is first modified by incorporating switching parameters which are
   assumed to be time-varying. Some threshold conditions are derived to
   guarantee the virus elimination by utilizing a Razumikhin-type approach.
   The results show that the proper switching conditions chosen can
   increase the counts of CD4(+) T-cells while reducing viral load. Pulse
   control strategies are then applied to the above model. More precisely,
   the treatment strategy and the vaccination strategy are applied to
   infected cells and uninfected cells, respectively. Each control strategy
   is analyzed to gauge its success in achieving viral suppression.
   Numerical simulations are performed to complement the analytical results
   and motivate future directions.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) is a powerful tool
   in imaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal
   coils are commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) of the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity
   inhomogeneities (bias field) that worsens as we move away from the
   endorectal coil. The presence of bias field can have a significant
   negative impact on the accuracy of different image analysis tasks, as
   well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to increased inter-and
   intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction approaches are
   introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared to the
   prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and
   anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed
   retrospective bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise
   amplification that can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image.
   Here, we propose a unified data reconstruction approach that enables
   joint compensation of bias field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging.
   The proposed noise-compensated, bias-corrected (NCBC) data
   reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel stochastically fully
   connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model to mitigate
   the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR data.
   The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR
   data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using
   endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis
   illustrated that the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image
   quality when compared to other tested bias correction methods. As such,
   the proposed NCBC method may have potential as a useful retrospective
   approach for improving the consistency of image interpretations.}},

Abstract = {{In transportation safety studies, it is often necessary to account for
   unobserved heterogeneity and multimodality in data. The commonly used
   standard or over-dispersed generalized linear models (e.g., negative
   binomial models) do not fully address unobserved heterogeneity, assuming
   that crash frequencies follow unimodal exponential families of
   distributions. This paper employs Bayesian nonparametric Dirichlet
   process mixture models demonstrating some of their major advantages in
   transportation safety studies. We examine the performance of the
   proposed approach using both simulated and real data. We compare the
   proposed model with other models commonly used in road safety literature
   including the Poisson-Gamma, random effects, and conventional latent
   class models. We use pseudo Bayes factors as the goodness-of-fit
   measure, and also examine the performance of the proposed model in terms
   of replicating datasets with high proportions of zero crashes. In a
   multivariate setting, we extend the standard multivariate
   Poisson-lognormal model to a more flexible Dirichlet process mixture
   multivariate model. We allow for interdependence between outcomes
   through a nonparametric random effects density. Finally, we demonstrate
   how the robustness to parametric distributional assumptions (usually the
   multivariate normal density) can be examined using a mixture of points
   model when different (multivariate) outcomes are modeled jointly.}},

Abstract = {{Photoplethysmographic imaging is an optical solution for non-contact
   cardiovascular monitoring from a distance. This camera-based technology
   enables physiological monitoring in situations where contact-based
   devices may be problematic or infeasible, such as ambulatory, sleep, and
   multi-individual monitoring. However, automatically extracting the blood
   pulse waveform signal is challenging due to the unknown mixture of
   relevant (pulsatile) and irrelevant pixels in the scene. Here, we
   propose a signal fusion framework, FusionPPG, for extracting a blood
   pulse waveform signal with strong temporal fidelity from a scene without
   requiring anatomical priors. The extraction problem is posed as a
   Bayesian least squares fusion problem, and solved using a novel
   probabilistic pulsatility model that incorporates both physiologically
   derived spectral and spatial waveform priors to identify pulsatility
   characteristics in the scene. Evaluation was performed on a
   24-participant sample with various ages (9-60 years) and body
   compositions (fat\% 30.0 +/- 7.9, muscle\% 40.4 +/- 5.3, BMI 25.5 +/-
   5.2 kg.m(-2)). Experimental results show stronger matching to the
   ground-truth blood pulse waveform signal compared to the FaceMeanPPG (p
   < 0.001) and DistancePPG (p < 0.001) methods. Heart rates predicted
   using FusionPPG correlated strongly with ground truth measurements (r(2)
   = 0.9952). A cardiac arrhythmia was visually identified in FusionPPG's
   waveform via temporal analysis. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel and unified synthesis approach and design
   procedure for microwave filters with extracted pole and nonresonating
   node (NRN) technique. By introducing a general circuit topology, the
   traditional extracted pole and NRN filters can be unified to a general

   between the electromagnetic (EM) model of the pole producing element and
   the circuit model can be achieved. All the physical dimensions of the
   filter structure can be obtained by a fully analytical approach. No full
   EM optimization or adjustment is needed in the filter design. A three
   pole TE101 mode waveguide filter with one finite transmission zero is
   designed to illustrate the new procedure. In addition, a seven-pole
   TE011 mode filter with four finite transmission zeros covering all three
   possible types of arrangements is designed and fabricated to demonstrate
   the versatility of the proposed method. The simulated and measured

Abstract = {{A novel approach to frequency-dependent power limiters (FDPLs) is
   proposed. RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches are
   integrated with bandpass filters to form a power limiter, where the
   output RF power is limited to specific levels, based on the frequency
   bands. Both the nonplanar and planar versions of FDPLs are presented
   using circulators and hybrids, and RF MEMS-based power limiters are
   analyzed theoretically and experimentally for one frequency band. The
   limiter attenuates the high-power signal only within the bandwidth of
   the integrated filter. The design of the proposed power limiter is
   expanded to achieve power limiting for various frequency bands. The
   flatness of the threshold level can be set to the desired value by
   controlling the return loss of the filters used in the FDPL circuit.
   Measured results for an FDPL circuit are presented, demonstrating that
   the limiting power level can be controlled by adjusting the dc bias of
   the MEMS switches. The commercially available electrostatically actuated
   switches OMRON and Radant are employed for the realization of the FDPL.
   Additionally, a varactor-based tunable filter is designed and
   implemented in FDPL circuits. The tunable FDPL circuits are fabricated
   and measured, demonstrating the feasibility of realizing adaptive FDPLs.}},

Abstract = {{The amplitude of the surface EMG (sEMG) is commonly estimated by
   rectification or other nonlinear transformations, followed by smoothing
   (low-pass linear filtering). Although computationally efficient, this
   approach leads to an estimation accuracy with a limited theoretical
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Since sEMG amplitude is one of the most
   relevant features for myoelectric control, its estimate has become one
   of the limiting factors for the performance of myoelectric control
   applications, such as powered prostheses. In this study, we present a
   recursive nonlinear estimator of sEMG amplitude based on Bayesian
   filtering. Furthermore, we validate the advantage of the proposed
   Bayesian filter over the conventional linear filters through an online
   simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) task, performed by eight
   able-bodied subjects and three below-elbow limb deficient subjects. The
   results demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian filter provides
   significantly more accurate SPC, particularly for the patients, when
   compared with conventional linear filters. This result presents a major
   step toward accurate prosthetic control for advanced multi-function
   prostheses.}},

Abstract = {{Test case prioritization aims at ordering test cases to increase the
   rate of fault detection, which quantifies how fast faults are detected
   during the testing phase. A common approach for test case prioritization
   is to use the information of previously executed test cases, such as
   coverage information, resulting in an iterative (greedy) prioritization
   algorithm. Current research in this area validates the fact that using
   coverage information can improve the rate of fault detection in
   prioritization algorithms. The performance of such iterative
   prioritization schemes degrade as the number of ties encountered in
   prioritization steps increases. In this paper, using the notion of
   lexicographical ordering, we propose a new heuristic for breaking ties
   in coverage based techniques. Performance of the proposed technique in
   terms of the rate of fault detection is empirically evaluated using a
   wide range of programs. Results indicate that the proposed technique can
   resolve ties and in turn noticeably increases the rate of fault
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications refer to information exchange
   between a vehicle and various elements of the intelligent transportation
   system (ITS), including other vehicles, pedestrians, Internet gateways,
   and transport infrastructure (such as traffic lights and signs). The
   technology has a great potential of enabling a variety of novel
   applications for road safety, passenger infotainment, car manufacturer
   services, and vehicle traffic optimization. Today, V2X communications is
   based on one of two main technologies: dedicated short-range
   communications (DSRC) and cellular networks. However, in the near
   future, it is not expected that a single technology can support such a
   variety of expected V2X applications for a large number of vehicles.
   Hence, interworking between DSRC and cellular network technologies for
   efficient V2X communications is proposed. This paper surveys potential
   DSRC and cellular interworking solutions for efficient V2X
   communications. First, we highlight the limitations of each technology
   in supporting V2X applications. Then, we review potential DSRC-cellular
   hybrid architectures, together with the main interworking challenges
   resulting fromvehiclemobility, such as vertical handover and network
   selection issues. In addition, we provide an overview of the global DSRC
   standards, the existing V2X research and development platforms, and the
   V2X products already adopted and deployed in vehicles by car
   manufactures, as an attempt to align academic research with automotive
   industrial activities. Finally, we suggest some open research issues for
   future V2X communications based on the interworking of DSRC and cellular

Abstract = {{Vehicular networks require a reliable and efficient one-hop broadcast
   service to disseminate delay sensitive messages for high-priority safety
   applications. However, frequent link breakage in the dynamic networking
   conditions, in the presence of high relative mobility and channel
   fading, poses technical challenges in satisfying the strict service
   requirements. Makeup transmissions can improve the performance through
   repetitive broadcasting of packets before detecting a transmission
   failure. In this paper, we introduce a node cooperation based makeup
   strategy for vehicular networks, referred to as cooperative relay
   broadcasting (CRB), such that neighboring nodes rebroadcast the packet
   from a source node, increasing the reliability of the broadcast service.
   The decision to perform CRB is taken proactively and based on the
   channel conditions between the relaying nodes and the target one-hop
   neighbors. We propose an optimization framework that provides an upper
   bound on the CRB performance with accurate channel information. Further,
   we propose a channel prediction scheme based on a two-state first-order
   Markov chain to select the best relaying node for CRB. We study the
   reliability of the broadcast service in terms of packet received rate
   and packet delivery rate. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate
   that the proposed CRB scheme provides a more reliable broadcast service,
   as compared with existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the PHY-layer authentication that exploits
   radio channel information (such as received signal strength indicators)
   to detect spoofing attacks in wireless networks. The interactions
   between a legitimate receiver and spoofers are formulated as a zero-sum
   authentication game. The receiver chooses the test threshold in the
   hypothesis test to maximize its utility based on the Bayesian risk in
   the spoofing detection, whereas the spoofers determine their attack
   frequencies to minimize the utility of the receiver. The Nash
   equilibrium of the static authentication game is derived, and its
   uniqueness is discussed. We also investigate a repeated PHY-layer
   authentication game for a dynamic radio environment. As it is
   challenging for the radio nodes to obtain the exact channel parameters
   in advance, we propose spoofing detection schemes based on Q-learning
   and Dyna-Q, which achieve the optimal test threshold in the spoofing
   detection via reinforcement learning. We implement the PHY-layer
   spoofing detectors over universal software radio peripherals and
   evaluate their performance via experiments in indoor environments. Both

Abstract = {{Watershed spatial discretization is an important step in developing a
   distributed hydrologic model. A key difficulty in the spatial
   discretization process is maintaining a balance between the
   aggregation-induced information loss and the increase in computational
   burden caused by the inclusion of additional computational units.
   Objective identification of an appropriate discretization scheme still
   remains a challenge, in part because of the lack of quantitative
   measures for assessing discretization quality, particularly prior to
   simulation. This study proposes a priori discretization error metrics to
   quantify the information loss of any candidate discretization scheme
   without having to run and calibrate a hydrologic model. These error
   metrics are applicable to multi-variable and multi-site discretization
   evaluation and provide directly interpretable information to the
   hydrologic modeler about discretization quality. The first metric, a sub
   basin error metric, quantifies the routing information loss from
   discretization, and the second, a hydrological response unit (HRU) error
   metric, improves upon existing a priori metrics by quantifying the
   information loss due to changes in land cover or soil type property
   aggregation. The metrics are straightforward to understand and easy to
   recode. Informed by the error metrics, a two-step discretization
   decision-making approach is proposed with the advantage of reducing
   extreme errors and meeting the user-specified discretization error
   targets. The metrics and decision-making approach are applied to the
   discretization of the Grand River watershed in Ontario, Canada. Results
   show that information loss increases as discretization gets coarser.
   Moreover, results help to explain the modeling difficulties associated
   with smaller upstream subbasins since the worst discretization errors
   and highest error variability appear in smaller upstream areas instead
   of larger downstream drainage areas. Hydrologic modeling experiments
   under candidate discretization schemes validate the strong correlation
   between the proposed discretization error metrics and hydrologic
   simulation responses. Discretization decision-making results show that
   the common and convenient approach of making uniform discretization
   decisions across the watershed performs worse than the proposed
   non-uniform discretization approach in terms of preserving spatial
   heterogeneity under the same computational cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Many studies of friction stir welding have shown that periodicity of
   metal flow around the tool pin may result in the formation of periodic
   differences in microstructure and texture in the weld nugget area
   correlated with the weld pitch. The current work investigates the
   periodicity of magnesium weld microtexture in the nugget region and its
   association with material flow using optical and electron microscopy.
   Two welds created in AZ80 at different processing conditions are
   presented in detail, one illustrating periodic longitudinal texture
   change, and one showing for the first time that periodic variations in
   texture, grain size, or composition are not defining features of
   periodic nugget flow. While nugget texture is dominated by shear
   deformation, it was found here to be affected to a lesser degree by
   compaction of material behind the welding tool, which led to reduction
   in intensity of the shear texture fiber. The decreased tendency for
   magnesium based alloys to form periodic patterns as compared to aluminum
   based alloys is explained with reference to the shear textures. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Due to the presence of noise and spikes in velocity measurements of
   turbulent flow fields, understanding the flow pattern may be seriously
   affected by the spurious values for zones where certain flow behaviour
   is not necessarily expected. In a series of laboratory experiments the
   velocity data recorded, using Acoustic Doppler Velocity meters (ADVs),
   and the salinity measurements were noticeably noisy. In despiking and
   denoising the velocity data a linear correlation algorithm was
   established, which successfully lowered the noise levels and removed the
   spikes. For the assessment of the method, an autoregressive model was
   used to generate a clean velocity signal. The spikes were generated with
   a uniformly random time index and a Gaussian distributed value, where
   White Gaussian noise was added to this simulated signal. Assessment was
   also undertaken on the signals generated using a three-dimensional
   numerical model. To enhance the comprehension of the flow field, an
   interpolation method for producing the missing data has also been
   developed, which may be deployed to increase the sampling frequency, or
   to produce data for the spatial domain at locations which are not
   included in the measurements. For salinity a different strategy was
   applied where a moving average procedure was carried out, as the data
   did not suffer from spikes and exhibited almost a constant band of noisy
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical methods have been widely used to simulate transient
   groundwater flow induced by pumping wells in geometrically and
   mathematically complex systems. However, flow and transport simulation
   using low-order numerical methods can be computationally expensive with
   a low rate of convergence in multi-scale problems where fine spatial
   discretization is required to ensure stability and desirable accuracy
   (for instance, close to a pumping well). Numerical approaches based on
   high-order test functions may better emulate the global behavior of
   parabolic and/or elliptic groundwater governing equations with and
   without the presence of pumping well(s). Here, we assess the
   appropriateness of high-order differential quadrature method (DQM) and
   radial basis function (RBF)-DQM approaches compared to low-order finite
   difference and finite element methods. This assessment is carried out
   using the exact analytical solution by Theis and observed head data as
   benchmarks. Numerical results show that high-order DQM and RBF-DQM are
   more efficient schemes compared to low-order numerical methods in the
   simulation of 1-D axisymmetric transient flow induced by a pumping well.
   Mesh-less RBF-DQM, with the ability to implement arbitrary (e.g.,
   adaptive) node distribution, properly simulates 2-D transient flow
   induced by pumping wells in confined/unconfined aquifers with regular
   and irregular geometries, compared to the other high-order and low-order
   approaches presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The down-regulation of CD3 protein present on the surface of a T-cell
   triggers the process of activation. A rapid decrease of CD3 from the
   surface is required to reach the threshold that is necessary for the
   continuation of the activation process. Using the flow cytometry
   technique, it is well established that an amount of down-regulated CD3
   proteins recycle and may appear on the surface of T-cell. This article
   studies the impact of recycled CD3 protein that is recruited into the
   immune synapse at different rates. The population density of T-cells is
   distributed over surface protein (CD3) concentration under the framework
   of population balance models by using a coupled system of PDEs. Such
   problems need non-conventional population balance modelling so that
   classical numerical techniques can be applied. A recently developed
   efficient numerical method is validated against the analytical and

Abstract = {{Bioprosthetic aortic valves (BAVs) are becoming the prostheses of choice
   in heart valve replacement. The objective of this paper is to assess the
   effects of leaflet geometry on the mechanics and hemodynamics of BAVs in
   a fluid structure interaction model. The curvature and angle of leaflets
   were varied in 10 case studies whereby the following design parameters
   were altered: a circular arch, a line, and a parabola for the radial
   curvature, and a circular arch, a spline, and a parabola for the
   circumferential curvature. Six different leaflet angles (representative
   of the inclination of the leaflets toward the surrounding aortic wall)
   were analyzed. The 3-dimensional geometry of the models were created
   using SolidWorks, Pointwise was used for meshing, and Comsol
   Multiphysics was used for implicit finite element calculations.
   Realistic loading was enforced by considering the time-dependent
   strongly-coupled interaction between blood flow and leaflets. Higher
   mean pressure gradients as well as von Mises stresses were obtained with
   a parabolic or circular curvature for radial curvature or a parabolic or
   spline curvature for the circumferential curvature. A smaller leaflet
   angle was associated with a lower pressure gradient, and, a lower von
   Mises stress. The leaflet curvature and angle noticeably affected the
   speed of valve opening, and closing. When a parabola was used for
   circumferential or radial curvature, leaflets displacements were
   asymmetric, and they opened and closed more slowly. A circular
   circumferential leaflet curvature, a linear leaflet radial curvature,
   and leaflet inclination toward the surrounding aortic wall were
   associated with superior BAVs mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{In urban vehicular networks, traveling users can enjoy Internet
   multimedia services through various mobile devices, such as smart phones
   and laptops. To maintain seamless and ubiquitous Internet connectivity,
   an efficient handoff scheme has to be employed when mobile users travel
   across different access networks. However, in the urban vehicular
   environment, the high velocity of vehicles and the random mobility of
   users impose great challenges to the design of an effective handoff
   scheme. In this paper, we propose an Efficient ProxyMobile IPv6
   (E-PMIPv6)-based handoff scheme that guarantees session continuity for
   urban mobile users. In the registration process, E-PMIPv6 enables mobile
   users to obtain seamless Internet connectivity either from fixed
   roadside units or mobile routers and improves cache utilization at the
   local mobility anchor by merging the binding cache entries of themobile
   users. In the handoff process, E-PMIPv6 comprehensively considers
   various handoff scenarios in the urban vehicular environment and
   provides transparent network-based mobility support to individual mobile
   users or a group of users in the same mobile network without disrupting
   ongoing sessions. In addition, E-PMIPv6 eliminates packet loss by either
   packet buffering or packet tunneling to improve handoff performance in
   each handoff scenario. Finally, a detailed analytical model is developed
   to study the performance of E-PMIPv6 in terms of handoff latency,
   signaling overhead, buffering cost, and tunneling cost. Analysis and
   simulation results demonstrate that the proposed E-PMIPv6 successfully
   extends the scalability of user mobility and greatly improves handoff
   efficiency in urban vehicular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Usibor (R) 1500P coupons are austenitized in a Gleeble 3500
   thermomechanical simulator using a two-step heating procedure in an
   argon atmosphere. Variations in spectral emissivity are measured in-situ
   using a near infrared spectrometer and ex situ with a Fourier transform
   infrared reflectometer. Microstructural evolution and surface roughness
   are investigated using optical microscopy, FE-scanning electron
   microscopy, and a surface profilometer. A series of phase
   transformations of Al-Fe-Si intermetallic phases at the coating/steel
   substrate interface cause the surface phase and surface roughness to
   change, which in turn influences the spectral emissivity. At the
   beginning of the first heating step, the coupons have very low spectral
   emissivity, due to the molten Al-Si coating. Spectral emissivity
   increases significantly with increasing soak time from 5 to 12 minutes,
   associated with the surface phase transformation of the coating into
   Al7Fe2Si intermetallic phase and an increase in surface roughness.
   Through the second step heating at 1173 K (900 degrees C), the spectral
   emissivity shows a gradually decreasing trend with increasing soak time,
   caused by the surface phase transformation from Al5Fe2 into AlFe
   intermetallic phase with a decrease in surface roughness. (C) The

Abstract = {{Warm forming operations have shown promise in expanding automotive heat
   exchanger designs by increasing forming limits of clad brazing sheet.
   The impact of isothermal holds below the clad melting temperature on
   subsequent brazeability has not previously been studied in detail. The
   effect of these holds on brazeability, as measured by the clad thickness
   loss due to solid state diffusion of Si out of the clad layer prior to
   clad melting, was assessed through parallel DSC and optical microscopy
   measurements, as well as through the use of a previously developed
   model. EPMA measurements were also performed to support the other
   measures. Overall, the same trends were predicted by DSC, microscopy,
   and the theoretical model; however, the DSC predictions were unable to
   accurately predict remaining clad thickness prior to melting, even after
   correcting the data for clad-core interactions. Microscopy measurements
   showed very good agreement with the model predictions, although there
   were slight discrepancies at short hold times due to the inability of
   the model to account for clad loss during heating to the brazing
   temperature. Further microscopy measurements showed that when the
   heating rate is set below a critical value, there is a reduction in the
   clad thickness from the as-received condition. (C) The Minerals, Metals

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) or

   potential climate change mitigation effects when combined with clean

   the next wave of technical improvements for LIBs and PEMFCs. If the next
   generation of EVs is to lead to not only reduced emissions during use
   but also environmentally sustainable production chains, the research on
   nanomaterials for LIBs and PEMFCs should be guided by a life-cycle
   perspective. In this Analysis, we describe an environmental life-cycle
   screening framework tailored to assess nanomaterials for
   electromobility. By applying this framework, we offer an early
   evaluation of the most promising nanomaterials for LIBs and PEMFCs and
   their potential contributions to the environmental sustainability of EV

Abstract = {{This paper studies the pinning stabilization problem of time-delay
   neural networks. A new pinning delayed-impulsive controller is proposed
   to stabilize the neural networks with delays. First, we consider the
   general nonlinear time-delay systems with delayed impulses, and
   establish several global exponential stability criteria by employing the
   method of Lyapunov functionals. Our results are then applied to obtain
   sufficient conditions under which the proposed pinning controller can
   exponentially stabilize the time-delay neural networks. It is shown that
   the global exponential stabilization of delayed neural networks can be
   effectively realized by controlling a small portion of neurons in the
   networks via delayed impulses, and, for fixed impulsive control gain,
   increasing the impulse delay or decreasing the number of neurons to be
   pinned at the impulsive moments will lead to high frequency of impulses
   added the corresponding neurons. Numerical examples are provided to
   illustrate the theoretical results, which demonstrate that our results
   are less conservative than the results reported in the existing
   literatures when the proposed pinning controller reduces to the delayed
   impulsive controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their superior material properties over bulk silicon,
   low-dimensional materials have been actively explored as potential
   candidates to replace or complement silicon technology in post-Moore
   era. As the first low-dimensional based transistor technology widely
   studied, carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNFET) technology is
   among the most promising candidates to outperform silicon in the
   advanced technology nodes, because of its potential to achieve higher
   speed, better gate control, and better energy efficiency. However,
   existing fabrication processes for most emerging low-dimensional
   material based technologies including CNFETs, suffer from imperfections,
   which lowers the device and circuit yield. This paper presents a
   quantitative methodology for estimating circuit-level yield of CNFET
   CMOS circuits, which takes into account imperfections of CNT substrates
   based on a recently developed CMOS-compatible self-assembly process. The
   impact of different types of process imperfection on circuit-level yield
   is analyzed. The paper also provides a methodology using device sizing
   optimization to effectively improve circuit level yields with minimal
   impact on area and energy delay product, consequently relaxing the
   process requirements to satisfy certain circuit-level yield target. It
   is shown that an 80\% pass rate can be achieved even with today's
   process for various 4-stage cascade CMOS circuits through the proposed
   sizing optimization approach.}},

Abstract = {{MEA-based post-combustion CO2 capture technology has been considered as
   one of the mature technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions since it can be
   easily integrated to existing fossil-fired power plants. In this work, a
   model describing the dynamic operation of a 453MWe natural gas combined
   cycle (NGCC) power plant integrated with a commercial-scale
   post-combustion CO2 capture plant has been developed. The proposed model
   has been used to evaluate the dynamic performance of the integrated
   process under various scenarios, e.g. changes in the reboiler heat duty
   and power plant inputs. In addition, the transient operation of the
   integrated plant using a pre-defined (scheduled) trajectory profile in
   the consumption of steam in the reboiler unit has been compared to the
   case of constant withdrawal of steam from the power plant. The results
   show that a coordinated effort between the two plants is needed to run
   the integrated plant efficiently and at near optimal economic points
   under changes in power demands. The insights gained through this
   analysis will be instrumental to design basic and advanced control and
   scheduling strategies for the integrated NGCC-CO2 capture plant. (C)

Abstract = {{The rheological behavior and viscosities of epoxy composites containing

   composites were mixed and dispersed without solvent using a planetary
   shear mixer. It was found that SDS decorated graphene (Gr(s)) exhibits
   lower viscosities when compared to non-decorated graphene. Further
   findings from the viscosity results show that the addition of Gr(s) to
   an intrinsically shear thickening (dilatant) epoxy resin not only
   suppressed this rheological behavior, but also began to exhibit
   shear-thinning behavior past a weight concentration of 0.5 \%. The
   morphology and electrical conductivity of the ECAs synthesized from this
   method have also been investigated and show bulk resistivity values in
   the range of . This work demonstrates the possibility of using Gr(s) in

Abstract = {{High-flexibility, small-mass, and high-bandwidth controllers required
   for inflatable space missions need quite accurate models to predict
   higher-order dynamics of these structures. Some major components often
   ignored in dynamic analysis of space structures that result in model
   inaccuracies are space flight cables. The cables-to-payload-mass ratio
   can be about 20\% in a traditional space structure; this number can
   increase significantly for inflatable structures due to their extremely
   light weights. As such, these cables can have significant impacts on the
   structural dynamics. The presented paper considers string-harnessed beam
   structures as a way to study the mass and stiffness effects of these
   cables. As a preliminary step, damping is ignored in the presented
   models. A homogenization technique is applied to develop the governing
   partial differential equation for the transverse bending coordinate of
   vibration of the string-harnessed beam structures. A periodic wrapping
   pattern is considered for the string throughout this paper. The
   frequency response functions for the continuum model are then compared
   to the experimental results, for which strong agreements are observed.}},

Abstract = {{A first demonstration of conjugated polyhydroxylated fullerene
   (C-60(OH)(30)) on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)s is
   reported. These nanohybrids display favourable antioxidant performance
   and are an attractive alternative to derivatized fullerene nanocages
   reported previously. UV-Vis measurements indicated that the
   C-60(OH)(30)-CNC system scavenged 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
   free radicals to a greater degree than C-60(OH)(30) alone, due to the
   nucleation of C-60(OH)(30) on the surface of CNC and high colloidal
   stability of the engineered nanohybrid. A mechanism for the 2-stage
   process of the radical reaction with C-60(OH)(30)-CNC is proposed, and
   modelled by pseudo-first order kinetics. Successful grafting of
   C-60(OH)(30) on CNC was confirmed by FTIR, while TEM revealed the
   morphology of the system with a grafting degree of 20.8 \% C-60(OH)(30).
   Zeta potential measurements of C-60(OH)(30)-CNC in aqueous solution
   showed a high stability in the pH range 4.0-8.0, indicating
   functionality of the CNC based antioxidant system as a biocompatible and
   sustainable protocol with potential for use in personal care
   applications.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Severity levels, e.g., critical and minor, of bugs are often used to
   prioritize development efforts. Prior research efforts have proposed
   approaches to automatically assign the severity label to a bug report.
   All prior efforts verify the accuracy of their approaches using
   human-assigned bug reports data that is stored in software repositories.
   However, all prior efforts assume that such human-assigned data is
   reliable. Hence a perfect automated approach should be able to assign
   the same severity label as in the repository - achieving a 100\%
   accuracy. Looking at duplicate bug reports (i.e., reports referring to
   the same problem) from three open-source software systems (OpenOffice,
   Mozilla, and Eclipse), we find that around 51 \% of the duplicate bug
   reports have inconsistent human-assigned severity labels even though
   they refer to the same software problem. While our results do indicate
   that duplicate bug reports have unreliable severity labels, we believe
   that they send warning signals about the reliability of the full bug
   severity data (i.e., including non-duplicate reports). Future research
   efforts should explore if our findings generalize to the full dataset.
   Moreover, they should factor in the unreliable nature of the bug
   severity data. Given the unreliable nature of the severity data,
   classical metrics to assess the accuracy of models/learners should not
   be used for assessing the accuracy of approaches for automated assigning
   severity label. Hence, we propose a new approach to assess the
   performance of such models. Our new assessment approach shows that
   current automated approaches perform well - 77-86 \% agreement with
   human-assigned severity labels.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents analysis of the systems in a Fuel Cell Electric
   Vehicle (FCEV) prototype with the aim of determining if it is possible
   to increase vehicle efficiency through strategic control of the
   auxiliary systems. To accomplish this, an overview of the vehicle design
   is given as well as an in depth analysis of the powertrain efficiency
   and control strategy. This leads to the development of a modified
   powertrain control algorithm which also oversees and controls the
   auxiliary power demand in real-time. The auxiliary control aspect of
   this algorithm follows predefined rules as determined through analysis
   of the individual systems, and based on the definitions of flexible
   useful and wasteful auxiliary power. The simulation results show that
   the proposed technique, applied to FCEV air conditioning system alone,
   improves the fuel economy in the neighborhood of 3.4\% compared to
   conventional bang -bang controller. This magnitude of energy reduction
   is very significant in the automotive industry, especially when
   considering the number of vehicles in use in today's transportation
   sector. The resulting algorithm is adaptable to a number of different
   types of auxiliary systems and primary power sources, thereby not
   specifically tied to the fuel cell architecture for which it is
   developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Finite-element analyses (FEA) of reinforced concrete slab-column
   connections with shear reinforcement are presented and discussed.
   Ultimate loads and crack patterns are shown and compared to the
   experimental findings. The damaged plasticity model in ABAQUS,
   previously calibrated and validated on tested slabs without shear
   reinforcement, is adopted to properly simulate the behavior of
   slab-column connections with shear reinforcement. Four interior
   slab-column specimens were tested under vertical loading applied through
   the column. One slab specimen was without shear reinforcement, while the
   other three differed in the amount of the shear bolts. The objective of
   this paper is to propose a novel numerical modeling strategy for
   simulating and analyzing shear reinforced slabs with shear bolts. For
   that purpose, in the numerical analyses, four different approaches for
   modeling the shear bolt are introduced and described. Discussion and
   comparison on the predicted failure loads from the design codes and
   models in conjunction with the experimental and numerical data, are
   presented. Finally, a parametric numerical study is conducted, where the
   rectangular and the radial shear reinforcement arrangements are

Volume = {{334}},
Pages = {{221-239}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Ionic liquids are often named solvents of the future because of
   flexibility in design. This statement has given credence that ionic
   liquids should simply replace the problematic electrolytes of lithium
   batteries. As a result, the promising potentials of ionic liquids in
   electrochemical systems are somehow obscured by inappropriate
   expectations. We summarize recent advancements in this field,
   especially, ionic liquids as standalone electrolytes, additives,
   plasticizers in gel polymer electrolytes, and binders; and attempt to
   shed light on the future pathway of this area of research. Ionic liquids
   are not dilute media to serve as pure solvents in electrochemical
   systems where mobility of ions is the priority; instead, they can
   contribute to the ionic conductivity of various components in a battery
   system. Owing to the enormous possibilities of ionic liquids, it is not
   merely a matter of choice. Ionic liquids can be used to design novel
   types of electrolytes for a new generation of lithium batteries. A
   promising possibility, which is still at a very early stage, is
   supercooled ionic liquid crystals for fast ion diffusion through the
   guided channels of a liquid-like medium. This, of course, will be a
   breakthrough in the realm of electrochemistry, far beyond lithium
   battery field, when materialized. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have
   found a good reputation in the automotive industry due to the fact that
   they neatly satisfy the existing tight environmental regulations and
   fuel economy requirements. Recently, there has been more interest in the
   design optimization of the PHEV powertrains to improve their operational
   characteristics to the maximum possible extent. The PHEV powertrains are
   complicated systems and include different controllers and components
   which should operate corporately to guarantee the acceptable performance
   of the vehicle. The reported investigations indicate that improving the
   performance of PHEVs is a very arduous task because both control
   strategies and component sizes should be optimized in tandem; however,
   in most of the previous studies, the focus has been on improving one of
   the above-mentioned aspects, which does not result in the most efficient
   design. The main goal of the current study is to take advantage of a
   bi-level optimization framework which combines the optimizations of both
   powertrain component sizes and power management controller for a
   specific PHEV, namely 2012 Toyota plug-in Prius. The bi-level optimizer
   comprises a chaos-enhanced differential evolutionary algorithm, which is
   in charge of the component sizing, and a classical optimal control
   approach based on the Pontryagin's minimum principle, which optimizes
   the vehicle power management strategy. A high-fidelity model of the
   vehicle is developed in the Autonomie software. This high-fidelity model
   is used to identify the parameters of a reduced model representing the
   vehicle dynamics by means of the homotopy analysis method, and the
   resulting model is then employed for the optimization procedure. The
   results of the numerical experiments indicate that by considering both
   component sizing and control strategy optimization, a very powerful tool
   is developed which can significantly improve the total fuel cost (F (C)
   ), acceleration time (T (acc) ), and battery state of charge (SOC)
   trajectory of the vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Active safety systems of a vehicle normally work well on tyre-road
   interactions, however, these systems deteriorate in performance on
   low-friction road conditions. To combat this effect, an innovative idea
   for the yaw moment and roll dynamic control is presented in this paper.
   This idea was inspired by the chase and run dynamics animals like
   cheetahs in the nature; cheetahs have the ability to swerve while
   running at very high speeds. A cheetah controls its dynamics by rotating
   its long tail. A three-dimensional stabilizer pendulum system (3D-SPS)
   resembles the rotational motion of the tail of a cheetah to improve the
   stability and safety of a vehicle. The idea has been developed in a
   stand-alone 3D stabilizer pendulum system as well as in an integrated
   control system, which consists of an ordinary differential braking
   direct yaw control (DYC) and active steering control that is assisted by
   the 3D-SPS. The performance of the proposed 3D-SPS has been evaluated
   over a wide range of handling manoeuvres by using a comprehensive
   numerical simulation. The results show the advantage of 3D-SPS over
   conventional control approaches, which are ineffective on low-friction
   road conditions and high lateral acceleration manoeuvres. It should
   however be noted that the best vehicle dynamics performance is obtained
   when an integrated 3D-SPS and DYC and AFS is utilised.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a vehicle's lateral dynamic model is developed based on
   the pure and the combined-slip LuGre tyre models. Conventional vehicle's
   lateral dynamic methods derive handling models utilising linear tyres
   and pure-slip assumptions. The current article proposes a general
   lateral dynamic model, which takes the linear and nonlinear behaviours
   of the tyre into account using the pure and combined-slip assumptions
   separately. The developed methodology also incorporates various normal
   loads at each corner and provides a proper tyre-vehicle platform for
   control and estimation applications. Steady-state and transient LuGre
   models are also used in the model development and their responses are
   compared in different driving scenarios. Considering the fact that the
   vehicle dynamics is time-varying, the stability of the suggested
   time-varying model is investigated using an affine quadratic stability
   approach, and a novel approach to define the critical longitudinal speed
   is suggested and compared with that of conventional lateral stability
   methods. Simulations have been conducted and the results are used to
   validate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a controller called dynamic matrix constrained variable
   structure controller (DM-CVSC) is proposed. The controller takes
   advantages of both dynamic matrix (DM) and constrained variable
   structure controllers. As a result, DM-CVSC is a robust trajectory
   tracking controller dealing with the constraints on control inputs and
   also makes decision based on the future behavior of the vehicle. The
   controller is applied to a linearized model of half-car suspension
   systems which are subject to different types of road disturbances and
   measurement noises. In this paper, it is shown that there is a simple
   formulation for calculating the range of sliding gains for single-input
   single-output (SISO) linear control systems. As for the multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) linear control systems, the calculation of upper
   sliding gain profile for controller leads to a search problem. To show
   the efficiency of the proposed controller, it is applied to four
   different cases involving specific road disturbances and measurement
   noises. The performance of the proposed controller is compared to
   various control techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of single microalgae cell plays a very important role in
   understanding the activity of microalgae cell. In this paper, a new
   method of capturing and monitoring a microalgae cell is presented. This
   method uses the surface of an air bubble formed in an aqueous solution
   in a microchannel to capture a microalgae cell. The aliveness of the
   captured microalgae cell can be monitored quantitatively by measuring
   chlorophyll fluorescence intensity of the microalgae cell. To
   demonstrate the performance of this method, two species of microalgae
   cells, Dunaliella salina and Tetraselmis Chui, were taken as samples.
   The effect of pH on the cell capture was studied experimentally. The
   cells were treated by NaClO or Formaldehyde solutions of different
   concentrations. The kinetics of the photosynthesis activity of the
   captured single microalgae cells was investigated under different
   treatment conditions. The results show that the viability of single
   microalgae cells can be studied individually and accurately by this
   method.}},

   factors}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is generated as a byproduct of
   bitumen extraction in Canada's oil sands. Due to the water's toxicity,
   associated with dissolved acid extractable organics (AEO), especially
   naphthenic acids (NAs), along with base-neutral organics, OSPW may
   require treatment to enable safe discharge to the environment.
   Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising advanced oxidation process
   (AOP) for OSPW remediation, however, predicting treatment efficacy can
   be challenging due to the unique water chemistry of OSPW from different
   tailings ponds. The objective of this work was to study various factors
   affecting the kinetics of photocatalytic AEO degradation in OSPW. The
   rate of photo catalytic treatment varied significantly in two different
   OSPW sources, which could not be accounted for by differences in AEO
   composition, as studied by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The
   effects of inorganic water constituents were investigated using
   factorial and response surface experiments, which revealed that hydroxyl
   (HO center dot) radical scavenging by iron (Fe3+) and bicarbonate
   (HCO3-) inhibited the NA degradation rate. The effects of NA
   concentration and temperature on the treatment kinetics were also
   evaluated in terms of Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Arrhenius models; pH and
   temperature were identified as weak factors, while dissolved oxygen (DO)
   was critical to the photo-oxidation reaction. Accounting for all of
   these variables, a general empirical kinetic expression is proposed,
   enabling prediction of photocatalytic treatment performance in diverse
   sources of OSPW. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In today's dynamic environment, there naturally exist two types of
   novelties: emerging and evolving. Emerging novelties are represented by
   concepts which are completely different from previously seen instances,
   while evolving novelties are characterized by relatively new aspects of
   existing concepts. Most existing algorithms for novelty detection focus
   on detecting only one type of novelty, giving little or no attention to
   the other. In real situations, the challenge is that these two types of
   novelties are not easily distinguishable and sometimes a truly novel
   concept does not fit perfectly under one of these categories. In this
   paper, a locally adaptive kernel density ratio method is proposed to
   capture the two characteristics in one formula. In specific, the density
   ratio between new and reference data is used to capture evolving
   novelties, and at the same time, the locally adaptive kernel is employed
   into the density ratio objective function to capture emerging novelties
   based on the local neighborhood structure. The effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated in the detection of
   novel handwritten digits and a set of benchmark novelty detection tasks.
   Additionally, we further examine its applicability in detecting
   novelties in social media data, which are characterized by a mixture of
   emerging and evolving topics over time.}},

Abstract = {{Epoxy-Graphene (E/G) nanocomposites with different loading of graphene
   were prepared via in situ prepolymerization and evaluated as protective
   coating for Stainless Steel 304 (SS304). The prepolymer composites were
   spin coated on SS304 substrates and thermally cured. Transmission
   Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were
   utilized to examine the dispersion of graphene in the epoxy matrix.
   Epoxy and E/G nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) techniques and the thermal
   behavior of the prepared coatings is analyzed using Thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The
   corrosion protection properties of the prepared coatings were evaluated
   using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Cyclic
   Voltammetry (CV) measurements. In addition to corrosion mitigation
   properties, the long-term adhesion performance of the coatings was
   evaluated by measuring the adhesion of the coatings to the SS304
   substrate after 60 days of exposure to 3.5 wt\% NaCl medium. The effects
   of graphene loading on the impact resistance, flexibility, and UV
   stability of the coating are analyzed and discussed. SEM was utilized to
   evaluate post adhesion and UV stability results. The results indicate
   that very low graphene loading up to 0.5 wt \% significantly enhances
   the corrosion protection, UV stability, and impact resistance of epoxy
   coatings.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that pre-treating cortical
   bone with ribose would protect the rising fracture resistance curve
   behavior and crack initiation fracture toughness of both bovine and
   human cortical bone from the degrading effects of gamma-irradiation
   sterilization.
   Materials and methods: A ribose pre-treatment (1.8 M for bovine, and 1.2
   M for human, in PBS at 60 degrees C for 24 h) was applied to single-edge
   notched bending fracture specimens prior to sterilization with a 33 kGy
   dose of gamma-irradiation. Fracture resistance curves were generated
   with a single specimen method using an optical crack length measurement
   technique. The effect of the treatment on overall fracture resistance
   behavior, crack initiation fracture toughness, and tearing modulus was
   compared with non-irradiated and conventionally irradiation sterilized
   controls. Hydrothermal isometric tension testing was used to examine
   collagen network connectivity and thermal stability to explore
   relationships between collagen network quality and fracture resistance.
   Results: The ribose pre-treatment successfully protected the crack
   growth initiation fracture toughness of bovine and human bone by 32\%
   and 63\%, respectively. The rising JR-curve behavior was also partially
   protected. Furthermore, collagen connectivity and thermal stability
   followed similar patterns to those displayed by fracture toughness.
   Conclusions: This paper demonstrates that the fracture toughness of
   irradiation-sterilized bone tissue can be partially protected with a
   ribose pre-treatment. This new approach shows potential for the
   production and clinical application of sterilized allografts with
   improved mechanical performance and durability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{158-169}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, power distribution systems have encountered a
   considerable shift toward utilizing renewable resource based distributed
   generation (DG) systems. This is due to the proven ability of DGs to
   reduce fossil fuel consumption, which reduces harm done to the
   environment. In this paper, a new state reduction algorithm is proposed
   to determine the minimum number of states required to describe or
   represent the behavior of wind speed and solar irradiance in DG planning
   problems and reliability analysis. This algorithm could be generalized
   to incorporate any planning problem where wind or PV power is part of
   its parameters. Moreover, an adequate time representation that mimics
   the fluctuation of renewable resource based DGs and chronologically
   matches the fluctuations in system demand is presented. Three different
   data clusters are applied (monthly, seasonal and yearly) to investigate
   the variability of DG power output and electricity demand on both DG
   planning problems and reliability assessment. These models are evaluated
   considering DG siting and sizing problems, as well as a supply
   adequacy-based reliability assessment. The proposed model measures the
   deviations in annual energy losses (AEL), total DG penetration, loss of
   load expectation (LOLE), and loss of energy expectation (LOEE). (C) 2016

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{238}},

Abstract = {{This article aims at a thorough study about the effects of sintering
   protocols and layer thickness on mechanical and physical properties of
   additive manufactured porous structures used in orthopedic applications.
   Stress shielding effects induced on the bone interfacial surfaces due to
   the fixation of the metallic implant must be minimized to prevent
   implant loosening resulting in inflammation and pain. To this end,
   controlling the mechanical and physical properties of the implant is
   crucial to address the above mentioned issue. This control can be
   enhanced by understanding the role of additive manufacturing parameters
   in anisotropic properties of titanium structures. In addition to the
   experimental tasks, a model was developed according to the
   microstructural arrangement of particles to predict the porosity of the
   produced structures. The results showed a good agreement between the
   developed model and the experimental results. Furthermore, with the
   variation of process parameters, titanium parts with a wide range of
   porosity (17-44\%), Young's modulus (0.77-11.46 GPa), yield strength
   (27-383 MPa), and shrinkage (similar to 2-11\%) were produced. Finally,
   the achieved porosity, young's modulus property and yield strength were
   comparable with the cortical bone properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model of nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ)

   The model integrates the detailed catalytic, electrochemical elementary

   data for H-2-H2O fuel gas under different cell sizes and operating
   conditions. The distributions of gas/surface phase species concentration
   and current density were predicted and the effects of operating
   temperature, fuel gas composition and fuel channel tube design on the
   cell performance were studied. The results show that the electrochemical
   reaction processes occurs mainly within a 20 mu m distance from the
   anode/electrolyte interface and that the Ni catalyst surface is covered
   mainly by H(s). For the chamber channel design, the calculations show
   that the tube chamber should have a diameter no smaller than the cathode

Abstract = {{A common indication for corneal transplantation, which is the most
   transplanted tissue, is a dysfunctional corneal endothelium due to
   Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (FED). FED is diagnosed by the presence of
   in vivo pathological microtopography on the Descemet membrane, which is
   called corneal guttata. Minimally invasive corneal endothelial cell
   regenerative procedures such as endothelial cell injection therapy and
   Rho kinase inhibitor pharmacotherapy have been proposed as alternatives
   to conventional corneal transplantation for FED patients. However, the
   effect of guttata on monolayer reformation following such therapies is
   unknown and there is no equivalent in vitro or animal model to study
   monolayer reformation. Using a synthetic guttata FED disease model, the
   formation of the monolayer is investigated to evaluate the efficacy of
   both therapies. Results obtained suggest that guttata dimensions,
   density, and spacing greatly affect the fate of corneal endothelial
   cells in terms of migratory behavior and monolayer reformation. Densely
   packed synthetic guttata mimicking late-stage FED hinders monolayer
   reformation, while synthetic guttata of lower height and density show
   improved monolayer formation. These results suggest that severity of the
   FED, as determined by height and density of existing guttata, can
   potentially attenuate corneal endothelial monolayer formation of corneal
   cell injection therapy and pharmacotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a theoretically simple, efficient yet robust
   approach to supervised texture segmentation based on local radial
   difference features and a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. We make the
   following contributions: (1) we propose an approach to optimally learn
   new compact single BoW histogram models from the entire training set,
   with the single histogram providing benefits of efficiency in both
   memory and computation costs; (2) we show that BoW histograms computed
   from local simple radial difference features can provide an accurate
   pixel-wise segmentation of a textured image; and (3) we investigate
   whether sparse reconstruction, very successful in texture
   classification, assists in texture segmentation, with our study
   demonstrating the surprising conclusion that sparse reconstruction
   methods actually do not improve segmentation performance.
   Extensive experiments on composite natural texture images demonstrate
   the superiority of the proposed approach over multiple state of the art
   texture segmentation methods. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates a
   significant superiority over recent popular sparse reconstruction
   segmentation methods in terms of computational efficiency, while
   outperforming or comparable in terms of segmentation accuracy. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Apart from conventional materials, the study of two-dimensional (2D)
   materials has emerged as a significant field of study for a variety of
   applications. Graphene-like 2D materials are important elements of
   potential optoelectronics applications due to their exceptional
   electronic and optical properties. The processing of these materials
   towards the realization of devices has been one of the main motivations
   for the recent development of photonics and optoelectronics. The recent
   progress in photonic devices based on graphene-like 2D materials,
   especially topological insulators (TIs) and transition metal
   dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the methodology level discussions from the
   viewpoint of state-of-the-art designs in device geometry and materials
   are detailed in this review. We have started the article with an
   overview of the electronic properties and continued by highlighting
   their linear and nonlinear optical properties. The production of TIs and
   TMDs by different methods is detailed. The following main applications
   focused towards device fabrication are elaborated: (1) photodetectors,
   (2) photovoltaic devices, (3) light-emitting devices, (4) flexible
   devices and (5) laser applications. The possibility of employing these
   2D materials in different fields is also suggested based on their
   properties in the prospective part. This review will not only greatly
   complement the detailed knowledge of the device physics of these
   materials, but also provide contemporary perception for the researchers
   who wish to consider these materials for various applications by
   following the path of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{The equivalent behavior among analogous block copolymer systems
   involving chemically distinct molecules or mathematically different
   models has long hinted at an underlying universality, but only recently
   has it been rigorously demonstrated by matching results from different
   simulations. The profound implication of universality is that simple
   coarse-grained models can be calibrated so as to provide quantitatively
   accurate predictions to experiment. Here, we provide the first
   compelling demonstration of this by simulating a
   polyisoprene-polylactide diblock copolymer melt using a previously
   calibrated lattice model. The simulation successfully predicts the peak
   in the disordered-state structure function, the position of the
   order-disorder transition, and the latent heat of the transition in
   excellent quantitative agreement with experiment. This could mark a new
   era of precision in the field of block copolymer research.}},

Abstract = {{The series hybrid electric tracked bulldozer (HETB)'s fuel economy
   heavily depends on its energy management strategy. This paper presents a
   model predictive controller (MPC) to solve the energy management problem
   in an HETB for the first time. A real typical working condition of the
   HETB is utilized to develop the MPC. The results are compared to two
   other strategies: a rule-based strategy and a dynamic programming (DP)
   based one. The latter is a global optimization approach used as a
   benchmark. The effect of the MPC's parameters (e.g. length of prediction
   horizon) is also studied. The comparison results demonstrate that the
   proposed approach has approximately a 6\% improvement in fuel economy
   over the rule-based one, and it can achieve over 98\% of the fuel
   optimality of DP in typical working conditions. To show the advantage of
   the proposed MPC and its robustness under large disturbances, 40\% white
   noise has been added to the typical working condition. Simulation
   results show that an 8\% improvement in fuel economy is obtained by the
   proposed approach compared to the rule-based one. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A predictive power management controller for service vehicle anti-idling
   systems without a priori information}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{548-557}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a model predictive power management strategy for a
   novel anti-idling system, regenerative auxiliary power system (RAPS),
   designed for service vehicles. RAPS is able to utilize recovered braking
   energy for electrified auxiliary systems; this feature distinguishes it
   from its counterparts - auxiliary power unit (APU) and auxiliary battery
   powered unit (ABP). To efficiently operate the RAPS, a power management
   strategy is required to coordinate power flow between different energy
   sources. Thus, a model predictive controller (MPC) is developed to
   improve the overall efficiency of the RAPS. As an optimization-based
   approach, the MPC-based power management strategy usually requires the
   drive cycle or the drivers' command to be known a priori. However, in
   this study, an average concept based MPC is developed without such
   knowledge. MPC parameters are tuned over an urban drive cycle; whereas,
   the robustness of this MPC is tested under different drive cycles (e.g.
   highway and combined). Analysis shows that, the presented MPC has a
   comparable performance as the prescient MPC regarding fuel consumption,
   which assumes knows the drive cycle beforehand. Meanwhile, with the help
   of the proposed MPC and RAPS, the service vehicle saves up to 9\% of the
   total fuel consumption. The proposed MPC is independent of powertrain
   topology such that it can be directly extended to other types of hybrid
   electric vehicles (HEVs), and it provides a way to apply the MPC even
   though future driving information is unavailable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) remains a big
   challenge in water treatment. Risks associated with these compounds are
   not clearly defined and it is important that the water industry has
   additional options to increase the resiliency of water treatment
   systems. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has potential applications for the
   removal of EDCs from water. TiO2 has been immobilized on supports using
   a variety of synthesis methods to increase its feasibility for water
   treatment. In this study, we immobilized TiO2 through the
   thermal-chemical oxidation of porous titania sheets. The efficiency of
   the material to degrade target EDCs under UV-LED irradiation was
   examined under a wide range of pH conditions. A yeast-estrogen screen
   assay was used to complement chemical analysis in assessing removal
   efficiency. All compounds but 17 beta-estradiol were degraded and
   followed a pseudo first-order kinetics at all pH conditions tested, with
   pH 4 and pH 11 showing the most and the least efficient treatments
   respectively. In addition, the total estrogenic activity was
   substantially reduced even with the inefficient degradation of 17
   beta-estradiol. Additional studies will be required to optimize
   different treatment conditions, UV-LED configurations, and membrane
   fouling mitigation measures to make this technology a more viable option
   for water treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce electrically thin cloaking devices that deflect a plane
   wave based on the principles of phase compensation and wave
   interference. An electrically large perfectly conducting object is
   cloaked by materials that control the phase velocity of the refracted
   wave. The design is based on gradient index materials to reflect
   incident waves in different directions resulting in a significant
   reduction in monostatic radar cross section. Unlike earlier cloaking
   devices that were constrained by specific geometry and involved complex
   media, the devices introduced here are electrically thin and can be made
   conformable to the surface of the structure to be cloaked. Numerical
   simulations are presented to validate the design concept presented here.

Abstract = {{Increasing energy demands and environment awareness have promoted
   extensive research on the development of alternative energy conversion
   and storage technologies with high efficiency and environmental
   friendliness. Among them, water splitting is very appealing, and is

   renewable-energy technology is to expedite the oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER) because of its slow kinetics and large overpotential. Therefore,
   developing efficient electrocatalysts with high catalytic activities is
   of great importance for high-performance water splitting. In the past
   few years, much effort has been devoted to the development of
   alternative OER electrocatalysts based on transition-metal elements that
   are low-cost, highly efficient, and have excellent stability. Here,
   recent progress on the design, synthesis, and application of OER
   electrocatalysts based on transition-metal elements, including Co, Ni,

Abstract = {{Aluminum (Al) nanoparticles have drawn much attention due to their high
   energy density and tunable ignition properties. In comparison with their
   micronscale counterpart, Al nanoparticles possess large specific surface
   area and low apparent activation energy of combustion, which reduce
   ignition delay significantly. In this paper, ignition and subsequently
   burning of consolidated Al nanoparticle pellets are performed via a
   continuous wave (CW) argon laser in a closed spherical chamber filled
   with oxygen. Pellets are fabricated using two types of nanoparticle
   sizes of 40-60 and 60-80 nm, respectively. A photodiode is used to
   measure the ignition delay, while a digital camera captures the location
   of the flame front. It is found that for the 40-60-nm nanoparticle
   pellets, ignition delay reduces with increasing the oxygen pressure or
   using the higher laser power. Analysis of the flame propagation rate
   suggests that oxygen diffusion is an important mechanism during burning
   of these porous nanoparticle pellets. The combustion characteristics of
   the Al pellets are compared to a simplified model of the
   diffusion-controlled oxidation mechanism. While experimental
   measurements of pellets of 40-60 nm Al particles agree with the computed
   diffusion-limiting mechanism, a shifted behavior is observed from the
   pellets of 60-80 nm Al particles, largely due to the inhomogeneity of
   their porous structures.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{While poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) {[}P(3HB-co-3HV)] is
   a biodegradable commodity plastic with broad applications, its microbial
   synthesis is hindered by high production costs primarily associated with
   the supplementation of related carbon substrates (e.g. propionate or
   valerate). Here we report construction of engineered Escherichia coli
   strains for direct synthesis of P(3HB-co-3HV) from an unrelated carbon
   source (e.g. glucose or glycerol). First, an E. coli strain with an
   activated sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) operon was used to generate
   propionyl-CoA as a precursor. Next, two acetyl-CoA moieties or
   acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA were condensed to form acetoacetyl-CoA and
   3-ketovaleryl-CoA, respectively, by functional expression of
   beta-ketothiolases from Cupriavidus necator (i.e. PhaA and BktB). The
   resulting thioester intermediates were channeled into the
   polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthetic pathway through functional
   expression of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) for thioester reduction
   and PHA synthase (PhaC) for subsequent polymerization. Metabolic
   engineering of E. coli host strains was further conducted to enhance
   total PHA content and the 3-hydroxyvaleryl (3HV) monomer fraction in the
   copolymer. Using a selection of engineered E. coli strains for batch
   cultivation with an unrelated carbon source, we achieved high-level
   P(3HB-co-3HV) production with the 3HV monomer fraction ranging from 3 to
   19 mol\%, demonstrating the potential industrial applicability of these
   whole-cell biocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Well-defined Pt-Co nanowire networks (NWNs) were successfully prepared
   as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts by a
   surfactant-assisted soft template (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB)
   synthesis procedure for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). We
   systematically investigate the impact of synthesis conditions, including
   the amount of reducing agent used, reaction stirring rates and CTAB
   concentrations, to determine the conditions for synthesizing Pt-Co NWNs
   with optimal ORR activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep
   voltammetry (LSV) results reveal that Pt-Co NWNs exhibit superior ORR
   activity in comparison to commercial Pt/C used as a benchmark. The mass
   and specific activities of Pt-Co NWNs are 0.179 A mg(pt)(-1) and 357.5 A
   cm(pt)(-2), respectively. This represents improvements of about 210\%
   and 220\%, respectively, in comparison to Pt/C. In addition, accelerated
   degradation testing (ADT) shows that the Pt-Co NWNs catalysts
   demonstrate evidently improved durability than commercial Pt/C in terms
   of electrochemical surface area and ORR activity retention. This renders
   Pt-Co NV/Ns as a highly promising, emerging class of ORR catalysts for
   PEMFCs application. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published

   removal in the SBRs (3.3-4.8\% with 3.4 mg P/L; 5.5-8.8\% with 6.4 mg

   composite system reliability based planning for ERs, and presents novel

   K-means clustering and Fuzzy C-means clustering techniques are applied
   to the set of reliability indices, Load Not Served per Interruption
   (LNSI), which are determined using nodal minimal cut sets. The nodal
   minimal cut sets are obtained using an optimal power flow (OPF) based
   approach in this paper. Once the optimal sizes and locations of ERs are
   obtained, the earliest year of penetration is determined using an
   adequacy check algorithm. Detailed studies presented considering the

Abstract = {{Photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) is a widefield noncontact
   biophotonic technology able to remotely monitor cardiovascular function
   over anatomical areas. Although spatial context can provide insight into
   physiologically relevant sampling locations, existing PPGI systems rely
   on coarse spatial averaging with no anatomical priors for assessing
   arterial pulsatility. Here, we developed a continuous probabilistic
   pulsatility model for importance-weighted blood pulse waveform
   extraction. Using a data-driven approach, the model was constructed
   using a 23 participant sample with a large demographic variability
   (11/12 female/male, age 11 to 60 years, BMI 16.4 to 35.1 kg . m(-2)).
   Using time-synchronized ground-truth blood pulse waveforms, spatial
   correlation priors were computed and projected into a coaligned
   importance-weighted Cartesian space. A modified Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel
   density estimation method was used to compute the continuous
   resolution-agnostic probabilistic pulsatility model. The model
   identified locations that consistently exhibited pulsatility across the
   sample. Blood pulse waveform signals extracted with the model exhibited
   significantly stronger temporal correlation (W = 35; p < 0.01) and
   spectral SNR (W = 31; p < 0.01) compared to uniform spatial averaging.
   Heart rate estimation was in strong agreement with true heart rate

Abstract = {{One of the key aspects of underground carbon dioxide disposal is the
   injection rate. This defines the amount of CO2 to be injected into a
   reservoir, and is limited by reservoir fracture pressure. Therefore, it
   is very important to determine all parameters which contribute to
   pressure build up to identify optimal injection design. When injection
   volumes are high, the rate is split between multiple injectors, making
   the optimization process time consuming for numerical simulations. As
   such analytical or semi analytical approaches can be very useful.
   In this paper, a fast semi -analytical approach to evaluate pressure
   distribution in saline aquifers during multiple well CO2 injection is
   presented. It is based on general 1-D solutions of the diffusivity
   equation for three regions (CO2, two-phase and brine) established in
   aquifers when injection is done using a single well. The boundaries of a
   two-phase region, where both CO2 and brine coexist in pores, depend on
   reservoir and fluid properties and assessed using a single numerical
   simulation, run to match the analytical solution for pressure
   distribution, and these values are kept constant when extending to
   multiple well scenarios., Extension to multiple well injection has been
   conducted using the superposition principle.
   The results of modeling were compared with the numerical simulations
   including single well injection and a variety of cases of multiple well
   injection, with differing numbers of injectors and their placement.
   Different reservoir properties, such as permeability, formation
   compressibility as well as vertical size have been considered. Good
   agreement between modeling and reservoir simulations was observed for
   all cases.
   The approach presented here can be used as a pre-screening tool for fast
   initial evaluation of potential injection sites as well as to suggest
   injection design ideas and optimization of well placement. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We present a design approach to maintain a stable voltage transfer
   characteristic in inkjet-printed complementary organic thin-film
   transistor logic inverters via device sizing. We use transistor-level
   design to help achieve stable logic gates, so that performance is less
   dependent on processing conditions and materials properties that are
   difficult to control for inkjet-printed electronics. Despite bias-stress
   instability in the individual p-and n-type transistors, a stable
   inverter switching threshold is achieved by equalizing the magnitudes of
   positive and negative threshold voltage shifts. Following a typical
   sizing approach for complementary logic, a p- to n-transistor
   transconductance ratio of 0.25 places the inverter switching threshold
   near the center of the voltage supply range. However, we show through
   calculations and measured results that a ratio closer to 2.5 prevents
   rapid shift of the switching threshold, which is equally important for
   reliable inverter operation. Furthermore, we provide a design approach
   to size digital logic gates with arbitrary probability of output states.}},

Abstract = {{The study of oxygen uptake ((V) over dot(O2)) dynamics during walking
   exercise transitions adds valuable information regarding fitness.
   However, direct (V) over dot(O2) measurements are not practical for
   general population under realistic settings. Devices to measure (V) over
   dot(O2) are associated with elevated cost, uncomfortable use of a mask,
   need of trained technicians, and impossibility of long-term data
   collection. The objective of this study was to predict the (V) over
   dot(O2) dynamics from heart rate and inputs from the treadmill ergometer
   by a novel artificial neural network approach. To accomplish this, 10
   healthy young participants performed one incremental and three moderate
   constant work rate treadmill walking exercises. The speed and grade used
   for the moderate-intensity protocol was related to 80\% of the (V) over
   dot(O2) response at the gas exchange threshold estimated during the
   incremental exercise. The measured (V) over dot(O2) was used to train an
   artificial neural network to create an algorithm able to predict the (V)
   over dot(O2) based on easy-to-obtain inputs. The dynamics of the (V)
   over dot(O2) response during exercise transition were evaluated by
   exponential modeling. Within each participant, the predicted (V) over
   dot(O2) was strongly correlated to the measured (V) over dot(O2) (= 0.97
   +/- 0.0) and presented a low bias (similar to 0.2\%), enabling the
   characterization of the (V) over dot(O2) dynamics during treadmill
   walking exercise. The proposed algorithm could be incorporated into
   smart devices and fitness equipment, making them suitable for tracking
   changes in aerobic fitness and physical health beyond the infrequent
   monitoring of patients during clinical interventions and rehabilitation
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{Dry etching of silicon has been extensively studied, mostly with a goal
   of obtaining perfectly vertical sidewalls with high aspect ratio. Yet,
   sloped sidewall with a negative taper angle (i.e., diameter/width
   decreases linearly with depth) may find various applications. However,
   the systematic study on the etching process development to obtain such a
   profile is rather scarce. In this work, the authors present a controlled
   and reproducible fabrication process to achieve silicon nanostructures
   with negatively tapered sidewall profile using inductively coupled
   plasma-reactive ion etching with C4F8 and SF6 gas. The plasma etching
   parameters have been thoroughly optimized in order to avoid the undercut
   or curved reentrant profile due to isotropic etching, so as to achieve a
   negatively tapered profile. The influence of the plasma etching
   parameters, especially the radio freguency power and C4F8/SF6 gas flow
   ratio, on the etching rate and the sidewall taper angle has been
   analyzed. With an optimal etching recipe, the silicon nanostructures
   with an unprecedented large 10 degrees negative taper angle were
   achieved. These results were demonstrated on different structure sizes
   of 500 nm, 700 nm, and 1.2 mu m diameters. (C) 2016 American Vacuum

   lift-off resist with controllable undercut}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A lift-off process is a popular method to pattern metals, especially for
   the noble metals that are hard to dry-etch. For a ``clean{''} lift-off
   process, an undercut profile is critical and is commonly achieved by
   using a bilayer resist stack. A resist with tunable sensitivity is
   apparently the most desirable, since it offers a controlled amount of
   undercut when used as the bottom layer, with the top layer being a less
   sensitive resist. In this study, the authors show that a simple mixture
   of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and ZEP can offer tunable
   sensitivity by adjusting the ratio of the two resists dissolved in
   anisole. Higher sensitivity was attained by increasing the ZEP content
   in the mixture since ZEP is about 3 more sensitive than PMMA. However,
   the relationship is not a linear one, and the contrast curve for a
   mixture containing more PMMA (e.g., PMMA: ZEP ratio of 2: 1) is closer
   to that of pure ZEP than to PMMA. For dense line array patterns with a
   periodicity of 200 and 500 nm, a moderate undercut obtained by using a
   low ZEP concentration (PMMA: ZEP = 2: 1 as the bottom layer, PMMA as the
   top layer) gave the result for lift-off of 100 nm Cr. While using pure
   ZEP as the bottom layer, the undercut was often too large that the
   resist lines collapsed because of capillary force or even completely
   detached when the adjacent undercut merged together. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{The deepening impact of global warming has stimulated numerous
   researchers to come up with alternative energy sources and
   transportation facilities that create fewer emissions. DC distribution
   systems are attractive candidates for adapting high penetration of
   distributed generation and electric vehicles. Accordingly, this work
   proposes a distributed power management scheme to enhance the
   reliability and economic performance of isolated dc microgrids. In the
   presented approach, the dc microgrid is assumed to contain both
   renewable and nonrenewable generating units. At lower loading
   conditions, the proposed scheme stimulates a power-sharing strategy
   among renewable sources to increase system reliability, whereas
   nonrenewable sources are kept operating at their lower power limits.
   Alternatively, renewable sources are allowed to operate at their maximum
   power limits while maintaining optimum economic operation among
   nonrenewable sources to meet higher loading conditions. To achieve these
   operational criteria, both renewable and nonrenewable DG units apply a
   consensus-based algorithm in a supervisory control level. Each DG unit
   exchanges information with its neighbors, thereby locally updating the
   no-load voltage setting of its primary control according to system
   voltage sensitivity analysis. The incorporation of DG droop-based
   primary control renders the proposed algorithms fully distributed with a
   reduced number of agents. The proposed algorithm has the additional
   advantage of restoring system voltage to its nominal value. The
   stability and convergence of the algorithm are analytically addressed,
   and real-time OPAL-RT simulations are performed in a
   hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application to verify its effectiveness. (C)

Abstract = {{Wireless powered communication systems have recently attracted
   significant interest because of their potential to provide a ubiquitous
   and sustainable energy supply for communication networks. However, the
   energy that can be harvested from external energy sources is generally
   uncontrollable and intermittent. By allowing multiple devices to
   exchange their harvested energy, dynamic energy trading (DET) is
   introduced to improve the energy supply reliability and performance of
   wireless powered communication networks. This article provides an
   overview of the possible architecture and functional components that
   enable DET in communication networks. Various design issues on how to
   implement DET in practice are discussed. An optimal policy is proposed
   for delay-tolerant wireless powered communication networks in which each
   wireless powered device can schedule its data transmission and energy
   trading operations according to current and future energy availability.
   Finally, some potential topics and challenges for future research are
   highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an adaptive medium access control (MAC)
   solution for a fully connected mobile ad hoc network (MANET), supporting
   homogeneous best-effort data traffic. The MAC scheme achieves
   consistently high network performance by adapting to the ever-varying
   network traffic load. Based on the detection of a current network load
   condition, nodes can make a switching decision between IEEE 802.11
   distributed coordination function (DCF) and dynamic time-division
   multiple access (D-TDMA), when the network traffic load reaches a
   threshold, referred to as MAC switching point. The adaptive MAC solution
   determines the MAC switching point to maximize network performance.
   Approximate and closed-form performance analytical models for both MAC
   protocols are established, which facilitate the computation of MAC
   switching point in a tractable way. Extensive analytical and simulation
   results demonstrate that the adaptive MAC solution provides consistently
   maximal network performance in the presence of traffic load dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study is done for optimizing antireflection coatings at

   The change in the differential slope efficiency was used to estimate the
   loss in the coatings. The lowest value achieved for a single layer
   coating was 5\% using aluminum oxide while a minimum value of
   reflectivity of 7 x 10(-4) was achieved with a double layer coating of
   zinc selenide and silicon dioxide. The coatings' quality was tested
   using scanning electron microscopy and tape test. The study provides a

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{91-97}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In classical adaptive control the parameters are assumed to be fixed or
   slowly time-varying. In order to facilitate parameter estimation/tuning
   it is desirable to have the set of admissible parameters lie in a convex
   set; if this set is not convex, a common trick is to replace it with its
   convex hull, but the adaptive control problem is challenging if
   stabilizability of the set of admissible parameters is lost. However,
   such a convexity assumption is an artifact of the approach to the
   problem, rather than an inherent constraint, since most logic-based and
   supervisory approaches to the problem make no such requirement. On the
   other hand, here we show that losing stabilizability on the convex hull
   of the set of admissible parameters plays an important role in the
   adaptive control of rapidly time-varying systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The structure, stability, and reorganization of lamella-forming block
   copolymer thin film surface topography ({''}islands{''} and ``holes{''})
   were studied under boundary conditions driving the formation of 0.5 L-0
   thick structures at short thermal annealing times. Self-consistent field
   theory predicts that the presence of one perfectly neutral surface
   renders 0.5 L-0 topography thermodynamically stable relative to 1 L-0
   thick features, in agreement with previous experimental observations.
   The calculated through-film structures match cross-sectional scanning
   electron micrographs, collectively demonstrating the pinning of edge
   dislocations at the neutral surface. Remarkably, near-neutral surface
   compositions exhibit 0.5 L-0 topography metastability upon extended
   thermal treatment, slowly transitioning to 1 L-0 islands or holes as
   evidenced by optical and atomic force microscopy. Surface restructuring
   is rationalized by invoking commensurability effects imposed by slightly
   preferential surfaces. The results described herein clarify the impact
   of interfacial interactions on block copolymer self-assembly and
   solidify an understanding of 0.5 L-0 topography, which is frequently
   used to determine neutral surface compositions of considerable
   importance to contemporary technological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Facing the spectrum supply-demand gap, heterogeneous network (HetNet) is
   a promising approach to achieve drastic gains in network coverage and
   capacity compared with macro-only networks, thus making it especially
   attractive to network operators. On the other hand, software-defined
   networking brings a number of advantages along with many challenges. One
   particular concern is on the resilience for in-band fashioned control
   plane. Existing approaches mainly rely on a local rerouting policy when
   performing the routing protection for the target sessions in
   software-defined networks. However, such a policy would potentially
   bring congestions in the neighbouring links of the failed one. To this
   end, we study a weighted cost-minimization problem, where the traffic
   load balancing and control-channel setup cost are jointly considered.
   Because this problem is NP-hard, we first propose a near-optimal Markov
   approximation-based approach for in-band-fashioned software-defined
   HetNets. We then extend our solution to an online case that handles a
   single-link failure. We also conduct theoretical analysis on the
   performance fluctuation due to the single-link failure. We finally carry
   out experiments by experimental simulation. The extensive numerical
   results show that the proposed algorithm has fast convergence and high
   efficiency in resource utilization.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method to extract dielectric material parameters from the
   anomalous phase response is theoretically investigated and
   experimentally verified. A microstrip resonance circuit that operates in
   the anomalous dispersion spectrum is constructed by employing the
   material sample as the substrate. This topology results in a strongly
   dispersive transmission phase having a slope opposite to the case in
   normal dispersion. This unique phase reversal property facilitates the
   detection of the resonance frequency with higher accuracy. Furthermore,
   since the transmission phase and magnitude in the anomalous dispersive
   region are related through Kramers-Kronig-like equations, one phase
   measurement is sufficient to completely characterize a dielectric
   material. Five known dielectric samples are characterized and the
   extracted parameters are compared with the known parameters. The
   extracted dielectric constants are found to be within a 10\% error
   range. The extracted resonant parameters are utilized in reconstructing
   the magnitude and phase spectra in off-resonance regions. The
   reconstructed and measured curves bear close resemblance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a technique to characterize and postcompensate for
   the dynamic nonlinearity exhibited by radio frequency (RF) receivers
   employed in passive intermodulation (PIM) and weakly nonlinear devices
   characterization (low gain compression of the order of 0.1 dB). The
   proposed technique begins by accurately characterizing the RF receiver's
   nonlinearity using two-tone and multitone stimuli with swept frequency
   spacing and input power level. Then, a pruned Volterra series-based
   postcompensation model is devised to mitigate the dynamic weak nonlinear
   distortions exhibited by the receiver. The technique was validated in
   two steps. First, the capacity of the postcompensation technique to
   separate the RF receiver's intermodulation from the device under test's
   intermodulation was assessed. Second, its capacity to postcompensate for
   the dynamic nonlinearity exhibited by the RF receiver and to enhance its
   spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) was assessed using digitally
   modulated stimuli. The application of the proposed technique reduced the
   third-order intermodulation (IMD3) of the RF receiver by an average of
   10 dB. This technique can significantly relax the requirements on
   duplexers and tone injection techniques used to enhance the accuracy of
   PIM measurements. Furthermore, the receiver's SFDR was extended by up to
   15 dB.}},

Abstract = {{A log-logistic model is developed to predict the probability of rupture
   (POR) given burst of a pressurized steel pipeline at a
   naturally-occurring part-through wall corrosion defect. The predictors
   of the model are the defect depth normalized by the pipe wall thickness
   and defect length normalized by the square root of the product of the
   pipe diameter and wall thickness. A set of 140 full-scale burst tests of
   corroded thin walled pipes are collected from the open literature to
   calibrate and validate the proposed POR model. The parameters of the POR
   model are evaluated using the maximum likelihood method. To facilitate
   deterministic defect assessments, a threshold POR of 0.35 is proposed
   such that defects with POR greater than or equal to 0.35 are designated
   as potential ruptures. The impact on the proposed POR model due to the
   measurement errors associated with defect sizes reported by the
   inspection tool is examined through sensitivity analyses. (C) 2016

Journal = {{METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Predicting Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is important for making new
   discoveries in the molecular mechanisms inside a cell. Traditionally,
   new PPIs are identified through biochemical experiments but such methods
   are labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming and technically
   ineffective due to high false positive rates. Sequence-based prediction
   is currently the most readily applicable and cost-effective method. It
   exploits known PPI Databases to construct classifiers for predicting
   unknown PPIs based only on sequence data without requiring any other
   prior knowledge. Among existing sequence based methods, most
   feature-based methods use exact sequence patterns with fixed length as
   features a constraint which is biologically unrealistic. SVM with
   Pairwise String Kernel renders better predicting performance. However it
   is difficult to be biologically interpretable since it is kernel-based
   where no concrete feature values are computed. Here we have developed a
   novel method WeMine-P2P to overcome these drawbacks. By assuming that
   the regions/sites that mediate PPI are more conserved, WeMine-P2P first
   discovers/locates the conserved sequence patterns in protein sequences
   in the form of Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs), allowing pattern
   variations with variable length. It then pairs up all APCs into a set of
   Co-Occurring APC (cAPC) pairs, and computes a cAPC-PPI score for each
   cAPC pair on all PPI pairs. It further constructs a feature vector
   composed of all cAPC pairs with their cAPC-PPI scores for each PPI pair
   and uses them for constructing a PPI predictor. Through 40 independent
   experiments, we showed that (1) WeMine-P2P outperforms the well-known
   algorithm, PIPE2, which also utilizes co-occurring amino acid sequence
   segments but does not allow variable lengths and pattern variations; (2)
   WeMine-P2P achieves satisfactory PPI prediction performance, comparable
   to the SVM-based methods particularly among unseen protein sequences
   with a potential reduction of feature dimension of 1280 x; (3) Unlike
   SVM-based methods, WeMine-P2P renders interpretable biological features
   from which we observed that co-occurring sequence patterns from the
   compositional bias regions are more discriminative. WeMine-P2P is
   extendable to predict other biosequence interactions such as Protein DNA
   interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   different developers collaborate on different bug reports that makes the

Abstract = {{Designing robust Doppler vector estimation strategies for use in
   plane-wave imaging schemes based on unfocused transmissions is a topic
   that has yet to be studied in depth. One potential solution is to use a
   multi-angle Doppler estimation approach that computes flow vectors via
   least-squares fitting, but its performance has not been established.
   Here, we investigated the efficacy of multi-angle Doppler vector
   estimators by: 1) comparing its performance with respect to the
   classical dual-angle (cross-beam) Doppler vector estimator and 2)
   examining the working effects of multi-angle Doppler vector estimators
   on flow visualization quality in the context of dynamic flow path
   rendering. Implementing Doppler vector estimators that use different
   combinations of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) steering angles, our
   analysis has compared the classical dual-angle Doppler method, a 5-Tx
   version of dual-angle Doppler, and various multi-angle Doppler
   configurations based on 3 Tx and 5 Tx. Two angle spans (10 degrees, 20
   degrees) were examined in forming the steering angles. In imaging
   scenarios with known flow profiles (rotating disk and straight-tube
   parabolic flow), the 3-Tx, 3-Rx and 5-Tx, 5-Rx multi-angle
   configurations produced vector estimates with smaller variability
   compared with the dual-angle method, and the estimation results were
   more consistent with the use of a 20 degrees angle span. Flow vectors
   derived from multi-angle Doppler estimators were also found to be
   effective in rendering the expected flow paths in both rotating disk and
   straight-tube imaging scenarios, while the ones derived from the
   dual-angle estimator yielded flow paths that deviated from the expected
   course. These results serve to attest that using multi-angle
   least-squares Doppler vector estimators, flow visualization can be
   consistently achieved.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate estimation of low blood velocities whose Doppler shifts span
   the wall filter cutoff, such as near the wall in recirculation or
   disturbed flow regions, is important for accurate mapping of velocities
   to achieve improved estimations of wall shear stress and turbulence,
   which are known risk factors for atherosclerosis and stroke. This paper
   presents the comparative benefit of increasing the number of receiver
   beams above three for an improved estimation of low 3-D velocities. The
   3-D crossbeam vector Doppler ultrasound configurations were studied in
   terms of the number of receiver beams, interbeam angle, and beam
   selection method (criterion for discriminating between tissue and blood
   Doppler signals) for a range of velocity orientations, which may prove
   useful in the design of a future 2-D array for vascular imaging. For
   maximum velocity resolution, a shallow gradient of low flow velocities
   up to 5 cm/s was generated across a large-diameter (2.46 cm) straight
   vessel. Data were acquired using a linear array rotated around the
   central transmit beam axis to generate three-to eight-receiver (3R-8R)
   configurations; the rotation of each configuration relative to the flow
   axis was used to mimic a broad range of velocity vector orientations.
   Accuracy and precision for >= 5 receivers were consistently better over
   all velocity orientations and for all selection methods. For a velocity
   magnitude of 2 cm/s, the best accuracy and precision in both magnitude
   and direction (similar to 21\% +/-13\%, <1 degrees +/-9 degrees,
   respectively) were seen with a 5R configuration using a weighted
   least-squares selection method. Asymmetry in the 5R configuration led to
   an improved accuracy and precision compared with that in symmetrical 6R
   and 8R configurations. The results demonstrated relatively little to no
   benefit from more than five receiver beams.}},

Abstract = {{As a major application domain of vascular ultrasound, the carotid artery
   has long been the subject of anthropomorphic phantom design. It is
   nevertheless not trivial to develop walled carotid phantoms that are
   compatible for use in integrative imaging of carotid wall motion and
   flow dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel phantom design protocol
   that can enable efficient fabrication of walled carotid bifurcation
   phantoms with: 1) high acoustic compatibility; 2) artery-like vessel
   elasticity; and 3) stenotic narrowing feature. Our protocol first
   involved direct fabrication of the vessel core and an outer mold using
   computer-aided design tools and 3-D printing technology; these built
   parts were then used to construct an elastic vessel tube through
   investment casting of a polyvinyl alcohol containing mixture, and an
   agar-gelatin tissue mimicking slab was formed around the vessel tube.
   For demonstration, we applied our protocol to develop a set of healthy
   and stenosed (25\%, 50\%, and 75\%) carotid bifurcation phantoms. Plane
   wave imaging experiments were performed on these phantoms using an
   ultrasound scanner with channel-level configurability. Results show that
   the wall motion dynamics of our phantoms agreed with pulse wave
   propagation in an elastic vessel (pulse wave velocity of 4.67 +/- 0.71
   m/s measured at the common carotid artery), and their flow dynamics
   matched the expected ones in healthy and stenosed bifurcation
   (recirculation and flow jet formation observed). Integrative imaging of
   vessel wall motion and blood flow dynamics in our phantoms was also
   demonstrated, from which we observed fluid-structure interaction
   differences between healthy and diseased bifurcation phantoms. These
   findings show that the walled bifurcation phantoms developed with our
   new protocol are useful in vascular imaging studies that individually or
   jointly assess wall motion and flow dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{RF sputtered, aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al orAZO) is an attractive
   candidate material as transparent conductive oxides in the fabrication
   of opto-electronic devices. High electrical conductivity and optical
   transparency are two key requirements in such applications. This paper
   reports on the formation of AZO films on glass substrates in an
   RF-sputtering chamber modified to facilitate in situ heating during
   deposition. The influence of chamber pressure, RF power, and deposition
   temperature has been systematically studied and the electrical
   parameters such as film resistivity, carrier concentration, carrier
   mobility as well as optical transmission have been analyzed. Film
   deposition at 250 degrees C and a low chamber pressure of 0.5 mT
   resulted in a very low resistivity of 2.94 x 10(-4) ohm cm. The
   structural properties of the films with the lowest resistivity have been
   further analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and PL measurements and are
   compared with the film deposited at room temperature. The XRD results
   show dominant peaks along (103) orientation for the AZO films with
   slightly improved crystal quality at higher temperature. Evolution of
   near band edge and deep level emission photoluminescence peaks also
   indicate improvement in crystal structure with increased deposition

Abstract = {{In this paper we study charging schemes for bandwidth or server usage
   under the processor sharing discipline. Specifically, we analyze
   post-payment and pre-payment (or payment on arrival) schemes in three
   charging frameworks: fixed-rate charging, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves based
   charging, and congestion based charging for users with logarithmic
   utilities. We show that in the absence of QoS constraints, the network
   operator can earn unbounded profits and thus there is a need to devise
   schemes where users are only charged if they are given a minimum rate.
   We obtain explicit characterizations for mean user payments and the
   operator's mean revenue for these frameworks. We also analyze charge
   volatility via the second moments of the above implementations of
   arrival-based payments and post-payments. The volatility reflects the
   confidence in mean revenue for the operator and expected charges for a
   user. We present conditions under which a pre-payment mechanism is
   preferable over a post-payment mechanism. We also show that the same
   analysis can be applied to a scenario with admission control where each
   entering user is guaranteed a minimum service rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel platform to prepare small and uniformly
   distributed metal nanoparticles (MNPs) on cellulose nanocrystals for use
   as high performance sustainable nanocatalysts. The model platinum or
   palladium NPs (1-2 nm in size) were immobilized and chemically reduced
   onto melamine-formaldehyde (MF) coated cellulose nanocrystals (MFCNCs).
   The MF coating was critical for the uniform generation and size-control
   of MNPs. The contribution of MF resin to optimal MNP synthesis includes:
   (1) increased surface area with its spongelike structure, (2) enhanced
   affinity to metals through chelation with nitrogen functionalities, and
   (3) effective MNP size control due to the mesoporous structure. The
   MNP/MFCNC system significantly improved catalytic activity as
   demonstrated by the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with Pd/MFCNCs with a
   turnover frequency of 3168 h(-1). Our synthesis does not require any
   complicated apparatus or harsh reaction conditions. The proposed
   strategy is well-suited for the synthesis of a wide range of metal

   visualize the diffusion phenomenon and calculate the effective diffusion
   coefficient of heavy metal ions in hydrogel beads by monitoring the
   fluorescence-quenching dynamics of Au@BSA NCs upon binding with mercury

Abstract = {{Hydrogen is an important commodity in the processing of intermediate
   bitumen products into a finished petroleum product and for upgrading
   bitumen into synthetic crude. With the continued extraction of
   bitumen-rich material from Alberta's oil sands project, there is an
   opportunity to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of upgrading and
   refining operations by using electrolytically produced hydrogen in place
   of hydrogen produced by steam methane reformation. Recently, a bitumen
   upgrading facility had been proposed for the city of Sarnia, Ontario
   because of its pre-existing petroleum processing infrastructure. Using
   the Ontario electrical system, which has a lower emissions factor than
   Alberta, the use of electrolytic hydrogen could result in a significant
   reduction of greenhouse gasses. In this paper, the objective is to
   determine an optimal system configuration for reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions while maintaining a low system cost. The analysis is performed
   with General Algebraic Modelling System tool, a mixed-integer linear
   optimization in addition to a simple model in Visual Basic. For each
   case, an economic and environmental analysis is performed including the
   use of cap-and-trade values for the price of carbon emissions, which are
   applied to determine the overall economic impact of the emissions
   reductions. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the unsteady development of multi-plume sprays has been
   investigated by large eddy simulations with Eulerian-Lagrangian
   multiphase approach for both global spray characteristics and local flow
   features. Multi-plume sprays are injected at the injection pressures of
   10 MPa and 15 MPa, and the temperature of T-s = 297.65 K into the
   ambient air at the atmospheric pressure and temperature of T-a = 293.15
   K. Experimentally obtained global multi-plume spray characteristics in
   terms of spray shape and penetration are used to validate the present
   numerical simulations. The present numerical predictions for Sauter mean
   diameter and its temporal variation agree well with the empirical
   correlations. The predicted droplet size distribution evolves temporally
   and spatially, and exhibits bimodal distribution, until eventually the
   mode for small droplet sizes dominates. The spray plumes are found to
   have limited interaction due to the relatively large orientation angles
   between the plumes. Because of the momentum transfer from the liquid to
   gas phase, spray-induced air jets appear in the multi-plume sprays.
   Using vorticity, pressure, and lambda(2) - criterion fields, it is shown
   that the spray-induced air jets form similar vortical structures as
   single phase jets. Similarities between the spray-induced air jets and
   single phase jets in terms of the shear layer vortical structures such
   as hairpin-like vortices improves our understanding of the entrainment
   and mixing processes in multi-plume sprays. Copyright (C) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Inferring the size distribution of aerosolized fractal aggregates from
   the angular distribution of elastically scattered light is a
   mathematically ill-posed problem. This paper presents a procedure for
   analyzing Wide-Angle Light Scattering (WALS) data using Bayesian
   inference. The outcome is probability densities for the recovered size
   distribution and aggregate morphology parameters. This technique is
   applied to both synthetic data and experimental data collected on
   soot-laden aerosols, using a measurement equation derived from
   Rayleigh-Debye-Gans fractal aggregate (RDG-FA) theory. In the case of
   experimental data, the recovered aggregate size distribution parameters
   are generally consistent with TEM-derived values, but the accuracy is
   impaired by the well-known limited accuracy of RDG-FA theory. Finally,
   we show how this bias could potentially be avoided using the
   approximation error technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ammonium nitrogen recovery using natural zeolite from the permeates of
   anaerobic membrane bioreactors was investigated with batch and
   continuous experiments. Regeneration of exhausted zeolite was compared
   between mechanical shaking and air stripping, and experimental results
   showed the superiority of air stripping over the shaking. Liquid
   circulation and air flow rates were optimized in a continuous
   zeolite-packed column with a separate recovery system consisting of a
   regeneration chamber and a stripping column. The liquid circulation rate
   had significant effect neither on the regeneration efficiency ( RE) nor
   the ammonia transfer efficiency ( ATE), while the ATE significantly
   increased with increasing air flow rate. The effect of pH on ammonia
   recovery was also tested and the results showed that both RE and ATE
   significantly improved at alkaline pH. When pH increased from 9.5 to 12,
   the RE increased from 9.2\% to 84\% and the ATE increased from 54\% to
   92\%. The results emphasized that the pH should be higher than 11 for
   efficient regeneration and recovery of ammonia. The preliminary economic
   analysis showed the superiority of the alkaline regeneration-air

Abstract = {{Managed aquifer recharge ( MAR) with reclaimed water is an important
   water reuse application. As an intentional way of recharging water into
   aquifers, MAR can be used to address water shortages and contribute to
   sustainable water resources management practices. The establishment of a
   MAR system depends on the source of recharge water, the selection of a
   recharge method and site, the type of water treatment system, and the
   ultimate purpose of recovered water, and these components are closely
   related and integrated. However, at present, detailed regulations or
   guidelines that specifically guide MAR with reclaimed water are
   unavailable in most countries. The complexity of MAR systems and the
   lack of a sophisticated regulatory framework increase the difficulties
   of MAR implementation. This review provides an introduction to MAR with
   reclaimed water and a comparison of current worldwide water reuse
   regulations or guidelines, including a proposed approach for MAR
   implementation. An analysis of selected MAR with reclaimed water case
   studies was also done within the context of this proposed approach. This
   paper recommends the development of specific regulatory or design
   criteria, including a complete quantitative risk assessment framework
   for the evaluation and operation of MAR systems.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{435-445}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the total energy requirements associated with the
   production of bitumen from oil sands and its upgrading to synthetic
   crude oil (SCO) are modeled and quantified. The production scheme
   considered is based on the commercially applied steam assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) for bitumen extraction and delayed coking for bitumen
   upgrading. In addition, the model quantifies the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions associated with the production of energy required for these
   operations from technologies utilized in the currently existing oil
   sands energy infrastructure. The model is based on fundamental
   engineering principles, and Aspen HYSYS and Aspen Plus simulations. The
   energy demand results are expressed in terms of heat, power, hydrogen,
   and process fuel consumption rates for SAGD extraction and bitumen
   upgrading. Based on the model's output, a range of overall energy and
   emission intensity factors are estimated for a bitumen production rate
   of 112,500 BPD (or 93,272 BPD of SCO), which were determined to be
   262.5-368.5 MJ/GJ(SCO) and 14.17-19.84 gCO(2)/MJ(SCO), respectively. The
   results of the model indicate that the majority of GHG emissions are
   generated during SAGD extraction (up to 60\% of total emissions) due to
   the combustion of natural gas for steam production, and the steam-to-oil
   ratio is a major parameter affecting total GHG emissions. The developed
   model can be utilized as a tool to predict the energy demand
   requirements for integrated SAGD/upgrading projects under different
   operating conditions, and provides guidance on the feasibility of
   lowering GHG emissions associated with their operation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The edge formability of ferritic-martensitic DP (dual-phase) and
   ferritic-bainitic CP (complex-phase) steels was evaluated using a hole
   expansion test for different edge conditions. Hole expansion tests
   involving the standard conical punch as well as a custom flat punch were
   performed to investigate formability when the hole is expanded
   out-of-plane (conical punch) and in-plane using the flat punch. A range
   of edge conditions were considered, in order to isolate the influence of
   a range of factors thought to influence edge formability. The results
   demonstrate that work hardening and void damage at the sheared edge
   govern formability, while the sheared surface quality plays a minor or
   secondary role. A comparison of the edge stretching limits of DP and CP
   steels demonstrates the advantages of a ferritic-bainitic microstructure
   for forming operations with severe local deformation as in a
   stretch-flanging operation. A comparison of a traditional DP780 steel
   with a CP steel of similar strength showed that the edge stretching
   limit of the CP steel was three times larger than that of the DP780.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concludes a two-part investigation of a novel architecture
   for vibration energy harvesting (VEH), the springless VEH. In this part,
   we study vertical springless electromagnetic VEHs where the direction of
   motion is aligned with the gravitational field. Experimental results
   show the existence of three topologies in the response of vertical
   springless VEHs; linear, single-impact, and double-impact. A model,
   encompassing all three topologies, was developed and validated by
   comparison to experimental results. We found that vertical springless
   VEHs demonstrate low frequency harvesting (<20 Hz), widebeand harvesting
   (bandwidths up to BW = 11.2 Hz), and an optimal output power of P = 7.52
   mW at a base acceleration of 0.6 g. While horizontal springless VEHs
   typically offer more output power, the single-impact regime of the
   vertical springless VEHs offers the simultaneous advantages of wider
   harvesting bandwidths at lower operating frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel architecture for wideband and low-frequency vibration
   energy harvesting (VEH). Springless vibration energy harvesters (SVEH)
   employ impact oscillators as energy harvesting elements. A seismic mass
   moves along a linear guide limited by stoppers at both ends of the
   track. An electromagnetic transducer converts the kinetic energy
   captured by the mass into electrical energy. Experiments using
   prototypes of the horizontal SVEH demonstrated low frequency harvesting
   (<20 Hz), wideband harvesting (up to 6.0 Hz), and an optimal rectified
   output power of P = 12 mW for a base acceleration amplitude of 0.5 g. A
   model of the electromagnetic SVEH was developed and validated
   experimentally. A figure of merit was defined to quantify realizable
   output power in linear and nonlinear VEHs. Comparison using this figure

Abstract = {{The impact process and the consequent two-phase interaction for a

   are investigated using large eddy simulation with Eulerian/Lagrangian
   multiphase approach, and the lambda (2) criterion is used to visualize
   the temporal and spatial evolution of the vortical structures in the gas
   field. It is shown that before the impact a leading tip vortex ring is
   followed by smaller vortex rings in the quasi-steady region of the
   starting jet while the vortical structures inside the spray plumes known
   as spray-induced air jets are formed. After the impact the leading tip
   vortex ring and the following rings as well as spray-induced air jet
   vortices start to deform and eventually break down into smaller
   elongated vortex filaments. Unlike the injection of multi-plume sprays
   into the core of a steady cross flow gas jet, spray droplets are
   dispersed in a larger volume in all directions when impacted by the
   starting gas jet, beneficial for two-phase mixing enhancement. A pair of
   vortex rings is also observed merging into a new ring before reaching
   the impact zone.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand biofiltration, concentration profiles of various
   natural organic matter (NOM) components throughout a pilot-scale
   drinking water biofilter were investigated using liquid chromatography
   organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence excitation and
   emission matrices (FEEM). Over a 2 month period, water samples were
   collected from six ports at different biofilter media depths. Results
   showed substantial removal of biopolymers (i.e. high molecular weight
   (MW) NOM components as characterized by LC-OCD) and FEEM protein-like
   materials, but low removal of humic substances, building blocks and low
   MW neutrals and low MW acids. For the first time, relative
   biodegradability of different NOM components characterized by LC-OCD and
   FEEM approaches were investigated across the entire MW range and for
   different fluorophore compositions, in addition to establishing the
   biodegradation kinetics. The removal kinetics for FEEM protein-like
   materials were different than for the LC-OCD-based biopolymers,
   illustrating the complementary nature of the LC-OCD and FEEM approaches.
   LC-OCD biopolymers (both organic carbon and organic nitrogen) and FEEM
   protein-like materials were shown to follow either first or second order
   biodegradation kinetics. Due to the low percent removal and small number
   of data points, the performance of three kinetic models was not
   distinguishable for humic substances. Pre-filtration of samples for FEEM
   analyses affected the removal behaviours and/or kinetics especially of
   protein-like materials which was attributed to the removal of the
   colloidal/particulate materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Prior work has addressed the effects of multipath fading and path loss
   separately for broadcast and multiple-access channels. It has been shown
   that the number of simultaneously active users are of the order for
   random channel gains with exponentially-decaying tails, where n is the
   total number of users. Furthermore, it has been shown that assuming path
   loss is dominant and ignoring multipath fading, the user capacity (i.e.
   the maximum number of simultaneously active users in a wireless system)
   of multi-user channels is of the order when the users are spatially
   distributed on the plane with a Gaussian or Uniform distribution. In
   this paper, we study the shadowing effects on the number of active users
   for broadcast and multiple-access channels in which the users are
   randomly distributed on the plane. It is shown that as the total number
   of users in the multi-user channel goes to infinity, the number of
   active users is of the order Theta (root In(n)).}},

Abstract = {{Rainwater-harvesting tanks (reservoirs) in Tamil Nadu, India support
   agricultural livelihoods, mitigate water insecurity, and enable
   ecosystem services. However, many tanks have fallen into disrepair, as
   private wells have supplanted collectively managed tanks as the dominant
   irrigation source. Meanwhile, encroachment by peri-urban development,
   landless farmers, and Prosopis juliflora has reduced inflow and tank
   capacity. This exploratory study presents a conceptual framework and
   proposed indicator set for measuring water security in the context of
   rainwater harvesting tanks. The primary benefits of tanks and threats to
   their functionality are profiled as a precursor to construction of a
   causal network of water security. The causal network identifies the key
   components, causal linkages, and outcomes of water security processes,
   and is used to derive a suite of indicators that reflect the multiple
   economic and socio-ecological uses of tanks. Recommendations are
   provided for future research and data collection to operationalize the
   indicators to support planning and assessing the effectiveness of tank
   rehabilitation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, efforts have been made to reconcile theoretical
   security with realistic imperfect implementations of quantum key
   distribution. Implementable countermeasures are proposed to patch the
   discovered loopholes. However, certain countermeasures are not as robust
   as would be expected. In this paper, we present a concrete example of ID
   Quantique's random-detector-efficiency countermeasure against detector
   blinding attacks. As a third-party tester, we have found that the first
   industrial implementation of this countermeasure is effective against
   the original blinding attack, but not immune to a modified blinding
   attack. Then, we implement and test a later full version of this
   countermeasure containing a security proof. We find that it is still
   vulnerable against the modified blinding attack, because an assumption
   about hardware characteristics on which the proof relies fails in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Planning and scheduling are challenging processes, particularly for
   projects with continuously evolving requirements and constraints such as
   design-build and turnkey projects. In the literature, schedule
   optimization models can only handle predefined activities and fixed
   constraints. To better support dynamic projects, this paper proposes a
   flexible constraint programming (CP) framework that optimizes schedules
   both at the early planning stage and immediately before construction. At
   the early planning stage, the model selects among alternative network
   paths and construction methods to determine the most suitable work
   packages for the project. Later as more constraints become refined, the
   optimization model helps to meet the persistent milestones, deadlines,
   and resource limits, using a variety of activity-crashing strategies
   without changing the committed construction methods. Experimenting with
   a case study proved the flexibility of the model, its unique support for
   planning, and its ability to consider evolving project constraints. The
   proposed model contributes to developing automated decision support
   systems for cost effectively meeting the evolving schedule constraints.}},

Title = {{Flexible Activity Relations to Support Optimum Schedule Acceleration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In construction schedules, a logical relationship between two activities
   is specified by the relationship type and a fixed lag time. This rigid
   representation, however, does not consider the situation when two
   activities have a degree of flexibility in their relationship. Such
   flexibility, or soft relation, can be very beneficial as it provides a
   range of overlapping options that can be utilized in situations that
   require the schedule to be optimally accelerated. This paper thus
   proposes a formalization of a generic logical relationship (hard or
   soft) of any type (finish-to-start, etc.) between any two activities.
   Using the generic representation, modified activity start and finish
   time computations are presented to accommodate the overlaps associated
   with soft relations, and are used in a schedule-crashing model. The
   model determines the optimum combination of activity crashing and
   overlapping decisions that minimizes project cost without violating the
   resource constraints. The new activity relationship and crashing model
   are beneficial to both researchers and practitioners as they facilitate
   schedule optimization decisions for projects that exercise a good level
   of overlapping, such as fast-track projects.}},

Abstract = {{Flow cytometry is an efficient monitoring tool for rapid cell counting,
   and can be applied to research on water quality and treatment. In this
   study, a method that employs flow cytometry and a natural microbial
   inoculum to determine assimilable organic carbon (AOC) was adapted for
   use with challenging surface waters that have a high organic and
   particle content, and subsequently applied in a long term river water
   study. AOC method optimization showed that river water bacteria could
   pass through a 0.2 mu m membrane filter, and therefore membrane
   filtration combined with heat treatment was required for sample
   sterilization. Preparation of the natural river inoculum with an
   acceptable yield value could only be achieved when grown using the
   natural water source, since growth was limited on different types of
   inorganic minimal media and in natural spring water, The resulting flow
   cytometry AOC method was reliable and reproducible, and results were
   comparable to the standard plate count AOC method. Size exclusion
   chromatography showed that both high and low molecular weight organic
   matter fractions were utilized by the natural AOC inoculum. Flow
   cytometry was used to measure both AOC levels and total cell counts in a
   long term study to monitor the water quality of a river which was used
   as a drinking water source. The method could distinguish between high
   nucleic acid (HNA) and low nucleic acid (LNA) groups of bacteria, and
   HNA bacteria were found to respond faster than LNA bacteria to seasonal
   changes in nutrients and water temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A novel hybrid medium access control protocol for inter-M2M
   communications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{77-88}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A scalable medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for
   machine-type devices to access the channel simultaneously in a
   machine-to-machine (M2M) network. There can be two types of scenarios in
   an M2M network. First, where the M2M devices communicate with the base
   station one-by-one, and second, where the M2M devices directly
   communicate with each other within a group or cluster without any human
   intervention (Inter-M2M communication). Considering the second type of
   scenario, the devices can use basic contention or reservation-based MAC
   protocols. But with such a large number of M2M devices, adaptability,
   and scalability become bottlenecks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
   a novel scalable hybrid-MAC protocol, which combines the benefits of
   both contention-based and reservation-based medium access schemes. We
   assume that the contention and reservation portion of M2M devices is a
   frame structure, which mainly has two parts: contention interval (CI)
   and data transmission interval (DTI). The devices contend for the
   channel access during CI. After contention, the successful devices win
   time-slots and transmit data packets during DTI. In our proposed
   hybrid-MAC scheme, each M2M device is IEEE 802.11 DCF enabled, and
   within each time slot during DTI, the devices share data with each
   other. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed
   hybrid-MAC protocol performs better than slotted-ALOHA, p-persistent
   CSMA, and TDMA in terms of aggregate throughput, average transmission
   delay, channel utility, and energy consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Safety and Traffic Implications of Differential Car and Truck Speed
   Controls for Two-Lane Highways}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Differential car/truck speed limits have been used to enhance road
   safety and increase the fuel efficiency of trucks. For two-lane
   highways, the safety of these differential speed controls could be
   affected by possible changes in the pattern of car and truck
   interactions and their associated crash risks, especially as it pertains
   to overtaking. In this paper, a microscopic simulation model is
   presented that assesses the safety and traffic implications of
   differential car/truck speed limits for two-lane highway operations,
   with emphasis on the overtaking maneuver. Three speed control strategies
   are considered: uniform posted speed limits (USLs), differential posted
   car-truck speed limits (DSLs), and differential mandated truck speed
   limits (MSLs). Mandated limits involve the use of on-board truck
   limiters or governors with preset maximum thresholds. The results from
   several simulation tests suggest that DSLs and MSLs reduce the average
   travel speed (ATS) of the traffic stream. DSL and MSL controls were
   found to slightly increase head-on time-to-collision (TTC) and
   percentage time spent following (PTSF). The total number of overtakes
   was found to increase slightly for DSL and MSL controls compared to
   USLs. While the number of car-truck overtakes increased significantly
   for DSLs and MSLs, the number of car-car overtakes resulted in a
   significant decrease. It was concluded that three measures of ATS, TTC,
   and car-car overtaking positively impacted safety, while PTSF,
   car-truck, and total number of overtakes negatively impacted safety
   because of differential speed limit controls.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrating screens are a widely applied form of particle separations. In
   spite of this significance, their understanding is still an obstacle.
   Three approaches were used to characterize the flow of granular material
   in a linear vibrating screen. The statistical model, mass action, and
   kinetic model based on conservation of momentum were derived.
   Experiments were then conducted on a multi-sized prototype screen and
   glass beads of sizes 0.75, 1, 2, 3 mm. Deck inclinations were varied
   over 7.5,12.5, and 17.5 degrees, and frequencies over 7, 15, and 20 Hz.
   A total of 72 feed batches and a constant power of 50 W was used. The
   experimental data was then used to validate the models. The three models
   provided accurate flow prediction over the screens. Additionally, the
   kinetic model also provided a basis for optimal design of the screening
   unit operation, by allowing manipulation of seven design variables to
   obtain a 95-100\% efficient vibrating screen. (c) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Multi-anode microbial electrochemical cells (MxCs) are considered as one
   of the most promising configurations for scale-up of MxCs, but
   understanding of anode kinetics in multiple anodes is limited in the
   MxCs. In this study we assessed microbial community and electrochemical
   kinetic parameters for bio-films on individual anodes in a multi-anode
   MxC to better comprehend anode fundamentals. Microbial community
   analysis targeting 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing showed that Geobacter
   genus was abundant (87\%) only on the biofilm anode closest to a
   reference electrode (low ohmic energy loss) in which current density was
   the highest among three anodes. In comparison, Geobacter populations
   were less than 1\% for biofilms on other two anodes distant from the
   reference electrode (high ohmic energy loss), generating small current
   density. Half-saturation anode potential (E-KA) was the lowest at -0.251
   to -0.242 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode) for the closest biofilm
   anode to the reference electrode, while E-KA was as high as -0.134 V for
   the farthest anode. Our study proves that electric potential of
   individual anodes changed by ohmic energy loss shifts biofilm
   communities on individual anodes and consequently influences electron
   transfer kinetics on each anode in the multi-anode MxC. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Localization and tracking of resources on construction jobsites are an
   emerging area where the location of materials, labor, and equipment is
   used to estimate productivity, measure project's progress and/or enhance
   jobsite safety. GPS has been widely used for outdoor tracking of
   construction operations. However, GPS is not suitable for indoor
   applications due to the lack of signal coverage; particularly inside
   tunnels or buildings. Several indoor localization research studies had
   been attempted, however such developments rely heavily on extensive
   external communication network infrastructures. These developments also
   are susceptible to electromagnetic interference in noisy construction
   jobsites. This paper presents indoor localization system using a
   microcontroller equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The
   IMU contains a cluster of sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope and
   magnetometer. The microcontroller uses a direct cosine matrix algorithm
   to fuse sensors data and calculate non-gravitational acceleration using
   nine-degrees-of-freedom motion equations. Current position is calculated
   based on measured acceleration and heading, while accounting for growing
   error in speed estimation utilizing jerk integration algorithm.
   Experimental results are presented to illustrate the relative
   effectiveness of the developed system, which is able to operate
   independently of any external aids and visibility conditions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Automating dimensional compliance control and progress tracking using
   computer vision has been identified as a central opportunity for
   improvement in the construction industry. Current 3D imaging sensors
   provide massive amounts of spatial data that remain underutilized due to
   the prohibitively time-consuming manual process of extracting usable
   information. Desired information is typically centered on a specific
   object of interest within 3D images, so there is a need for construction
   specific object recognition processes. In this paper, we present an
   automated method for locating and extracting pipe spools in cluttered
   point cloud scans. The method is based on local data level curvature
   estimation, clustering, and bag-of-features matching. Experimental
   results from two point clouds containing pipe spool objects demonstrate
   the method's ability to successfully extract spools from cluttered
   scenes as well as differentiate between similar spools in a single

   the P (1) hcp (fiber (and relatively weak B (fiber ) textures. The
   analyses of macro- and microtextures showed that the presence of
   nanosized Al2O3 particles activated the pyramidal slip system in
   addition to dominant prism, basal and pyramidal slip systems which
   normally govern plastic deformation during FSP of commercially pure

Abstract = {{Fast protection of distribution substation based on traveling wave is
   becoming a reality today. The transient traveling wave is mostly used in
   protection to determine the faulted line and the fault location. The
   advantages of signal of traveling wave includes immunity to system
   oscillation, transition resistance, CT saturation, and neutral point
   operation modes. In this article, a detailed study for analyzing the
   performance of using WLAN for real time protection based on the
   transient traveling wave. The high sampling frequency needed for
   traveling wave causes blockage in communication in the process bus. Now
   a packing of multi samples with suitable compression techniques in
   Merging Unit (MU), or using feature extraction with Hilbert-Huang
   transform with WLAN compliance with IEC 61850 has been tested. Further,
   this article presents the modeling and simulation of a WLAN
   communication network for an automation system using the precepts of IEC
   61850, which is currently becoming a trend in Substation Automation
   System (SAS) specification. This article also investigates the impact of
   impulsive and interface noise on WLAN performance. Finally, the article
   advocates the wide application of traveling waves in the digital

Title = {{Comparison of fatigue behavior in Mg/Mg similar and Mg/steel dissimilar
   refill friction stir spot welds}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{78-86}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mg/Mg similar and Mg/steel dissimilar spot welds were produced using
   refill friction stir spot welding. For comparison, the Mg/Mg and
   Mg/steel welds were evaluated in terms of microstructures, microchemical
   analysis, interfacial reactions, tensile-shear and fatigue fracture.
   Acceptable Mg/steel dissimilar spot weld strength can be obtained by
   plunging the sleeve to a depth 0.05 mm above the Mg/steel interface. The
   presence of a 10 mu m zinc coating on the DP600 steel surface is
   beneficial to the bond formation between Mg/steel sheets, which also
   contributes to brazing outside the weld boundary. Hence, this increases
   the bonded area for Mg/steel welds compared to Mg/Mg spot welds.
   Consequently, Mg/steel dissimilar welds exhibit superior overlap shear
   static and fatigue behavior compared to Mg/Mg similar spot welds. When
   stress P-max <= 51450 N, all of the welds fractured at the Mg parent
   sheet. Most fatigue fractures in Mg/steel welds occurred at the sheet
   interface, however when 1087 N <= P-max <= 1812 N, Mg/steel welds
   occasionally fractured through the Mg parent sheet. When the fatigue
   fracture propagation occurred through the parent Mg sheet in Mg/steel
   welds, superior fatigue behavior is observed and attributed to zinc
   brazing at the surrounding weld interface. The SEM and fracture analysis
   show that fatigue cracks at the parent Mg sheet initiated from multiple
   sites located at the Mg side and then propagated into the base material.

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{As multi-core systems are becoming more popular in real-time embedded
   systems, strict timing requirements for accessing shared resources must
   be met. In particular, a detailed latency analysis for double data rate
   dynamic RAM (DDR DRAM) is highly desirable. Several researchers have
   proposed predictable memory controllers to provide guaranteed memory
   access latency. However, the performance of such controllers sharply
   decreases as DDR devices become faster and the width of memory buses is
   increased. High-performance commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) memory
   controllers in general-purpose systems employ open row policy to improve
   average case access latencies and memory throughput, but the use of such
   policy is not compatible with existing real-time controllers. In this
   article, we present a new memory controller design together with a
   novel, composable worst case analysis for DDR DRAM that provides
   improved latency bounds compared to existing works by explicitly
   modeling the DRAM state. In particular, our approach scales better with
   increasing memory speed by predictably taking advantage of shorter
   latency for access to open DRAM rows. Furthermore, it can be applied to
   multi-rank devices, which allow for increased access parallelism. We
   evaluate our approach based on worst case analysis bounds and simulation
   results, using both synthetic tasks and a set of realistic benchmarks.
   In particular, benchmark evaluations show up to 45 \% improvement in
   worst case task execution time compared to a competing predictable
   memory controller for a system with 16 requestors and one rank.}},

Title = {{Characterization and assessment of an enhanced CuY catalyst for

Abstract = {{Chloride-free CuY catalysts containing different oxidation states of Cu
   are prepared via three methods, namely, liquid-phase ion exchange,
   incipient wetness impregnation and a combined procedure of ion exchange
   and Cu(NO3)(2) impregnation. The objective is to develop effective
   catalysts for converting methanol to dimethyl carbonate through the
   oxidative carbonylation process. Microstructures and chemical
   compositions of as-produced samples are characterized by analytic
   chemistry methods such as temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen
   (H-2-TPR), diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectroscopy (DIRFT)
   of CO adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic activities of
   as-produced samples are found to be distinct and associated with the
   oxidation states and locations of Cu2+/Cut The catalyst prepared by
   liquid-phase ion exchange contains Cu+ and Cu2+ in the smallcage and
   exhibits a low catalytic activity. The catalyst prepared by incipient
   wetness impregnation contains dispersed CuO (as the major Cu species)
   and Cu2+ in the sodalite units or hexagonal prisms (41\% of the total Cu
   amount) and shows an improved catalytic performance. The catalyst
   prepared by the combined procedure contains an even greater amount of
   active CuO and Cu2+/Cu+ in the supercage and exhibits the best
   performance. It is concluded that Cu2+/Cu located in the supercage is
   the desired active center for oxidative carbonylation of methanol to
   produce dimethyl carbonate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{143-155}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A single-frame grid-noise removal technique was developed for
   application in single-frame digital-moire 3D shape measurement. The
   ability of the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to prevent oscillation
   artifacts near discontinuities, and the ability of the Fourier transform
   (FFT) applied to wavelet coefficients to separate grid-noise from useful
   image information, were combined in a new technique, SWT-FFT, to remove
   grid-noise from moire-pattern images generated by digital moire. In
   comparison to previous grid-noise removal techniques in moire, SWT-FFT
   avoids the requirement for mechanical translation of optical components
   and capture of multiple frames, to enable single-frame moire-based
   measurement. Experiments using FFT, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT),
   DWT-FFT, and SWT-FFT were performed on moire-pattern images containing
   grid noise, generated by digital moire, for several test objects.
   SWT-FFT had the best performance in removing high-frequency grid-noise,
   both straight and curved lines, minimizing artifacts, and preserving the
   moire pattern without blurring and degradation. SWT-FFT also had the
   lowest noise amplitude in the reconstructed height and lowest roughness
   index for all test objects, indicating best grid-noise removal in
   comparison to the other techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new approach for modification of polyamid thin film composite membrane
   PA(TFC) using synthesized ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was shown to
   enhance the membrane performances for reverse osmosis water
   desalination. First, active layer of synthesis PA(TFC) membrane was
   activated with an aqueous solution of free radical graft polymerization
   of hydrophilic methacrylic acid (MAA) monomer onto the surface of the
   PA(TFC) membrane resulting PMAA-g-PA(TFC). Second, the PA(TFC) membrane
   has been developed by incorporation of ZnO NPs into the MAA grafting
   solution resulting the ZnO NPs modified PMAA-g-PA(TFC) membrane. The
   surface properties of the synthesized nanoparticles and prepared
   membranes were investigated using the FTIR, XRD and SEM. Morphology
   studies demonstrated that ZnO NPs have been successfully incorporated
   into the active grafting layer over PA(TFC) composite membranes. The
   zinc leaching from the ZnO NPs modified PMAA-g-PA(TFC) was minimal, as
   shown by batch tests that indicated stabilization of the ZnO NPs on the
   membrane surfaces. Compared with the a pure PA(TFC) and PMAA-g-PA(TFC)
   membranes, the ZnO NPs modified PMAA-g-PA(TFC) was more hydrophilic,
   with an improved water contact angle (similar to 50 +/- 3 degrees) over
   the PMAA-g-PA(TFC) (63 +/- 2.5 degrees). The ZnO NPs modified
   PMAA-g-PA(TFC) membrane showed salt rejection of 97\% (of the total
   groundwater salinity), 99\% of dissolved bivalent ions (Ca2+, SO42- and
   Mg2+), and 98\% of mono valent ions constituents (Cl- and Na+). In
   addition, antifouling performance of the membranes was determined using
   E. coli as a potential foulant. This demonstrates that the ZnO NPs
   modified PMAA-g-PA(TFC) membrane can significantly improve the membrane
   performances and was favorable to enhance the selectivity, permeability,
   water flux, mechanical properties and the bio-antifouling properties of
   the membranes for water desalination. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The impact of climate change on the behaviour of
   intensity-duration-frequency curves is critical to the estimation of
   design storms, and thus to the safe design of drainage infrastructure.
   The present study develops a regional time trend methodology that
   detects the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation from 1960
   to 2010. The regional time trend linear regression method is fitted to
   different durations of annual maximum precipitation intensities derived
   from multiple sites in Ontario, Canada. The results show the
   relationship between climate change and increased extreme precipitation
   in this province. The regional trend analysis demonstrates, under
   nonstationary conditions arising from climate change, that the intensity
   of extreme precipitation increased decennially between 1.25\% for the
   30-min storm and 1.82\% for the 24-h storm. A comparison of the results
   with a regional Mann-Kendall test validates the found regional
   time-trend results. The results are employed to extrapolate the
   intensity-duration-frequency curves temporally and spatially for future
   decades across the province. The results of the regional time trend
   assessment help with the establishment of new safety margins for
   infrastructure design in Ontario. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Mechanochromic polymers display detectable changes in their fluorescence
   emission upon deformation of their macromolecular structure. Here, we
   study reversible mechanochromism of pyrene functionalized nanocomposite
   hydrogels. Highly stretchable nanocomposite hydrogels are prepared by
   free radical polymerization of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and pyrene
   terminated poly(ethylene) glycol methacrylate copolymers in the presence
   of nanoclay, acting as the physical crosslinker. Mechanochromic behavior
   is characterized through uniaxial tensile experiments, where force,
   deformation, and fluorescence emission are simultaneously measured. To
   demonstrate the application of mechanochromic nanocomposite hydrogels in
   pressure sensing, membranes are used to detect differential pressures on
   the order of 10(2) Pa. We envision the integration of these
   mechanochromic hydrogels in the design of novel force and pressure
   sensors with application to mechanics, fluid dynamics, and biophysics.

Title = {{A New Time-varying Concept of Risk in a Changing Climate}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{In a changing climate arising from anthropogenic global warming, the
   nature of extreme climatic events is changing over time. Existing
   analytical stationary-based risk methods, however, assume
   multi-dimensional extreme climate phenomena will not significantly vary
   over time. To strengthen the reliability of infrastructure designs and
   the management of water systems in the changing environment,
   multidimensional stationary risk studies should be replaced with a new
   adaptive perspective. The results of a comparison indicate that current
   multi-dimensional stationary risk frameworks are no longer applicable to
   projecting the changing behaviour of multi-dimensional extreme climate
   processes. Using static stationary-based multivariate risk methods may
   lead to undesirable consequences in designing water system
   infrastructures. The static stationary concept should be replaced with a
   flexible multi-dimensional time-varying risk framework. The present
   study introduces a new multi-dimensional time-varying risk concept to be
   incorporated in updating infrastructure design strategies under changing
   environments arising from human-induced climate change. The proposed
   generalized time-varying risk concept can be applied for all stochastic
   multi-dimensional systems that are under the influence of changing
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Thermochemical properties and microstructures of layered aluminum (Al)
   and iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanothermite were investigated via
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for developing a new type
   of metastable intermolecular composites (MIC). The nanoparticles of Al
   and Fe2O3 were dispersed insolution and deposited separately on
   stainless steel electrodes by means of the electrophoretic deposition
   (EPD) process. These nanoparticles were dispersed and deposited without
   any surfactant and additive, which eliminates potential contaminates in
   products. In order to produce layered structures, nanoparticles were
   deposited in a sequence which promotes effective bonding between two
   different types of nanoparticles. SEM images demonstrate a layered
   structure with the intimate contact between Al and Fe2O3. DSC data was
   collected to characterize the onset temperature and energy release per
   unit mass from the layered composites with different molar ratios of
   Al/Fe2O3. It is revealed, based on the consistent onset temperatures
   from different composites, that the ignition of Al and Fe2O3 layers is
   closely associated with oxygen which is produced from thermal
   decomposition of Fe2O3. In addition, the thickness of the reaction zone
   is restricted by the diffusion length of oxygen across the
   layer-to-layer interface, which results in a varying degree of reaction
   completion within the composite and subsequently the distinct energy
   release values per unit mass. The decomposition of Fe2O3 nanoparticles,
   diffusion path of oxygen and interfacial contact between Al and Fe2O3
   layers are found to determine the energetic properties of layered
   thermite composites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{1082-1090}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The viscosity of a set of N-succinyl-chitosan (NSC) solutions was
   characterized near the 0.2 Pa s rheological injectability limit. This is
   believed to be the first such report in the open literature. Viscosity
   was characterized at physiological pH and ionic strength as a function
   of NSC degree of substitution, NSC concentration, temperature, and shear
   rate. NSC was synthesized via Yamaguci's method and characterized using
   HNMR, membrane osmometry, TGA and isothermal vacuum drying. NSC
   synthesis results were shown to fit a reproducible log-linear
   correlation and both optimum drying temperature and thermal
   decomposition temperature were found to be a function of NSC degree of
   substitution. Viscosity results were explained using Katchalsky's full
   model for polyampholyte ionization combined with a charge induced
   excluded volume model proposed by Higgs. The model predicted a
   polyelectrolyte/polyampholyte transition which agreed well with
   experimental data. For minimally injectable formulations a maximum in
   primary amine concentration is expected at 32 sub\% amine NSC. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Monomer reactivity ratios are important parameters used in
   copolymerization kinetics to predict the rate of polymerization,
   copolymer composition and monomer sequence length, and by extension,
   molecular weight and distribution of the final product. Batch aqueous
   solution copolymerizations of acrylic acid (AA) and itaconic acid (IA)
   are performed at various feed compositions. Polymerizations are
   categorized into low (<11 wt \%) conversion and higher (<30 wt \%)
   conversion data sets for analysis. Due to the limited solubility of IA
   in the reaction mixture, the feed composition of IA in all
   polymerizations is constrained to lower than 25 mol \%. Conversion is
   determined by gravimetric methods, and copolymer composition via H-1-NMR
   spectroscopy. All data are analyzed using the error-in-variables model
   (EVM) method. Two analyses are used, one with the EVM approach and
   another with a novel Direct Numerical Integration (DNI) coupled with the

Title = {{Three-Dimensional Wiring for Extensible Quantum Computing: The Quantum
   Socket}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Quantum computing architectures are on the verge of scalability, a key
   requirement for the implementation of a universal quantum computer. The
   next stage in this quest is the realization of quantum error-correction
   codes, which will mitigate the impact of faulty quantum information on a
   quantum computer. Architectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits)
   have been realized using trapped ions and superconducting circuits.
   While these implementations are potentially scalable, true scalability
   will require systems engineering to combine quantum and classical
   hardware. One technology demanding imminent efforts is the realization
   of a suitable wiring method for the control and the measurement of a
   large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an interconnect
   solution for solid-state qubits: the quantum socket. The quantum socket
   fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to
   qubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional
   methods based on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on
   spring-mounted microwires-the three-dimensional wires-that push directly
   on a microfabricated chip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross
   section (approximately 1 mm), nearly nonmagnetic components, and
   functionality at low temperatures make the quantum socket ideal for
   operating solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry and
   operate over a frequency range from dc to 8 GHz, with a contact
   resistance of approximately 150 m Omega, an impedance mismatch of
   approximately 10 Omega, and minimal cross talk. As a proof of principle,
   we fabricate and use a quantum socket to measure high-quality
   superconducting resonators at a temperature of approximately 10 mK.
   Quantum error-correction codes such as the surface code will largely
   benefit from the quantum socket, which will make it possible to address
   qubits located on a two-dimensional lattice. The present implementation
   of the socket could be readily extended to accommodate a quantum
   processor with a (10 x 10)-qubit lattice, which would allow for the
   realization of a simple quantum memory.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the techno-economic analysis results of a novel
   polygeneration process that converts biomass, petcoke, and natural gas
   into methanol, ethanol, DME, olefins, FT-liquids, and electricity, while

   developed in Aspen Plus. The economic optimization of the plant is
   performed for a wide range of biomass to petcoke ratios: 0\%, 5\%, 10\%,
   and 20\%, using the particle swarm optimization technique. Moreover,
   five different optimization scenarios are considered for each feedstock
   including maximizing profitability of the plant, maximizing petcoke
   utilization, maximizing fuel production, maximizing olefin production
   and maximizing ethanol production. The economic optimization results
   showed that up to 65\% of feedstock inlet can be a petcoke/biomass
   mixture while the process is still profitable. In addition, the results
   indicate that the methanol scenario leads to the minimum thermal
   efficiency and NPV compared to the other chemical production units. (C)

   drain water heat recovery system effectiveness}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to experimentally investigate the impact of
   mains-side and drain-side water temperatures on the effectiveness of
   falling film drain water heat recovery (DWHR) systems. DWHR systems are
   heat exchangers that recover energy from a building's greywater, and use
   it to preheat incoming mains water. According to standards, the
   effectiveness of such systems is typically determined at controlled
   mains-side and drain-side inlet temperatures. Four DWHR systems of
   varying diameter and length are tested at inlet temperatures of 25, 30,
   35, 40 and 45 degrees C on the drain-side, and 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30
   degrees C on the mains-side. The effectiveness for each DWHR system is
   calculated in each test. Experiments show that heat exchanger
   effectiveness is strongly linked to fluid inlet temperatures, and that
   increases in either of these temperatures would lead to an increase in
   effectiveness, even if the temperature difference between the inlets is
   kept constant. These changes in effectiveness occur regardless of
   diameter, length, or flow rate. A semi-empirical correlation is
   established to correct system effectiveness for different inlet
   temperatures. This correlation represents one step in the development of
   a building simulation model of falling film DWHR systems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (REs) such as wind
   and solar into larger scale fossil fueled combined cycle power plant
   (CCPP) utilizing hydrogen as the energy vector is presented in this
   study in order to provide the needed load following energy profile and
   lower emissions. Such `Energy Hubs' have the potential to provide a
   unique future integrated system to meet consumer's energy demands
   utilizing conversion and storage technologies for multiple energy
   carriers such as electricity and hydrogen. Storing hydrogen in the
   natural gas pipeline network is an effective factor in reducing the cost
   of clean power produced. Wind turbines, solar farms, and CCPPs act as
   energy generation and transformation components within an energy hub.
   Maximizing revenues from selling power and from emissions credits
   represent the objective function; whereas hydrogen percentage in CCPP
   fuel represents the decision variable. Meeting power demand and hydrogen
   limits in CCPP fuel are the most effective constraints. GAMS is used to
   model energy hub costs to approach the problem using mathematical
   programming while power cost and emission credits represent the model
   outputs. Such a model will aid in sizing of the key components within
   the hub and optimizing its operation. Hydrogen production cost is found
   to be an average of \$4.10 per kg representing an extra cost while
   reducing CO2 and NOx, emissions by about 2\%. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the impact of various discharge rates on
   the thermal (temperature and heat generation profiles) and electrical
   performance of the Li-ion battery for electric vehicles and hybrid
   electric vehicles. For this, a prismatic Li-ion phosphate (LiFePO4)
   battery with 20 Ah capacity is tested under constant current discharge
   rates of C/10, C/5, C/2, 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C and surface temperatures and
   voltage distributions during both charging and discharging are measured.
   In addition, IR images were also captured during experiments with a Flir
   Therma CAM S60 IR camera at various discharge rates and are reported in
   this study. Furthermore, a thermal model is created and validated for a
   particular battery using a MATLAB Simulink in terms of temperature,
   voltage, heat generation, and internal resistance. The results of this
   study demonstrate that the increased C-rates from C/10 to 4C result in
   increased temperatures on the principal surface of the battery. Also, at
   the lower discharge rates (below 1C), the surface temperature remains
   close to the ambient temperature, but at higher discharge rates (above
   1C); the surface temperature quickly increases for all C-rates. The most
   noteworthy surface temperature distribution is observed to be 58.1
   degrees C towards the end of 4C discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors (LIHSs) have recently attracted increasing
   attention as a new and promising energy storage device. However, it is
   still a great challenge to construct novel LIHSs with high-performance
   due to the majority of battery-type anodes retaining the sluggish
   kinetics of Li-ion storage and most capacitor-type cathodes with low
   specific capacitance. To solve this problem, 3D graphene-wrapped MoO3
   nanobelt foam with the unique porous network structure has been designed
   and prepared as anode material, which delivers high capacity, improved
   rate performance, and enhanced cycle stability. First-principles
   calculation reveals that the combination of graphene dramatically
   reduces the diffusion energy barrier of Li+ adsorbed on the surface of
   MoO3 nanobelt, thus improving its electrochemical performance.
   Furthermore, 3D graphene-wrapped polyaniline nanotube foam derived
   carbon is employed as a new type of capacitor-type cathode,
   demonstrating high specific capacitance, good rate performance, and long
   cycle stability. Benefiting from these two graphene foam-enhanced
   materials, the constructed LIHSs show a wide operating voltage range
   (3.8 V), a long stable cycle life (90\% capacity retention after 3000
   cycles), a high energy density (128.3 Wh.kg(-1)), and a high power
   density (13.5 kW.kg(-1)). These encouraging performances indicate that
   the obtained LIHSs may have promising prospect as next-generation energy
   storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Conserving utilities in an eco-industrial park (EIP) by exploiting the
   synergistic heating/cooling needs of its inhabitants can have
   significant economic and environmental benefits. However, a successful
   implementation of an EIP-wide heat integration involves much more than
   the simple minimization of utility usage. Like any collaborative
   endeavour involving independent and diverse profit-making enterprises,
   an EIP-wide heat integration faces several real and practical challenges
   such as exchanger locations, stream transports over long distances, etc.
   In this work, we propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model
   (MINLP) for configuring an EIP-wide multi-enterprise heat exchanger
   network (HEN). We propose a practical and rational strategy that (1)
   considers all the major capital and operating costs, and utility
   savings, (2) selects an optimum HEN location with the highest net
   present value, (3) uses a third party logistics provider for managing
   and operating the HEN, and (4) ensures an identical rate of return on
   investment for all participating enterprises. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Most researches on oil droplets immersed in aqueous solutions assume
   that the surface charges of oil droplets are, similar to that of solid
   particles, immobile and distributed uniformly under external electric
   field. However, the surface charges at the liquid liquid interface are
   mobile and will redistribute under external electric field. This paper
   studies the redistribution of surface charges on an oil droplet under
   the influence of the external electrical field. Analytical expressions
   of the local zeta potential on the surface of an oil droplet after the
   charge redistribution in a uniform electrical field were derived. The
   effects of the initial zeta potential, droplet radius and strength of
   applied electric field on the surface charge redistribution were
   studied. In analogy to the mobile surface charges, the redistribution
   ofA1203-passivated aluminum nanoparticles on the oil droplet surface was
   observed under applied electrical field. Experimental results showed
   that these nanoparticles moved and accumulated towards one side of the
   oil droplet under electric field. The redistribution of the
   nanoparticles is in qualitative agreement with the redistribution model
   of the mobile surface charges developed in this work. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tensile and stress controlled fatigue tests were performed to
   investigate the influence of forging at a temperature of 400 degrees C
   at different rates, on the performance of extruded AZ31B magnesium
   alloy. The obtained microstructural analysis showed that the extruded
   AZ31B magnesium alloy possesses a bimodal grain structure with strong
   basal texture. In contrast, the forged samples showed refined grains and
   a weaker texture. During tensile testing, a maximum yield and ultimate
   tensile strength of about 163 MPa and 268 MPa were obtained for the
   forged samples showing an increase of 102\% and 7\%, respectively from
   the as-extruded material. At the same time, a significant improvement of
   fatigue life was also observed for the sample forged at the rate of 100
   mm/min. The fractographic analysis of the fracture surfaces showed that
   ductile type fractures occurred in both as-extruded and forged samples.
   However, more dimples and plastic deformation were identified in the
   fracture surfaces of the forged specimens. It is believed that forging
   improved the fatigue life by a combination of grain refinement and
   texture modification resulting in improved yield and ductility.}},

Abstract = {{Research advances over the past decade in the areas of nematic phase
   transition and texture dynamics are reviewed. Research studies applying
   theoretical techniques able to resolve the length and time scales
   inherent to liquid crystal (LC) dynamics are focused on: coarse-grained
   molecular dynamics and continuum mechanics. The focus on LC dynamics is
   due to their importance in both fundamental and technological processes
   involving complex LC textures and texture transitions. Meta-stable
   textures frequently occur in soft matter systems, thus knowledge of LC
   textures that result in free energy minima for a specific system is not
   sufficient to characterise its behaviour. Resolution of dynamics enables
   researchers to predict with more accuracy observable LC textures and
   texture transitions. As is reflected in the reviewed research, LC
   dynamics simulations have enabled both validation of simulations with
   existing experimental observations and predictive results, which augment
   direct experimentation. While the outlook is positive as a result of
   this, several key challenges stymie further progress: (i) the
   availability of validated open-source software implementing nematic
   dynamics simulation methods, (ii) development of suitable visualisation
   and characterisation methods for transient three-dimensional LC
   textures, and (iii) inclusion of thermal fluctuations in nematic
   dynamics models.

Abstract = {{Objective. The position-dependence of a method to measure the joint
   space of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints using high-resolution
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) was studied.
   Methods. Cadaveric MCP were imaged at 7 flexion angles between 0 and 30
   degrees. The variability in reproducibility for mean, minimum, and
   maximum joint space widths and volume measurements was calculated for
   increasing degrees of flexion.
   Results. Root mean square coefficient of variance values were < 5\%
   under 20 degrees of flexion for mean, maximum, and volumetric joint
   spaces. Values for minimum joint space width were optimized under 10
   degrees of flexion.
   Conclusion. MCP joint space measurements should be acquired at < 10
   degrees of flexion in longitudinal studies.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time Ethernet (RTE) is widely recognized for its potential to
   provide a unified communication backbone for next-generation
   heterogeneous distributed systems. However, most of the existing
   research in RTE technologies has traditionally focused on formal models
   and theoretical analyzes of timing properties, usually omitting the
   associated implementation challenges for testing them in practice. This
   gap between theory and practice prevents experimental validation of the
   claimed properties, which in turn hinders the pace of innovation and
   adoption of the technology in industrial settings. This paper aims at
   narrowing the theory-practice gap by characterizing a comprehensive
   open-source RTE framework that explores emerging challenges in real-time
   networking, including the provision of ultra-low latency and jitter,
   dynamic bandwidth management, and segmentation within large networks.
   This work integrates research on formal abstractions for dynamic
   time-division multiple access arbitration and technological insights
   from modern hardware infrastructure, and uses a representative
   distributed video processing application to provide reproducible
   evidence of the achieved properties in multihop Ethernet settings. By
   leveraging readily available technology and an open-source design, the
   proposed framework facilitates further exploration and experimental
   validation of properties that are beyond the scope of current commercial
   technologies, encouraging evidence-based discussions to accelerate
   development and adoption of new standards for next-generation industrial
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Our group has shown a greater number of functioning motor units (MU) in
   a cohort of highly active older (similar to 65 yr) masters runners
   relative to age-matched controls. Because of the precipitous loss in the
   number of functioning MUs in the eighth and ninth decades of life it is
   unknown whether older world class octogenarian masters athletes (MA)
   would also have greater numbers of functioning MUs compared with
   age-matched controls. We measured MU numbers and neuromuscular
   transmission stability in the tibialis anterior of world champion MAs
   (similar to 80 yr) and compared the values with healthy age-matched
   controls (similar to 80 yr). Decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered
   averaging was used to collect surface and intramuscular electromyography
   signals during dorsiflexion at similar to 25\% of maximum voluntary
   isometric contraction. Near fiber (NF) MU potential analysis was used to
   assess neuromuscular transmission stability. For the MAs compared with
   age-matched controls, the amount of excitable muscle mass (compound
   muscle action potential) was 14\% greater (P < 0.05), there was a trend
   (P = 0.07) toward a 27\% smaller surface-detected MU potential
   representative of less collateral reinnervation, and 28\% more
   functioning MUs (P < 0.05). Additionally, the MAs had greater MU
   neuromuscular stability than the controls, as indicated by lower NF
   jitter and jiggle values (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that
   high-performing octogenarians better maintain neuromuscular stability of
   the MU and mitigate the loss of MUs associated with aging well into the
   later decades of life during which time the loss of muscle mass and
   strength becomes functionally relevant. Future studies may identify the
   concomitant roles genetics and exercise play in neuro-protection.}},

Abstract = {{Pt, Pd, Ni, and Cu supported on HSiW/Al2O3 catalysts were studied for
   the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. It was found that Pt is the best
   promoter for the production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) and 1-propanol
   (1-PO). Ni, a much cheaper metal, has fairly comparable reactivity to
   Pt, while Cu does not show any activity for the production of 1,3-PD:
   The catalysts were characterized by XRD and NH3-TPD. The strength of the
   acid sites affects the distribution of products. A reaction mechanism
   for a NiHSiW/Al2O3 catalyst involving rate-determining parallel
   dehydration of primary alcohol to produce acetal and of secondary
   alcohol to produce 3-hydroxypropylaldehdye (3-HPA) was proposed.
   Hydrogenolysis of 1,3-PD is 15 times slower than that of 1,2-PD. Most of
   the 1-PO is derived from 1,2-PD. An optimal balance of acid sites of
   appropriate acid strength and hydrogenation sites will lead to a highly
   selective catalyst for the production of higher value sustainable
   chemicals from glycerol.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the dose received by thoron (Rn-220) domestically,
   conventional methods measure the activity concentration of thoron
   progeny only (namely the Pb-212 atoms) and calculate the dose by using a
   set of conversion factors. This may be due to the measurement of progeny
   being simpler since it is longer lived and will be evenly spread
   throughout the room, whereas the thoron gas, with its short half-life,
   will exist only near the source and hence will not be of major concern
   for the majority of the room. However, concrete walls are a source of
   thoron, and spending prolonged amounts of time near them may lead to
   greatly increased radiation exposure, the degree of which is not
   revealed through progeny activity alone. The present paper compares the
   energy received from the ionising radiation of both thoron gas and
   thoron progeny near its source. Converting the energy dose to radiation
   dose is not within the scope of this paper. The results suggest a
   difference of an order of magnitude higher when taking into account the
   dose received by thoron gas.}},

   unworthy ideas and the abandonment of promising ideas. An inadequate
   description of a claim can make it difficult to reason about the claim,
   for example, to determine whether the claim is sound. Many practitioners
   will acknowledge the threat of unsound claims or inadequate descriptions
   of claims to their field. We believe that this situation is exacerbated,
   and even encouraged, by the lack of a systematic approach to exploring,
   exposing, and addressing the source of unsound claims and poor
   exposition.
   This article proposes a framework that identifies three sins of
   reasoning that lead to unsound claims and two sins of exposition that
   lead to poorly described claims and evaluations. Sins of exposition
   obfuscate the objective of determining whether or not a claim is sound,
   while sins of reasoning lead directly to unsound claims.
   Our framework provides practitioners with a principled way of critiquing
   the integrity of their own work and the work of others. We hope that
   this will help individuals conduct better science and encourage a
   cultural shift in our research community to identify and promulgate
   sound claims.}},

Title = {{Automated segmentation of white matter fiber bundles using diffusion
   tensor imaging data and a new density based clustering algorithm}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Robust and accurate segmentation of brain white matter (WM)
   fiber bundles assists in diagnosing and assessing progression or
   remission of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, autism and
   depression. Supervised segmentation methods are infeasible in most
   applications since generating gold standards is too costly. Hence, there
   is a growing interest in designing unsupervised methods. However, most
   conventional unsupervised methods require the number of clusters be
   known in advance which is not possible in most applications. The purpose
   of this study is to design an unsupervised segmentation algorithm for
   brain white matter fiber bundles which can automatically segment fiber
   bundles using intrinsic diffusion tensor imaging data information
   without considering any prior information or assumption about data
   distributions.
   Methods and material: Here, a new density based clustering algorithm
   called neighborhood distance entropy consistency (NDEC), is proposed
   which discovers natural clusters within data by simultaneously utilizing
   both local and global density information. The performance of NDEC is
   compared with other state of the art clustering algorithms including
   chameleon, spectral clustering, DBSCAN and k-means using Johns Hopkins
   University publicly available diffusion tensor imaging data.
   Results: The performance of NDEC and other employed clustering
   algorithms were evaluated using dice ratio as an external evaluation
   criteria and density based clustering validation (DBCV) index as an
   internal evaluation metric. Across all employed clustering algorithms,
   NDEC obtained the highest average dice ratio (0.94) and DBCV value
   (0.71).
   Conclusions: NDEC can find clusters with arbitrary shapes and densities
   and consequently can be used for WM fiber bundle segmentation where
   there is no distinct boundary between various bundles. NDEC may also be
   used as an effective tool in other pattern recognition and medical
   diagnostic systems in which discovering natural clusters within data is
   a necessity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study presents a new technique for reconstructing the

   time-resolved, planar, two-component particle image velocimetry data
   collected in multiple orthogonal planes. The technique produces
   conditionally averaged flow field reconstructions based on a pattern
   recognition analysis of velocity fields. It is validated on the wake of
   a low-aspect ratio dual step cylinder geometry, consisting of a large
   diameter cylinder (D) with small aspect ratio (L/D) attached to the
   mid-span of a small diameter cylinder (d). For a dual step cylinders
   with D/d = 2, and L/D = 1, numerical and experimental data are
   considered for Re-D = 150 (laminar wake) and for Re-D = 2100 (turbulent
   wake). The results show that the proposed technique successfully
   reconstructs the dominant periodic wake vortex interactions and can be
   extended to a wide range of turbulent flows.}},

Title = {{Motor unit number estimates and neuromuscular transmission in the

   people are not spared from age-related motor unit remodeling}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Muscle motor unit numbers decrease markedly in old age, while remaining
   motor units are enlarged and can have reduced neuromuscular junction
   transmission stability. However, it is possible that regular intense
   physical activity throughout life can attenuate this remodeling. The aim
   of this study was to compare the number, size, and neuromuscular
   junction transmission stability of tibialis anterior (TA) motor units in
   healthy young and older men with those of exceptionally active master
   runners. The distribution of motor unit potential (MUP) size was
   determined from intramuscular electromyographic signals recorded in
   healthy male Young (mean +/- SD, 26 +/- 5 years), Old (71 +/- 4 years)
   and Master Athletes (69 +/- 3 years). Relative differences between
   groups in numbers of motor units was assessed using two methods, one
   comparing MUP size and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) determined with
   MRI, the other comparing surface recorded MUPs with maximal compound
   muscle action potentials and commonly known as a ``motor unit number
   estimate (MUNE){''}. Near fiber (NF) jiggle was measured to assess
   neuromuscular junction transmission stability. TA CSA did not differ
   between groups. MUNE values for the Old and Master Athletes were 45\%
   and 40\%, respectively, of the Young. Intramuscular MUPs of Old and
   Master Athletes were 43\% and 56\% larger than Young. NF jiggle was
   slightly higher in the Master Athletes, with no difference between Young
   and Old. These results show substantial and similar motor unit loss and
   remodeling in Master Athletes and Old individuals compared with Young,
   which suggests that lifelong training does not attenuate the age-related
   loss of motor units.}},

Abstract = {{The conceptual design of a petroleum refinery that satisfies multiple
   economics and operating constraints is a highly complex task. Coupled
   with the ever-rising cost of designing and constructing a new refinery
   and the increasing demand for energy and fuels, there is incentive to
   optimize the energy recovery and energy efficiency of such a facility.
   This work addresses the flowsheet optimization of the synthesis of a
   petroleum refinery to attain an optimal heat-integrated configuration or
   topology. A sequential two-step strategy is employed that first performs
   simultaneous flowsheet optimization and heat integration to obtain an
   optimal refinery topology with minimum utility cost. Subsequently, the
   fixed optimal topology with minimum utility loads is optimized to arrive
   at a configuration with the fewest heat exchanger units. A mixed-integer
   linear program (MILP) is formulated based on a superstructure
   representation that considers many alternative feasible refinery
   topologies. The computational results show meaningful reduction in the
   total annualized capital and operating costs as compared to a
   non-heat-integrated configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed arithmetic coding (DAC) is a variant of AC that can realize
   Slepian-Wolf coding in a nonlinear way. In our previous work, we defined
   codebook cardinality spectrum (CCS) and Hamming distance spectrum (HDS)
   for DAC. In this paper, we make use of CCS and HDS to analyze tailed
   DAC, which is a form of DAC that, as traditional AC, maps the last few
   symbols of each source block onto non-overlapped intervals. First, we
   derive the exact HDS formula for tailless DAC, a form of DAC that maps
   all the symbols of each source block onto overlapped intervals, and show
   that the HDS formula previously given is in fact approximation. Then,
   the HDS formula is extended to tailed DAC. Using CCS, we also deduce the
   average codebook cardinality, which is closely related to decoding
   complexity, and rate loss of tailed DAC. The effects of tail length are
   extensively analyzed. It is revealed that by increasing tail length to a
   value not close to the bitstream length, closely spaced codewords within
   the same codebook can be removed at the cost of a higher decoding
   complexity and a larger rate loss. Finally, theoretical analyses are
   verified by experiments.}},

   requirement of high extinction molar coefficients, absorption over the

   Interestingly, these compounds initiate the cationic polymerization of
   epoxides or the free radical polymerization of acrylates upon exposure
   of the photocurable formulations to a LED emitting at 405 nm. Some of

Abstract = {{We fabricated a type of superconducting heterostructures,
   TiN/tapering/NbN/tapering/TiN, on c-cut sapphire substrates by reactive
   magnetron sputtering. The goal is to achieve an x-band resonator that
   maintains a high Q in modest magnetic fields. The structure shows (111)
   orientation with local epitaxial correlation, as a result of stacking
   face-centered-cubic structures on top of hexagonal-close-packing
   substrates. The artificial tapering layers vary gradually from NbN into
   TiN and vice versa, creating a smooth transition so that no distinct
   interface exists. We characterized microstrip single line resonators on
   these heterostructures that are promising candidates for quantum
   information processing with hybrid nuclear-electron spins.}},

Abstract = {{Freeze-thaw action is considered to be one of the most destructive
   actions that can induce significant damage in stabilized subgrades in
   seasonally frozen loess areas. Laboratory tests including frost
   heave-thaw shrinkage and microstructure change during freeze-thaw cycles
   were conducted to evaluate the volume change rate of loess stabilized
   with cement, lime, and fly ash under the impact of cyclic freeze-thaw
   conditions. The loess specimens collapsed after eight freeze-thaw cycles
   (192 h), but most stabilized loess specimens had no visible damage after
   all freeze-thaw cycles were completed. All of the stabilized loess
   samples underwent a much smaller volume change than the loess alone
   after the freeze-thaw cycles. Although surface porosity and equivalent
   diameter of stabilized loess samples increased, the stabilized loess can
   retain its microstructure during freeze-thaw cycles when the cement
   content was less than 6\%. To ensure freeze-thaw resistance of
   stabilized loess subgrades, the mix proportions of the three additives
   was recommended to be 4 to 5\% cement, 6\% lime, and 10\% fly ash.}},

Title = {{Toward Multi-Radio Vehicular Data Piping for Dynamic DSRC/TVWS Spectrum

Abstract = {{Enabling high-throughput and cost-effective vehicular communications is
   important for many emerging vehicular applications, such as safety
   applications, traffic management, and mobile Internet access. However,
   dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), as the sole solution so
   far, would meet significant challenges in the foreseeable future for
   supporting diverse vehicular applications simply due to the spectrum
   scarcity. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an adaptive
   vehicular data piping framework, which is assisted by a geolocation
   database, for the joint utilization of DSRC and TV white space (TVWS)
   spectrum; in this framework, three types of vehicular data pipes (DSRC,
   TVWS, and cellular) are considered, while the cellular data pipe is only
   used as a control-plane link in coordinating the dynamic DSRC and TVWS
   spectrum sharing happened in the data-plane operations. In order to
   guarantee the optimal dynamic vehicular access to the geolocation
   database, we first propose a log-sum-exp (LSE) approximation-based TVWS
   geolocation database access approach, named LSE-WS algorithm. We
   formulate the adaptive vehicular data piping problem for dynamic
   DSRC/TVWS spectrum sharing as a coalitional formation game, and it is
   shown that the proposed coalitional formation approach reaches the
   optimal and Nash-stable vehicular data pipe selection partition in a
   distributed way. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that not
   only the proposed LSE-WS algorithm satisfies the dynamic vehicular
   geolocation database access requirement but also the adaptive
   multi-radio vehicular data piping approach for dynamic DSRC/TVWS
   spectrum sharing significantly outperforms the traditional DSRC
   solution.}},

Title = {{You Can Jam But You Cannot Hide: Defending Against Jamming Attacks for
   Geo-Location Database Driven Spectrum Sharing}},

Abstract = {{The emerging paradigm for dynamic spectrum sharing is based on allowing
   secondary users (SUs) to exploit white space frequency that is not
   occupied by primary users. White space database provides an opportunity
   for SUs to obtain spectrum availability information by submitting a
   location-based query. However, this new paradigm can also be exploited
   by the attackers to significantly enhance their jamming capability due
   to the available channel information from spectrum queries, which is
   expected to increasingly block SUs. The challenge is that the unique
   characteristics (e.g., lack of the wide range frequencies or continuous
   broadband) make existing anti-jamming techniques (e.g., direct-sequence
   spread spectrum and frequency hopping spread spectrum) difficult to be
   applied. In this paper, we present a novel Jammer Inference-based
   Jamming Defense (jDefender) framework. The main idea of jDefender is
   inferring the likelihood of a user being a jammer based on the observed
   jamming events and then utilizing the inferred attack likelihood to
   enhance the effectiveness of a series of the proposed anti-jamming
   strategies. Specifically, we first propose the Channel Allocation-based
   Jammer Inference scheme to infer the likelihood of an SU being a jammer
   based on the channels occupied by SUs even under the collusion attack
   performed by multiple jammers. The strength of the anti-jamming
   strategies (e.g., puzzle difficulties, available spectrum resources)
   will be correlated with the possibility of an SU being a jammer to
   achieve the tradeoff between system performance and jamming tolerance.
   We then implement the proposed scheme on Universal Software Radio
   Peripheral and PC. Extensive evaluations are performed to validate the
   effectiveness of the attacks and countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) has emerged as a promising
   solution to address the spectrum scarcity problem in traditional sensor
   networks, by enabling sensor nodes to opportunistically access licensed
   spectrum. To protect the transmission of primary users and enhance
   spectrum utilization, collaborative spectrum sensing is generally
   adopted for improving spectrum sensing accuracy. However, as sensor
   nodes may be compromised by adversaries, these nodes can send false
   sensing reports to mislead the spectrum sensing decision, making CRSNs
   vulnerable to spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks.
   Meanwhile, since the energy consumption of spectrum sensing is
   considerable for energy-limited sensor nodes, SSDF attack
   countermeasures should be carefully devised with the consideration of
   energy efficiency. To this end, we propose a secure and energy-efficient
   collaborative spectrum sensing scheme to resist SSDF attacks and enhance
   the energy efficiency in CRSNs. Specifically, we theoretically analyze
   the impacts of two types of attacks, i.e., independent and collaborative
   SSDF attacks, on the accuracy of collaborative spectrum sensing in a
   probabilistic way. To maximize the energy efficiency of spectrum
   sensing, we calculate the minimum number of sensor nodes needed for
   spectrum sensing to guarantee the desired accuracy of sensing results.
   Moreover, a trust evaluation scheme, named FastDtec, is developed to
   evaluate the spectrum sensing behaviors and fast identify compromised
   nodes. Finally, a secure and energy-efficient collaborative spectrum
   sensing scheme is proposed to further improve the energy efficiency of
   collaborative spectrum sensing, by adaptively isolating the identified
   compromised nodes from spectrum sensing. Extensive simulation results
   demonstrate that our proposed scheme can resist SSDF attacks and
   significantly improve the energy efficiency of collaborative spectrum
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile video streaming is fundamental to advanced applications in the
   fifth generation (5G) networks. Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication
   represents a leading 5G technology, which provides rich bandwidth and,
   therefore, great potentials for high-quality mobile video streaming.
   However, mobile video streaming in mmWave 5G networks faces fundamental
   challenges due to mmWave antenna directivity and high user mobility. As
   such, users typically have short connection durations and frequent
   handoffs, making video streaming suffer from long handoff delays and
   connection latency. In this paper, we tackle the issues by developing a
   caching-based mmWave framework, which precaches video contents at the
   base station for handoff users and thus significantly reduces the
   connection and retrieval delays. As a result, high-mobility users with
   frequent handoffs can enjoy continuous high-quality video streaming.
   Specifically, we model the proposed system as a cache management problem
   and attain optimal video streaming quality by using Markov decision
   process to dynamically allocate proper cache memory space of each base
   station to mobile users. A cell-by-cell decomposition method is proposed
   to solve the dynamic programming problem with significantly reduced
   computational complexity. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate
   that the proposed solution can effectively maintain high-quality mobile
   video streaming for high-mobility 5G users moving among mmWave small
   cells with directional antenna.}},

Abstract = {{The precipitation hardening behavior of newly developed Mg-Zn-Ca-Ce
   alloys, with modified texture and improved ductility, is studied to
   delineate the microstructural characteristics that lead to effective
   hardening upon ageing treatments. Advanced electron microscopy and atom
   probe techniques are used to analyze the structural characteristics in
   relevance to the hardening potential. It has been found that the
   formation of a new basal precipitate phase, which evolves from a single
   atomic layer GP zone, and is finely distributed in both under-aged and
   peak-aged microstructures, has a significant impact in the improvement
   of the hardening response compared with the base Mg-Zn alloys. It has
   also been found that the beta'(1) rod precipitates, commonly formed
   during ageing treatments of Mg-Zn alloys, have their size and
   distribution significantly refined in the Ca-Ce containing alloys. The
   role of alloy chemistry in the formation of the fine basal plate GP
   zones and the refinement in precipitation and their relationships to the
   hardening behavior are discussed. It is proposed that Ca microalloying
   governs the formation of the GP zones and the enhancement of hardening,
   particularly in the under-aged conditions, but that this is aided by a
   beneficial effect from Ce. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a spin field effect transistor using a graphene nanoribbon as
   the channel. The control and manipulation of the electron spin in the
   channel modulate the spin-polarized current. The modulation is carried
   out by the magnetic exchange field which arises from the electron
   exchange interaction with ferromagnetic gate and quantum confinement
   effect. Numerical estimation indicates that a substantial magnetic
   exchange field can generate a phase difference on the order of pi within
   a timeframe far below the spin lifetime and timescale between successive
   collisions, which ensures both the spin coherence and ballistic
   conduction during the electron transport. A graphene ribbon with
   armchair boundaries has the desired Dirac point and metallic character.
   This Dirac-like dispersion relation, together with negligible spin-orbit
   coupling, makes large on-off ratio feasible even in the presence of
   thermal dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{Geometrical discontinues, such as notches, need careful consideration
   due to stress concentration appearing in their proximity. Notches become
   even more dangerous in the case of mechanical and structural components
   subjected to high temperature and cyclic loading resulting often in
   localized creep deformations. It appears, based on the current state of
   art, that needed are numerical or analytical tools enabling the analysis
   and simulation of creep deformations near notches.
   The knowledge of notch tip stresses and strains can be used as the input
   into stress-strain creep models used for strength and fracture
   evaluations of mechanical and structural components. The method
   discussed below is based on considerations of the strain energy density
   variations near notches. Several examples concerning V-notches have been
   analysed to validate the concept. Finally, the problem associated with
   the analysis of sharp notches and cracks is discussed in terms of the

Abstract = {{Due to their cost-effective and environmental-friendly natures,
   renewable energies as well as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are
   increasingly utilized nowadays. A critical challenge with renewable
   energies is natural intermittency and as such can be addressed
   appropriately using Energy Storage Systems (ESS). In this paper, optimal
   planning of battery based energy storage units is proposed in
   distribution network. As an important challenge in optimal storage
   planning, the uncertainty investigation is dealt with in this work. A
   new approach which is based on Point Estimate Method (PEM) is introduced
   as a tool to handle the uncertainty of the load, the Wind-based
   Distributed Generation (WDG) and PEVs demand, simultaneously. The
   proposed method is intuitively compared with Monte Carlo Simulation
   (MCS) as well as conventional PEM for a case study and the results are
   verified through the comparisons. Moreover, in order to challenge
   voltage control benefit of the storage units, the under study
   distribution network is equipped to the tap-changer and the capacitor
   banks. Whereas the optimal storage planning is a very complicated task,
   a modified hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS)
   algorithm is used to solve the related optimization problem. The
   simulation results for a case study in Iran show the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach in different scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Winter road maintenance (WRM) has been shown to have significant
   benefits of improving road safety and reducing traffic delay caused by
   adverse weather conditions. It has also been suggested that WRM is also
   beneficial in terms of reducing vehicular air emissions and fuel
   consumptions because snow and ice on road surface often cause the
   drivers to reduce their vehicle speeds or to switch to high gears, thus
   decreasing fuel combustion efficiency. However, there has been very
   limited information about the underlying relationship, which is
   important for quantifying this particular benefit of a winter road
   maintenance program. This research is focused on establishing a
   quantitative relationship between winter road surface conditions and
   vehicular air emissions. Speed distribution models are developed for the
   selected Ontario highways using data from 22 road sites across the
   province of Ontario, Canada. The vehicular air emissions under different
   road surface conditions are calculated by coupling the speed models with
   the engine emission models integrated in the emission estimation model -
   MOVES. It was found that, on the average, a 10\% improvement in road
   surface conditions could result in approximately 0.6-2\% reduction in
   air emissions. Application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated
   through a case study to analyse the air emission and energy consumption
   effects under specific weather events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles have been synthesized by arc discharge and
   femtosecond laser ablation in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) aqueous
   solution. Both methods are the simple, cost-effective and
   environment-friendly way to obtain the purity silver nanoparticles. In
   this study, the structure, composition, morphology, size and
   distribution, stability, production rate and sintering properties of
   silver nanoparticles synthesized by both methods were compared. The
   spherical or pseudo-spherical silver nanoparticles were synthesized by
   both methods, and the diameters were below 50 nm. The arc
   discharge-synthesized particle distribution varied with the breakdown
   voltage, and laser-synthesized particle size mainly depended on the
   laser energy. PVP solution could cap and stabilize the silver
   nanoparticles by Ag-O bond, while arc discharge and laser ablation
   resulted in some level of PVP degradation during processing. Sliver
   nanoparticle colloids synthesized by both methods had the high negative
   values of zeta potential and exhibited the good stability. The maximum
   production rates of the silver nanoparticles synthesized by arc
   discharge and femtosecond laser ablation were 6.0 and 3.0 mg/min,

Abstract = {{In the present study, for the first time, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)
   sensors are employed to measure the cyclic-strain induced on AZ31B
   extrusion samples during rotational bending tests (RBTs). The importance
   of this observation will be highlighted by considering the risk of
   failures under this circumstance in the modern technologies such as
   aerospace, while any in situ cyclic strain measurement has not been
   reported under RBTs. For this purpose, first, the accuracy of strain
   measurements captured by the FBG sensor in the elastic and plastic
   regimes is investigated by comparing the FBG measured strain with the
   data obtained simultaneously by a standard extensometer during uniaxial
   pull-push tests. The results confirm that the FBG sensor is able to
   measure the strain up to 1.3 \% (plastic region) accurately. Next, the
   strains of the specimens are measured under different bending moments
   during RBTs in both the elastic and plastic regimes, hence monitoring
   the degradation of material during the test. The experiments uncover
   that the strain amplitude of the samples is decreased as the number of
   cycles increases in the plastic regime until the sample is stabilized.
   However, the strain response of the material under a bending moment of
   2.5 Nm (in the elastic regime) remains constant during the test. This
   paper concludes that the measurement of strain amplitude evolution, with
   respect to the number of cycles, in a rotating bending cyclic test with
   FBG sensors is feasible with high level of accuracy and repeatability in
   the cyclic testing in the elastic region.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the increase in small-scale solar installations used for
   powering homes and small businesses, we consider the design of
   rule-based strategies for operating an energy storage device connected
   to a self-use solar generation system to minimize payments to the grid.
   This problem is inherently challenging, since strategies depend greatly
   on the choice of the tariff structure and forecasts of future generation
   and load. We propose an optimization framework for finding optimal
   operation strategies and use it to evaluate the performance of an
   existing operating strategy that we modified to not use forecasts, in
   the context of differential pricing. We also use our framework to
   propose a new practical operating strategy for peak-demand pricing. We
   simulate the two rule-based strategies using real data for solar
   generation and building load, and find that they are able to achieve
   near-optimal performance without requiring forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-band filters simplify the system architecture considerably by
   replacing doubly multiplexed filters. This is especially important in
   base stations for wireless communications, where high-selective
   filtering functions are required, with very stringent requirements in
   size and insertion losses. For this goal, compact dual-band filters
   realized in air-filled metallic ridge waveguides are proposed. The
   dual-band approach shown in this article allows fulfilling the stringent
   insertion loss specifications of very selective filtering functions. The
   ridge waveguide resonators are placed in a canonical folded top-bottom
   structure layout. Coupling sections that provide cross-couplings are
   realized by irises opened in the intermediate wall. Given the high-order
   of the dual-band filter required for actual wireless applications, an
   efficient modeling by the mode-matching method is used. A complete
   challenging filter prototype with 16 poles and 10 transmission zeros
   with specifications of typical wireless transceivers is built and tested
   for verification. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J RF and

Abstract = {{Empirical systems research is facing a dilemma. Minor aspects of an
   experimental setup can have a significant impact on its associated
   performance measurements and potentially invalidate conclusions drawn
   from them. Examples of such influences, often called hidden factors,
   include binary link order, process environment size, compiler generated
   randomized symbol names, or group scheduler assignments. The growth in
   complexity and size of modern systems will further aggravate this
   dilemma, especially with the given time pressure of producing results.
   How can one trust any reported empirical analysis of a new idea or
   concept in computer science? DataMill is a community-based
   services-oriented open benchmarking infrastructure for rigorous
   performance evaluation. DataMill facilitates producing robust, reliable,
   and reproducible results. The infrastructure incorporates the latest
   results on hidden factors and automates the variation of these factors.
   DataMill is also of interest for research on performance evaluation. The
   infrastructure supports quantifying the effect of hidden factors,
   disseminating the research results beyond mere reporting. It provides a
   platform for investigating interactions and composition of hidden
   factors. This paper discusses experience earned through creating and
   using an open benchmarking infrastructure. Multiple research groups
   participate and have used DataMill. Furthermore, DataMill has been used
   for a performance competition at the International Conference on Runtime
   Verification (RV) 2014 and is currently hosting the RV 2015 competition.
   This paper includes a summary of our experience hosting the first RV

Abstract = {{Use of relays is considered one of the most effective ways for capacity
   enhancement and coverage extension in next-generation broadband wireless
   access networks (BWAN). The paper investigates the location planning
   problem in BWANs, aiming at an optimal deployment of relay stations and

   integer linear programming to effectively capture various planning
   policies that govern relay and base station placement. Case studies are
   conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed formulations. We
   show that the same traffic demand can be satisfied with up to 73 \%
   fewer relay stations with a slight (6 \%) decrease in the overall
   network capacity, compared with our benchmark. Based on the developed
   formulations, we introduce a maximin objective function to properly
   distribute excess bandwidth to all subscriber stations rather than
   assigning it to a single one, which surprisingly leads to a significant
   gain in the rate allocated to each subscriber station.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery and exploitation of the prokaryotic adaptive immunity
   system based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
   repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins have
   revolutionized genetic engineering. CRISPR-Cas tools have enabled
   extensive genome editing as well as efficient modulation of the
   transcriptional program in a multitude of organisms. Progress in the
   development of genetic engineering tools for the genus Clostridium has
   lagged behind that of many other prokaryotes, presenting the CRISPR-Cas
   technology an opportunity to resolve a long-existing issue. Here, we
   applied the Streptococcus pyogenes type II CRISPR-Cas9 (SpCRISPR-Cas9)
   system for genome editing in Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM792. We
   further explored the utility of the SpCRISPR-Cas9 machinery for
   gene-specific transcriptional repression. For proof-of-concept
   demonstration, a plasmid-encoded fluorescent protein gene was used for
   transcriptional repression in C. acetobutylicum. Subsequently, we
   targeted the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) system of C.
   acetobutylicum through transcriptional repression of the hprK gene
   encoding HPr kinase/phosphorylase, leading to the coutilization of
   glucose and xylose, which are two abundant carbon sources from
   lignocellulosic feedstocks. Similar approaches based on SpCRISPR-Cas9
   for genome editing and transcriptional repression were also demonstrated
   in Clostridium pasteurianum ATCC 6013. As such, this work lays a
   foundation for the derivation of clostridial strains for industrial
   purposes.
   IMPORTANCE
   After recognizing the industrial potential of Clostridium for decades,
   methods for the genetic manipulation of these anaerobic bacteria are
   still underdeveloped. This study reports the implementation of
   CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing and transcriptional regulation
   in Clostridium acetobutylicum, which is arguably the most common
   industrial clostridial strain. The developed genetic tools enable
   simpler, more reliable, and more extensive derivation of C.
   acetobutylicum mutant strains for industrial purposes. Similar
   approaches were also demonstrated in Clostridium pasteurianum, another
   clostridial strain that is capable of utilizing glycerol as the carbon
   source for butanol fermentation, and therefore can be arguably applied
   in other clostridial strains.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{765-797}},

Abstract = {{Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is a turbulent combustion model
   that uses conditional averages to close the chemical source term.
   Previous CSE studies have shown that the model is able to predict the
   flame characteristics successfully; however, these studies have only
   focused on simple hydrocarbon fuels mostly composed of methane. The
   objective of the present paper is to evaluate the capabilities of CSE
   applied to turbulent non-premixed methanol flames, which has never been
   done previously. The current study investigates two different types of
   methanol flames: piloted and bluff-body flames. For the piloted flame,
   the standard k-epsilon model is used for turbulence modelling, while the
   Shear Stress Transport (SST) k- model is applied to the bluff-body case.
   Different values of empirical constants within the turbulence models
   were tested, and it was found that C-epsilon 1= 1.7 for the piloted
   flame and (2)= 0.66 for the bluff-body flame provided the best agreement
   with experimental measurements for the mixing field. Detailed chemistry
   is included in tabulated form using the Trajectory Generated
   Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) method. The predictions including both
   the Favre-averaged and conditional mass fraction of reactive species and
   temperature are compared with available experimental data and previous
   numerical results. Overall, the CSE predictions of conditional and
   unconditional quantities are in good agreement with the experimental
   data except for hydrogen. Sources of discrepancies are identified such
   as the chemical kinetics and neglect of differential diffusion. Large
   eddy simulations may also help to improve the velocity and mixing field
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{In deep submicron nodes, the final design patterning quality depends
   profoundly on the optical proximity correction (OPC) quality. The
   required pattern fidelity and CD uniformity can never be achieved
   without good OPC. However, OPC runtime-resource factor has been
   exponentially increasing every technology node reaching alarming levels,
   where the OPC cost in terms of resources and turn-around-time is
   becoming very expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach for
   speeding up the OPC convergence process using our model-based initial
   bias methodology. Our proposed methodology is based on building generic
   compact bias-models that can predict the final OPC shapes with a good
   accuracy using the optical simulation parameters. As a result, the OPC
   initial condition is much closer to the final solution and more than
   half of the OPC iterations can be saved as a result. In this paper, we
   present the details of our methodology and our compact initial-bias
   model we are proposing. We also present our testing results on a 10 nm
   metal level, where almost 50\% of the OPC iterations could be saved when
   we apply our methodology.}},

Title = {{Friction Characteristics of CFRP Plates in Contact with Copper Plates

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) plates have significant
   properties for applications in structural engineering, automotive,
   aviation, space, and shipbuilding. CFRP plates have the advantage over
   conventional materials owing to their resistance to corrosion, low
   weight, and high tensile strength. The coefficient of friction between
   CFRP plate and copper plate is an important parameter required for
   designing anchors for CFRP plates. The friction behavior of CFRP plates
   in contact with copper plates of different hardness (as-received and
   annealed) under high contact pressure (50-175 MPa) was investigated. The
   shear stress versus contact pressure relationship was linear for the
   as-received copper plates with a constant coefficient of friction of
   0.31. However, for the annealed copper plates, the coefficient of
   friction decreased with contact pressure from 0.39 to 0.30. For all
   tests, the sliding distance before rupture of CFRP plate decreased with
   the increase of contact pressure. Ploughing, wear, debris accumulation,
   and stick-slip behavior were observed and illustrated in this article.

Abstract = {{Yield locus measurements and their analytical descriptions has been the
   bases for modeling metal processing. These analytical descriptions play
   a role in models to predict limit strains observed during determination
   of forming limit diagrams of flat metal stock as means to evaluate their
   fabrication performance. Some of these analytical descriptions use the
   isotropic or anisotropic plastic potentials that take into account the
   crystallographic texture of the material. The applicability of such
   potentials is validated by comparing their predictions to that of
   unidirectional tensile data. In the current work, this approach is
   reversed to examine whether the constitutive relations, which replicate
   the measured stress strain diagrams, can generate a two-dimensional
   section of the yield locus. The strategy is to sum the computed plastic
   work (PW) from unidirectional mechanical tests in two principal
   directions which also accommodates the biaxial interaction strains. The
   resulting yield function includes f(theta) and f(phi), the prescribed
   stress ratios and the texture parameters R-phi and R-theta in their
   respective principal directions. The prescribed PW at an arbitrary
   strain during unidirectional tensile test is equated to the work sum
   from the biaxial stresses on the premise that the plastic flow -stress
   registers only the increasing density of obstacles it generates. The
   computed biaxial yield stresses showed good fits for AA5154 and AA5754
   with only small modification due to latent work hardening. (C) 2016 Acta

Abstract = {{A partially premixed formulation of Conditional Source-term Estimation
   including doubly conditioned averages, namely DCSE, is applied to
   several turbulent stratified V-shaped flames using a Reynolds Averaged

   authors' initial work (Dovizio et al., 2016), a more elaborate closure
   of the scalar dissipation rate is implemented in the progress variable
   variance equation, where a dependence on the local value of the
   equivalence ratio is considered. Detailed chemistry is included. Good
   predictions are obtained for the mean axial and transverse velocity
   components, and progress variable compared to experimental data for the
   stoichiometric cases, in particular for the lean and rich cases, where
   the predictions are significantly improved compared to previous
   numerical studies. The flame thickness is found to be reduced when the
   stratification increases, consistent with experimental findings. Future
   work will examine the closure of cross-dissipation terms in the

Title = {{Exploring social dimensions of municipal solid waste management around

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{3-12}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Currently, municipal solid waste (MSW) is experiencing a massive
   increase in both the amount and composition throughout the world.
   Effective and efficient MSW management has been widely accepted as an
   emergent factor for future social development, which requires not only
   technical innovation, but also the involvement of all stakeholders as
   well as social, economic, and psychological components. On account of
   this reality, there is an urgent need for research related to the social
   dimensions of MSW management. In this paper, a systematic literature
   review was carried out to characterize and critically evaluate the
   published literature on the social dimensions of MSW management from
   1980 to 2014 in terms of vulnerability, public participation, public
   attitude and behavior, and policy. A keyword search was first performed
   by using the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science,
   which retrieves 1843 documents. After removing the papers that were not
   closely related to the topic, 200 articles were retained for an in-depth
   review. In each category, major research issues and observations were
   summarized, and important insights were obtained. Besides compiling a
   related list of key references, the analysis results indicate that the
   global distribution of social dimensions reports on MSW management is
   inequitable and the research on the social dimensions of MSW management
   is insufficient, which may attract increased research interest and
   attention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A micromechanical study of dilatancy of granular materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{411-427}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In micromechanics of granular materials, relationships are investigated
   between micro scale characteristics of particles and contacts and
   macro-scale, continuum characteristics. Dilatancy is an important
   property of granular materials, defined as volume changes (dilative or
   compressive) induced by shear deformation. To obtain detailed
   information at the micro-scale, two-dimensional Discrete Element Method
   simulations of isobaric tests with disk-shaped particles have been
   performed. The required information includes the fabric tensor which
   characterizes statistical properties of the contact network.
   The dependence of the dilatancy rate on the shear strength and the
   fabric tensor has been investigated, based on the results of the
   simulations employing a dense and a loose initial system. The dilatancy
   rate depends in a complex, non-unique way on the shear strength, while
   the dependence on the fabric tensor is more amenable to analytical
   description. Two micromechanical mechanisms of dilatancy have been
   identified: (i) dilatancy due to deformation of loops that are
   determined by the interparticle contact network and (ii) dilatancy due
   to topological changes in the interparticle contact network that
   correspond to the creation or disruption of contacts. For the first
   mechanism the anisotropy in the contact network is the primary
   parameter, while for the second mechanism the average number of contacts
   per particle is the primary parameter.
   A fabric-based micromechanical relation for the dilatancy rate has been
   formulated that describes these identified mechanisms. Parameters
   present in this relation are determined by fitting this relation to the
   results of the Discrete Element Method simulations, using combined data
   for the dense and the loose initial system. Employing these fitted
   coefficients, good agreement is obtained between the results of the
   simulations and the predictions of the micromechanical dilatancy
   relation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we added several aromatic amine compounds as dopants to
   an ambipolar polymer semiconductor, PDBTAZ, and studied the charge
   transport behavior of the doped polymer thin films in organic thin film
   transistors. The trap energy (E-T), which is the HOMO energy difference
   between the amine dopant and the polymer, was found related to the hole
   transport suppression effect of these amines. For an amine with E-T <
   0.25 eV, at a 2\% dopant concentration, little changes in the hole
   transport characteristics of the doped polymer films were observed. In
   contrast, for an amine with E-T > 0.25 eV, complete hole transport
   suppression was realized. This study offers a useful approach to
   converting an ambipolar polymer semiconductor into a unipolar n-type

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{49-63}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study was undertaken to investigate the influence of
   freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) on the seismic performance of shear wall
   specimens. Four identical squat reinforced concrete (RC) shear wall
   specimens were tested; three were subjected to 100, 200 and 300 FTCs,
   and the other one was left undisturbed and used as a control specimen.
   The shear wall specimens were loaded in a reverse cyclic manner, and the
   principal damage states were investigated throughout the testing
   process. The responses of the wall specimens were initially dominated by
   flexural cracking but gradually changed to shear cracking; the damage
   patterns of the wall specimens gradually changed from diagonal tensile
   failure to compressive failure, as the number of FTCs increased. Based
   on the test results of this study, the effects of FTCs on the damage
   characteristics, hysteretic behavior, ductility, secant stiffness
   degradation, strength degradation and energy dissipation capacity of the
   samples were analyzed. The test results indicate that FTCs have
   significant effects on the seismic performances of shear walls. As the
   number of FTCs increases, the load-carrying capacity decreases
   significantly, and the contribution of shear deformation increases
   significantly. Specimens experiencing more FTCs tend to have larger
   ductility coefficients and plastic rotation magnitudes. Note that the
   energy dissipation coefficient and cumulative hysteretic dissipation
   energy are more sensitive to changes in the number of FTCs than the work
   index. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   equalizers for the amplify-and-forward cooperative systems. In the
   proposed equalization schemes, the sampling rate of the received signal
   remains at least as high as the Nyquist rate within the digital
   processing chain of the relay node(s), upon which a true
   fractionally-spaced equalization becomes feasible at the destination.
   Based on minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion, different
   equalization structures (linear and non-linear) are designed, and
   approximations for their bit error rate (BER) performance are presented.
   The BER performance of the proposed schemes are further lower bounded
   through a matched-filter bound (MFB) analysis which provides insight
   into system design such as optimum power allocation and relay selection
   strategy. Our results show that, under certain channel realizations and
   sampling phase errors (that may occur in the relay and destination
   terminals), the performance of the conventional symbol-spaced
   cooperative systems reduces to that of no relay scenario. However, the
   performance of cooperative systems with the proposed fractionally-spaced
   equalizers is independent of the samplers' phases, and as a result, full
   benefit of cooperation is retained.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the rate of heat generation in a lithium-ion cell is
   critical for its safety and performance behavior. This paper presents in
   situ measurements of the heat generation rate for a prismatic
   Lithium-ion battery at 1C, 2C, 3C and 4C discharge rates and 5 degrees
   C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C boundary conditions
   (BCs). For this work, an aluminum-laminated battery consisting of
   LiFePO4 cathode material with 20 Ah capacity was adopted to investigate
   the variation of the rate of heat generation as a function of the
   discharge capacity. Ten thermocouples and three heat flux sensors were
   applied to the battery surface at distributed locations. The results of
   this study show that the highest rate of heat generation was found to be
   91 W for 4C discharge rate and 5 degrees C BC while the minimum value
   was 13 W measured at 1C discharge rate and 35 degrees C BC. It was also
   found that the increase in discharge rate and thus the discharge current
   caused consistent increase in the heat generation rate for equal depth
   of discharge points. A model is later developed using the neural network
   approach and validated. The heat generation rate predicted by the model
   demonstrates an identical behavior with experimental results. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A novel method for detecting and sizing airborne particles at single
   particle level is presented in this paper. When a particle hits a metal
   electrode which is grounded, electrostatic charges will be transferred
   between the particle and the electrode. As a result, an electrical
   current pulse will be generated in the measurement system. The number of
   the signal pulse represents the number of particles in the sample. To
   determine the effect of the particle size on the magnitude of the
   signal, the correlation between the magnitude of the signal and the size
   of particle was experimentally investigated. The results show that the
   magnitude of the measured signal is linearly proportional to the square
   of particle's diameter. Such a correlation can be used to evaluate
   particle size from the measured signal. The airborne particle detection
   method presented in this paper can be used for counting and sizing
   airborne particles at single particle level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A solvent-free electrostatic separation method was employed to separate
   navy bean flour (NBF) into protein-rich (PR) and starch-rich (SR)
   fractions. The physicochemical properties of NBF and separated fractions
   were compared to proteins (navy bean isolate (NBI) and 7S globulin)
   prepared using a wet process. Gel electrophoresis confirmed that the
   protein distribution in the isolated fractions was similar to that of
   NBF. The protein profile of NBI and 7S globulin was found to be devoid
   of certain proteins that were found in the NBF and PR fraction. Amino
   acid analysis revealed that the NBI and 7S globulin had a lower content
   of sulfur-containing amino acids compared to NBF and the
   electrostatically isolated fractions. CD and fluorescence spectroscopy
   confirmed that denaturation of the proteins during the acid
   precipitation is likely. This novel solvent-free electrostatic
   separation process preserves the native protein structure found in NBF
   and improves the recovery of some of the smaller MW proteins. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Acquiring reliable and efficient wearable electronics requires the
   development of flexible electrolyte membranes (EMs) for energy storage
   systems with high performance and minimum dependency on the operating

   functionalized with 1-hexy1-3-methylimidazolium chloride (HMIM)
   molecules via both covalent and noncovalent bonds induced by
   esterification reactions and electrostatic pi(cation)-pi stacking,

   HMIM/GO membrane demonstrates not only slightest performance sensitivity
   to the operating conditions but also a superior hydroxide conductivity
   of 0.064 0.0021 S cm-1 at 30\% RH and room temperature, which was 3.8

Abstract = {{This Rapid Communication presents a structure and full theoretical
   analysis to exploit the photon drag effect for THz signal generation in
   a graphene layer integrated with a plasmonic structure. The plasmonic
   structure is composed of a periodic array of asymmetric nanoparticles
   patterned over a graphene layer. The nanoparticles are designed to
   accomplish two goals: field localization due to the plasmonic resonance
   and manipulating the phase of the near field to effectively drag the
   quasiparticles in graphene. Combining the asymmetry with the plasmon
   resonances of nanoparticles, we show that an enhancement as large as
   three orders of magnitude is attainable in the power of the generated
   THz wave. This level of unprecedented enhancement mostly stems from the
   phase manipulation of the near field caused by asymmetric nanoparticles.
   Using the achieved enhancement, it is demonstrated that an
   ultra-wideband THz signal carrying the power of 1 mu W can be generated
   using a commercially available femtosecond pulsed laser.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of Cu2O films from an alkaline copper-lactate electrolyte
   using potentiostatic pulse electrodeposition has been conducted. The
   effects of the frequency, duty cycle, potential amplitude and
   electrolyte composition during pulsed electrodeposition on the resulting
   Cu2O morphology, crystal structure and orientation have been
   investigated in detail. Comparisons are made with films produced by
   potentiostatic DC deposition in the same electrolyte. An increase in the
   pulse frequency or reduction in the duty cycle causes the Cu2O grains to
   become less cubic and more spherical as the crystal growth in the < 111
   > direction becomes less dominant and growth in the < 100 > direction
   becomes more favored. Higher Cu(II) concentration, lower electrolyte pH
   and smaller cathodic overpotential have a similar effect and leads to
   the formation of Cu2O crystals with distinct or truncated octahedral
   shapes through pulsed electrodeposition. Overall, the application of a
   pulsed potential waveform during Cu2O electrodeposition in alkaline
   electrolyte enables the formation of Cu2O films with controllable
   morphology with lesser need to alter the electrolyte composition or
   temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of recombinant proteins exerts stress on cell culture
   systems, affecting the expression of endogenous proteins, and
   contributing to the depletion of nutrients and accumulation of waste
   metabolites. In this work, 2D-DIGE proteomics was employed to analyze
   differential expression of proteins following stable transfection of a
   Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line to constitutively express a heavy
   chain monoclonal antibody. Thirty-four proteins of significant
   differential expression were identified and cross-referenced with
   cellular functions and metabolic pathways to identify points of cell
   stress. Subsequently, 1D-H-1 NMR metabolomics experiments analyzed
   cultures to observe nutrient depletion and waste metabolite
   accumulations to further examine these cell stresses and pathways. From
   among fifty metabolites tracked in time-course, eight were observed to
   be completely depleted from the production media, including: glucose,
   glutamine, proline, serine, cystine, asparagine, choline, and
   hypoxanthine, while twenty-three excreted metabolites were also observed
   to accumulate. The differentially expressed proteins, as well as the
   nutrient depletion and accumulation of these metabolites corresponded
   with upregulated pathways and cell systems related to anaplerotic
   TCA-replenishment, NADH/NADPH replenishment, tetrahydrofolate cycle Cl
   cofactor conversions, limitations to lipid synthesis, and redox
   modulation. A nutrient cocktail was assembled to improve the growth
   medium and alleviate these cell stresses to achieve a similar to 75\%
   improvement to peak cell densities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   central fermentative metabolism in Clostridium pasteurianum}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Clostridium pasteurianum is emerging as a prospective host for the
   production of biofuels and chemicals, and has recently been shown to
   directly consume electric current. Despite this growing biotechnological
   appeal, the organism's genetics and central metabolism remain poorly
   understood. Here we present a concurrent genome sequence for the C.
   pasteurianum type strain and provide extensive genomic analysis of the
   organism's defence mechanisms and central fermentative metabolism. Next
   generation genome sequencing produced reads corresponding to spontaneous
   excision of a novel phage, designated phi 6013, which could be induced
   using mitomycin C and detected using PCR and transmission electron
   microscopy. Methylome analysis of sequencing reads provided a
   near-complete glimpse into the organism's restriction-modification
   systems. We also unveiled the chief C. pasteurianum Clustered Regularly
   Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) locus, which was found to
   exemplify a Type I-B system. Finally, we show that C. pasteurianum
   possesses a highly complex fermentative metabolism whereby the metabolic
   pathways enlisted by the cell is governed by the degree of reductance of
   the substrate. Four distinct fermentation profiles, ranging from
   exclusively acidogenic to predominantly alcohologenic, were observed
   through redox consideration of the substrate. A detailed discussion of
   the organism's central metabolism within the context of metabolic
   engineering is provided.}},

Abstract = {{There exists a fundamental trade-off between the spectral resolution and
   the efficiency or throughput for all optical spectrometers. The primary
   factors affecting the spectral resolution and throughput of an optical
   spectrometer are the size of the entrance aperture and the optical power

   above mentioned has proven difficult. Here, we introduce the concept of
   high-throughput computational slits (HTCS), a numerical technique for
   improving both the effective spectral resolution and efficiency of a
   spectrometer. The proposed HTCS approach was experimentally validated
   using an optical spectrometer configured with a 200 mu m entrance
   aperture, test, and a 50 mu m entrance aperture control, demonstrating
   improvements in the spectral resolution of the spectrum by similar to
   50\% over the control spectral resolution and improvements in efficiency
   of >2 times over the efficiency of the largest entrance aperture used in
   this Letter, while producing highly accurate spectra. (C) 2016 Optical

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in soft magnetic films (SMFs) to a large
   extent determines the maximum working frequency of magnetic devices. The
   FMR frequency (fr) in an optical mode is usually much higher than that
   in the corresponding acoustic mode for exchange coupled
   ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet (FM/NM/FM) trilayers. In this study,
   we prepared a 50 nm FeCoB film with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA),
   showing a high acoustic mode fr of 4.17 GHz. When an ultrathin Ru spacer
   was inserted in the very middle of the UMA-FeCoB film, the zero-field
   FMR was abruptly switched from an acoustic mode to an optical one with
   fr dramatically enhanced from 4.17 GHz to 11.32 GHz. Furthermore, the
   FMR mode can be readily tuned to optical mode only, acoustic mode only,
   or double mode by simply varying the applied filed, which provides a
   flexible way to design multi-band microwave devices.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing the penetration of wind power, the voltage regulation
   becomes a more important problem in active distribution networks. In
   addition, as an uncertain load Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) will
   introduce a new concern in voltage adjustment of future distribution
   networks. Hence, this paper presents a flexible active-reactive power
   based Wind Distributed Generation (WDG) planning procedure to address
   the mentioned challenges. The uncertainties related to WDG5, load demand
   as well as PEV5 load have been handled using the Point Estimate Method
   (PEM). The distribution network under study is equipped to
   on-loadtap-changer and, as a conventional voltage control component, the
   Capacitor Banks (CBs) will be planned simultaneously with WDGs. The
   planning procedure has been considered as a two-loop optimization
   problem that is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu
   Search (TS) algorithms. The tap position and power factor of WDGs are
   taken into account as stochastic variables with practical limitations.
   The proposed methodology is applied to a typical distribution network
   and several scenarios are considered and analyzed. Simulation results
   show that the standard deviation of power factor depends on PEVs
   penetration that highlights the capability curve of WDG5. The optimal
   penetration of wind power increases nonlinearly versus increasing of
   PEV5 connected to the distribution network, however the fixed CBs are
   required to increase the optimal penetration of WDGs. The proposed
   Modified PSO (MPSO) is compared with the conventional PSO in numerical
   studies that show MPSO is more efficient than the conventional algorithm
   for this analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A strategic analysis of the ongoing conflict between Nevada and Utah,
   over groundwater allocation at Snake Valley, is carried out in order to
   investigate ways on how to resolve this dispute. More specifically, the
   Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is employed to formally model and
   analyze this conflict using the decision support system called GMCR+.
   The conflict analysis findings indicate that the dispute is enduring
   because of a lack of incentive and opportunity for any party to move
   beyond the present circumstances. Continued negotiations are not likely
   to resolve this conflict. A substantial change in the preferences or
   options of the disputants, or new governance tools will be required to
   move this conflict forward. This may hold lessons for future groundwater
   conflicts. It is, however, increasingly likely that the parties will
   require a third party intervention, such as equal apportionment by the
   US Supreme Court. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{351-361}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Organic micropollutants found in the environment are a diverse group of
   compounds that includes pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and
   endocrine disruptors. Their presence in the aquatic environment
   continues to be a concern as the risk they pose towards both the
   environment and human health is still inconclusive. Removal of these
   compounds from water and wastewater is difficult to achieve and often
   incomplete, but UV-TiO2 is a promising treatment approach. In this
   study, the efficiency of titanium dioxide (TiO2) immobilized on porous
   supports were tested for treatment of target pharmaceuticals and their
   metabolites under UV-LED exposure, a potential low energy and cost
   effective alternative to conventional UV lamps. Immobilization was
   completed using two different methods: (1) dip coating of TiO2 onto
   quartz fiber filters (QFT) or (2) thermal-chemical oxidation of porous
   titanium sheets (PIT). Comparison against experimental controls (dark
   QFT, dark PTT, and photolysis using UV LED only) showed that UV-LED/PTT
   and UV-LED/QFT treatments have the potential to reduce the
   concentrations of the target compounds. However, the treatments were
   found to be selective, such that individual pharmaceuticals were removed
   well using QFT and FIT but not both. The complementary treatment
   behavior is likely driven by electrostatic interactions of charged
   compounds with the membranes. QFT membranes are negatively charged at
   the experimental pH (4.5-5) while FIT membranes are positively charged.
   As a result, cationic compounds interact more with QFT while anionic
   compounds with FIT. Neutral compounds, however, were found to be
   recalcitrant under any treatment conditions suggesting that ionic
   interactions were important for reactions to occur. This behavior can be
   advantageous if specificity is required. The behavior of pharmaceutical
   metabolites is similar to the parent compounds. However, isomeric
   metabolites of atorvastatin with functional groups in para and ortho
   configurations behave differently, suggesting that the positioning of
   functional groups can have an impact in their interaction with the
   immobilized TiO2. It was also apparent that FIT can be reused after
   cleaning by heat treatment. Overall, these newly synthesized membrane
   materials have potential applications for treatment of trace organic
   contaminants in water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tempered martensite obtained from four different tempering modes were
   characterized using transmission electron microscopy, high-angle annular

   nanoindentation techniques. Crystallographic analysis of tempered
   martensite revealed that ferrite (alpha) and cementite (theta) obtained

   Bagaryatsky orientation relationship. A strict orientation relationship
   between ferrite and cementite could not be determined on the tempered
   structure extracted from the sub-critical heat affected zone of two
   different laser beam welded samples. Extensive recovery and reduction of
   boundary regions was identified on the structure tempered slowly,

Pages = {{229-240}},

Abstract = {{The removal of mercury (II) from water by polymer-enhanced
   ultrafiltration (PEUF) was carried out using polyethylenimine (PEI),
   polyvinylamine (PVAm) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as the metal-binding
   polymers. All three water-soluble polymers had strong interactions with
   mercury (II) in aqueous solutions, and a high mercury rejection was
   achieved with PEUF. At a given polymer dosage, the permeate flux
   followed the order of PVAm > PEI > PAA, presumably due to different
   physiochemical properties (e.g., viscosity and interfacial property) of
   the solution systems. Membrane fouling by PVAm and PEI in cross-flow
   mode was insignificant, but the flux decline due to fouling by PAA was
   not negligible. The batch operation of PEUF was modeled based on mass
   balance, and the applicability of the model equations was validated with
   experimental data. For a given system, the mercury content in the
   concentrated retentate, the mercury retention rate, the batch time and
   membrane area needed to achieve a desired separation task could be
   predicted if prior knowledge of concentration dependences of permeate
   flux and solute rejection were known. The effects of the amount of feed
   solution to be treated per unit membrane area on the separation
   performance of batch PEUF was analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Rapid and portable diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria can save lives lost
   from infectious diseases. Biosensors based on a ``chemical nose{''}
   approach are attracting interest because they are versatile but the
   governing interactions between bacteria and the biosensors are poorly
   understood. Here, we use a ``chemical nose{''} biosensor based on gold
   nanoparticles to explore the role of extracellular polymeric substances
   in bacteria-nanoparticle interactions. We employ simulations using
   Maxwell-Garnett theory to show how the type and extent of aggregation of
   nanoparticles influence their colorimetric response to bacteria. Using
   eight different species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, we
   demonstrate that this ``chemical nose{''} can detect and identify
   bacteria over two orders of magnitude of concentration (89\% accuracy).
   Additionally, the ``chemical nose{''} differentiates between binary and
   tertiary mixtures of the three most common hospital-isolated pathogens:
   Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   (100\% accuracy). We demonstrate that the complex interactions between
   nanoparticles and bacterial surface determine the colorimetric response
   of gold nanoparticles and thus, govern the performance of ``chemical
   nose{''} biosensors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional vertically aligned nano- and micropillars have emerged
   as promising tools for a variety of biological applications. Despite
   their increasing usage, the interaction mechanisms of cells with these
   rigid structures and their effect on single- and collective-cell
   behaviors are not well understood for different cell types. In the
   present study, we examine the response of glioma cells to micropillar
   arrays using a new microfabricated platform consisting of rigid silicon
   micropillar arrays of various shapes, sizes, and configurations
   fabricated on a single platform. We compare collective- and single-cell
   behaviors at micropillar array interfaces and show that glial cells
   under identical chemical conditions form distinct arrangements on arrays
   of different shapes and sizes. Tumor-like aggregation and branching of
   glial cells only occur on arrays with feature diameters greater than 2
   mu m, and distinct transitions are observed at interfaces between
   various arrays on the platform. Additionally, despite the same
   side-to-side spacing and gaps between micropillars, single glial cells
   interact with the flat silicon surface in the gap between small pillars
   but sit on top of larger micropillars. Furthermore, micropillars induced
   local changes in stress fibers and actin-rich filopodia protrusions as
   the cells conformed to the shape of spatial cues formed by these
   micropillars.}},

Title = {{Identifying model error in metabolic flux analysis - a generalized least
   squares approach}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The estimation of intracellular flux through traditional
   metabolic flux analysis (MFA) using an overdetermined system of
   equations is a well established practice in metabolic engineering.
   Despite the continued evolution of the methodology since its
   introduction, there has been little focus on validation and
   identification of poor model fit outside of identifying ``gross
   measurement error{''}. The growing complexity of metabolic models, which
   are increasingly generated from genome-level data, has necessitated
   robust validation that can directly assess model fit.
   Results: In this work, MFA calculation is framed as a generalized least
   squares (GLS) problem, highlighting the applicability of the common
   t-test for model validation. To differentiate between measurement and
   model error, we simulate ideal flux profiles directly from the model,
   perturb them with estimated measurement error, and compare their
   validation to real data. Application of this strategy to an established
   Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell model shows how fluxes validated by
   traditional means may be largely non-significant due to a lack of model
   fit. With further simulation, we explore how t-test significance relates
   to calculation error and show that fluxes found to be non-significant
   have 2-4 fold larger error (if measurement uncertainty is in the 5-10\%
   range).
   Conclusions: The proposed validation method goes beyond traditional
   detection of ``gross measurement error{''} to identify lack of fit
   between model and data. Although the focus of this work is on t-test
   validation and traditional MFA, the presented framework is readily
   applicable to other regression analysis methods and MFA formulations.}},

Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{We study a system consisting of a superconducting flux qubit strongly
   coupled to a microwave cavity. The fundamental cavity mode is externally
   driven and the response is investigated in the weak nonlinear regime. We
   find that near the crossing point, at which the resonance frequencies of
   the cavity mode and qubit coincide, the sign of the Kerr coefficient
   changes, and consequently the type of nonlinear response changes from
   softening to hardening. Furthermore, the cavity response exhibits
   superharmonic resonances (SHR) when the ratio between the qubit
   frequency and the cavity fundamental mode frequency is tuned close to an
   integer value. The nonlinear response is characterized by the method of
   intermodulation and both signal and idler gains are measured. The
   experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions and good
   qualitative agreement is obtained. The SHRs have potential for
   applications in quantum amplification and generation of entangled states
   of light.}},

Abstract = {{We present a micro-scale microbial fuel cell (MFC) with an
   ultramicroelectrode (UME) anode, with the aim of creating a miniaturized
   high-current/power-density converter using carbon-neutral and renewable
   energy sources. Micro-scale MFCs have been studied for more than a
   decade, yet their current and power densities are still an order of
   magnitude lower than those of their macro-scale counterparts. In order
   to enhance the current/power densities, we engineer a concentric
   ring-shaped UME, with a width of 20 mu m, to facilitate the diffusion of
   ions in the vicinity of the micro-organisms that form biofilm on the
   UME. The biofilm extends approximately 15 mu m from the edge of the UME,
   suggesting the effective biofilm area increases. Measured current/power
   densities per the effective area and the original anode area are 7.08
   +/- 0.01 A m(-2) \& 3.09 +/- 0.04 W m(-2) and 17.7 +/- 0.03 A m(-2) \&
   7.72 +/- 0.09 W m(-2), respectively. This is substantially higher than
   any prior work in micro-scale MFCs, and very close, or even higher, to
   that of macro-scale MFCs. A Coulombic efficiency, a measure of how
   efficiently an MFC harvests electrons from donor substrate, of 70\%, and
   an energy conversion efficiency of 17\% are marked, highlighting the
   micro-scale MFC as an attractive alternative within the existing energy
   conversion portfolio.}},

Title = {{High-Speed Railway Train Timetable Conflict Prediction Based on Fuzzy
   Temporal Knowledge Reasoning}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Trains are prone to delays and deviations from train operation plans
   during their operation because of internal or external disturbances.
   Delays may develop into operational conflicts between adjacent trains as
   a result of delay propagation, which may disturb the arrangement of the
   train operation plan and threaten the operational safety of trains.
   Therefore, reliable conflict prediction results can be valuable
   references for dispatchers in making more efficient train operation
   adjustments when conflicts occur. In contrast to the traditional
   approach to conflict prediction that involves introducing random
   disturbances, this study addresses the issue of the fuzzification of
   time intervals in a train timetable based on historical statistics and
   the modeling of a high-speed railway train timetable based on the
   concept of a timed Petri net. To measure conflict prediction results
   more comprehensively, we divided conflicts into potential conflicts and
   certain conflicts and defined the judgment conditions for both. Two
   evaluation indexes, one for the deviation of a single train and one for
   the possibility of conflicts between adjacent train operations, were
   developed using a formalized computation method. Based on the temporal
   fuzzy reasoning method, with some adjustment, a new conflict prediction
   method is proposed, and the results of a simulation example for two
   scenarios are presented. The results prove that conflict prediction
   after fuzzy processing of the time intervals of a train timetable is
   more reliable and practical and can provide helpful information for use
   in train operation adjustment, train timetable improvement, and other
   purposes. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of

Abstract = {{Protective devices of smart and fault-resilient microgrids are not
   expected to trip the healthy phases during unbalanced short-circuits.
   Thus, some utilities and relay manufacturers have started contemplating
   single-and double-pole tripping for distribution systems. Selective
   phase tripping demands fault type classification. This paper reveals
   that existing industrial methods misidentify the fault type in
   microgrids that include photovoltaic distributed generations (DGs). Due
   to interface similarities, this paper pertains to systems with type IV
   wind DGs as well. Two new classifiers proposed in this paper determine
   the fault type accurately for not only microgrids with photovoltaic DGs,
   but for any three-phase system. With low computational burden, they
   require only local information and operate successfully for high
   resistance faults. Furthermore, these techniques are not affected by the
   system imbalance and different DG power factors over disturbances.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{54-60}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{D2D communications offer various benefits such as coverage extension and
   high energy efficiency. For example, a cluster of in-coverage devices
   can be recruited to relay packets for an out-of-coverage device. As the
   helper devices can be subject to varying relay costs and resource
   constraints, a sequence of packets need to be properly assigned among
   the helpers. In this article, we study the packet assignment problem
   from a mechanism design's perspective, taking into account the strategic
   interactions of self-interested helpers. Fundamental concepts in
   mechanism design are introduced for general readers to understand the
   background. Auctions are an important application of mechanism design
   and widely used in many fields. We develop a reverse auction mechanism,
   consisting of an allocation rule and a payment rule, to assign packets
   among helpers and determine payments based on their declared costs and
   resource constraints. As it is NP-hard to find an optimal packet
   assignment that minimizes the total cost, we use a low-complexity
   allocation rule, which performs closely to the optimal allocation on
   average. The payment rule implements the allocation rule in dominant
   strategies in which helpers disclose their true costs and resource
   constraints. This truthful revelation in turn justifies the allocation
   according to the helpers' declaration. Numerical analysis and
   simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance.}},

Abstract = {{With the increased use of renewable energy, energy storage technologies
   are becoming increasingly important. One such technology is
   Power-to-Gas, which can provide seasonal energy storage by utilizing
   both the electrical and natural gas infrastructures through injecting
   hydrogen into existing gas infrastructure to create Underground Storage
   of Hydrogen and Natural Gas (UHNG). The hydrogen is recovered from the
   mixture as needed for industry or transportation applications, converted
   to electricity to meet power demand, or kept as a mixture of
   hydrogen-enriched natural gas to serve gas demand. Large scale energy
   storage is desirable to energy generation operators for its ability try
   manage excess base load energy, integrate renewable energy into the grid
   and provide long term energy storage. The authors investigate the
   financial and environmental performance of specific scenarios of UHNG
   produced by Power-to-Gas through scenario-based simulations in a
   MATLAB/Simulink for comparative purposes. The simulated scenarios
   include the injection of hydrogen for long term storage, load shifting,
   renewable energy integration and supplying a large hydrogen demand. All
   of these scenarios are compared to a base case which simulates the
   operations of a conventional underground gas storage facility. The
   analysis illustrates that existing natural gas storage practices are
   driven by variations in the demand for natural gas. The most desirable
   pathway for energy recovery and revenue in this analysis occurs when
   hydrogen is injected into the reservoir along with natural gas and is
   distributed to off-site users. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, we evaluate geomechanics of fluid injection from a
   fully penetrating vertical well into an un-consolidated formation
   confined with stiff seal rocks. The coupled behavior of an isotropic,
   homogeneous sand layer is studied under injection pressures that are
   high enough to induce plasticity yet not fracturing. Propagation of the
   significant influence zone surrounding the injection borehole,
   quantified by the extent of the plastic domain in the elasto-plastic
   model, is examined for the first time. First, a new fully coupled
   axisymmetric numerical model is developed. A comprehensive assessment is
   performed on pore pressures, stresses/strains, and failure planes during
   the entire transient period of an injection cycle. Results anticipate
   existence of five distinctive zones in terms of plasticity state:
   liquefaction at wellbore; two inner plastic domains surrounding the
   wellbore, where failure occurs along two planes and major principal
   stress is in vertical direction; remaining of the plastic domain, where
   formation fails along one plane and major principal stress is in radial
   direction; and a non-plastic region. Failure mechanism at the wellbore
   is found to be shear followed by liquefaction. Next, a novel methodology
   is proposed based on which new weakly coupled poroelasto-plastic
   analytical solutions are derived for all three stress/strain components.
   Unlike previous studies, extension of the plastic zone is obtained as a
   function of injection pressure, incorporating plasticity effects on the
   subsequent elastic domain. Solutions, proven to be a good approximation
   of numerical simulations, offer a huge advantage as the run time of
   coupled numerical simulations is considerably long. Copyright (C) 2016

   and Pietrzak in 2010. Our first contribution is a variant of the bounded
   leakage and the only-computation-leaks model that is closer to practice.
   We weaken the restriction on the image size of the leakage functions in
   these models and only insist that the inputs to the leakage functions
   have sufficient min-entropy left, in spite of the leakage, with no
   limitation on the quantity of this leakage. We provide a novel security
   reduction for BEG-KEM in this relaxed leakage model using the generic
   bilinear group axiom. Secondly, we show that a naive implementation of
   the exponentiation in BEG-KEM makes it impossible to meet the leakage
   bound. Instead of trying to find an exponentiation algorithm that meets
   the leakage axiom (which is a non-trivial problem in practice), we
   propose an advanced scheme, BEG-KEM+, that avoids exponentiation by a
   secret value, but rather uses an encoding into the base group due to
   Fouque and Tibouchi. Thirdly, we present a software implementation of
   BEG-KEM+ based on the Miracl library and provide detailed experimental
   results. We also assess its (theoretical) resistance against power
   analysis attacks from a practical perspective, taking into account the
   state-of-the-art in side-channel cryptanalysis.}},

   mass) were quantified from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In
   addition to establishing a body segment parameter database of Paralympic
   athletes for prospective biomechanists and engineers, the mass of each
   body segment as experimentally measured via the DXA imaging was compared
   with that reported by previous research of able-bodied cadavers. In
   general, there were significant differences in the body segment masses
   between the different methods. These findings support the implementation
   of the proposed database for developing valid multibody biomechanical

Abstract = {{Particle separation has found practical applications in many areas from
   industry to academia. Current electrokinetic particle separation
   techniques primarily rely on dielectrophoresis, where the electric field
   gradients are generated by either active microelectrodes or inert
   micro-insulators. We develop herein a new type of electrokinetic method
   to continuously separate particles in a bifurcating micro-channel. This
   sheath-free separation makes use of the inherent wall-induced electrical
   lift to focus particles towards the centerline of the main-branch and
   then deflect them to size-dependent flow paths in each side-branch. A
   theoretical model is also developed to understand such a size-based
   separation, which simulates the experimental observations with a good
   agreement. This electric field-driven sheathless separation can
   potentially be operated in a parallel or cascade mode to increase the
   particle throughput or resolution. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{This article identifies previously unknown, fundamental constraints on
   the effectiveness of economic policy instruments. The constraints arise
   from unstable zero dynamics, which occur commonly in macroeconomic
   models, and require (in the linear, time-invariant case) that infinite

   necessarily equal zero, irrespective of policy. Unstable zero dynamics
   potentially explain the ``price puzzle,{''} and are exemplified by
   classic explanations of the effect of changes in the rate of money
   creation on interest rates. They furnish a mathematical formulation of
   elements of Minsky's financial instability hypothesis. In the
   multivariable case, they give rise to constraints involving multiple
   endogenous variables, which relate to the Phillips curve and Okun's Law,

Abstract = {{The relationships between non-contact anterior cruciate ligament
   injuries and the underlying biomechanics are still unclear, despite
   large quantities of academic research. The purpose of this research was
   to study anterior cruciate ligament strain during jump landing by
   investigating its correlation with sagittal plane kinetic/kinematic
   parameters and by creating an empirical model to estimate the maximum
   strain. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured
   from seven subjects performing single leg jump landing and were used to
   drive a musculoskeletal model that estimated lower limb muscle forces.
   These muscle forces and kinematics were then applied on five
   instrumented cadaver knees using a dynamic knee simulator system.
   Correlation analysis revealed that higher ground reaction force, lower
   hip flexion angle and higher hip extension moment among others were
   correlated with higher peak strain (p<0.05). Multivariate regression
   analyses revealed that intrinsic anatomic factors account for most of
   the variance in strain. Among the extrinsic variables, hip and trunk
   flexion angles significantly contributed to the strain. The empirical
   relationship developed in this study could be used to predict the
   relative strain between jumps of a participant and may be beneficial in
   developing training programs designed to reduce an athlete's risk of

Abstract = {{This study explores the relationship between coherent eddies and zonally
   elongated striations. The investigation involves an analysis of two
   baroclinic quasigeostrophic models of a zonal and double-gyre flow and a
   set of altimetry sea level anomaly data in the North Pacific. Striations
   are defined by either spatio-temporal filtering or empirical orthogonal
   functions (EOFs), with both approaches leading to consistent results.
   Coherent eddies, identified here by the modified Okubo-Weiss parameter,
   tend to propagate along well-defined paths, thus forming ``eddy trains''
   that coincide with striations. The striations and eddy trains tend to
   drift away from the intergyre boundary at the same speed in both the
   model and observations. The EOF analysis further confirms that these
   striations in model simulations and altimetry are not an artifact of
   temporal averaging of random, spatially uncorrelated vortices. This
   study suggests instead that eddies organize into eddy trains, which
   manifest themselves as striations in low-pass filtered data and EOF
   modes.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays there is a world concern on the impact and effect of large CO2
   atmospheric concentrations on human health. Fossil-fuel combustion
   processes in power plants are among the major contributors to this
   issue. Hence, it becomes important to develop new clean and sustainable
   processes aimed to reduce the amount of CO2 released to atmosphere by
   combustion processes in power plants. One of the best feasible manners
   to achieve this purposes lies in the use of a closed-loop control system
   able to keep the amount of green-house gases under specification even in
   the presence of unexpected scenarios. Of course, CO2 capture has been
   extensively researched in the past. However, in this regard the
   industrial practice has consisted in using Amines leading to
   sustainability and safety issues. Hence, it makes sense to seek for new
   and potentially environmental friendly process design to address CO2
   reduction from power plants but applying a new type of sustainable
   stripping solvents. In this work we address the sustainable CO2
   reduction issue from a process control point of view applying a previous
   design proposed by our research team based on the deployment of Ionic
   Liquids (IL) as potential green solvents and developing an efficient and
   decentralized multiloop control system. We demonstrate that the
   closed-loop system is able to maintain the CO2 concentration levels
   under specification by testing in presence of several demanding
   scenarios. Overall, from an economic, sustainable and control point of
   view it looks feasible to replace the traditional amines-based CO2
   capture process by other alternatives based on the application of IL as
   potential green solvents. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{In this paper, recent fatigue tests conducted on welded specimens
   subjected to high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment are
   described, geometry measurements and metallurgical analyses of the
   tested specimens are presented, and efforts to estimate the test results
   using a nonlinear fracture mechanics model are discussed. The specimens
   were fabricated from 9.5-mm-thick (3/8 in.) aluminum (5083-H321) and
   high-strength steel (ASTM A514) plate. The specimen geometry and
   preparation followed procedures used in previous studies on mild steel
   (CSA 350W). Fatigue tests were performed on the as-welded and
   impact-treated specimens under two loading histories (constant amplitude
   with and without periodic under-loads) at several equivalent stress
   ranges. Residual stress distributions were determined by x-ray
   diffraction. In addition, weld toe geometry measurements were obtained
   using silicon impressions and micro-hardness distributions were obtained
   on polished weld samples for each material type. This information was
   used to establish parameter values for a nonlinear fracture mechanics
   analysis. The employed fracture mechanics model is reviewed in this
   paper, and its benefits as a tool for modelling the fatigue behavior of
   impact-treated welds are discussed. Following this, the effectiveness of
   the model in estimating the test results for the three materials is

Abstract = {{Modeled after the hierarchical control architecture of power
   transmission systems, a layering of primary, secondary, and tertiary
   control has become the standard operation paradigm for islanded
   microgrids. Despite this superficial similarity, the control objectives
   in microgrids across these three layers are varied and ambitious, and
   they must be achieved while allowing for robust plug-and-play operation
   and maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision making and
   time-scale separations. In this paper, we explore control strategies for
   these three layers and illuminate some possibly unexpected connections
   and dependencies among them. Building from a first-principle analysis of
   decentralized primary droop control, we study centralized,
   decentralized, and distributed architectures for secondary frequency
   regulation. We find that averaging-based distributed controllers using
   communication among the generation units offer the best combination of
   flexibility and performance. We further leverage these results to study
   constrained ac economic dispatch in a tertiary control layer.
   Surprisingly, we show that the minimizers of the economic dispatch
   problem are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of steady states
   reachable by droop control. In other words, the adoption of droop
   control is necessary and sufficient to achieve economic optimization.
   This equivalence results in simple guidelines to select the droop
   coefficients, which include the known criteria for power sharing. We
   illustrate the performance and robustness of our designs through
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) enables vehicles to access
   the Internet through roadside access points (APs). An important issue in
   system deployment is determining how many roadside APs shall be
   installed on a road. However, the existing works fail to provide
   rigorous and accurate analysis for VANETs. In this paper, we propose a
   general structure for Internet access in VANETs. It allows both
   real-time traffic and delay-tolerant traffic to be delivered to users in
   the most efficient ways. An analytical model is also proposed to analyze
   the system performance with random arrival of the vehicles. We finally
   develop an AP placement algorithm based on theoretical results derived
   from the model to deploy the minimal number of roadside APs with
   quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. The simulation results have
   demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed analytical model and the

Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{67-81}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Located in an arid and semi-arid region of the world, Iran has
   experienced many extreme flood and drought events in the last and
   current century. The present study aims to assess the changes in Iran's
   flood magnitude and drought severity for 1950-2010, with some time span
   variation in some stations. The Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trend
   was first applied to assess changes in flood and drought severity data.
   In addition, to consider the effect of serial correlation, two
   Pre-Whitening Trend (PWT) tests were also applied. It was observed that
   the number of stations with statistically significant trends has
   increased after applying PWT tests. Both increasing and decreasing
   trends were observed for drought severity and flood magnitude in
   different climate regions and major basins of Iran using these tests.
   The increase in flood magnitude and drought severity can be attributed
   partly to land use changes, an annual rainfall negative trend, a maximum
   rainfall increasing trend, and inappropriate water resources management
   policies. The paper indicates a critical situation related to extreme
   climate change in Iran and the increasing risk of environmental changes
   in the 21st century. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A binary de Bruijn sequence of order n is a sequence of zeros and ones
   of period 2n that contains every binary n-tuple exactly once in a period
   of the sequence. A composited construction of a de Bruijn sequence is a
   construction of a nonlinear feedback shift register (NLFSR) that
   generates a de Bruijn sequence where the composited feedback function of
   the NLFSR is the sum of a feedback function with kth order composition
   and a sum of (k + 1) product-of-sum terms. The goals of this article are
   to perform a profound analysis of composited de Bruijn sequences for use
   in cryptography and find an efficient implementation of the composited
   feedback function. We first determine the lower bound of the linear
   complexity of a composited de Bruijn sequence and then conduct a
   profound analysis on the composited construction by introducing the
   notion of the higher order D-morphic preimages of a binary sequence. Our
   analysis aims at the reconstruction of a composited de Bruijn sequence
   from a segment known as kth order D-morphic order n de Bruijn preimages
   ((n, k)-DMDPs) of length (2(n) + k) and kth order D-morphic
   ordernm-sequence preimages ((n, k)-DMMPs) of length (2n + k) for a
   nonlinearly and linearly generated composited de Bruijn sequence,
   respectively. We also provide the success probability of finding an (n,
   k)-DMMP/DMDP from a composited de Bruijn sequence for the
   reconstruction. Furthermore, we develop a new iterative technique with
   its parallel extension for computing the feedback function and the new
   technique is faster than other known techniques for producing de Bruijn
   sequences of long period. In addition, we present three instances of
   composited de Bruijn sequences of period 264 together with their
   software implementations and performances.}},

Pages = {{2739-2751}},

Abstract = {{As the number of cores increases, more master components can
   simultaneously access main memory. In real-time systems, this ongoing
   trend is leading to crippling pessimism when computing the worst-case
   cache miss time, since a memory request could potentially contend with
   other requests coming from every other core in the system. CPU-centric
   scheduling policies, therefore, are no longer sufficient to guarantee
   schedulability without introducing unacceptable pessimism for
   memory-intensive task sets. For this reason, we believe a shift is
   needed towards real-time scheduling approaches that can prevent timing
   interference from memory contention, while still making efficient use of
   the multicore platform. Previously, we have demonstrated the
   practicality of the PREM task model, where each job consists of a
   sequence of phases, some of which access memory and some of which
   perform only computation on cached data. In this work, we present the
   first global memory-centric scheduling policy for memory-intensive task
   sets whose jobs can be modeled as a sequence of memory-intensive (memory
   phase) and execution-intensive (execution phase) phases. The proposed
   policy is parameterizable based on the number of cores which are allowed
   to concurrently access main memory without saturating it. Building upon
   results from multicore response-time analysis, we introduce the notion
   of virtual memory cores as a fundamental technique for performing
   phase-based response time analysis for memory-intensive task sets.
   Finally, we use synthetic task set generation to demonstrate that
   proposed scheduling policy and related schedulability bound do indeed
   better schedule memory-intensive task sets when compared to state-of-art
   multicore scheduling.}},

   Oxide Semiconductor platform, where the gate dielectric is made of a
   nonferroelectric material. Operating at room temperature, when the
   device is illuminated, in depletion mode the total capacitance grows in
   magnitude to values larger than the geometrical capacitance. We believe
   this is caused by the trap states existing at the interface of
   dielectric and semiconductor layers, and present the supporting modeling
   results. Using our model, we investigate the role of the trap density
   and light intensity, as well as the device geometry such as gate-ground
   position and the thickness of the silicon layer. Our model shows the
   depletion capacitance can grow to values more than three times larger
   than the geometrical capacitance.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic analysis of satellite structures comprises an important part of
   their design. One such example is an inflatable deployable structure.
   Although prized for their small volume, mass, and subsequent launch
   costs, these structures are quite susceptible to disturbances in a space
   environment that can jitter their mission accuracy. Therefore, it is
   important to have models to accurately predict their vibrations response
   to these disturbances. One important aspect to include in these models
   is the effect of signal and power cables surrounding the host structure
   that has been traditionally ignored or accounted for using ad hoc
   models. Obtaining simple analytical solutions that can predict the
   dynamic behavior of these structures has numerous advantages for their
   vibrations control and modeling before their launch. Although damping
   plays an important role in the dynamics of these structures, the
   presented paper pertains only to the mass and stiffness effects of these
   cables. The structures are modeled as beam structures harnessed with
   cables and the governing partial differential equations of motion for
   different coordinates of vibrations, such as bending, longitudinal, and
   torsional modes, are derived for the harnessed structure. Two wrapping
   patterns for the cables are considered. Natural frequencies and the
   resultant frequency response functions are presented, and the results
   are compared to a finite element solution.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary design flood flows have been derived for 24,000 locations
   throughout Canada on rivers with catchments larger than 400km(2). In the
   absence of any published consistent method for flood estimation covering
   Canada, a flood frequency analysis of instantaneous and daily annual
   maximum flows at 1664 gauging stations has been regionalized using
   geostatistical methods. The methodology accounts, in a generalized way,
   for unusual catchments including arid areas in the Prairie Provinces,
   the influence of extensive lakes, and (implicitly) for the effects of
   snowmelt. It does not attempt to represent other more local effects such
   as flow regulation and diversion. Cross-validation has shown that the
   results exhibit little bias and at half of all locations the predicted
   results are within 25\% of those calculated from the flood peak data,
   for floods with annual exceedance probabilities of both 1 in 2 and 1 in
   20. This broad-scale analysis, which was performed as part of a flood
   mapping study, helps to pave the way for the development of a unified
   procedure for flood frequency analysis across Canada, which forms part
   of the FloodNet research initiative.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is developed using strain-based fracture mechanics (SBFM)

   required input parameters for mild structural (CSA 350W) steel were
   obtained using relatively simple and inexpensive small-scale fatigue
   tests of smooth specimens, conventional monotonic and cyclic materials
   tests, laboratory measurements, and residual stress measurements. The
   ESL modelling component of the methodology is validated using direct
   crack growth measurements. The SBFM model is evaluated using the results
   of fatigue tests on weld specimens and is found to be capable of
   accurately or conservatively predicting the fatigue performance, of the

Abstract = {{Mobility improvement for patients is one of the primary concerns of
   physiotherapy rehabilitation. Providing the physiotherapist and the
   patient with a quantified and objective measure of progress can be
   beneficial for monitoring the patient's performance. In this paper, two
   approaches are introduced for quantifying patient performance. Both
   approaches formulate a distance between patient data and the healthy
   population as the measure of performance. Distance measures are defined
   to capture the performance of one repetition of an exercise or multiple
   repetitions of the same exercise. To capture patient progress across
   multiple exercises, a quality measure and overall score are defined
   based on the distance measures and are used to quantify the overall
   performance for each session. The effectiveness of these measures in
   detecting patient progress is evaluated on rehabilitation data recorded
   from patients recovering from knee or hip replacement surgery. The
   results show that the proposed measures are able to capture the trend of
   patient improvement over the course of rehabilitation. The trend of
   improvement is not monotonic and differs between patients.}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A fluid jet ejected from micron size nozzle is a commonly occurring
   phenomenon in biomedical engineering, printing technology and
   micro-fluidic applications. Disintegration of a jet into drops occurs
   due to disturbances induced by external sources. This work explores the
   various sources of perturbation and their effect on jet disintegration
   through numerical simulation of a two-dimensional non-isothermal model.
   The mathematical approach uses a novel technique to combine analytical
   solutions for the energy balance equation in the radial direction to
   solve the complete two dimensional problem. The two dimensional energy
   balance equation is simultaneously solved together with the
   axi-symmetric Navier-Stokes equations using the slender-jet
   approximation to predict jet velocity. The energy balance takes into
   account of peripheral heat transfer to the environment through
   analytical expressions derived from radial approximations. The model
   helps in understanding the factors in dynamic temperature variations
   that eventually render the jet unstable. The distinguishing aspect of
   this work is the analysis of the effect of a periodic thermal
   perturbation applied at any point in the domain of a progressive jet, a
   situation typically encountered in thermal inkjet printers and not
   considered previously. Results presented for non-isothermal jets which
   are both stationary and moving illustrate the effect of jet velocity in
   propagation of perturbation and subsequent drop formation. The major
   contribution of this numerical study is that it provides an insight on
   novel ways of controlling droplet formation in bubble jet printers. This
   study demonstrates that thermal disturbance propagating from periodic
   heating can be manipulated to shape the droplets and control their
   breakage point along the jet.}},

Abstract = {{Newmark design spectra have been implemented in many building codes,
   especially in building codes for critical structures. Previous studies
   show that Newmark design spectra exhibit lower amplitudes at high
   frequencies and larger amplitudes at low frequencies in comparison with
   spectra developed by statistical methods. To resolve this problem, this
   study considers three suites of ground motions recorded at three types
   of sites. Using these ground motions, influences of the shear-wave
   velocity, earthquake magnitudes, source-to-site distances on the ratios
   of ground motion parameters are studied, and spectrum amplification
   factors are statistically calculated. Spectral bounds for combinations
   of three site categories and two cases of earthquake magnitudes are
   estimated. Site design spectrum coefficients for the three site
   categories considering earthquake magnitudes are established. The
   problems of Newmark design spectra could be resolved by using the site
   design spectrum coefficients to modify the spectral values of Newmark
   design spectra in the acceleration sensitive, velocity sensitive, and

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an extensive field study of the
   comparative deicing performance of conventional dry road salt and
   prewetted road salt for the snow and ice control of transportation
   facilities. Approximately 500 tests in side-by-side sections were
   conducted in a real-world environment, covering a wide range of weather
   conditions in 31 snow events. This paper compares the snow melting
   performance of prewetted salt to that of regular road salt in terms of
   bare pavement regain time. The pair-wise study conducted confirmed that,
   despite the lower amount of sodium chloride (i.e.,using approximately
   20\% less salt) in the prewetted salt, the two types of treatments
   performed similarly in terms of bare pavement regain time. A multiple
   linear regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that
   are associated with the relative performance of prewetted salt as
   compared to dry salt. The modeling results indicate that the performance
   advantage of the prewetting strategy decreases as the amount of snow
   present or the moisture content of the snow increases. This research has
   provided quantitative evidence on the relative effectiveness of
   prewetting under specific pavement surface and weather conditions.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In capital construction projects, the contractor selection process is
   executed in the front-end planning phase based on the experience and
   judgment of the project leadership team, whose members are considered
   experts. A comprehensive construction value packaging system (CVPS) is
   presented for assisting these project leaders in improving the efficacy,
   efficiency, and transparency of this process. The CVPS comprises an
   interface-oriented approach to work decomposition and a multicriteria
   approach to contractor selection. Selection is supported by software for
   iteratively computing and interactively visualizing the Pareto front of
   optimal work packages. The CVPS is validated by functional demonstration
   and a case study of a piping installation project in an energy
   infrastructure facility. The initial Pareto front had more than 100,000
   optimal work packages representing different trade-offs between cost,
   time, contractor experience, maintenance rates, and financial stability.
   An iterative and interactive process of query formulation and exact (not
   heuristic) evaluation helped the expert to focus in on solutions of
   interest and created a transparent and quantitative record of the
   decision-making process. Thus, this research contributes a new paradigm
   and computational tool for project decision support. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Dealing with the heat losses associated with steam-assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) experiments has been an issue for which different heat
   loss prevention techniques have been developed and utilized in the
   literature. The aim is to minimize the amount of heat losses from the
   porous medium to the surrounding environment. Excessive heat losses
   negatively affect quantifying the energy requirements of the SAGD
   experiments. In this study, an inverted-bell vacuum chamber was employed
   to minimize the excessive heat losses while steam was injected under
   different superheating levels. Local temperatures along the glass
   micromodels' height and width were recorded on a real time basis.
   Details of the heat losses associated with our pore-scale SAGD
   visualization experiments are described in this paper. According to the
   results presented, employing extremely low vacuum conditions resulted in
   effective heat loss prevention in a sense that the convective element of
   heat loss could be neglected. As a result, radiation heat transfer was
   the only mechanism of heat transfer that contributed to the heat loss
   from the micromodels' surfaces. In each pore-level SAGD experiment, the
   overall steam consumption to produce one unit of the mobile oil was
   corrected based on the heat loss analysis of the process to account for
   the additional volume of steam which was condensed because of the heat
   loss. The net cumulative steam consumed, corrected for the heat losses,
   was in very good agreement with the predictions made based on the theory
   of gravity drainage and its application in performance analysis of the
   SAGD process.}},

   Engineering Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Probabilistic seismic risk analysis (SRA) is often used for accurately
   quantifying seismic risk of critical engineering structures. It combines
   the probabilistic model of the behavior of structural response given a
   ground motion parameter (GMP) (e.g.,seismic fragility model) and the
   probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for the GMP in a
   mathematically rigorous manner. In current engineering practice, SRA is
   performed based on a single GMP. For structures whose responses can be
   better predicted using multiple GMPs, a vector-valued SRA (VSRA) gives
   more accurate estimates of risk. However, due to the extensive
   computational efforts required for the multiple-dimensional cases, VSRA
   has not been widely applied in engineering practice. This paper presents
   a simplified approach to VSRA, which can substantially improve
   computational efficiency without losing accuracy. A new seismic hazard
   deaggregation procedure is proposed to determine a set of controlling
   earthquakes in terms of magnitude, source-site distance, and occurrence
   rate for the site of interest. VSRA is then performed based on the
   controlling earthquakes rather than all possible earthquake occurrences.
   Two numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness and
   accuracy of the simplified approach. Factors affecting the
   approximations in the simplified approach are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an extensive field study of the
   comparative performance of road salt on different pavement types for
   snow and ice control in transportation facilities. Approximately 400
   tests were conducted in a real-world environment, covering three
   different pavement types and 27 snow events. The performance is compared
   on asphalt concrete (AC), portland cement concrete (PCC), and
   interlocked concrete (IC) pavements in terms of pavement clearing speed.
   The study suggests that on average, salt performs better on AC than PCC
   or ICC pavement, with the latter two having similar performance. The
   results were confirmed with a paired t-test analysis and then used to
   develop a performance model, the results of which were used to develop
   an adjustment factor for each of the different pavement types. The
   results from this research can be applied by pavement maintenance
   personnel to optimize salt usage and improve safety in transportation

Abstract = {{A unit cell model is developed to capture the elasto-visco-plastic
   response of a long fibre composite using a 3-dimensional finite element
   model. Using a glass rubber model, the elasto-visco-plastic response of
   the matrix is analysed and the fibre is considered to deform
   elastically. A functionally graded interphase zone is defined in the
   region surrounding and encompassing a reinforcing fibre. The model
   subdivides the interphase zone into an infinite number of concentric
   rings where stress and strain compatibility is preserved. This model
   aims to improve on the computational efficiency of micromechanics models
   where the fibre and matrix are modeled as separate materials. The
   mechanics of the fibre deformation are governed by a transformation
   tensor for transversely isotropic materials based on Eshelby's method.
   The model is calibrated using experimental data for the transverse
   compression of a unidirectional composite: it is then validated using
   axial compression and shear data for quasi static strain rates. For
   moderate strain rate the model is also calibrated for one of the
   transverse strain rates then validated using the other strain rates and
   axial compression. The proposed unit cell model is capable of predicting
   the elasto-visco-plastic response of long fibre composites to a very
   high accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsive solutions in LTI dynamical systems have received ample
   attention, but primarily for descriptor systems, i.e., first order
   Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). This paper focuses on the
   impulsive behavior of higher order dynamical systems and analyzes the
   causes of impulses in the context of interconnection of one or more
   dynamical systems. We extend the definition of impulse-controllability
   to the higher order case. Amongst the various nonequivalent notions of
   impulse-controllability for first order systems available in the
   literature, which mostly rely on the input/output structure of the
   system, our definition, based on a so-called state-map obtained directly
   from the system equations, generalizes many key first order results to
   the higher order case. In particular, we show that our
   higher-order-extension of the definition of impulse controllability
   generalizes the equivalence between impulse controllability and the
   ability to eliminate impulses in the closed loop by interconnecting with
   a suitable controller. This requires an extension of the definition of
   regularity of interconnection from behaviors involving only smooth
   trajectories to behaviors on the positive half line involving
   impulsive-smooth trajectories.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{224-254}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{With their high strain rate hardening capacity and good combination of
   strength and ductility, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels
   offer lightweight solutions for reinforcement components undergoing
   crash events. The TRIP effect correlates with stress-stimulated
   martensitic transformation from austenite, which depends on a myriad of
   kinematic ingredients, including three-dimensional plastic deformation,
   temperature change, strain-rate, and stress state. The complex
   interdependency of these kinematic ingredients requires stepwise and
   time iterative numerical analyses, especially when boundary-value
   problems are imposed. Typically engineering desired boundary value
   problems involve simulations designed to control energy absorption under
   complex crash scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate a new
   phenomenological framework for thermomechanical modeling of multi-phase
   TRIP steel that captures the evolution of phase transformation. The
   model was implemented into the user-defined subroutine of the explicit
   dynamic version of the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA.
   Simulations were performed on a top-hat crush tube made of an industrial
   multiphase TRIP 800 steel. The results were utilized within an
   optimization simulation framework to pinpoint composition windows, which
   maximize the energy absorption capacity. When not concerned about peak
   crush force, larger compositions of austenite (typically 70\%) will
   outperform all other compositions. However, lowering the austenite
   volume fraction with higher volume fractions of bainite (similar to
   80\%) with balanced ferrite could produce a top-hat crush rail with a
   superior crush force and efficiency compared to TRIP 800 steel without
   increasing the peak crush force. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Friction is an important part of many dynamic systems, and, as a result,
   a good model of friction is necessary for simulating and controlling
   these systems. A new friction model, designed primarily for optimal
   control and real-time dynamic applications, is presented in this paper.
   This new model defines friction as a continuous function of velocity and
   captures the main velocity-dependent characteristics of friction: the
   Stribeck effect and viscous friction. Additional phenomena of friction
   such as micro-displacement and the time dependence of friction were not
   modeled due to the increased complexity of the model, leading to reduced
   performance of real-time simulations or optimizations. Unlike several
   current friction models, this model is C-1 continuous and
   differentiable, which is desirable for optimal control applications,
   sensitivity analysis, and multibody dynamic analysis and simulation. To
   simplify parameter identification, the proposed model was designed to
   use a minimum number of parameters, all with physical meaning and
   readily visible on a force-velocity curve, rather than generic shape
   parameters. A simulation using the proposed model demonstrates that the
   model avoids any discontinuities in force at initial impact and the

Abstract = {{Eye diseases, such as dry eye syndrome, are commonly treated with eye
   drop formulations. However, eye drop formulations require frequent
   dosing with high drug concentrations due to poor ocular surface
   retention, which leads to poor patient compliance and high risks of side
   effects. We developed a mucoadhesive nanoparticle eye drop delivery
   platform to prolong the ocular retention of topical drugs, thus enabling
   treatment of eye diseases using reduced dosage. Using fluorescent
   imaging on rabbit eyes, we showed ocular retention of the fluorescent
   dye delivered through these nanoparticles beyond 24 h while free dyes
   were mostly cleared from the ocular surface within 3 h after
   administration. Utilizing the prolonged retention of the nanoparticles,
   we demonstrated effective treatment of experimentally induced dry eye in
   mice by delivering cyclosporin A (CsA) bound to this delivery system.
   The once a week dosing of 0.005 to 0.01\% CsA in NP eye drop formulation
   demonstrated both the elimination of the inflammation signs and the
   recovery of ocular surface goblet cells after a month. Thrice daily
   administration of RESTASIS on mice only showed elimination without
   recovering the ocular surface goblet cells. The mucoadhesive
   nanoparticle eye drop platform demonstrated prolonged ocular surface
   retention and effective treatment of dry eye conditions with up to 50-
   to 100-fold reduction in overall dosage of CsA compared to RESTASIS,
   which may significantly reduce side effects and, by extending the
   interdosing interval, improve patient compliance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel configuration optimization method for multi
   degree-of-freedom modular reconfigurable robots (MRR) using a memetic
   algorithm (MA) that combines genetic algorithms (GAs) and a local search
   method. The proposed method generates multiple solutions to the inverse
   kinematics (IK) problem for any given spatial task and the MA chooses
   the most suitable configuration based on the search objectives. Since
   the dimension of each robotic link in this optimization is considered
   telescopic, the proposed method is able to find better solutions to the
   IK problem than GAs. The case study for a 3-DOF MRR shows that the MA
   finds solutions to the IK problem much faster than a GA with noticeably
   less reachability error. Additional case studies show that the proposed
   MA method can find multiple IK solutions in various scenarios and
   identify the fittest solution as a suboptimal configuration for the MRR.}},

Volume = {{83}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Self-organizing ability is one of the most important requirements of
   modern sensor networks; particularly for tracking maneuvering targets.
   Flocking-based approaches are biologically inspired methods that have
   recently gained significant attention to address the control and
   coordination problem in self-organizing sensor networks. These
   approaches are exemplified by the two well-known algorithms, namely, the
   Flocking and the Semi-Flocking algorithms. Although these two algorithms
   have demonstrated promising performance in tracking linear target(s),
   they have deficiencies in tracking maneuvering targets.
   This paper introduces a constrained clustering approach that uses a
   novel extension of K-means algorithm to provide better coverage over
   maneuvering targets. This extension clusters the sensors based on
   certain background knowledge, then uses the information about the
   clusters to improve coverage. The performances of flocking-based
   algorithms, both with and without the proposed approach, are examined in
   tracking both linear and maneuvering targets. Experimental results
   demonstrate how constrained clustering yields better tracking of
   maneuvering targets, and how applying constraints on the clustering
   process improves the quality of clustering and increases the speed of
   convergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel design of an air-coupled capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducer (CMUT) with annular cell geometry (annular CMUT) is proposed.
   Finite element analysis shows that an annular cell has a ratio of
   average-to-maximum displacement (RAMD) of 0.52-0.58 which is 58-76\%
   higher than that of a conventional circular cell. The increased RAMD
   leads to a larger volume displacement which results in a 48.4\% improved
   transmit sensitivity and 127.3\% improved power intensity. Single-cell
   annular CMUTs were fabricated with 20-mu m silicon plates on 13.7-mu m
   deep and 1.35-mm wide annular cavities using the wafer bonding
   technique. The measured RAMD of the fabricated CMUTs is 0.54. The
   resonance frequency was measured to be 94.5 kHz at 170-V DC bias. The
   transmit sensitivity was measured to be 33.83 Pa/V and 25.85 Pa/V when
   the CMUT was excited by a continuous wave and a 20-cycle burst,
   respectively. The receive sensitivity at 170-V DC bias was measured to
   be 7.7 mV/Pa for a 20-cycle burst, and 15.0 mV/Pa for a continuous
   incident wave. The proposed annular CMUT design demonstrates a
   significant improvement in transmit efficiency, which is an important
   parameter for air-coupled ultrasonic transducers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Persulfate Interaction with Tropical Soils}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{227}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Persulfate use as a chemical oxidant for remediation of contaminated
   sites has increased due to its higher in situ persistence and reactivity
   with environmentally relevant contaminants. The interaction of
   persulfate with soil materials can significantly influence treatment
   efficiency by either promoting activation or by decreasing its
   persistence. In this investigation, the interaction between persulfate
   and three soils (two highly weathered and clayey Oxisols, and a sandy
   Psamment soil) found in tropical environments was evaluated. A series of
   batch tests were conducted using a high (14 g L-1) and low (1 g L-1)
   persulfate concentration. Additional persulfate mass was added after 120
   days into low persulfate concentration systems. Persulfate degradation
   generally followed a first-order kinetic model; however, the reaction
   rate coefficients varied with initial concentration and with the
   addition of persulfate at 120 days. A kinetic model that accounts for
   the presence of a finite mass of oxidizable material was shown to
   capture all experimental conditions. In all systems, the pH decreased
   significantly, causing favorable conditions for the dissolution of clay
   minerals such as kaolinite, as supported by mineralogical analyses. This
   dissolution resulted in an increase in exchangeable aluminum and iron,
   as well as conversion of iron associated with amorphous oxides to
   crystalline oxides. The increased availability of these species resulted
   in accelerated persulfate degradation. Based on the data set assembled,
   a conceptual model was developed that represents the interaction between
   persulfate and soils that have clay minerals containing iron that are
   susceptible to dissolution.}},

Abstract = {{Crude glycerol, the major by-product of biodiesel production, is an
   attractive bioprocessing feedstock owing to its abundance, low cost, and
   high degree of reduction. In line with the advent of the biodiesel
   industry, Clostridium pasteurianum has gained prominence as a result of
   its unique capacity to convert waste glycerol into n-butanol, a
   high-energy biofuel. However, no efforts have been directed at
   abolishing the production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), the chief
   competing product of C. pasteurianum glycerol fermentation. Here, we
   report rational metabolic engineering of C. pasteurianum for enhanced
   n-butanol production through inactivation of the gene encoding 1,3-PDO
   dehydrogenase (dhaT). In spite of current models of anaerobic glycerol
   dissimilation, culture growth and glycerol utilization were unaffected
   in the dhaT disruption mutant (dhaT:: Ll.LtrB). Metabolite
   characterization of the dhaT:: Ll.LtrB mutant revealed an 83\% decrease
   in 1,3-PDO production, encompassing the lowest C. pasteurianum 1,3-PDO
   titer reported to date (0.58 g liter(-1)). With 1,3-PDO formation nearly
   abolished, glycerol was converted almost exclusively to n-butanol (8.6 g
   liter(-1)), yielding a high n-butanol selectivity of 0.83 g n-butanol g
   (-1) of solvents compared to 0.51 g n-butanol g (-1) of solvents for the
   wild-type strain. Unexpectedly, high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) analysis of dhaT:: Ll.LtrB mutant culture supernatants identified
   a metabolite peak consistent with 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO), which was
   confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Based on these findings,
   we propose a new model for glycerol dissimilation by C. pasteurianum,
   whereby the production of 1,3-PDO by the wild-type strain and low levels
   of both 1,3-PDO and 1,2-PDO by the engineered mutant balance the
   reducing equivalents generated during cell mass synthesis from glycerol.
   IMPORTANCE Organisms from the genus Clostridium are perhaps the most
   notable native cellular factories, owing to their vast substrate
   utilization range and equally diverse variety of metabolites produced.
   The ability of C. pasteurianum to sustain redox balance and glycerol
   fermentation despite inactivation of the 1,3-PDO pathway is a testament
   to the exceptional metabolic flexibility exhibited by clostridia.
   Moreover, identification of a previously unknown 1,2-PDO-formation
   pathway, as detailed herein, provides a deeper understanding of
   fermentative glycerol utilization in clostridia and will inform future
   metabolic engineering endeavors involving C. pasteurianum. To our
   knowledge, the C. pasteurianum dhaT disruption mutant derived in this
   study is the only organism that produces both 1,2- and 1,3-PDOs. Most
   importantly, the engineered strain provides an excellent platform for
   highly selective production of n-butanol from waste glycerol.

Abstract = {{Since the first disclosure of a patent on biphasic CO2 capture absorbent
   in 2005, more and more research work has been carried out worldwide
   looking for new biphasic systems and expanding the earlier achievements.
   There are two types of biphasic absorbent systems: amine dissolved in
   alcohol, i.e., non-aqueous system; and less soluble amines
   (alkanolamines or lipophilic amines, single amine or a mixture of
   amines) dissolved in water, i.e., aqueous system. Phase separation could
   happen at absorption temperature or at higher temperature, resulting in
   a CO2-rich phase and a CO2-lean phase. Only the CO2-rich phase will be
   regenerated, rendering a smaller regenerator and lower regeneration
   energy consumption. Some of the biphasic absorbent systems show lower
   regeneration temperatures and higher regeneration depth compared to
   aqueous MEA (monoethanolamine), indicating even more potential merits.
   In this paper, the previous R\&D results and data are summarized and
   reviewed. Future directions for research and development are discussed.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a multi-modal approach for driver fatigue and
   distraction detection. Based on a driving simulator platform equipped
   with several sensors, we have designed a framework to acquire sensor
   data, process and extract features related to fatigue and distraction.
   Ultimately the features from the different sources are fused to infer
   the driver's state of inattention. In our work, we extract audio, color
   video, depth map, heart rate, and steering wheel and pedals positions.
   We then process the signals according to three modules, namely the
   vision module, audio module, and other signals module. The modules are
   independent from each other and can be enabled or disabled at any time.
   Each module extracts relevant features and, based on hidden Markov
   models, produces its own estimation of driver fatigue and distraction.
   Lastly, fusion is done using the output of each module, contextual
   information, and a Bayesian network. A dedicated Bayesian network was
   designed for both fatigue and distraction. The complementary information
   extracted from all the mod- ules allows a reliable estimation of driver
   inattention. Our experimental results show that we are able to detect
   fatigue with 98.4 \% accuracy and distraction with 90.5 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal solidification (IS) is a phenomenon observed in clad aluminum
   brazing sheets, wherein the amount of liquid clad metal is reduced by
   penetration of the liquid clad into the core. The objective of the
   current investigation is to quantify the rate of IS through the use of a
   previously derived parameter, the Interface Rate Constant (IRC). The
   effect of peak temperature and initial sheet temper on IS kinetics were
   investigated. The results demonstrated that IS is due to the diffusion
   of silicon (Si) from the liquid clad layer into the solid core. Reduced
   amounts of liquid clad at long liquid duration times, a roughened sheet
   surface, and differences in resolidified clad layer morphology between
   sheet tempers were observed. Increased IS kinetics were predicted at
   higher temperatures by an IRC model as well as by experimentally
   determined IRC values; however, the magnitudes of these values are not
   in good agreement due to deficiencies in the model when applied to
   alloys. IS kinetics were found to be higher for sheets in the fully
   annealed condition when compared with work-hardened sheets, due to the
   influence of core grain boundaries providing high diffusivity pathways
   for Si diffusion, resulting in more rapid liquid clad penetration.}},

Title = {{Effect of asynchronous valve timing on combustion characteristic and

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{185-199}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Based on a high-speed spark ignition (SI) gasoline engine with five
   valves, a novel concept of asynchronous valves timing (AVT) and
   synchronous valves timing (SVT) systems has been proposed. In order to
   demonstrate the effect of AVT and SVT on gas exchange process,
   combustion process, engine performance, fuel economy and emissions, a
   comparative study between AVT and SVT systems are conducted by using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and experiment.
   Considering the disadvantages of original cam profile, the intake and
   exhaust cam profile are redesigned. The valve train would be able to
   work more steadily and reliably under the high speed movement condition
   after optimized. Followed experiments for the AVT and SVT schemes were
   performed under full load to measure engine performance and operating
   parameters. Finally, in order to study the in-cylinder working process,
   a numerical calculation was conducted by using the CFD code AVL-FIRE.
   Additionally, a GT-Power simulation model was set up and calibrated by
   experimental data to study the impact of AVT and SVT on gas exchange
   process and secure accurate boundary conditions for the CFD calculation.
   The simulation results show that AVT scheme can strengthen in-cylinder
   gas rotational flow, increase gas turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) at the
   ignition timing, which is beneficial to increase the flame propagation
   speed. The IVC timing can significantly affect the in-cylinder pressure
   and heat release rate. With late IVC, both the mass flow rate and the
   peak in-cylinder pressure of retarding 20 degrees CA opening are
   decreased. The experimental results show that the engine torque, BSFC,
   CO and HC emissions of advancing 20 degrees CA opening are better than
   those under retarding 20 degrees CA opening and SVT at full load.
   However, NOx and CO2 emissions are worse than those of the other two
   schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermo-mechanical behavior of asphalt mixes, with Recycled Asphalt
   Pavement (RAP) and manufacturing waste roofing asphalt shingles (RAS),
   is investigated. The cracking behavior at low temperature is studied
   using the Thermal Stress Restrained Specimen Test (TSRST). The
   experimental device has been improved with a radial strains measurement
   system during the performed TSRST. Tri-dimensional behavior could thus
   be investigated. Studied mixes are made with different RAP contents (up
   to 25\%) and RAS contents (up to 10\%). First, the influence of the
   content of RAP and RAS is analyzed and a ranking of the different mixes
   is proposed based on the classical TSRST results (stress and temperature
   at failure). Then, in order to simulate TSRST, a three dimensional
   modelling is performed with the visco-elasto-plastic DBN model. The
   calibration steps in the small domain (linear visco-elasticity) and in
   the large strain domain (non-linearity and visco-plastic flow) are
   presented. The comparison between experimental and simulated results
   obtained using the DBN model has shown the potential of the DBN model to
   simulate the low temperature cracking behavior of asphalt mixes. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of the yield surface curvature and anisotropy
   constants on the predicted crush response of aluminum tubes are
   investigated. The yield function proposed by Plunkett et al. (2008) with
   two linear transformations is employed in the commercial finite element
   software LS-DYNA to predict the crush response of the aluminum alloy
   AA5754-O circular tubes. This yield function represents anisotropy of
   aluminum alloys accurately by simultaneously capturing the variation of
   both the yield stress and the R-value with orientation. Dynamic crush
   simulations of tubes are performed using this yield function with four
   different yield surface shapes. The same sets of experimental uniaxial
   yield stresses and R-values along with various sample orientations are
   considered for determining the anisotropy coefficients of the yield
   function for each case (the coefficients are different even though the
   input experimental data is the same). Simulations of axial crush show
   that the yield surface shape affects the collapse mode and predicted
   energy absorption characteristics of the crush tube. The analysis shows
   that the deformation is predominately controlled by balanced biaxial
   deformation. However, characterization of both the plane strain and pure
   shear points on the yield surface for energy absorption are also
   important. The shape and the area of the yield function govern the
   loading condition, which dictates the deformation and energy absorption.
   The results demonstrate the importance of the shape of the yield surface
   in axial crush simulations of structural components using aluminum. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding the behaviour of automotive structural components is
   essential for vehicle weight reduction and passenger safety. In this
   study, a novel framework is developed to design an optimized front rail
   that maximizes crash energy absorption characteristics. The new design
   is coupled with material and process development to provide a component
   with superior energy absorption and strength characteristics that is
   commercially sustainable. Simulations of the extrusion crush behaviour
   are performed using the anisotropic Barlat et al. (2003) Yld2000 yield
   functions. The simulations are compared to the dynamic crush results for
   this extrusion. The size of the structure is optimized using the
   response surface methodology, using artificial neural networks
   metamodels and simulated annealing optimization techniques. The specific
   energy absorption (SEA) is used as a single optimization objective
   function for maximizing energy absorption and minimizing mass. An
   analytical relationship that relates the SEA function to the crush
   efficiency is derived to show that a single optimization function
   parameter may be sufficient for mass minimization. Analysis is performed
   to identify key extrusion operational parameters and the wall thickness
   is identified as the most important parameter to control during
   extrusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{358}},
Pages = {{56-72}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple and novel, yet highly effective approach
   for robust face recognition. Using LBP-like descriptors based on local
   accumulated pixel differences Angular Differences and Radial
   Differences, the local differences were decomposed into complementary
   components of signs and magnitudes. Based on these descriptors we
   developed labeled dominant patterns where the most frequently occurring
   patterns and their labels were learned to capture discriminative
   textural information. Six histogram features were obtained from each
   given face image by concatenating spatial histograms extracted from
   non-overlapping subregions. A whitened PCA technique was used for
   dimensionality reduction to produce more compact, robust and
   discriminative features, which were then fused using the nearest
   neighbor classifier, with Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.
   We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method on the Extended
   Yale B, the large-scale FERET, and CAS-PEAL-R1 databases, and found that
   that the proposed method impressively outperforms other well-known
   systems with a recognition rate of 74.6\% on the CAS-PEAL-R1 lighting

Abstract = {{Traditionally, most real-time systems (RTS) were considered to be
   invulnerable to security breaches and external attacks. This was mainly
   due to the use of proprietary hardware and protocols in such systems
   along with physical isolation. Hence, security and RTS were considered
   to be separate domains. This assumption is being challenged by recent
   events that highlight the vulnerabilities in such systems. In this
   paper, we focus on how to integrate security as a first-class principle
   in the design of RTS. We demonstrate how certain security requirements
   can be cast as real-time scheduling constraints. We use information
   leakage as a motivating problem to illustrate our techniques and focus
   on the class of fixed-priority real-time schedulers. We evaluate our
   approach both analytically as well as using simulations and discuss the
   tradeoffs in using such an approach. Our work shows that many real-time
   task sets can be scheduled using our methods without significant
   performance impact.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3303-3314}},

Abstract = {{Recent flood events in Canada have led to speculation that changes in
   flood behaviour are occurring; these changes have often been attributed
   to climate change. This paper examines flood data for a collection of
   132 gauging stations in Canada. All of these watersheds are part of the
   Canadian Reference Hydrometric Basin Network (RHBN), a group of gauging
   stations specifically assembled to assist in the identification of the
   impacts of climate change. The RHBN stations are considered to have good
   quality data and were screened to avoid the influences of regulation,
   diversions, or land use change. Daily flow data for each watershed are
   used to derive a peaks over threshold (POT) dataset. Several measures of
   flood behaviour are examined based on the POT data, which afford a more
   in-depth analysis of flood behaviour than can be obtained using annual
   maxima data. Analysis is conducted for four time periods ranging from 50
   to 80years in duration; the latter period results in a much smaller
   number of watersheds that have data for the period. The changes in flood
   responses of the watersheds are summarized by grouping the watersheds by
   size (small, medium, and large) and also by hydrologic regime (nival,
   mixed, and pluvial). The results provide important insights into the
   nature of the changes that are occurring in flood regimes of Canadian
   rivers, which include more flood exceedances, reduced maximum flood
   exceedance magnitudes for snowmelt events, and earlier flood events.

Abstract = {{Peptide based vaccine that incorporates one or several highly conserved
   CD8+ T cells epitopes to induce potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
   response is desirable for some infectious diseases, such as HIV-1 (human
   immunodeficiency virus-1), and cancers. However, the CD8+ T cells
   epitope is often weakly immunogenic, and thus requires a specific
   adjuvant or delivery system to enhance the efficiency. Here we
   investigated the use of self-assembling peptide EAK16-II based platform
   to achieve the co-delivery of CD8+ T cells epitope and TLR7/8 agonists
   (R848 or R837) for augmenting DCs maturation and HIV-1 specific CTL
   response. HIV-1 CTL epitope SL9 was conjugated with EAK16-II to obtain
   SL9-EAK16-II, which further spontaneously co-assembled with R848 or R837
   in aqueous solution, forming co-assembled nanofibers. Fluorescence
   spectra and calorimetrical titration revealed the interaction between
   SL9-EAK16-II assemblies and R848 or R837 via hydrogen bonding and
   hydrophobic interaction, with the binding affinity (dissociation
   constant K-d) of 0.62 mu M or 0.53 mu M, respectively. Ex vivo generated
   DCs from HIV-1+ patients pulsed with the SL9-EAK16-II/R848 nanofibers
   stimulated significantly more polyfunctional SL9 specific CTLs, compared
   to the DCs pulsed with SL9 alone or the mixture of SL9 and TLR agonist.
   Furthermore, the nanofibers elicited stronger SL9 specific CTL response
   in vaccinated mice. Our findings suggest the self-assembling peptide
   EAK16-II might be used as a new delivery system for peptide based
   vaccines. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sparse reconstruction of compressive sensing MRI using cross-domain
   stochastically fully connected conditional random fields}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical
   imaging technology for the screening and diagnosis of frequently
   occurring cancers. However, image quality may suffer from long
   acquisition times for MRIs due to patient motion, which also leads to
   patient discomfort. Reducing MRI acquisition times can reduce patient
   discomfort leading to reduced motion artifacts from the acquisition
   process. Compressive sensing strategies applied to MRI have been
   demonstrated to be effective in decreasing acquisition times
   significantly by sparsely sampling the k-space during the acquisition
   process. However, such a strategy requires advanced reconstruction
   algorithms to produce high quality and reliable images from compressive
   sensing MRI.
   Methods: This paper proposes a new reconstruction approach based on
   cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields
   (CD-SFCRF) for compressive sensing MRI. The CD-SFCRF introduces
   constraints in both k-space and spatial domains within a stochastically
   fully connected graphical model to produce improved MRI reconstruction.
   Results: Experimental results using T2-weighted (T2w) imaging and
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate show strong performance
   in preserving fine details and tissue structures in the reconstructed
   images when compared to other tested methods even at low sampling rates.
   Conclusions: The ability to better utilize a limited amount of
   information to reconstruct T2w and DWI images in a short amount of time
   while preserving the important details in the images demonstrates the
   potential of the proposed CD-SFCRF framework as a viable reconstruction
   algorithm for compressive sensing MRI.}},

Abstract = {{With a great variety of potential applications, machine-type
   communications (MTC) is gaining a tremendous interest from mobile
   network operators and research groups. MTC is standardized by the 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which has been regarded as the
   promising solution facilitating machine-to-machine communications. In
   the latest standard, 3GPP proposes a novel architecture for MTC, in
   which the MTC server is located outside the operator domain. However,
   the connection between the 3GPP core network and MTC server in this
   scenario is insecure; consequently, there are distrustful relationships
   among MTC device, core network, and MTC server. If the security issue is
   not well addressed, all applications involved in MTC cannot be put into
   the market. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end security
   scheme for MTC based on the proxy-signature technique, called
   (ESEC)-S-2. Specifically, both the MTC device and MTC server can
   establish strong trustful relationships with each other by using the
   proxy signatures issued by the 3GPP core network. Moreover, we present
   some implementation considerations of (ESEC)-S-2 and analyze the
   performance during authentication by comparing the operational cost of
   three cases that apply three different signature algorithms, that is,
   ElGamal, Schnorr, and DSA. Through security analysis by using Automatic
   Cryptographic Protocol Verifier (ProVerif), we conclude that the
   proposed (ESEC)-S-2 scheme can achieve the security goals and prevent
   various security threats. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   reaction conditions, the two-phase organic aqueous system with
   cyclohexane addition and high MTBE/formaldehyde ratio enhanced the
   isoprene formation. When the catalyst concentration was increased, the
   formaldehyde conversion and turnover frequency increased, but isoprene
   selectivity slightly decreased. At high temperature or low
   MTBE/formaldehyde ratio, isoprene yield decreased because of the
   formation of 3,4-dihydro-4-methyl-2H-pyran. When the catalyst activities
   are compared, the STA catalyst exhibited formaldehyde conversion,
   isoprene yield, and selectivity that were slightly higher than those of
   the PTA and PMA catalysts. Among the Prins reaction products formed,
   4,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane was the key precursor of isoprene formation in

Abstract = {{A generic framework is developed to study the application of energy hubs
   and its related network model to demonstrate the optimal design and
   operation of distributed energy systems (DESs) in urban areas. A novel
   multi-objective approach based on augmented epsilon constraint technique
   is employed to carry out this work. As an illustrative example, the
   proposed model is applied to an urban area in Ontario, Canada. Different
   scenarios are defined to investigate the effect of energy storage
   systems and energy exchange within a network on the optimal
   configuration and operation of the system. Moreover, multi-objective
   optimization is carried out based on two conflicting objectives, namely,
   total annual cost and greenhouse gas emission. The findings show that
   the simultaneous consideration of DESs, storage technologies, and a
   network of energy exchange between hubs (scenario 4) results in the
   installation of more DESs and at least 8\% reduction of annual cost when
   compared to other scenarios. Furthermore, lowering the electricity grid
   emission factor results in higher adoption of renewable energy
   generation based DESs rather than natural gas based DESs. The
   sensitivity analysis shows that doubling the electricity tariff rate
   results in 75\% increase in cost, while the pricing of natural gas has
   no significant effect on overall cost. This demonstrates that the cost
   is more sensitive to the electricity tariff rate rather than natural gas
   price for this specific case study.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo field-theoretic simulations (MC-FTS) are performed on
   structurally symmetric binary homopolymer blends for invariant
   polymerization indexes of (N) over bar >= 10(3). It is shown that the
   ultraviolet (UV) divergence that plagues MC-FTS at small (N) over bar
   can be removed by an appropriate renormalization of the Flory-Huggins
   interaction parameter, chi, allowing one to extract meaningful results
   that are independent of the wavevector cutoff. Once the divergence is
   taken care of, the fluctuation corrections to mean-field theory are
   found to be exceptionally small. In particular, the disordered-state
   structure function, S(k), is virtually indistinguishable from the RPA
   prediction, and there is a slight shift in the critical point, (chi
   N)(c), that roughly scales as (N) over bar (-1/2). An implication of the
   small corrections is that previous experimental determinations of chi
   based on homopolymer blends should be relatively accurate.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the crystallization behavior of poly (lactic acid)
   (PLA)/amine-modified silica nanocomposites at different loadings of
   amine-modified silica (1, 2, and 8 wt \%) under isothermal,

   significant improvement in crystallization rate was observed after
   introduction of the nanoparticles. A modified Hoffman-Lauritzen
   nucleation theory was utilized to explain the facilitation and
   acceleration of the crystallization process of nanocomposites with
   introducing the surface energy of the nanoparticles and interfacial
   energy between polymer/nanoparticle into the rate equation. After
   incorporation of the nanoparticles, three-dimensional spherulites formed
   sporadically in the PLA matrix based on the prediction of the Avrami
   exponents of the nanocomposites. High-pressure DSC results also showed
   an increase in the crystallization rate at 15 bar compared with the
   atmospheric pressure condition. However, an increase in pressure up to
   21 bar had no significant effect on the crystallization rate. The PLA
   nanocomposites with lower molecular weights and D-content also showed a
   significant increase in the crystallization rate but with no change in
   the crystallization mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Motivation: Evolutionarily conserved amino acids within proteins
   characterize functional or structural regions. Conversely, less
   conserved amino acids within these regions are generally areas of
   evolutionary divergence. A priori knowledge of biological function and
   species can help interpret the amino acid differences between sequences.
   However, this information is often erroneous or unavailable, hampering
   discovery with supervised algorithms. Also, most of the current
   unsupervised methods depend on full sequence similarity, which become
   inaccurate when proteins diverge (e.g. inversions, deletions,
   insertions). Due to these and other shortcomings, we developed a novel
   unsupervised algorithm which discovers highly conserved regions and uses
   two types of information measures: (i) data measures computed from input
   sequences; and (ii) class measures computed using a priori class
   groupings in order to reveal subgroups (i.e. classes) or functional
   characteristics.
   Results: Using known and putative sequences of two proteins belonging to
   a relatively uncharacterized protein family we were able to group
   evolutionarily related sequences and identify conserved regions, which
   are strong homologous association patterns called Aligned Pattern
   Clusters, within individual proteins and across the members of this
   family. An initial synthetic demonstration and in silico results reveal
   that (i) the data measures are unbiased and (ii) our class measures can
   accurately rank the quality of the evolutionarily relevant groupings.
   Furthermore, combining our data and class measures allowed us to
   interpret the results by inferring regions of biological importance
   within the binding domain of these proteins. Compared to popular
   supervised methods, our algorithm has a superior runtime and comparable
   accuracy.}},

Title = {{A feasibility study of piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic

Abstract = {{We study the feasibility of fabricating piezoelectric micromachined
   ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) using a commercially available multi-user
   MEMS process (MUMPs). MUMPs provide a low cost and easily accessible
   option for MEMS researchers, but the resulting device performance is
   usually sacrificed. In this work, we investigate the potential
   limitations of MUMPs PMUTs using an experimental approach. The
   square-shaped PMUT structure that we fabricated has a dimension of 500
   mu m by 500 mu m. It consists mainly of a 10 mu m silicon layer and a
   0.5 mu m aluminum nitride piezoelectric layer. Vibrometer measurements
   revealed that the PMUTs resonate at 600 kHz in air. Acoustic experiments
   showed a resonance frequency of 1.2 MHz in immersion, which was caused
   by a higher order vibration mode. Transmit and receive experiments using
   a hydrophone and an off-the-shelf transducer demonstrated the
   functionality of PMUTs in immersion, with measured transmit and receive
   sensitivity at 0.95 kPa/V and 1.35 mu V/Pa, respectively, for a 1.8 mm
   by 1.8 mm element. Limitations of the multi-user process that restrict
   the operating frequency and output pressure are discussed. More
   specifically, the maximum fundamental modal frequency is limited to
   about 2 MHz in immersion by the process design rule, and the maximum
   output pressure is restricted by a maximum driving voltage of 25V(pp)
   because of potential dielectric breakdown of the piezoelectirc layer.
   Acoustic experiments also showed ringing that affects the axial
   resolution of the devices. The ringing limits the usefulness of the
   devices in pulse-echo applications. We conclude that MUMPs PMUTs are
   more suitable for applications that rely mainly on the device receive
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior thigh muscles are particularly susceptible to muscle loss
   and weakness during ageing, although how this is associated with changes
   to neuromuscular structure and function in terms of motor unit (MU)
   number, size and MU potential (MUP) stability remains unclear.
   Intramuscular (I.M.) and surface electromyographic signals were recorded
   from the vastus lateralis (VL) during voluntary contractions held at
   25\% maximal knee extensor strength in 22 young (mean +/- SD, 25.3 +/-
   4.8 years) and 20 physically active older men (71.4 +/- 6.2 years). MUP
   size, firing rates, phases, turns and near fibre (NF) jiggle were
   determined and MU number estimates (MUNEs) were made by comparing
   average surface MUP with maximal electrically-evoked compound muscle
   action potentials. Quadriceps cross-sectional area was measured by
   magnetic resonance imaging. In total, 379 individual MUs were sampled in
   younger men and 346 in older men. Compared to the MU in younger
   participants, those in older participants had 8\% lower firing rates and
   larger MUP size (+25\%), as well as increased complexity, as indicated
   by phases (+13\%), turns (+20\%) and NF jiggle (+11\%) (all P < 0.0005).
   The MUNE values (derived from the area of muscle in range of the
   surface-electrode) in older participants were similar to 70\% of those
   in the young (P < 0.05). Taking into consideration the 30\% smaller
   cross-sectional area of the VL, the total number of MUs in the older
   muscles was between 50\% and 60\% lower compared to in young muscles (P
   < 0.0005). A large portion of the VL MU pool is lost in older men and
   those recruited during moderate intensity contractions were enlarged and
   less stable. These MU changes were evident before clinically relevant
   changes to muscle function were apparent; nevertheless, the changes in
   MU number and size are probably a prelude to future movement problems.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear dynamic characteristics of Functionally Graded
   Piezoelectric Material (FGPM) beams under in-plane and out-of-plane
   mechanical, thermal, and electrical excitations are examined. Large
   deflection behaviour is accounted for in both vibration and dynamic
   stability analyses using a modified couple stress theory to account for
   size effects. Response under thermo-electro-mechanical loads
   demonstrates the complex vibration, dynamic buckling, and post -buckling
   of the structure. The effects of load type, microstructural dependency,
   boundary conditions, beam geometry, composition rule of the
   constituents, and the applied actuator voltage are examined. It is shown
   that the applied external electric voltage may significantly affect the
   nonlinear dynamic response of the structure under different types of
   thermomechanical loading. Hence, to achieve desirable sensing and
   actuating characteristics, it would be possible to control the
   vibration, critical dynamic buckling, and stability response of the beam
   by applying a suitable electric voltage. Moreover, it has been
   demonstrated that the nonlinear dynamic response of the actuator under
   thermal (deformation -controlled) loading is quite different from that
   of mechanical (load controlled) excitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, a small amount of polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) was
   incorporated into cellulose acetate (CA) to electrospin CA/PVDF
   composite nanofiber membranes, followed by exposure to solvent vapor for
   crosslinking. Under controlled solvent vapor environment, the surfaces
   of the nanofibers were partially ``melt,{''} and the contact points
   among the nanofibers formed physical crosslinks. It was demonstrated
   that the solvent vapor induced crosslinking was simple yet effective to
   enhance the mechanical strength of the resulting membranes. The degree
   of crosslinking could be controlled by adjusting the solvent vapor
   composition and the exposure time of the membrane in solvent vapor. To
   further reinforce the membrane, the CA/PVDF composite nanofiber membrane
   were electrospun onto a nonwoven substrate layer. The resulting
   membranes had pore sizes in the range of nm to mu m. The membranes with
   a mean pore size of 0.75 mu m and 0.59 mu m exhibited a high pure water
   flux and good rejection to emulsion lattices when tested for emulsion
   separations. These results have revealed the potential of the membranes

   surface profile versus chain discreteness}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Silberberg has argued that the surface of a polymer melt behaves like a
   reflecting boundary on the random-walk statistics of the polymers.
   Although this is approximately true, independent studies have shown that
   violations occur due to the finite width of the surface profile and to
   the discreteness of the polymer molecule, resulting in an excess of
   chain ends at the surface and a reduction in surface tension inversely
   proportional to the chain length, N. Using self-consistent field theory
   (SCFT), we compare the magnitude of these two effects by examining a
   melt of discrete polymers modeled as N monomers connected by Hookean
   springs of average length, a, next to a polymer surface of width xi. The
   effects of the surface width and the chain discreteness are found to be
   comparable for realistic profiles of xi similar to a. A semi-analytical
   approximation is developed to help explain the behavior. The relative
   excess of ends at the surface is dependent on the details of the model,
   but in general it decreases for shorter polymers. The excess is balanced
   by a long-range depletion that has a universal shape independent of the
   molecular details. Furthermore, the approximation predicts that the
   reduction in surface energy equals one unit of k(B)T for every extra
   chain end at the surface.}},

   magnetic field for a wide range of filling factors. The Landau-level
   width is found to be independent of magnetic field. The mobility edge
   moves in the case of changing Landau-level overlap to maintain a sample
   dependent critical density of states at that energy. An analysis of
   filling factor nu = 2/3 shows that the composite fermion Landau levels
   have exactly the same width as their electron counterparts. An important
   ingredient of the model is the Lorentzian broadening with long tails
   which provide localized states deep in the gap which are essential in
   order to reproduce the robust high-temperature B-c(T) phase observed in
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG) uses
   mechanistic-empirical models by analysing the impacts of traffic,
   climate, materials and pavement structure to predict performances of
   pavement. The MEPDG software uses a three-level hierarchical input to
   predict performance in terms of terminal International Roughness Index,
   permanent deformation, total cracking (reflective and alligator),
   asphalt concrete (AC) thermal fracture, AC bottom-up fatigue cracking
   and AC top-down fatigue cracking. However, these inputs with different
   levels of accuracy may have significant impact on performance
   prediction. This study focuses on the sensitivity of the inputs of MEPDG
   distresses to identify the effect of the accuracy level of inputs based
   on experimental design. A local sensitivity analysis is carried out to
   identify the main effect of inputs considering them as independent
   variables. Interaction effects are also analysed based on random
   combination of the inputs. Sensitive input variables and their
   combinations are evaluated through a multiple regression analysis for
   respective distresses.}},

Abstract = {{Protein analysis is a fundamental aspect of biochemical research. Gold
   nanoparticles are an emerging platform for various biological
   applications given their high surface area, biocompatibility, and unique
   optical properties. The colorimetric properties of gold nanoparticles
   make them ideal for point-of-care diagnostics. Different aspects of gold
   nanoparticle-protein interactions have been investigated to predict the
   effect of protein adsorption on colloidal stability, but the role of
   surfactants is often overlooked, despite their potential to alter both
   protein and nanoparticle properties. Herein we present a method by which
   gold nanoparticles can be prepared in various surfactants and used for
   array-based quantification and identification of proteins. The exchange
   of surfactant not only changed the zeta potential of those gold
   nanoparticles but also drastically altered their aggregation response to
   five different proteins (bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin,
   immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, and hemoglobin) in a concentration-dependent
   manner. Finally, we demonstrate that varying surfactant concentration
   can be used to control assay sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Standard camera and projector calibration techniques use a checkerboard
   that is manually shown at different poses to determine the calibration
   parameters. Furthermore, when image geometric correction must be
   performed on a three-dimensional (3D) surface, such as projection
   mapping, the surface geometry must be determined. Camera calibration and
   3D surface estimation can be costly, error prone, and time-consuming
   when performed manually. To address this issue, we use an
   auto-calibration technique that projects a series of Gray code
   structured light patterns. These patterns are captured by the camera to
   build a dense pixel correspondence between the projector and camera,
   which are used to calibrate the stereo system using an objective
   function, which embeds the calibration parameters together with the
   undistorted points. Minimization is carried out by a greedy algorithm
   that minimizes the cost at each iteration with respect to both
   calibration parameters and noisy image points. We test the
   auto-calibration on different scenes and show that the results closely
   match a manual calibration of the system. We show that this technique
   can be used to build a 3D model of the scene, which in turn with the
   dense pixel correspondence can be used for geometric screen correction
   on any arbitrary surface.}},

Abstract = {{Improving image resolution by refining hardware is usually expensive
   and/or time consuming. A critical challenge is to optimally balance the
   trade-off among image resolution, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and
   acquisition time. Super-resolution (SR), an off-line approach for
   improving image resolution, is free from these trade-offs. Numerous
   methodologies such as interpolation, frequency domain, regularization,
   and learning-based approaches have been developed for SR of natural
   images. In this paper we provide a survey of the existing SR techniques.
   Various approaches for obtaining a high resolution image from a single
   and/or multiple low resolution images are discussed. We also compare the
   performance of various SR methods in terms of Peak SNR (PSNR) and
   Structural Similarity (SSIM) index between the super-resolved image and
   the ground truth image. For each method, the computational time is also
   reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{548-555}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to determine the impact of the experimental
   conditions (number and sampling time) of measurements of the water
   content on the identifiability of a concentration-dependent water
   diffusivity. Water contents simulating a drying process were generated
   from a diffusion model with the addition of Gaussian noise. An infinite
   slab with Dirichlet boundary conditions was considered. The coefficients
   describing a concentration-dependent water diffusivity were estimated
   from the water content by least-squares minimization. The
   identifiability of the coefficients was investigated from the model
   sensitivity functions and using the asymptotic method, the profile
   likelihood method, and Monte Carlo simulation. The inner product
   sensitivity matrix was full rank, indicating that the coefficients were
   locally structurally identifiable. The coefficients were estimated more
   accurately from water content obtained over the whole drying process,
   because sampling times concentrated in a short period increased the
   correlation between the coefficients and increased their uncertainty.
   The coefficients were practically identifiable from the water content
   for noise intensity below 0.4\%. Above that threshold, the number of
   measurements of the water content required for the practical
   identifiability of the coefficients increased linearly with the noise
   intensity of the water content. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Heat treated iron-polyaniline-carbon - based non-precious metal
   catalysts represent a promising class of material to replace the
   platinum based ORR catalysts for PEMFC technologies. In the present
   research, we apply an ammonia treatment to tune the structure and
   activity of electrocatalysts derived from iron, polyaniline and carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs). By controlling the NH3 reaction conditions, we were
   able to tune the chemistry of nitrogen incorporation, including
   concentration and dopant type. The final catalyst had a robust
   morphology consisting of highly porous 2-D in-situ formed graphene-like
   structures that, along with the intermixed 1-D CNTs, were decorated with
   an abundance of nitrogen and iron species. The resultant surface
   chemistry led to impressive catalyst activity, with a half-wave
   potential of 0.81 V observed through half-cell testing and under H-2-air
   fuel cell testing, a current density of 77 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V was
   achieved, along with a maximum power density of 335 mW cm(-2). (C) 2016

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Resonant tunneling can lead to inverse tunnel magnetoresistance when
   impurity levels rather than direct tunneling dominate the transport
   process. We fabricated hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions of
   CoFe/LiF/EuS/Ti, with an epitaxial LiF energy barrier joined with a
   polycrystalline EuS spin-filter barrier. Due to the water solubility of
   LiF, the devices were fully packaged in situ. The devices showed
   sizeable positive TMR up to 16\% at low bias voltages but clearly
   inverted TMR at higher bias voltages. The TMR inversion depends
   sensitively on the thickness of LiF, and the tendency of inversion
   disappears when LiF gets thick enough and recovers its intrinsic
   properties. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content, except where

Title = {{Large eddy simulation of the near-field vortex dynamics in starting
   square jet transitioning into steady state}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Large eddy simulation (LES) is carried out to study the vortex dynamics
   in the near-field of a starting turbulent square jet as well as its
   evolution into a developed steady jet. Simulations are conducted at
   Reynolds numbers (Re = UjD/nu) of 8000 and 45 000 based on the nozzle
   hydraulic diameter (D) and jet velocity (U-j). A Reynolds stress model
   was used to simulate the internal flow in the nozzle which provided the
   inlet conditions for the LES of the jet. To validate the simulations,
   turbulence statistics are compared with experimental results available
   for a steady square jet. Evaluation of the probability density function,
   skewness, and flatness of the centerline streamwise velocity (U-c) shows
   deviation from the Gaussian distribution in the near-field. Evolution of
   the self-induced deformation of the leading vortex ring is investigated
   to further clarify the role of axis-switching. The axis-switching is
   initiated earlier at low Reynolds number while the completion of the
   axis-switching process occurred at the same dimensionless time for both
   Reynolds numbers. The role of pressure distribution on vortex ring
   deformation is investigated. It is shown that the influence of
   pressure-induced azimuthal instability tends to deform a two-dimensional
   vortex ring topology into a three-dimensional one and revert back to a
   two-dimensional character again. The break-down and diffusion of the tip
   of the vortex are also studied. Evolution of the shear layer from a
   starting jet to a developed jet is studied in terms of the vorticity
   field. For a starting jet, entrainment is shown to occur in the presence
   of corner hairpin vortices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution ice concentration maps are of great interest for ship
   navigation and ice hazard forecasting. In this case study, a
   convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used to estimate ice
   concentration using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes captured
   during the melt season. These dual-pol RADARSAT-2 satellite images are
   used as input, and the ice concentration is the direct output from the
   CNN. With no feature extraction or segmentation postprocessing, the
   absolute mean errors of the generated ice concentration maps are less
   than 10\% on average when compared with manual interpretation of the ice
   state by ice experts. The CNN is demonstrated to produce ice
   concentration maps with more detail than produced operationally.
   Reasonable ice concentration estimations are made in melt regions and in
   regions of low ice concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The TV white spaces (TVWS) enabled infostation has received significant
   attention due to its wide area coverage for cost-effective and
   media-rich content dissemination. In this paper, we engineer WhiteFi
   infostation, which is dedicated for Internet-based vehicular media
   streaming by leveraging geolocation database. After demonstrating the
   empirical observations of unique TVWS features and analyzing the
   real-world TVWS data collected from geolocation database, we first
   propose an optimal TVWS network planning to deploy WhiteFi infostation
   with the objective of maximizing network-wide throughput. The proposed
   TVWS network planning jointly considers the multi-radio configuration
   and the channel-power tradeoff, which can be realized by decentralized
   Markov approximation. Furthermore, we introduce a location-aware
   contention-free multi-polling access scheduling scheme for vehicular
   media streaming, which considered both the realistic vehicular
   applications and dynamics of wireless channel conditions. Through
   extensive simulations with real-world empirical TVWS data and urban
   vehicular traces, we demonstrate that our WhiteFi infostation solution
   can well support both the delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant vehicular
   media streaming services.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is developed to model a decision maker's (DM's) fuzzy
   and/or interval fuzzy preference over feasible scenarios or states
   within the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution. This
   technique uses the DM's fuzzy relative importance of its preference
   statements and their fuzzy truth values for the feasible states in a
   conflict under uncertain conditions. A preference statement of a DM is a
   preferable combination of DM's options or courses of action. The fuzzy
   importance for one preference statement over another, a value in the
   interval {[}0, 1], is interpreted as the degree to which the first
   preference statement is more important than the second to the DM. A
   fuzzy truth value of a preference statement at a feasible state is a
   number in the interval {[}0, 1] that represents the degree to which the
   statement is true at the state. When the DM is confident in its pairwise
   fuzzy importance degrees over the preference statements and their fuzzy
   truth values at the feasible states, the methodology provides a fuzzy
   preference over the states. When there is an ordinary or crisp
   importance ordering of preference statements and when the truth values
   of preference statements are classical or crisp at the feasible states,
   the technique generates a crisp preference over the states. The
   methodology is illustrated using a case study.}},

Abstract = {{For industrial wireless sensor networks, it is essential to reliably
   sense and deliver the environmental data on time to avoid system
   malfunction. While energy harvesting is a promising technique to extend
   the lifetime of sensor nodes, it also brings new challenges for system
   reliability due to the stochastic nature of the harvested energy. In
   this paper, we investigate the optimal energy management policy to
   minimize the weighted packet loss rate under the delay constraint, where
   the packet loss rate considers the lost packets, both during the sensing
   and delivering processes. We show that the above-mentioned energy
   management problem can be modeled as an infinite horizon average reward
   constraint Markov decision problem. In order to address the well-known
   curse of dimensionality problem and facilitate distributed
   implementation, we use the linear value approximation technique.
   Moreover, we apply stochastic online learning with a post-decision state
   to deal with the lack of the knowledge of the underlying stochastic
   processes. A distributed energy allocation algorithm with a
   water-filling structure and a scheduling algorithm by an auction
   mechanism are obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed
   algorithm achieves nearly the same performance as the optimal offline
   value iteration algorithm while requiring much less computation
   complexity and signaling overhead, and outperforms various existing
   baseline algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The previous model for the boundary layer nanofluid flow past a
   stretching surface with a specified nanoparticle volume fraction on the
   surface is revisited. The major limitation of the previous model is the
   active control of the nanoparticle volume fraction on the surface. In a
   revised model proposed in this paper, the nanoparticle volume fraction
   on the surface is passively controlled, which accounts for the effects
   of both the Brownian motion and the thermophoresis under the boundary
   condition, whereas the Buongiorno's model considers both effects in the
   governing equations. The assumption of zero nanoparticle flux on the
   surface makes the model physically more realistic. In the revised model,
   the dimensionless heat transfer rates are found to be higher whereas the
   dimensionless mass transfer rates are identically zero due to the
   passive boundary condition. It is also found that the Brownian motion
   parameter has a negligible effect on the Nusselt number.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an attempt is made to develop a bio-inspired soft sensor
   as a real-time identifier for online estimations of the engine-out
   hydrocarbon emission and exhaust gas temperature over the coldstart
   operation of an automotive engine. To date, a number of studies have
   been done to design soft models as offline identifiers for capturing the
   knowledge of a set of collected coldstart databases. The results
   indicated that bio-inspired computation can be of great use for the
   identification of coldstart phenomenon. It also can be a good
   alternative to classic approaches. However, bio-inspired soft sensors
   have not been used as online estimators for monitoring the behavior of
   coldstart phenomenon. This is while it is desirable to have a flexible,
   inexpensive online identifier which can be employed to detect the
   real-time behavior of the engine over coldstart periods. Here, an
   exhaustive numerical study is conducted to demonstrate the potentials of
   bio-inspired approaches for online measuring of engine-out hydrocarbon
   emission and exhaust gas temperature during the coldstart operation. To
   do so, a set of well-known bio-inspired optimizers are combined with a
   time-delayed artificial neural network to design an evolvable soft
   sensor. The results clearly demonstrate the high potential of
   bio-inspired computation for handling the difficulties associated with
   the real-time identification of engine-out hydrocarbon emission and
   exhaust gas temperature.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The flow development and structural loading characteristics of cylinders
   with equispaced circular fins were studied experimentally for a range of
   fin pitches with constant fin thickness and diameter. The experiments
   were performed for a range of Reynolds numbers, corresponding to the
   shear layer transition turbulent shedding regime. Time-resolved planar
   Particle Image Velocimetry and direct meati drag and fluctuating lift
   measurements are employed to relate spatio-temporal flow development to
   structural loading. The results show that wake development is dominated
   by vortex shedding for all the cases examined. However, the fin pitch
   ratio has a significant effect on vortex shedding characteristics. The
   addition of fins increases the characteristic spatial and temporal
   scales of the main spanwise vortices forming in the near wake. As the
   fin pitch is decreased to a critical value, the coalescence of boundary
   layers between the adjacent fins leads to a significant enlargement of
   the vortex formation region. A modified vortex shedding frequency
   scaling is proposed, based on the effective diameter, that incorporates
   a Reynolds number dependence associated with the lateral boundary layers
   developing on the fin surfaces. A detailed analysis is conducted to
   characterize the strength of the vortical structures forming in the near
   wake. The addition of the fins is shown to produce a stabilizing effect
   on the roll-up process, associated with a reduction in the generation of
   smaller scale, three-dimensional structures. The results demonstrate
   that the addition of fins leads to an increase in the mean drag, which
   is driven primarily by the associated increase in skin friction. The
   significant effect of the fin pitch ratio on the characteristics of the
   shed vortices as well as the size of the vortex formation region is
   shown to lead to substantial variations in the fluctuating loads. (C)

   100,000 and an angle of attack of 5 deg are investigated experimentally
   using a combination of surface pressure measurements; time-resolved flow
   visualization; and time-resolved planar two-component particle image
   velocimetry. The results show that strongly periodic shear-layer
   vortices form in the separation bubble due to the amplification of
   disturbances in the fore portion of the bubble. These structures feature
   strong spanwise coherence at rollup; however, they deform rapidly
   upstream of the mean reattachment location. Spanwise undulations in the
   vortex filaments develop in a nonperiodic fashion, with the spanwise
   wavelength shown to be approximately two times the streamwise spacing of
   the shed structures. It is demonstrated that these spanwise deformations
   lead to regions of local vortex breakup, which expand rapidly as the
   vortices approach the mean reattachment point. This is associated with a
   rapid decay of the spanwise coherence length, which reaches a constant
   minimum value typical of turbulent boundary layers just downstream of
   mean reattachment. The results demonstrate that the development of
   shear-layer vortices plays the fundamental role in the formation of the
   separation bubble, and the later stages of transition are directly
   related to the breakup of these structures in the aft portion of the
   separation bubble.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a novel multi-class brain-computer interface (
   BCI) for communication and control. In this system, the information
   processing is shared by the algorithm ( computer) and the user ( human).
   Specifically, an electro-tactile cycle was presented to the user,
   providing the choice ( class) by delivering timely sensory input. The
   user discriminated these choices by his/ her endogenous sensory ability
   and selected the desired choice with an intuitive motor task. This
   selection was detected by a fast brain switch based on real-time
   detection of movement-related cortical potentials from scalp EEG. We
   demonstrated the feasibility of such a system with a four-class BCI,
   yielding a true positive rate of 80 and 70, and an information transfer
   rate of 7 bits min and 5 bits min, for the movement and imagination
   selection command, respectively. Furthermore, when the system was
   extended to eight classes, the throughput of the system was improved,
   demonstrating the capability of accommodating a large number of classes.
   Combining the endogenous sensory discrimination with the fast brain
   switch, the proposed system could be an effective, multi-class,
   gaze-independent BCI system for communication and control applications.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A new method for nonlinear analysis of Euler-Bernoulli beams resting on
   heterogeneous, multilayered soil is presented. The governing
   differential equations for beam and soil displacements are obtained
   using the principle of virtual work, and these equations are solved
   using one-dimensional finite-element and finite-difference methods.
   Using the analysis, beam displacements can be obtained as a nonlinear
   function of applied loads if the beam and soil geometry and properties
   are known. The distinct feature of the analysis is that beam responses
   with accuracy comparable with those obtained from equivalent
   two-dimensional finite-element analysis are obtained within seconds.
   Examples illustrate how the proposed method can be applied in practice
   to obtain beam displacements in soil deposits that are characterized
   with nonlinear stress-strain relationships, have multiple layers, and
   have a modulus varying spatially within each soil layer. Parametric
   studies are performed that highlight the effects of soil layering and
   nonlinearity on the beam response.}},

   using piperazine and MEA}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed a decentralized control scheme and
   investigate the performance of the piperazine (PZ) and monoethanolamine
   (MEA) CO2 capture process for industrially-relevant operation scenarios.
   The base for the design of the control schemes is Relative Gain Array
   (RGA) analysis combined with open-loop dynamic sensitivity analysis.
   This study suggests that controllers with smaller time integrals and
   larger gains are required to maintain the PZ plant within reasonable
   short closed-loop settling times when compared to MEA. It also shows
   that the offset from the designated set-points in the presence of
   disturbances in the flue gas flow and heat duty is larger using PZ
   compared to MEA. The settling time for the PZ plant is generally larger
   than for MEA. However, the PZ plant rejects the disturbances faster and
   with less variability in the load of the power plant. Furthermore, this
   study indicates that the proposed PI-based control structure can handle
   large changes in the load provided that the manipulated variables, i.e.
   lean solvent flow or reboiler duty, do not reach their saturation limit.
   Additionally, we observed that shortage in the steam supply (reboiler
   duty) may represent a critical operational bottleneck, especially when
   PZ is being used. The MEA plant controllers drive the system towards
   drying out/flooding while the CO2 capture rate performance of the PZ
   plant reduces drastically in the presence of constraints in the
   availability of steam. These findings suggest the need for advanced
   control structures, e.g. MPC, which can explicitly account for
   constraints in the process variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{71-87}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to develop a comprehensive beam model
   based on the micropolar elasticity theory which is as general, as easy
   to use, and as convenient as the classical beam theories. Uncomplicated
   torsion and bending theories for micropolar elastic beams deforming in
   three-dimensional space and under different types of external loading
   and boundary conditions are presented in this paper. Unlike the
   classical beam models, the developed beam model includes the effect of
   microinertia and contains new material parameters to capture the
   microstructure-dependent size effects which could be useful when dealing
   with micro scale beams. The presented micropolar beam model generalizes
   the Duleau torsion and Timoshenko bending beam models to include the
   microstructure effects. Hamilton's principle and a variational approach
   are used to derive the dynamic equations of the micropolar beam with
   longitudinal, torsional, and bending deformations. Then the governing
   dynamic equations are solved numerically by using a finite element
   approach and numerical results for a simply supported micropolar beam
   are provided. The static and dynamic behaviors of the developed
   micropolar beam model are studied and compared against the classical
   beam models. In particular, the conditions for recovery of the results
   of the classical beam theories, i.e. Duleau and Timoshenko theories, are
   addressed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic complementary peptides have shown potential in delivering

   complementary peptides, EAR16-II, EAR8-II, EAR8-IIa and ELR8-IIa, is
   derived from the most studied ionic complementary peptide EAK16-II. The
   purpose is to investigate the impact of peptide sequence on
   nanostructure formation, delivery efficacy and cell specificity of the
   peptide-drug complex. We show that the peptide length has a pronounced
   impact on the morphology of peptide complex with the anticancer drug
   ellipticine (EPT), and the amino acid arrangement affects the complex
   size. Cytotoxicity studies show that the complexes are effective at
   inhibiting the growth of A549 lung cancer cells and EAR16-II-EPT is the
   most effective. Interestingly, the complexes formulated with EAR16-II
   and EAR8-II become less active against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but
   more hemolytic than the other two complexes. This work provides

Abstract = {{The establishment of a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
   repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system for strain construction in Bacillus subtilis
   is essential for its progression toward industrial utility. Here we
   outline the development of a CRISPR-Cas9 tool kit for comprehensive
   genetic engineering in B. subtilis. In addition to site-specific
   mutation and gene insertion, our approach enables continuous genome
   editing and multiplexing and is extended to CRISPR interference
   (CRISPRi) for transcriptional modulation. Our tool kit employs
   chromosomal expression of Cas9 and chromosomal transcription of guide
   RNAs (gRNAs) using a gRNA transcription cassette and counterselectable
   gRNA delivery vectors. Our design obviates the need for multicopy
   plasmids, which can be unstable and impede cell viability. Efficiencies
   of up to 100\% and 85\% were obtained for single and double gene
   mutations, respectively. Also, a 2.9-kb hyaluronic acid (HA)
   biosynthetic operon was chromosomally inserted with an efficiency of
   69\%. Furthermore, repression of a heterologous reporter gene was
   achieved, demonstrating the versatility of the tool kit. The performance
   of our tool kit is comparable with those of systems developed for
   Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which rely on replicating
   vectors to implement CRISPR-Cas9 machinery.
   IMPORTANCE
   In this paper, as the first approach, we report implementation of the
   CRISPR-Cas9 system in Bacillus subtilis, which is recognized as a
   valuable host system for biomanufacturing. The study enables
   comprehensive engineering of B. subtilis strains with virtually any
   desired genotypes/phenotypes and biochemical properties for extensive
   industrial application.}},

Abstract = {{A two-point expression of effective drive current (I-eff\_PG) for
   pass-gate (PG) transistors is proposed for the first time. We
   demonstrate that the proposed expression of I-eff\_PG estimates the PG
   latency with a reasonable accuracy (relative error <15\%) under
   different technology nodes from 90 to 20 nm and a wide range of biasing
   conditions including gate overdrive voltage up to 0.4 V and nonzero body
   bias between -0.3 and 0.3 V. The effective drive current expression is
   simple to use, independent of process technologies, and maintains
   accuracy when transistors are scaled down to deep submicron regime with
   severe nonidealities such as drain-induced barrier lowering. I-eff\_PG
   provides a simple yet efficient approach for technology evaluation and
   projection for PG heavy applications such as field-programmable gate
   array routing. We also show that the previously proposed static CMOS
   effective drive current (I-eff\_inv) is not a valid figure of merit when
   applied to PG transistors, because PG transistors operate in a different
   regime from the transistors in CMOS inverters. The scaling trend of
   I-eff\_PG is discussed, which illustrates the I-eff\_PG does not improve
   from device scaling as much as CMOS saturation current (I-dsat) and
   effective drive current (I-eff\_inv) do.}},

Title = {{Performance of Pedestrian-Load Models through Experimental Studies on
   Lightweight Aluminum Bridges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aluminum structures provide a high strength-to-weight ratio, are
   corrosion resistant, and are esthetically pleasing. Hence, their use in
   bridge construction has recently begun to increase, especially for
   pedestrian bridges. Because of their relative light weight as compared
   with other structures, they often exhibit fundamental vertical
   frequencies outside the range of normal pedestrian walking frequencies.
   Despite this, they tend to be lively structures, easily excited by
   pedestrians, resulting in large-amplitude accelerations. An experimental
   program was undertaken by the authors to study the vibration
   characteristics and performance of three full-scale aluminum pedestrian
   bridges, two in the laboratory and one in the field. Although the lowest
   fundamental frequencies for all three bridges fall outside the normal
   range of pedestrian walking frequencies, there is the possibility of
   higher harmonics of walking loads near resonance or in resonance with
   the fundamental vertical mode. The aluminum bridges studied were
   instrumented and subjected to a range of pedestrian-load tests to
   understand the performance of existing periodic models in predicting the
   dynamic response. The performance of these models (assuming pedestrian
   forces to be a summation of harmonics) has thus far only been assessed
   for cases in which the fundamental frequency is resonant with the first
   harmonic of walking, often considered the most severe case for design.
   This is the first time, to the knowledge of the authors, that these
   models have been studied for the case of bridges that are nonresonant
   with the fundamental mode. This article notes important observations
   regarding the performance of these models in predicting the
   serviceability of bridges made out of lightweight materials, such as
   aluminum, for cases in which the higher harmonics of pedestrian walking
   are either nonresonant or near resonance with the fundamental vertical
   flexure mode.}},

Title = {{A compact in-blade five hole pressure probe for local inflow study on a
   horizontal axis wind turbine}},
Journal = {{WIND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-378}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Understanding local inflow conditions on a wind turbine blade on an
   operating wind turbine can further understanding of aerodynamic
   variations and help predict loads on the turbine. Turbine blades are
   generally designed with a two-dimensional steady approach, however the
   real wind conditions are highly three-dimensional (3D) and unsteady.
   Detailed measurements are not common for validating aerodynamic models.
   The aim of this theoretical and experimental study is to build,
   calibrate, install and test a compact in-blade five hole pressure probe
   system to be used to retrieve these measurements. Wind tunnel
   calibration of the five hole pressure probe has been successfully
   completed using an automated traversing system over a +/- 45 degrees
   range, with 5 degrees increments. Error analysis showed that the
   multi-zone pressure coefficient data reduction approach is the most
   suitable for this application. This approach not only extends the
   measurable local inflow angles up to +/- 70 degrees, but also it allows
   any reference pressure for differential pressure readings. A new data
   acquisition system (DAQ) internal to a rotating small wind turbine blade
   section was developed. Space limitations resulted in a custom built DAQ
   of very contained dimensions. This included, among others, five pressure
   transducers on a printed circuit board, a 16 bit analog to digital
   converter, an Arduino microcontroller, and a Bluetooth transceiver to
   transmit the data wirelessly to the main computer. The new blade section
   was designed and 3D-printed in such a way that the DAQ instrumentation
   could be easily accessed and, at the same time, had an acceptable
   structural solidity. A series of tests were conducted on a 3.4 m
   diameter wind turbine in a large scale wind tunnel in order to assess
   the correct functioning of the probe system. As expected, the inflow
   measurement obtained while the turbine was operating under yawed
   conditions showed a periodically oscillating inflow vector. The period
   of this variation was the same as the period of the rotor rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle rollovers are a serious safety issue for drivers and passengers
   and have led to many fatal accidents on the road. This paper describes a
   system and a method of enhancing vehicular stability to reduce the

   control strategy called pulsed active rear steering was investigated and
   is discussed in detail. To verify this system, the yaw and roll model
   was derived and the pulse signal parameters (the frequency and the
   amplitude) were evaluated to determine their optimum values. A
   full-vehicle model was built in CarSim and co-simulated with
   MATLAB/Simulink as the control module. Moreover, we designed and
   prototyped the proposed system for a sport utility vehicle and then
   conducted road tests with different manoeuvres. The results from
   simulations and experiments confirmed that the proposed pulsed active
   rear-steering system is promising for rollover prevention of sport

Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Polymeric foam materials may be used as energy absorbing materials for
   protection in impact scenarios, and design with these materials requires
   the mechanical properties of foams across a range of deformation rates,
   where high deformation rate testing often requires small samples for
   testing. Owing to their cellular macrostructure, and the large
   deformations that occur during loading of foams, the measured
   stress-strain response of a foam material may be influenced by the
   sample size. In this study, the mechanical properties of three
   closed-cell polymeric foams (Low Density Polyethylene, Expanded
   Polystyrene and Expanded Polypropylene) at two different densities were
   investigated over a range of deformation rates from 0.01 s(-1) to 100
   s(-1). For each foam material, three different nominal sample sizes (10
   mm, 17 mm and 35 mm) were tested. On average, the polymeric foam
   materials exhibited increasing stress with increasing deformation rate,
   for a given amount of strain. Density variation was identified at the
   sample level, with smaller samples often exhibiting lower density.
   Expanded Polystyrene demonstrated the highest variability in sample
   density and corresponding variability in mechanical response,
   qualitatively supported by observed variations in the macrostructure of
   the foam. Expanded Polypropylene exhibited variability in density with
   sample size, and observable variability in the material macrostructure;
   however, the dependence of the measured mechanical properties on sample
   size was modest. Low Density Polyethylene was found to have a relatively
   consistent cell size at the macrostructure level, and the material
   density did not vary significantly with sample size. In a similar
   manner, the dependence of measured mechanical properties on sample size
   was modest. The effect of sample size was identified to be material
   specific, and it is recommended that this be assessed using
   sample-specific density measurements and considering different sized
   samples when testing foam materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{After the concept of the active wiretapper was proposed, integrity
   protection became more important than ever before. Therefore, message
   authentication code, a method that protects the message from being
   modified in an undetectable way, attracts more attention nowadays. In
   this paper, we propose two new message authentication codes based on
   almost perfect nonlinear functions and stream ciphers. The security of
   both new constructions is proved by giving upper bounds of the
   probability of the successful substitution forgery attacks against our
   new message authentication codes, and these upper bounds are negligible.
   We implement our algorithms and compare their time consumption with the
   time consumption of EIA1, the message authentication code used in the 4G
   LTE system. The results show that our algorithms are overwhelmingly
   faster than EIA1. Moreover, our new constructions are resistant to
   cycling and linear forgery attacks, which can be applied to EIA1.

   were performed inside two preschools at three classrooms (an activity
   room, classroom KG1 and classroom KG2) and three schools at different
   classrooms, starting from grade 1 to grade 12. The logarithmic average
   noise levels (L (Aeq avg)) and the 8-h average noise exposure level (L
   (EX, 8-h)) were estimated for each classroom. Furthermore, health risk
   issues associated with the exposure to high noise levels were
   investigated using a questionnaire and an interview with more than 250
   teachers at the preschools and the schools. Then, the results were
   analyzed using different statistical tools and were compared with the
   World Health Organization, Occupational Health and Safety and National
   Institute for Occupational Safety and Health standards. Also, the
   results were compared with those from different countries worldwide. The
   study results show that the 8-h average noise exposure level exceeded
   the allowable limits in some schools, which indicates that students and
   teachers can face a serious health effects from noise exposure. The
   comparisons show that the values of noise levels in Kuwait are higher
   than those in different countries. The maximum value of noise levels was
   found in secondary schools. The health problems found during the survey
   are potentially associated with issues related to hearing, voice,
   headache and the physiological function of teachers.}},

Abstract = {{In this context, we report a novel one-pot synthesis of S@Polypyrrole
   core-shell spheres as the cathode material in lithium-sulfur battery,
   designed by polypyrrole (PPy) wrapping on the formed nano-sulfur via the
   facile wet chemical strategy. The in-situ polymerized PPy layer in this
   special structure is helpful to inhibit aggregation of sulfur particles
   with small size, the polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, and offer
   fast and efficient transport of electron/lithium ion within the
   electrode. Besides, the flexible PPy layer effectively accommodates the
   volume expansion. PPy with partial PO43- doping was also employed to
   improve cycling stability and C-rate performance of S@PPy composite by
   exchanging a with PO43-. Thus, the sulfur electrode with a high sulfur
   loading of 80\% delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1142 mA h
   g(-1) and maintained a high capacity of 805 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles
   at 0.1 C. The corresponding capacity retention over 100 cycles was about
   65\%, with a limited decay of 0.3\% per cycle. Even at a high current
   density of 1.5 C, the composite still exhibited a high discharge
   capacity of about 700 mA h g(-1). This results mean that the designed
   electrode can achieve a high practical specific energy density of more
   than 400 W h/kg, far beyond the commercial LiCoO2 batteries. Due to low
   cost, facile large-scale synthesis and superior electrochemical
   performance of S@PPy cathode with high sulfur loading, this work will
   provide a very promising method to further promote the Li-S batteries in
   the practical application of portable electronic devices, electric
   devices and energy storage system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper extends hybrid-type optimization models of genetic algorithm
   adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (GA-ANFIS) for predicting
   the soil permeability coefficient (SPC) of different types of soil. In
   these models, GA optimizes parameters of a subtractive clustering
   technique that controls the structure of the ANFIS model's fuzzy rule
   base. Simultaneously, a hybrid leaning algorithm is employed in the
   ANFIS, as a trained fuzzy inference system (FIS), which optimally
   determines the parameter sets of the examined FISs in ANFIS. Using an
   updated large database of SPCs consisting of 338 fine-grained, 178 mixed
   and 94 granular soil samples, GA-ANFIS framework constructs different
   models of predicting the permeability coefficient of respectively
   fine-grained, mixed and granular soils. A fuzzy C-mean technique has
   been used to cluster the entire data samples of each type of soil and
   divide them uniformly into training and testing data sets. Different
   prediction models of SPC have been trained and tested for each of the
   three soil types, and the appropriate models have been selected. The
   selected models have been compared with ANN and modified-by-GA empirical
   prediction models. Results show that the constructed GA-ANFIS models
   outperform the other models in terms of the prediction accuracy and the
   generalization capability.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of the current investigation is to answer some open
   questions regarding the applicability of bio-inspired techniques for
   simultaneous evolving and training of extreme learning machines (ELMs).
   Over the past decade, ELMs have successfully been applied to a wide
   range of regression and classification problems. However, in most of the
   reports, classical learning systems have been used for training ELMs
   which can result in cumbersome mathematical formulations and unstable
   solutions when handling large databases. Moreover, there is no guarantee
   for converging to global optimum solutions when traditional methods are
   used for the regularized learning of ELMs, especially when the variables
   in the database are correlated. To cope with such flaws, some
   researchers have used bio-inspired computation (BIC) for the topology
   evolving and parameter tuning of ELMs. However, the research stream
   still experiences its infancy. In an attempt to take a significant
   stride towards fulfilling the existing gap, the authors conduct a
   comprehensive analysis by adopting different BIC and classical methods
   for training ELMs. Based on the simulation results, some recommendations
   are given to guide researchers on using appropriate BICs for ELM
   training for small-scale, medium-scale, large-scale and very large-scale
   regression and classification problems.}},

Title = {{Coevolution of variability models and related software artifacts}},
Journal = {{EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1744-1793}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Variant-rich software systems offer a large degree of customization,
   allowing users to configure the target system according to their
   preferences and needs. Facing high degrees of variability, these systems
   often employ variability models to explicitly capture user-configurable
   features (e.g., systems options) and the constraints they impose. The
   explicit representation of features allows them to be referenced in
   different variation points across different artifacts, enabling the
   latter to vary according to specific feature selections. In such
   settings, the evolution of variability models interplays with the
   evolution of related artifacts, requiring the two to evolve together, or
   coevolve. Interestingly, little is known about how such coevolution
   occurs in real-world systems, as existing research has focused mostly on
   variability evolution as it happens in variability models only.
   Furthermore, existing techniques supporting variability evolution are
   usually validated with randomly-generated variability models or
   evolution scenarios that do not stem from practice. As the community
   lacks a deep understanding of how variability evolution occurs in
   real-world systems and how it relates to the evolution of different
   kinds of software artifacts, it is not surprising that industry reports
   existing tools and solutions ineffective, as they do not handle the
   complexity found in practice. Attempting to mitigate this overall lack
   of knowledge and to support tool builders with insights on how
   variability models coevolve with other artifact types, we study a large
   and complex real-world variant-rich software system: the Linux kernel.
   Specifically, we extract variability-coevolution patterns capturing
   changes in the variability model of the Linux kernel with subsequent
   changes in Makefiles and C source code. From the analysis of the
   patterns, we report on findings concerning evolution principles found in
   the kernel, and we reveal deficiencies in existing tools and theory when
   handling changes captured by our patterns.}},

Title = {{EventHealer: Bypassing data races in event-driven programs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{208-220}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Data races represent a serious threat to the reliability of
   shared-memory concurrent programs including event-driven programs which
   handle asynchronous events. Despite the important number of existing
   testing and detection tools, data races often remain undetectable until
   the exploitation phase leading the application into unpredictable
   executions sometimes with disastrous consequences. To heal data races,
   current approaches which focus only on multithreaded programs are not
   directly applicable to event driven programs since they are still
   incomplete or incur a high runtime overhead which makes them also
   inappropriate for the exploitation phase. Thus, this paper proposes a
   hybrid technique that statically disassembles a program binary to
   collect information about critical sections and event handlers accessing
   each shared variable, to dynamically prevent data races from occurring
   by injecting a disabling and an enabling instruction respectively before
   and after every critical section, in order to enforce the
   synchronization property of the potentially harmful events. We
   implemented a prototype of this technique for sequential programs with
   signal handlers on top of the Pin instrumentation framework. An
   evaluation of this prototype proved its effectiveness and showed that
   our technique incurs only a negligible overhead to the monitored
   program. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   compound as a donor semiconductor for achieving high performance for
   OPV. Through an intensive study of the active layer using AFM, XRD, and

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are still attracting great attention
   as a potential alternative to conventional silicon solar cells, and a
   lot of current research is focusing on enhancing their efficiency
   through the individual improvement of the DSSCs components, as well as
   their integration. Among all components, mesoporous TiO2 plays a major
   role, because it is the charge collector for the dye molecules or
   perovskite in liquid and solid DSSCs, respectively. Specificities of
   TiO2 are now well-known: an anatase crystalline structure for an
   optimized bandgap, small particle size to shorten the charge diffusion
   path, reduced grain boundaries to limit current resistivity, significant
   porosity to enhance integration and interaction between the photon
   absorbers and the charge-collecting anode. We reported previously how
   well-crystallized small nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via
   a room temperature synthesis by Hegazy and Prouzet (2012) {[}10],
   leading to very small crystallites (4-10 nm) of pure TiO2 anatase. Since
   as-synthesized materials still contain hydration water, a major drawback
   in DSSCs, we report here how dehydration and crystallinity can be
   improved by annealing at a moderate temperature, without any sintering
   or significant particle coarsening. The resulting impact on properties
   is confirmed by testing the resulting annealed TiO2 nanopowder in
   photovoltaic liquid DSSCs. In addition, we describe a comprehensive
   study of the preparation and test of TiO2 based photoanodes, including
   UV exposure and HCl treatment. Photovoltaic tests were conducted on a
   large active surfaces (5 cm(2)) cells to give a more realistic picture
   of the influence of each parameter involved in the cell performance,
   characterized under AM 1.5 illumination with 100 mWcm(-2) light
   intensity. The specific contribution of each parameter on the cell
   performance is discussed. We demonstrate why the TiO2 nanopowder
   developed in our previous synthesis, in connection with the suitable
   treatments during the photoanode preparation, can replace commercial
   powders, with a greater success in cell photoefficiency. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{To predict fatigue life of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) modified

   Programming (GP), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Fuzzy Logic-based
   methods have been employed. In this study, an application of Support

   fatigue life of PET modified asphalt mixture. The inputs are PET
   percentages, stress levels and environmental temperatures. The
   performance of proposed method is validated against observed experiment
   data. The results of the prediction using SVM-FFA are then compared to
   those of applying ANN and GP approach and it is concluded that SVM-FFA
   leads to more accurate results when compared to observed experiment

Abstract = {{Detection of H2S in very low concentrations with innovative functional
   materials is of key importance in oil and gas industries. One approach
   to control the limit of detection for gas sensors is to engineer the
   shape of sensing nanostructures to develop high performance gas sensors.
   By controlling the process parameters in synthesizing of CuO
   nanostructures, programming the limit of detection has been obtained up
   to 100 ppb H2S for CuO-SWCNT nanostructures at room temperature. Gas
   sensing evaluation of nanomaterials indicates the role of surface to
   volume ratio on the performance of the sensors. The crystalline
   structure, chemical composition and morphological characterization have
   been studied by X-ray diffraction, Furrier transform IR spectroscopy,
   Raman spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The
   CuO-SWCNT nanomaterials has been immobilized on top-side of commercial
   13.56MHz radio frequency identification (RFID) tag by drop-casting to
   produce tag sensors. Due to change in radar cross section of the
   fabricated wireless devices, a reduction of reflectance and shift of
   peak frequency toward lower values is observed by increasing the gas
   concentration. Repeatability and long life-time (30 days) of fabricated
   sensors indicate their effective potential for remote healthcare and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Formation of metal-semiconductor (M-S) contacts at sub-20 nanometer
   range is a key requirement for down-scaling of semiconductor devices.
   However, electrical measurements of M-S contacts at this scale have
   exhibited dramatic change in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics
   compared to that of conventional (or planar) Schottky contacts. This
   change is actually attributed to the limited metal contact region where
   the transferred charge from the semiconductor into the metal is confined
   to a small surface area, which in turn results in an enhanced electric
   field at the nano-M-S interface. We here present detailed theoretical
   models to analyze the nano-M-S junctions at 10 nm contact range and then
   implement this analysis on the experimental data we conducted under
   these conditions. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate
   a significant effect of the contact size on the electronic structure of
   the M-S junctions and thus on the I-V characteristics. This effect is
   rather prominent when the size of the metal contact is substantially
   smaller than the width of conventional depletion region of the relevant
   planar M-S contacts. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{A pressure sensor based on irregular microhump patterns has been
   proposed and developed. The devices show high sensitivity and broad
   operating pressure regime while comparing with regular micropattern
   devices. Finite element analysis (FEA) is utilized to confirm the
   sensing mechanism and predict the performance of the pressure sensor
   based on the microhump structures. Silicon carbide sandpaper is employed
   as the mold to develop polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microhump patterns
   with various sizes. The active layer of the piezoresistive pressure
   sensor is developed by spin coating PEDOT: PSS on top of the patterned
   PDMS. The devices show an averaged sensitivity as high as 851 kPa(-1),
   broad operating pressure range (20 kPa), low operating power (100 nW),
   and fast response speed (6.7 kHz). Owing to their flexible properties,
   the devices are applied to human body motion sensing and radial artery
   pulse. These flexible high sensitivity devices show great potential in
   the next generation of smart sensors for robotics, real-time health

Abstract = {{Optical characterization of graphite anodes in lithium ion batteries
   (LIB) is presented here for potential use in estimating their state of
   charge (SOC). The characterization is based on reflectance spectroscopy
   of the anode of commercial LIB cells and in situ optical measurements
   using an embedded optical fiber sensor. The optical characterization of
   the anode using wavelengths ranging from 500 to 900 nm supports the
   dominance of graphite over the solid electrolyte interface in governing
   the anode's reflectance properties. It is demonstrated that lithiated
   graphite's reflectance has a significant change in the near-infrared
   band, 750-900 nm, compared with the-visible spectrum as a function of
   SOC. An embedded optical sensor is used to measure the transmittance of
   graphite anode in the near-infrared band, and the results suggest that a
   unique inexpensive method may be developed to estimate the SOC of a LIB.}},

Abstract = {{The Fe-Cr-Ti-Nb elemental powders were mechanically alloyed/ball milled
   with TiB2 and a small quantity of Y2O3 ceramic to synthesize a novel
   Fe-based alloy-ceramic powder composite that could be processed by hot
   isostatic pressing (HIP) for a perceived potential application as a
   neutron absorber in nuclear reactors. After ball milling for the 30-80 h
   duration relatively uniform powders with micrometric sizes were
   produced. With increasing milling time a fraction of TiB2 particles
   became covered with the much softer Fe-based alloy which resulted in the
   formation of a characteristic ``core-mantel{''} structure. For the final
   HIP-ing process the mechanically alloyed powders were initially
   uniaxially pressed into rod-shaped compacts and then cold isostatically
   pressed (CIP-ed). Subsequently, the rod-shaped compacts were placed in
   the Ti-tubing and subjected to hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1150
   degrees C/200 MPa pressure. The HIP-ing process resulted in the
   formation of the near-Ti and intermediate diffusional layers in the
   microstructure of HIP-ed samples which formed in accord with the Fe-Ti
   binary phase diagram. Those layers contain the phases such as alpha-Ti
   (HCP), the FeTi intermetallic and their hypoeutectoid mixtures. In
   addition, needle-like particles were formed in both layers in accord
   with the Ti-B binary phase diagram. Nanohardness testing, using a
   Berkovich type diamond tip, shows that the nanohardness in the
   intermediate layer areas, corresponding to the composition of the
   hypo-eutectoid mixture of Ti-FeTi, equals 980.0 (+/- 27.1) HV and
   correspondingly 1176.9 (+/- 47.6) HV for the FeTi phase. The
   nanohardness in the sample's center in the areas with the fine mixture
   of Fe-based alloy and small TiB2 particles equals 1048.3 (+/- 201.8) HV.
   The average microhardness of samples HIP-ed from powders milled for 30
   and 80 h is 588 HV and 733 HV, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Graphene and its functionalized derivatives are unique and multifaceted
   novel materials with a wide range of applications in chemistry,
   healthcare, and optoelectronic engineering. 3D graphene materials
   exhibit several advantages over 2D (monolayer) graphene for a variety of
   devices applications. Here a novel and effective room temperature
   technique is introduced to convert an aqueous graphene oxide solution
   into a reduced graphene oxide gel with tunable physical and chemical
   properties comparable to a monolayer graphene sheet, without the need
   for any additives or chemical agents. The femtogel is synthesized by
   exposing an ultrahigh concentration graphene oxide solution with
   single-layer flakes to high intensity femtosecond laser pulses. The
   femtosecond laser beam is focused on the air/aqueous solution interface
   to enhance the vaporization of functional groups and water, enabling
   femtogel formation. By controlling the pulsed laser intensity, beam
   focal parameters, and pulse duration, it is possible to produce several
   milliliters of femtogel in as little as 8 min. Through initial
   optimization of the irradiation parameters, a thin film is produced from
   a femtogel that demonstrates a surface roughness less than 6 nm, and
   more than 95\% reduction in OH absorbance, as compared to a thin film
   produced from the unexposed graphene oxide solution.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{29}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Silver nanobelts are demonstrated here to undergo inter-particle joining
   at relatively low temperatures of less than 180 degrees C. For
   surface-coated networks of nanobelts this joining reduced the network
   sheet resistance by 95\%. The joining mechanism appears to be
   non-diffusional oriented attachment, caused by the thermal reactivation
   of the halted oriented attachment mechanism that occurred originally at
   room temperature during the rapid nanobelt synthesis. This self-assembly
   mechanism was explored by in situ electrical and calorimetric
   experiments, and supported by electron microscopy. Unlike pentagonal
   silver nanowires, silver nanobelts do not rely on diffusional
   instability to achieve workably low joining temperatures. The oriented
   attachment displayed by nanobelts represents a new approach to achieving
   valuable reductions in network resistance, disentangled from the
   instability and diffusion-driven failure by nanoparticle degradation
   displayed by competing silver nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the electrochemical behavior of free base and zinc
   mesa-substituted porphyrins is examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
   density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the half-wave
   oxidation potential splitting of the two oxidation states (Delta E=
   second E-1/2 - first E-1/2) of tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) and its zinc
   complex (ZnTPP) are higher than those of porphyrins and their zinc
   complexes with meso-substituted five-membered heterocylic rings. The
   Delta E values follow the trend of TPP > T(3'-thienyl)P > T(3'-furyl)P >
   T(2'-thienyl)P for both meso-porphyrins and their respective zinc
   complexes. By employing DFT calculations, we have found that the trend
   of Delta E values is consistent with that of highest spin density (HSD)
   distribution and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of cationic radicals as well as
   the pi-conjugation between central porphyrin and meso-substituted rings.
   Also, they exhibit the better resonance between the porphyrin ring with
   meso-substituted rings as moving from porphyrins and their zinc
   complexes with phenyl rings to five membered heterocyclic rings. A good
   agreement between calculated and experimental results indicates that
   cationic radicals, especially their spin density distribution, do play
   an important role in half-wave oxidation potential splitting of
   meso-porphyrins and their zinc complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting can be leveraged by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to
   address its energy-scarcity problem, giving rise to Energy Harvesting
   Wireless Sensor Network (EHWSN). Residual energy balancing of sensors is
   the key issue to avoid sensors' failure and promise the network function
   of EHWSN. In this paper, by exploiting the sensors around the source and
   sink as relays, we propose a distributed relay selection and power
   control scheme to balance sensors' residual energy in EHWSN. To achieve
   the optimal power control of each relay, we formulate a maximization of
   minimum value problem which can be efficiently solved by utilizing its
   linear structure. The optimal relay is selected in a distributed manner
   by setting the highest priority to the relay which can maximize the
   minimum residual energy of sensors. Through extensive performance
   evaluations, we verify that DEBS can be applied to effectively balance
   the residual energy of sensors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a discrete-time learning algorithm for fast image
   restoration using a novel L-2-norm noise constrained estimation. The
   noise constrained estimation approach can relax the need of the optimal
   regularization parameter to be estimated. Performance analysis shows
   that the proposed algorithm can converge globally to a robust optimal
   weight vector. Compared with the cooperative neural fusion (CNF)
   algorithm minimizing L-1-norm estimation, the proposed algorithm only
   needs O(N) multiplication operationper iteration, instead of O(N-2)
   multiplication operation required by the CNF algorithm. Moreover, the
   proposed fusion approach overcomes the difficulty of estimating the
   noise error set in the CNF approach. Simulation results show by
   comparison that under the non-optimal regularization parameter, the
   proposed algorithm can obtain a better restored estimate in Gaussian
   mixture noise and can run much faster compared to the CNF algorithm. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{670}},

Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Anisotropic fatigue and cyclic behaviour of AM30 Mg alloy extrusion is
   investigated by performing fully-reversed strain-controlled
   tension-compression cyclic tests at strain amplitudes between 0.3\% and
   2.3\%, along extrusion (ED) and transverse (TD) directions. The shapes
   of half-life hysteresis loops suggest the predominance of slip and
   twinning/de-twinning mechanisms below and above the strain amplitude of
   0.5\%, respectively. The twinning/de-twinning occurrence is found to be
   more extensive during straining along ED, which results in higher
   asymmetry of hysteresis loops, and thereby, higher induced mean stress.
   This adversely affects the fatigue resistance and yields to less number
   of cycles before failure in ED. Optical microscopy and texture analysis
   are employed to validate the findings. In addition, fracture surfaces
   are studied by scanning electron microscopy to identify the sources of
   fatigue crack initiation. Persistent slip bands (PSBs) and twin lamellae
   interfaces are evidenced as crack initiation sites at low and high
   strain amplitudes, respectively. Cracks emanated from debonded inclusion
   interface are also observed. Lastly, estimated fatigue life by
   Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) and Jahed-Varvani (JV) fatigue models are
   compared with experimental life obtained through this study as well as
   the ones reported in the literature. The JV energy model is proven to
   yield better life predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An energy optimization model for the integration of renewable
   technologies into the energy infrastructure of the oil sands industry is
   presented. The proposed model determines the optimal configuration of
   oil producers and the energy infrastructure required to meet their
   energy demands. The model is geared toward the minimization of cost
   subject to carbon dioxide emission constraints. A mixed integer
   non-linear optimization model is developed that simultaneously optimizes
   capacity expansion and new investment decisions of conventional and
   renewable energy technologies. To illustrate its applicability, the
   proposed model was applied to a case study using data reported in the
   literature for various years of oil sands operations. A rolling horizon
   approach was implemented to determine the effect of investment decisions
   of previous operational years on the selection of new investment
   options. Results were compared with and without the incorporation of
   renewable energy technologies. The results obtained indicate that the
   proposed model is a practical tool that can be employed to evaluate and
   plan oil sands and energy producers for future scenarios. Moreover, the
   results show that renewable energy technologies have significant
   potential in reducing reliance on fossil-fuel based technologies and
   their associated CO2 emissions. The emission constraints set for the
   operational year 2025 can only be achieved by the incorporation of
   renewables in the energy production mix. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel microfluidic valve by utilizing induced charge
   electro-osmotic flow (ICEOF) is proposed and analyzed. The key part of
   the microfluidic valve is a Y-shaped microchannel. A small metal plate
   is placed at each corner of the junction of the Y-shaped microchannel.
   When a DC electrical field is applied through the channels,
   electro-osmotic flows occur in the channels, and two vortices will be
   formed near each of the metal plates due to the ICEOF. The two vortices
   behave like virtual `blocking columns' to restrain and direct the flow
   in the Y-channel. In this paper, effects of the length of the metal
   plates, the applied voltages, the width of the microchannel, the zeta
   potential of the non-metal microchannel wall, and the orientation of the
   branch channels on the flow switching between two outlet channels are
   numerically investigated. The results show that the flow switching
   between the two outlet channels can be flexibly achieved by adjusting
   the applied DC voltages. The critical switching voltage (CSV), under
   which one outlet channel is closed, decreases with the increase in the
   metal plate length and the orientation angle of the outlet channels. The
   CSV, however, increases with the increase in the inlet voltage, the
   width of the microchannel, and the absolute value of the zeta potential
   of the non-metal microchannel wall. Compared with other types of
   micro-valves, the proposed micro-valve is simple in structure without
   any moving parts. Only a DC power source is needed for its actuation,
   thus it can operate automatically by controlling the applied voltages.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the current study is to probe the potential of receding
   horizon sliding control (RHSC) technique for reducing the coldstart
   hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of automotive spark-ignited (SI) engines. The
   RHSC approach incorporates the potentials of sliding control (SC) and
   nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to employ the future
   information of the considered engine to keep the system's trajectories
   close to a stable manifold. To calculate the control commands, the
   authors adopt an efficient optimization technique, known as the
   multivariate quadratic fit sectioning algorithm (MQFSA), and also,
   define three different objective functions, based on l(1), l(2), and
   l(infinity) norms. To demonstrate the efficacy of RHSC controller, its
   performance is compared with two other well-known controllers extracted
   from the literature, namely NMPC and Pontryagin's minimum principle
   (PMP)-based controllers. Through numerical simulations for three
   distinctive operating conditions, it is demonstrated that the RHSC
   controller is very effective for reducing the total tailpipe HC
   emissions over the coldstart period of the considered engine system.
   Moreover, by conducting a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test using an echo
   state network high-fidelity model, it is indicated that the
   computational speed of calculating control commands is fast enough to
   enable RHSC to be used for real-time implementations in practice.}},

   this work: (i) enables satisfactory control of the molecular weight of
   the copolymer by tracking the profiles of concentrations of
   macroradicals, monomers, and polymer as well as degree of
   polymerization, polydispersity, and chain length distribution; (ii)
   captures the bivariate distribution of chain length and copolymer
   composition; (iii) comprehensively tracks and analyzes detailed
   information on the molecular architecture of the growing chains, thus
   distinguishing between sequence length and polydispersity of chains
   produced in batch and starved-feed semibatch operations; (iv) makes
   possible the screening of products, based on such details as the number
   and weight fractions of products having different comonomer units
   located at various positions along the copolymer chains. The
   aforementioned characteristics are achieved by stochastic calculations

Abstract = {{Road safety is becoming urgent due to a large number of traffic
   accidents each year and its severe socio-economic impact on a global

   a technology that can make driving safer by enabling a variety of
   advanced road safety applications, through broadcasting of safety
   messages by vehicles and roadside units. This article discusses the
   ability of existing wireless technologies to provide reliable broadcast
   of safety messages, which are necessary to realize any road safety
   application. The wireless technologies under consideration are the IEEE
   802.11p standard, the current cellular network standards, and a
   time-division multiple access protocol, known as VeMAC, recently
   proposed for VANET safety applications. The performance of the IEEE
   802.11p standard is compared with that of the VeMAC protocol via
   computer simulations in different highway and city scenarios, including
   a traffic bottleneck situation caused by emergency parking of a vehicle

Abstract = {{Dark-spot detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a
   fundamental step in marine oil-spill detection and monitoring. However,
   achieving robust and accurate detection is difficult due to SAR sensor
   limitations and the complex marine environment. To address this problem,
   the large-scale spatial contextual information in SAR imagery has to be
   utilized to increase the class separability between the dark spot and
   the background. A stochastic fully connected continuous conditional
   random field (SFCCRF) approach to model SAR imagery and perform
   soft-label inference has been designed and built, leading to an
   efficient detection algorithm. Instead of treating all pixels in the
   imagery as being connected, SFCCRF determines the connectivity of two
   pixels in a stochastic manner based on their proximity in both feature
   space and image space. Since SFCCRF provides an efficient and effective
   way for modeling the large-scale spatial correlation effect, the
   resulting soft labels can resist the influence of speckle noise and
   highlight the difference between dark spot and the background. Dark-spot
   detection is achieved by binarizing the soft labels estimated by SFCCRF.
   The proposed algorithm is tested on both simulated and real SAR
   imageries. The results show that SFCCRF can delineate the dark spot with
   low commission and omission error rates.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of soils, such as shear wave velocity and damping,
   are some of critical parameters in the design of civil infrastructures
   subjected to vibrations from earthquakes and machine foundations. Bender
   element (BE) testing is used in the laboratory to determine shear wave
   velocity; however, there is no standard procedure for the interpretation
   of the results. The main limitation in BE testing is the correct
   estimation of the shear wave arrival time leading to uncertainty in the
   values of shear wave velocity. In this paper, three different automatic
   methods for the shear wave arrival time detection were tested. From
   these methods, a new procedure was proposed for the automatic
   determination of the shear wave arrival time using the Akaike
   information criterion. The method is tested on a series of bender
   element measurements giving less than 5 \% error when the results were
   compared with the standard method for a signal-to-noise ratio higher
   than four.}},

Abstract = {{Wind is considered one of the most advantageous alternatives to fossil
   energy because of its low operating cost and extensive availability.
   However, alleged health-related effects of exposure to wind turbine (WT)
   noise have attracted much public attention and various symptoms, such as
   sleep disturbance, have been reported by residents living close to wind
   developments. Prospective cohort study with synchronous measurement of
   noise and sleep physiologic signals was conducted to explore the
   possibility of sleep disturbance in people hosting new industrial WTs in
   Ontario, Canada, using a pre and post-exposure design. Objective and
   subjective sleep data were collected through polysomnography (PSG), the
   gold standard diagnostic test, and sleep diary. Sixteen participants
   were studied before and after WT installation during two consecutive
   nights in their own bedrooms. Both audible and infrasound noises were
   also concurrently measured inside the bedroom of each participant.
   Different noise exposure parameters were calculated (LAeq, LZeq) and
   analyzed in relation to whole-night sleep parameters. Results obtained
   from PSG show that sleep parameters were not significantly changed after
   exposure. However, reported sleep qualities were significantly (P=0.008)
   worsened after exposure. Average noise levels during the exposure period
   were low to moderate and the mean of inside noise levels did not
   significantly change after exposure. The result of this study based on
   advanced sleep recording methodology together with extensive noise
   measurements in an ecologically valid setting cautiously suggests that
   there are no major changes in the sleep of participants who host new
   industrial WTs in their community. Further studies with a larger sample
   size and including comprehensive single-event analyses are warranted.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates selecting paths for communication flows when
   deploying a hard real-time application on a chip-multiprocessor system.
   This chip-multiprocessor system uses a priority-aware real-time
   network-on-chip interconnect between the processors. Given a mapping of
   the computation tasks onto the chip-multiprocessor, the problem we
   address in this work is to discover paths the communication flows take
   such that hard real-time deadlines of flows are met. Furthermore, we
   must ensure that deadlines are met even in the presence of direct and
   indirect interference from other flows sharing network links on the
   path. To achieve this, our algorithm utilizes a stage-level analysis for
   real-time communication to determine the impact of a network link being
   used by a flow, and its effect on other flows sharing the link. The path
   selection algorithm uses heuristics such as selecting links with least
   interference, and considering lower-priority flows when dedicating links
   to paths of higher-priority flows since an optimal one is intractable.
   The algorithm also considers constraints on the number of virtual
   channels at each router port in the network. The statistically
   significant experimental results show an improvement in schedulability
   by 5\% and 12\% over existing path selection algorithms such as Minimum
   Interference Routing and Widest Shortest Path algorithms, respectively.
   We also present a set-top box case study to further illustrate the
   benefits of using the proposed algorithm.}},

Title = {{A Collaborative Energy-Aware Sensor Management System Using Team Theory}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With limited battery supply, power is a scarce commodity in wireless
   sensor networks. Thus, to prolong the lifetime of the network, it is
   imperative that the sensor resources are managed effectively. This task
   is particularly challenging in heterogeneous sensor networks for which
   decisions and compromises regarding sensing strategies are to be made
   under time and resource constraints. In such networks, a sensor has to
   reason about its current state to take actions that are deemed
   appropriate with respect to its mission, its energy reserve, and the
   survivability of the overall network. Sensor Management controls and
   coordinates the use of the sensory suites in a manner that maximizes the
   success rate of the system in achieving its missions. This article
   focuses on formulating and developing an autonomous energy-aware sensor
   management system that strives to achieve network objectives while
   maximizing its lifetime. A team-theoretic formulation based on the
   Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and the Joint Intention theory is
   proposed as a mechanism for effective and energy-aware collaborative
   decision-making. The proposed system models the collective behavior of
   the sensor nodes using the Joint Intention theory to enhance sensors'
   collaboration and success rate. Moreover, the BDI modeling of the sensor
   operation and reasoning allows a sensor node to adapt to the environment
   dynamics, situation-criticality level, and availability of its own
   resources. The simulation scenario selected in this work is the
   surveillance of the Waterloo International Airport. Various experiments
   are conducted to investigate the effect of varying the network size,
   number of threats, threat agility, environment dynamism, as well as
   tracking quality and energy consumption, on the performance of the
   proposed system. The experimental results demonstrate the merits of the
   proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art centralized approach
   adapted from Atia et al. {[}2011] and the localized approach in Hilal
   and Basir {[}2015] in terms of energy consumption, adaptability, and
   network lifetime. The results show that the proposed approach has 12x
   less energy consumption than that of the popular centralized approach.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Two modeling approaches, the scaling-law and CFD (Computational Fluid
   Dynamics) approaches, are presented in this paper. To save on
   experimental cost of the pilot plant, the scaling-law approach as a
   low-computational-cost method was adopted and a small scale column
   operating under ambient temperature and pressure was built. A series of
   laboratory tests and computer simulations were carried out to evaluate
   the hydrodynamic characteristics of a pilot fluidized-bed biomass
   gasifier. In the small scale column solids were fluidized. The pressure
   and other hydrodynamic properties were monitored for the validation of
   the scaling-law application. In addition to the scaling-law modeling
   method, the CFD approach was presented to simulate the gas-particle
   system in the small column. 2D CFD models were developed to simulate the
   hydrodynamic regime. The simulation results were validated with the
   experimental data from the small column. It was proved that the CFD
   model was able to accurately predict the hydrodynamics of the small
   column. The outcomes of this research present both the scaling law with
   the lower computational cost and the CFD modeling as a more robust
   method to suit various needs for the design of fluidized-bed gasifiers.}},

Abstract = {{We study a common-pool resource game where the resource experiences
   failure with a probability that grows with the aggregate investment in
   the resource. To capture decision making under such uncertainty, we
   model each player's risk preference according to the value function from
   prospect theory. We show the existence and uniqueness of a pure Nash
   equilibrium when the players have heterogeneous risk preferences and
   under certain assumptions on the rate of return and failure probability
   of the resource. Greater competition, vis-a-vis the number of players,
   increases the failure probability at the Nash equilibrium; we quantify
   this effect by obtaining bounds on the ratio of the failure probability
   at the Nash equilibrium to the failure probability under investment by a
   single user. We further show that heterogeneity in attitudes towards
   loss aversion leads to higher failure probability of the resource at the
   equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors report on the use of multilayered carbon
   nanotubes and graphene films for the fabrication of temperature
   sensitive resistors. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes- and graphene-based
   films possess moderate temperature coefficients of resistance and
   wideband infrared absorption efficiency. This work demonstrates that by
   incorporating these nanoparticles into a thermally and electrically
   insulating polymer, polystyrene, the temperature sensitivity
   significantly improves. Experimental results show temperature
   coefficients of resistances for these films as high as -0.7\%/K. The
   layers were deposited using a spraying setup without further chemical or
   thermal treatment. The low cost, simple, and versatile deposition
   process, in addition to the high temperature coefficients of resistances
   for these films, makes them suitable alternatives for infrared image
   sensors as well as many other sensing applications. (c) 2016 American

Abstract = {{An integral approach to boundary-layer analysis is employed to
   investigate the effects of the longitudinal-pitch ratio on fluid flow
   and heat transfer from a longitudinal row of circular cylinders immersed
   in an infinite medium. The momentum equation is solved using the
   modified von Karman-Pohlhausen method, which employs a fourth-order
   velocity profile within the hydrodynamic boundary layer. The
   potential-flow velocity is obtained by complex potential theory outside
   the boundary layer. A third-order temperature profile is used in the
   thermal boundary layer to solve the energy integral equation for the
   isothermal boundary condition. Closed-form solution is obtained for the
   heat transfer coefficient for a longitudinal row of circular cylinders
   immersed in an infinite medium. In the second part of this research
   activity, a numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics is
   developed to validate the closed-form solution. The proposed numerical
   model has been successfully implemented for simulating the flowfield
   over a longitudinal row of circular cylinders. Numerical simulations
   have been carried out for various values of the freestream Reynolds
   number and longitudinal-pitch ratio. The results obtained from the
   analytical and numerical models have been found to be in good agreement.
   The maximum percentage error in values of the average Nusselt number
   obtained from the numerical and analytical solutions is less than 9\%
   and reduces further to a value of less than 4\% with an increase in
   values of the freestream Reynolds number.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel framework for monitoring fish sounds based
   on acoustic analysis of noisy big ocean data. The proposed method
   involves multiresolution acoustic features (MRAF) extraction and RPCA
   (robust principal component analysis) based feature selection for
   monitoring of natural fish sounds produced in situ by the plainfin
   midshipman (Porichthys notatus); here, we investigate this fish's
   grunts, growls and groans. Both local and contextual information are
   exploited by MRAF, while sparse components of the MRAF matrix obtained
   through RPCA is found to be more robust to overlapping low-frequency
   spectral contents among different classes. The simulation results
   obtained from real-recorded ocean data reveal the advantages of the
   proposed scheme for monitoring underwater soundscapes and determining a
   variety of fish sounds in natural marine habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The catalytic hydrogenation of sodium oleate in emulsion form was
   carried out using the second-generation Ru Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst in a
   semibatch reactor. A fast and complete hydrogenation of the C=C bond was
   observed after a reaction time of 1 h with 0.4 wt \% catalyst at 120
   degrees C and 8.27 MPa hydrogen gas. H-1 NMR characterization shows that
   the carboxylic group C=O was preserved without any reduction. The
   hydrogenated product sodium stearate was thus obtained. Our results show
   that the Hoveyda-Grubbs second-generation catalyst can maintain its
   activity for the hydrogenation reactions in an organic solvent free
   environment. The hydrogenation reaction presented here provides an
   alternate pathway to manufacture sodium stearate and other saturated
   fatty acid salts in a greater volume by an environmental friendly
   ``green{''} process. In addition, this research will benefit the
   commercial process of catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated elastomers

Abstract = {{With the popularity of intelligent mobile devices, enormous amounts of
   urban information has been generated and demanded by the public. In
   response, ShanghaiGrid (SG) aims to provide abundant information
   services to the public. With a fixed schedule and urbanwide coverage, an
   appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to
   the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send
   messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in
   realizing this service is to provide an efficient routing scheme with
   privacy preservation under a highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In
   this paper, we present the innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this
   problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to
   their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each
   message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a
   fixed routing path with the message to adapt the dynamic of urban
   traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the
   message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and
   outside adversaries. Both rigorous privacy analysis and extensive
   trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the BusCast scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A polar transmitter (TX) is implemented at 60 GHz, enabling a power
   amplifier (PA) to operate in saturation where efficiency is highest,
   even when handling higher order modulations such as QPSK and 16-QAM. The
   phase path is upconverted by I-Q mixers, while the amplitude path
   modulates an RF-DAC. Aimed at 802.11ad applications, the 10 GS/s (i.e.,
   6x-oversampled) polar TX realizes more than 30 dB alias attenuation, and
   the input bandwidth exceeds 3.1 GHz. The PA saturated output power is
   10.8 dBm with 29.8\% drain efficiency at the maximum RF-DAC code.
   Average output power is 8.1 dBm with 22.3\% drain efficiency at -20.7 dB
   EVM for QPSK modulation without RF-DAC predistortion. The corresponding
   16-QAM values are: 7.2 dBm average output power with 19.8\% efficiency
   at -16.5 dB EVM. With predistortion, a QPSK modulated output achieves
   5.3 dBm average power with 15.3\% efficiency at -23.6 dB EVM, while 3.6
   dBm average power with 11.6\% efficiency at -18.1 dB EVM is realized for
   16-QAM. For a sampling rate of 10 GS/s, the TX data rates are 3.33
   Gb/and 6.67 Gb/s for QPSK and 16-QAM, respectively. Implemented in 40 nm
   bulk-CMOS, the core circuit occupies 0.18 mm(2) core of the 2.38 mm(2)
   total die area, and consumes 40.2 mW from a 0.9 V supply.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study opportunistic traffic offloading in a vehicular
   environment, where the cellular traffic of vehicular users (VUs) is
   offloaded through carrier-WiFi networks deployed by the mobile network
   operator (MNO). By jointly considering users' satisfaction, the
   offloading performance, and the MNO's revenue, two WiFi offloading
   mechanisms are proposed: auction game-based offloading (AGO) and
   congestion game-based offloading (CGO). Moreover, we introduce an
   approach to predict WiFi offloading potential and access cost and
   incorporate it in the offloading mechanisms. Specifically, with the AGO
   mechanism, the MNO employs auctions to sell WiFi access opportunities;
   VUs decide whether to bid according to their utilities and are capable
   of using WiFi if the auction is won. With the CGO mechanism, a VU
   calculates utility considering other VUs' strategies and makes
   offloading decisions accordingly. We show that the AGO mechanism can
   maximize social welfare and increase the MNO's revenue, whereas the CGO
   mechanism can achieve a better performance of average VU utility and
   fairness. Additionally, both AGO and CGO mechanisms can improve the
   overall WiFi offloading performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate
   that both AGO and CGO mechanisms can achieve higher average utility of
   VUs and lower average service delay and offload much more cellular
   traffic compared with existing offloading mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a multilayer thin-film giant magnetoimpedance (GMI)
   magnetic sensor is fabricated, and its performance is enhanced by
   post-processing treatment. The CoSiB alloy is developed to enhance the

   for different post-processing magnetothermal conditions. The provided
   recipe will facilitate low-cost fabrication of GMI structures in
   conventional microfabrication facilities. A detailed study is carried
   out to investigate the effect of temperature, time, and external
   magnetic field on the results of the post-processing technique. The
   prepared samples are tested with various magnetics and material
   characterization tools in order to give a detailed understanding of
   these effects. The post-processing shows a significant impact on the
   magnetic properties of the material. It is demonstrated that some
   nanoclusters of cobalt (with a diameter of 2-4 nm) form in its amorphous

Abstract = {{Electric system operators rely on regulation services to match the total
   system supply to the total system load in quasi real-time. The
   regulation contractual framework requires that a regulation unit
   declares its regulation parameters at the beginning of the contract, the
   operator guarantees that the regulation signals will be within the range
   of these parameters, and the regulation unit is rewarded proportionally
   to what it declares and what it supplies. We study how this service can
   be provided by a unit with a non-ideal storage. We consider two broad
   classes of storage technologies characterized by different state of
   charge evolution equations, namely batteries and flywheels. We first
   focus on a single contract, and obtain formulas for the upward and
   downward regulation parameters that a unit with either a battery or a
   flywheel should declare to the operator to maximize its reward. We then
   focus on a multiple contract setting and show how to analytically
   quantify the reward that such a unit could obtain in successive
   contracts. We quantify this reward using bounds and expectation, and
   compare our analytical results with those obtained from a dataset of
   real-world regulation signals. Finally, we provide engineering insights
   by comparing different storage technologies in terms of potential
   rewards for different contract durations and parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of voltage stability margins is a promising direction for

   algorithms for the online computation of voltage collapse sensitivity
   indices. The computations are collectively performed by processors
   embedded at each bus in the smart grid, using synchronized phasor
   measurements and communication of voltage phasors between neighboring
   buses. Our algorithms provably converge to the proper index values as
   would be calculated using centralized information, but do not require
   any central decision maker for coordination. Modifications of the
   algorithms to account for generator reactive power limits are discussed.

Abstract = {{Activity theory (AT) has gained a widespread acceptance in
   human-computer interaction (HCI). However, embodiment has not been
   significantly addressed by this approach. In accounting for embodied
   interaction, this critical and conceptual review presents the
   theoretical approach of the Russian physiologist Nikolai Bernstein.
   Bernstein's approach to activity is very closely connected to existing
   approaches of AT used in HCI. Bernstein provides a sustained set of
   concepts for addressing activity as contextualized and purposeful
   achievement. Further, ecological psychologists have extensively
   developed Bernstein's approach (complementary to J.J. Gibson's), in
   terms of dynamical systems theory. Using a concrete example of an
   adaptive milk bottle for infant use and a hypothetical example of the
   video game Rockband, the concepts of Bernstein's approach and its
   applicability to HCI are presented. Addressing Bernstein's research
   allows for growing the repertoire of AT in HCI, as well as, providing a
   crucial link between ecological psychology, AT and HCI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a two-stage stochastic centralized dispatch scheme
   for AC/DC hybrid smart grids. The developed dispatch scheme coordinates
   the operations of a variety of distributed energy resources (DERs), such
   as distributed generators (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs). It
   also ensures the coordinated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) and
   models the degradation of their batteries that occurs due to
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The energy coordination problem has been
   formulated as a two-stage day-ahead resource scheduling problem, with
   the intermittent supply; the variable demand, which includes EVs; and
   the fluctuating real-time energy price modeled as random variables. The
   first stage produces day-ahead dispatch decisions for the dispatchable
   DG units. For a set of possible scenarios over the next 24 h, the second
   stage determines appropriate corrective decisions with respect to the
   import/export schedule, storage charging/discharging cycles, and EV
   charging/discharging patterns. The objective is to minimize the expected
   total operating cost while satisfying operational and technical
   constraints. The new two-stage stochastic centralized dispatch model has
   been tested on a 38-bus AC/DC hybrid distribution system. The simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme for
   optimally coordinating the various components of future AC/DC hybrid
   smart grids. To demonstrate the necessity for uncertainty modeling, the
   value of the stochastic solution (VSS) and the expected value of perfect
   information (EVPI) have been applied for comparing the stochastic
   solution obtained and the deterministic one.}},

Abstract = {{A promising configuration for future smart grids is an AC/DC hybrid
   topology that enables the integration of AC/DC energy resources and
   modern loads, thus permitting the consequent formation of AC/DC hybrid
   microgrids (HMGs). An understanding of AC/DC HMGs and their operational
   premise during islanding will certainly pave the way toward the
   realization of a future smart grid that includes a plug-and-play
   feature. However, the planning and operation of such isolated and hybrid
   systems are reliant on a powerful and efficient power flow tool. To this
   end, this paper proposes a novel unified, generic, and flexible power
   flow algorithm for isolated AC/DC HMGs. The power flow subproblems
   related to AC and DC subgrids are described mathematically by a set of
   linear and nonlinear equations and are solved simultaneously using a
   Newton trust-region method. The proposed algorithm is generic in the
   sense that it includes consideration of the unique characteristics of
   islanded AC/DC HMGs: a variety of possible topologies, droop
   controllability of the distributed resources (DRs), and bidirectionality
   of the power flow in the interlinking converters (ICs). The new power
   flow formulation is flexible and permits the easy incorporation of any
   changes in DR operating modes and IC control strategies. The developed
   algorithm was tested and applied for analyzing selected operational and
   control aspects of isolated AC/DC HMGs, including inaccurate power
   sharing and interlinking converters characterized by differing control
   strategies. The proposed load flow program can form the basis of and
   provide direction for further studies of isolated AC/DC HMGs.}},

Abstract = {{Pasta products enriched with ingredients to improve their nutritional
   value or functionality have become increasingly popular, and substantial
   research efforts have been directed towards the development of new
   enriched pasta products. In this work, a meta-analysis was conducted to
   quantify the impact of enrichment and process specifications on the
   quality attributes of pasta. A literature search revealed 66studies on
   enriched pasta. Process specifications and quality attributes, namely
   proximate composition, dough, drying, cooking, and mechanical
   properties, color, and sensory attributes, were extracted from the
   studies and compiled in a data set. Analysis of the data set revealed
   significant differences between pasta enriched with high-fiber
   ingredients and pasta enriched with pulse flour. High-fiber ingredients
   generally preserved the quality attributes of pasta more effectively
   than pulse flour. Comparisons based on the drying temperature showed
   that high drying temperatures generally improve the cooking properties
   of enriched pasta. Sensory evaluations indicated that enrichment levels
   below 10\% generally do not affect consumer acceptance, but higher
   enrichment levels significantly decrease it. Pearson correlation
   coefficients showed that the gelatinization temperature and Farinograph
   properties are useful indicators of the mechanical properties and
   sensory attributes of pasta. The meta-analysis revealed the need to
   better understand the impact of the processing history of the enrichment
   ingredient on the quality attributes and the health benefits of enriched
   pasta.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile networks integrate cloud computing to impair the weaknesses of
   the mobile terminals. With mobile cloud storage, mobile users can fully
   enjoy the advantages from both mobile networks and cloud storage.
   However, a major concern of mobile users is how to guarantee the
   integrity of their outsourced data. Taking into account the mobility of
   mobile devices, in this paper, we propose a shared data integrity
   verification protocol with identity privacy preserving, named SDIVIP2,
   for mobile cloud storage. In the construction of SDIVIP2, the dynamic
   group key agreement technique is employed for key sharing among a group
   of mobile users and the proxy re-signature mechanism is utilized to
   update tags efficiently when users in the group change. In this new
   protocol, a third party auditor is able to verify the correctness of
   cloud data without the knowledge of mobile users' identities during the
   data integrity checking process. Performance analysis demonstrates that
   SDIVIP2 outperforms the existing schemes in the sense that it can
   significantly enhance the efficiency of mobile users' joining and
   leaving a group. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Actuation Strategy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Parallel structural systems and assemblies are challenging to erect,
   align and plumb on construction sites due to their complex geometries
   and current heuristic realignment strategies. Examples of parallel
   systems include complicated pipe modules and pipe racks in the
   industrial construction sector. This paper presents a generalized
   approach analogous to robotics and inverse kinematics for building
   parallel systems' realignment planning, introduced using a series
   approach. In addition to the calculation of a realignment strategy,
   feasible applications of such a strategy are also investigated in this
   paper. The framework for realigning parallel systems has two primary
   steps: (1)as-built status identification by capturing the geometric
   state of construction assemblies using three-dimensional (3D) imaging
   theories, and (2)realignment calculation and actuation based on degrees
   of freedom (DOFs) defined during the development of the kinematics
   chains of assemblies. A Quasi-Newton-Raphson (QNR) method is employed
   for solving the kinematics equation of the inverse kinematics analogy.
   Experimental results show that the developed algorithms are sufficiently
   accurate to capture any incurred geometrical discrepancies in parallel
   construction assemblies and proactively calculate and plan for efficient
   realignment strategies. Generalization of realignment calculation for
   parallel systems and realignment actuation are the key contributions of
   this work.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide is a potential dechlorinating agent that can preserve

   trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles

   in a model of natural water was investigated and compared with parallel
   samples quenched by sodium sulfite and ammonium sulfate. Positive errors
   of up to 9g/L for THMs, 19g/L for HAAs, 1g/L for HANs, and 22gCl/L for
   AOX were found after adding ammonium and storing for 9 days at 4 degrees
   C, primarily due to the continued formation of chloroform,

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{303}},
Pages = {{68-74}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the process of
   uncertainty designation (aleatory vs. epistemic) and subsequent
   separation in a two-staged nested Monte Carlo simulation approach may
   lead to misinterpretation of the study results, particularly with
   respect to the confidence (i.e., lower and upper bounds) in the
   estimated probabilities. Using simple examples, a critical distinction
   is made between first- and second-order random variable problems, which
   has a direct bearing on the calculated outcomes. The results show how
   using the nested simulation approach in a first-order problem renders
   the uncertainty in the probability estimate to be conditional on the
   separated variables, and therefore leads to the estimation of
   sensitivity bounds, rather than confidence bounds on the probability.
   The probability itself is essentially a fixed number, and only subject
   to sampling error from the simulation. In contrast, the two-staged
   simulation approach is naturally applicable in the context of
   second-order problems, and allows the impact of both aleatory and
   epistemic uncertainties to be displayed effectively and separately on
   the final results, including the estimation of the true confidence
   bounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A graph-theoretic formulation for the sensitivity analysis of
   multi-domain dynamic systems is presented in this article. In this
   formulation, a linear graph is used to capture the system topology and a
   graph-theoretic formulation is used to generate the system equations and
   the sensitivity equations simultaneously from the linear graph. Symbolic
   generation ensures automated, accurate, and efficient generation of
   sensitivity equations. The proposed method of sensitivity analysis
   avoids differentiation of complicated algebraic expressions, and the
   corresponding equation swells, by using pre-formed (and stored)
   expressions that are combined according to the topology captured by the
   linear graph. To illustrate the application of graph-theoretic
   sensitivity analysis to multi-domain systems, an electric motor-driven
   slider-crank mechanism and an automotive torque converter are considered
   as examples. The generation of the sensitivity equations is
   demonstrated, and the results are validated using a finite difference
   formulation. Also, the efficiencies of the generated equations are
   gauged by measuring the associated computational costs. Finally, some
   features of multi-domain multibody systems that pose unique challenges
   to the theory and software implementation are presented, along with a
   brief description of the symbolic software platform that has been used

Abstract = {{Image quality assessment (IQA) has been intensively studied, especially
   for the full-reference (FR) scenario. However, only the mean-squared
   error (MSE) is widely employed in compression. Why other IQA metrics
   work ineffectively? We first sum up three main limitations including the
   computational time, portability, and working manner. To address these
   problems, we then in this paper propose a new content-weighted MSE
   (CW-MSE) method to assess the quality of compressed images. The design
   principle of our model is to use adaptive Gaussian convolution to
   estimate the influence of image content in a block-based manner, thereby
   to approximate the human visual perception to image quality. Results of
   experiments on six popular subjective image quality databases (including
   LIVE, TID2008, CSIQ, IVC, Toyama and TID2013) confirm the superiority of
   our CW-MSE over state-of-the-art FR IQA approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale models have been developed to simulate the behavior of
   spatially-heterogeneous porous catalytic flow reactors, i.e., multiscale
   reactors whose concentrations are spatially-dependent. While such a
   model provides an adequate representation of the catalytic reactor,
   model-plant mismatch can significantly affect the reactor's performance
   in control and optimization applications. In this work, power series
   expansion (PSE) is applied to efficiently propagate parametric
   uncertainty throughout the spatial domain of a heterogeneous multiscale
   catalytic reactor model. The PSE-based uncertainty analysis is used to
   evaluate and compare the effects of uncertainty in kinetic parameters on
   the chemical species concentrations throughout the length of the
   reactor. These analyses reveal that uncertainty in the kinetic
   parameters and in the catalyst pore radius have a substantial effect on
   the reactor performance. The application of the uncertainty
   quantification methodology is illustrated through a robust optimization
   formulation that aims to maximize productivity in the presence of
   uncertainty in the parameters. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{The impact of a water demand management plan on a water system and its
   users is investigated within a comprehensive cooperative water
   allocation framework. In particular, a demand management plan is
   incorporated into a two-step multi-period fair water allocation model. A
   modified cooperative game is designed for the sharing of additional net
   benefits under the scenario having water demand management. The results
   indicate that cooperation among water users can yield more net benefits,
   and a water demand management plan is able to lead to a further increase
   of the aggregated net benefits by means of water transfers from less
   productive users to more productive ones. By utilizing the modified
   cooperative game, fair sharing of additional net benefits ensures that
   every water user can expect to receive more net benefits and thereby
   water users are motivated by incentives to implement a water demand
   management plan which in turn improves water use efficiency. The results
   demonstrate that the demand management plan can be of great assistance

Abstract = {{Extensive researches have been conducted on using reclaimed asphalt
   pavement (RAP) material in production of recycled hot mix asphalt.
   According to literature, the aged binder is the main obstacle to

   cracking in pavement structure. To overcome this problem, rejuvenating
   agent or rejuvenator is usually used to restore the RAP binder
   properties to a condition that resembles that of fresh asphalt binder.
   Different types of rejuvenators have been used previously. This study
   provides an overview on utilizing RAP, and the use of rejuvenators, type

Title = {{The impact of psychological factors on self-reported sleep disturbance
   among people living in the vicinity of wind turbines}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Canada's wind energy capacity has grown from approximately 137 MW (MW)
   in 2000 to over 9700 MW in 2014, and this progressive development has
   made Canada the fifth-largest market in the world for the installation
   of new wind turbines (WTs). Although wind energy is now one of the
   fastest growing sources of power in Canada and many other countries, the
   growth in both number and size of WTs has raised questions regarding
   potential health impacts on individuals who live close to such turbines.
   This study is the first published research using a prospective cohort
   design, with noise and sleep measurements obtained before and after
   installation of WTs to investigate effect of such turbines on self
   reported sleep disturbances of nearby residents. Subjective assessment
   of sleep disturbance was conducted in Ontario, Canada through standard
   sleep and sleepiness scales, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
   Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISO, and Epworth daytime
   Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Both audible and infra-sound noises were also
   measured inside the bedroom. Descriptive and comparison analyses were
   performed to investigate the effect of WT exposure on sleep data.
   Results of the analysis show that participants reported poorer sleep
   quality if they had a negative attitude to WTs, if they had concerns
   related to property devaluation, and if they could see turbines from
   their properties. This study provides evidence for the role of
   individual differences and psychological factors in reports of sleep
   disturbance by people living in the vicinity of WTs. Crown Copyright (C)

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{2997-3009}},

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard adopts
   a hierarchical coding structure to improve its coding efficiency. This
   allows for the quantization parameter cascading (QPC) scheme that
   assigns quantization parameters (Qps) to different hierarchical layers
   in order to further improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance.
   However, only static QPC schemes have been suggested in HEVC test model,
   which are unable to fully explore the potentials of QPC. In this paper,
   we propose an adaptive QPC scheme for an HEVC hierarchical structure to
   code natural video sequences characterized by diversified textures,
   motions, and encoder configurations. We formulate the adaptive QPC
   scheme as a nonlinear programming problem and solve it in a
   scientifically sound way with a manageable low computational overhead.
   The proposed model addresses a generic Qp assignment problem of video
   coding. Therefore, it also applies to group-of-picture-level,
   frame-level and coding unit-level Qp assignments. Comprehensive
   experiments have demonstrated that the proposed QPC scheme is able to
   adapt quickly to different video contents and coding configurations
   while achieving noticeable RD performance enhancement over all static
   and adaptive QPC schemes under comparison as well as HEVC default
   frame-level rate control. We have also made valuable observations on the
   distributions of adaptive QPC sets in the videos of different types of
   contents, which provide useful insights on how to further improve static
   QPC schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the development of a graphene/silver nanoparticle

   With a mean resistivity of 1.07 x 10(-4) Omega cm, these graphene/Ag NP
   patterns have about 100 times less resistivity compared to graphene
   patterns and three times less resistivity than Ag NP patterns, made with
   the same printing system. With their low degree of resistivity and the
   same flexibility as the graphene printed patterns, resulted from the
   bending test, graphene/Ag aerosol-jet printed patterns may therefore be

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a generalized framework for active
   eavesdropping in a frequency hopping spread spectrum passive radio
   frequency identification system. In our model, there exists an
   adversarial reader who is able to transmit its own continuous wave
   signal outside the frequency band of the legitimate reader. Due to the
   fact that under backscatter modulation, the tag cannot distinguish
   different frequencies and simply sets the impedance in its circuitry to
   either low or high to reflect a bit of 1 or 0, and the adversarial
   reader's received signal is a weighted sum of the response to both its
   own signal and the legitimate reader's signal. Using this model, we
   provide a theoretical analysis of the capability of the adversarial
   reader in terms of the decoding error probability for slow frequency and
   fast frequency hopping systems. We derive analytic formulas and conduct
   experiments using software defined radios that act as the legitimate
   reader, the adversarial reader, and Intel Wireless Identification
   Sensing Platform tags with parameters as specified in EPC Gen2.
   Simulations are also used to validate our findings. We find from the
   theoretical analysis as well the experimental results that the active
   eavesdropper can achieve a better decoding error rate than a
   conventional passive eavesdropper, even in the case that the
   eavesdropper's signal is a low power signal.}},

Title = {{Effect of non-acoustic parameters on heterogeneous sonoporation mediated
   by single-pulse ultrasound and microbubbles}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{107-115}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sonoporation-transient plasma membrane perforation elicited by the
   interaction of ultrasound waves with microbubbles-has shown great
   potential for drug delivery and gene therapy. However, the heterogeneity
   of sonoporation introduces complexities and challenges in the
   realization of controllable and predictable drug delivery. The aim of
   this investigation was to understand how non-acoustic parameters (bubble
   related and bubble-cell interaction parameters) affect sonoporation.
   Using a customized ultrasound-exposure and fluorescence-imaging
   platform, we observed sonoporation dynamics at the single-cell level and
   quantified exogenous molecular uptake levels to characterize the degree
   of sonoporation. Sonovue microbubbles were introduced to passively
   regulate microbubble-to-cell distance and number, and bubble size. 1 MHz
   ultrasound with 10-cycle pulse duration and 0.6 MPa peak negative
   pressure were applied to trigger the inertial collapse of microbubbles.
   Our data revealed the impact of non-acoustic parameters on the
   heterogeneity of sonoporation. (i) The localized collapse of relatively
   small bubbles (diameter, D < 5.5 mu m) led to predictable sonoporation,
   the degree of which depended on the bubble-to-cell distance (d). No
   sonoporation was observed when d/D > 1, whereas reversible sonoporation
   occurred when d/D < 1. (ii) Large bubbles (D > 5.5 mu m) exhibited
   translational movement over large distances, resulting in unpredictable
   sonoporation. Translation towards the cell surface led to variable
   reversible sonoporation or irreversible sonoporation, and translation
   away from the cell caused either no or reversible sonoporation. (iii)
   The number of bubbles correlated positively with the degree of
   sonoporation when D < 5.5 mu m and d/D < 1. Localized collapse of two to
   three bubbles mainly resulted in reversible sonoporation, whereas
   irreversible sonoporation was more likely following the collapse of four
   or more bubbles. These findings offer useful insight into the
   relationship between non-acoustic parameters and the degree of
   sonoporation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution presents a new set of petroleum coke dry gasification
   tests performed on pilot-scale gasifier. Dry gas composition and flow
   rate, temperature distribution, conversion, and pollutant formation
   taken from the experimental tests and respective calculations were used
   to validate the prediction capabilities of a reduced order model (ROM)
   developed for the same gasifier. The ROM predicted the experimental
   observations for conversion in the range of 48-90\%. This study confirms
   that a systematically developed ROM (with a fixed framework) can predict
   the behavior of a gasifier under different operating conditions with
   reasonable accuracy. Moreover, this study investigates the variability
   in the ROM's key outputs in the presence of uncertainty in the feed and
   model parameters, i.e., the volatile percentage of the fuel, solid
   particle diameters, angle of multiphase flow jet, and recirculation
   ratio. These parameters affect the feedstock's properties and the
   mixing/laminar flows within different zones of the gasifier. Insights
   gained from the uncertainty quantification study revealed significant
   variability in the conversion, peak temperature, and steam percentage in
   the syngas; while the dry syngas composition does not seem to be
   significantly affected by the uncertainty of the parameters considered.}},

Abstract = {{The simultaneous capture of imaging data at multiple wavelengths across
   the electromagnetic spectrum is highly challenging, requiring complex
   and costly multispectral image devices. In this study, we investigate
   the feasibility of simultaneous multispectral imaging using conventional
   image sensors with color filter arrays via a novel comprehensive
   framework for numerical demultiplexing of the color image sensor
   measurements. A numerical forward model characterizing the formation of
   sensor measurements from light spectra hitting the sensor is constructed
   based on a comprehensive spectral characterization of the sensor. A
   numerical demultiplexer is then learned via non-linear random forest
   modeling based on the forward model. Given the learned numerical
   demultiplexer, one can then demultiplex simultaneously-acquired
   measurements made by the color image sensor into reflectance intensities
   at discrete selectable wavelengths, resulting in a higher resolution
   reflectance spectrum. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility
   of such a method for the purpose of simultaneous multispectral imaging.}},

   Based on Anomalous Dispersion}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{The traditional microwave resonance sensors are based on the measurement
   of the frequency shift and bandwidth of a resonator's amplitude
   spectrum. Here we propose a novel sensing scheme in which the material
   properties are estimated by determining the changes in the phase
   spectrum of an anomalousphase resonator. In the proposed phase sensing,
   we exploit the unique double phase reversal which takes place on the
   edges of the anomalous dispersion region as a signature to detect the
   resonance. We show that with the phase sensing, a significant reduction
   in detection errors compared to the traditional sensing can be obtained
   because of the noise immunity offered by the phase detection and also
   due to the strong dispersive phase response that reduces the sensor's
   dependence on the external environment. We also show that the bandwidth
   determination procedure of the resonance which is needed to characterize
   the sample losses is significantly simplified. The concept of phase
   sensing is shown by devising an experimental microstrip open stub
   resonator whose frequency response lies in the anomalous dispersion
   region. The dielectric characteristics of the samples placed on the stub
   are extracted from the resonant frequency and the slope of the phase
   response. We also demonstrate that the changes in moisture levels can
   also be detected by utilizing the phase sensing method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cluster-based two-phase coordination scheme for
   cooperative cognitive radio networks is proposed considering both
   spectrum efficiency and network fairness. Specifically, candidate
   secondary users (SUs) are first selected by a partner selection
   algorithm to enter the two-phase cooperation with primary users (PUs).
   In phase I, the selected SUs cooperate with PUs to acquire a fraction of
   time slot as a reward. In phase II, all SUs including the unselected
   ones share the available spectrum resources in local clusters; each of
   which is managed by a cluster head who participated in the cooperation
   in phase I. To improve the total network utility of both PUs and SUs,
   the maximum weighted bipartite matching is adopted in partner selection.
   To further improve the network performance and communication
   reliability, network coding is exploited during the spectrum sharing
   within the cluster. Simulation results demonstrate that, with the
   proposed cluster-based coordination scheme, not only the PUs'
   transmission performance is improved, but also SUs achieve spectrum
   access opportunities. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium arsenide nanowires have shown considerable promise for use in
   applications in which the absorption of light is required. When the
   nanowires are oriented vertically, a considerable amount of light can be
   absorbed, leading to significant heating effects. Thus, it is important
   to understand the threshold power densities that vertical GaAs nanowires
   can support, and how the nanowire morphology is altered under these
   conditions. Here, resonant photo-thermal modification of vertical GaAs
   nanowires was studied using both Raman spectroscopy and electron
   microscopy techniques. Resonant waveguiding, and subsequent absorption
   of the excited optical mode reduces the irradiance vertical GaAs
   nanowires can support relative to horizontal ones, by three orders of
   magnitude before the onset of structural changes occur. A power density
   of only 20Wmm(-2) was sufficient to induce local heating in the
   nanowires, resulting in the formation of arsenic species. Upon further
   increasing the power, a hollow nanowire morphology was realized. These
   findings are pertinent to all optical applications and spectroscopic
   measurements involving vertically oriented GaAs nanowires. Understanding
   the optical absorption limitations, and the effects of exceeding these
   limitations will help improve the development of all III-V nanowire
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) models are capable of
   simulating complex hydrological systems when used at fine resolutions.
   However, properly characterizing bulk GW-SW fluxes for either coarsely
   resolved integrated models or basin-discretized surface water models
   remains a challenge. Loss of subgrid detail, while beneficially
   decreasing computational cost, leads to a decrease in model accuracy as
   scale effects become important. Ideally, coarse low-resolution models
   should be informed by expected subgrid behaviour, reducing the impact of
   scale effects. Determining how to best represent these fine-scale
   details in lower-resolution models is important for improving the
   accuracy and appropriateness of these models. To investigate some of
   these scale effects, we here explore the relationships between
   area-averaged hydraulic head and bulk GW-SW exchange fluxes (e.g.
   evapotranspiration and discharge), all of which are presumed to be
   controlled predominantly by subgrid topographic effects. These
   relationships may be useful for simply upscaling models without the
   complete loss of crucial fine-resolution subgrid details. Using finely
   resolved simulation output from Modflow for a fine-resolution simulation
   and post-processed results generated to represent coarser resolutions,
   upscaled flux relationships (UFRs) are generated for multiple terrains;
   these UFRs define the relationships that exist between average hydraulic
   head and average fluxes in unconfined aquifer systems. It is found that,
   for steady-flow regimes, similar one-to-one power law relationships
   consistently exist between area-averaged hydraulic heads, exchange
   fluxes and saturated area for a variety of terrains. Additionally, when
   the averaged values are properly normalized, the generated steady-state
   UFRs for a single terrain are independent of hydraulic conductivity and
   potential evapotranspiration rates and apparently insensitive to the
   presence of mild heterogeneity. While some hysteresis is apparent in the
   relationships under transient conditions, transient artefacts are shown
   to be minor under some circumstances, indicating that UFRs may be
   applied to both steady-state and transient scenarios. Simpler tests
   performed under saturated and variably saturated conditions in a
   cross-sectional model show similar trends, suggesting that the UFR
   representation is extendable to systems where the vadose zone plays a
   significant role. It is suggested that relatively simple UFRs such as
   these may find use as an alternative to direct point upscaling or
   multi-resolution models for estimating GW-SW exchange fluxes in
   coarse-scale models. They also appear to justify the functional form of
   some classical models of baseflow and evapotranspiration used in
   conceptual surface water models. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework for employing X-ray computed tomography
   (CT) for the assessment of hot mix asphalt (HMA) fatigue damage. The
   analyses were carried out on asphalt beams in order to quantify the
   damage created by four-point bending load. A new algorithm has been
   developed for calculating the thresholding levels of the images acquired
   before and after testing. The thresholding level prior to testing was
   estimated using laboratory air voids. To determine the post-testing
   thresholding level, the proposed algorithm matches 16-bit image
   histograms obtained before and after the test. This process is
   implemented only for the portion of the histogram that represents the
   aggregate colour intensities that remain unchanged during the testing.
   The results and analysis reveal that the developed technique is a valid
   method for successfully quantifying and evaluating HMA fatigue damage in
   large specimens. Because of the high degree of precision they provide,
   16-bit images are recommended for this type of analysis. It was found
   that the distributions of air voids and damage are not uniform in
   asphalt beams and that they vary significantly throughout the length of
   a single beam as well as from beam to beam. This study also confirms the
   effectiveness of X-ray CT for quantifying HMA fatigue damage in asphalt
   beams following crack propagation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Solar energy will make a valuable contribution for power generation in
   the future. However the intermittency of solar energy has become an
   important issue in the utilization of PV system, especially small scale
   distributed solar energy conversion systems. The issue can be addressed
   through the management of production and storage of the energy in the
   form of hydrogen. The hydrogen can be produced by solar photovoltaic
   (PV) powered electrolysis of water. The amount of transferred energy to
   an electrolyzer from a PV module is a function of the distance between
   maximum power points (MPP) of PV module and the electrolyzer operating
   points. The distance can be minimized by optimizing the number of series
   and parallel units of the electrolyzer. However the maximum power points
   are subject to PV module characteristics, solar irradiation and ambient
   temperature. This means the climate condition can substantially
   influence the MPP and therefore the optimal size of the PV-Electrolyzer
   (PV/EL) system. On the other hand, system size can affect the levelized
   cost of hydrogen production as well.
   In this paper, the impact of climate conditions on the optimal size and
   operating conditions of a direct coupled photovoltaic-electrolyzer
   system has been studied. For this purpose, the optimal size of
   electrolyzer for six cities which have different climate condition is
   obtained by considering two solution scenarios, regarding two objectives
   which are annual energy transfer loss and levelized costs of hydrogen
   production and then the optimal results for these cities are compared.
   The results show that the climate condition can strongly affect the size
   of the electrolyzer, the annual hydrogen production and consequently,
   both the levelized costs of hydrogen production and annual energy
   transfer loss. Moreover, it is found out that the solar to hydrogen
   efficiency of the optimal systems regarding these cities are different
   based on the solution scenarios, the characteristics of PV output power
   and the configuration of optimal electrolyzer configuration and
   placement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability indices are increasingly recognized as a powerful tool
   for assessing the performance of chemical process designs considering
   energy, environment, safety and technological improvement aspects and
   above all, economy. Sustainability indicators enable decision makers to
   simplify, quantify and analyze complex information. Generally, it is
   challenging to evaluate the performance of process designs on the basis
   of a large number of indicators. The integration of a set of key
   sustainability indicators in the form of a composite index is essential
   for simplifying the evaluation of sustainability performance. Currently
   available methodologies for sustainability assessment of process designs
   require detailed process data, which are typically unavailable at the
   conceptual design phase. This paper introduces a new composite
   sustainability index (CSI) that addresses the sustainability performance
   of chemical processes and which can be applied for early design phases
   where minimum amount of data are available. The three pillars of
   sustainability are considered in the development of the new composite
   index, which are energy, environmental and safety aspects. A conceptual
   decision model based on the analytical hierarchy process can be employed
   to compare and determine weights for the different sustainability
   indicators, which are then aggregated to obtain the CSI, when the
   indicators conflict. The capability of the proposed model is
   investigated by applying it to a hydrogenation case study to choose the
   more sustainable design among different alternatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanowire-covered surfaces

   domains. Through the use of multiple parameter alignment metrics,
   automated quantitative analysis of SEM images is shown to be possible
   and the alignment characteristics of different samples are able to be
   quantitatively compared using a similarity metric. The results of this

Abstract = {{Radiation shielding in space missions is critical in order to protect
   astronauts, spacecraft and payloads from radiation damage. Low
   atomic-number materials are efficient in shielding particle-radiation,
   but they have relatively weak material properties compared to alloys
   that are widely used in space applications as structural materials.
   However, the issues related to weight and the secondary radiation
   generation make alloys not suitable for space radiation shielding.
   Polymers, on the other hand, can be filled with different filler
   materials for reinforcement of material properties, while at the same
   time provide sufficient radiation shielding function with lower weight
   and less secondary radiation generation. In this study,
   poly(methyl-methacrylate)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (PMMA/MWCNT)
   nanocomposite was fabricated. The role of MWCNTs embedded in PMMA
   matrix, in terms of radiation shielding effectiveness, was
   experimentally evaluated by comparing the proton transmission properties
   and secondary neutron generation of the PMMA/MWCNT nanocomposite with
   pure PMMA and aluminum. The results showed that the addition of MWCNTs
   in PMMA matrix can further reduce the secondary neutron generation of
   the pure polymer, while no obvious change was found in the proton
   transmission property. On the other hand, both the pure PMMA and the
   nanocomposite were 18\%-19\% lighter in weight than aluminum for
   stopping the protons with the same energy and generated up to 5\% fewer
   secondary neutrons. Furthermore, the use of MWCNTs showed enhanced
   thermal stability over the pure polymer, and thus the overall
   reinforcement effects make MWCNT an effective filler material for
   applications in the space industry.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nitrogen and sulfur co-doped mesoporous carbon (N-S-MPC)
   materials are selected as the platform to demonstrate the potential of
   N-S-MPC to replace precious metal catalyst for fuel cell cathode oxygen
   reduction. Using both N-S-MPC and commercial available 40\%Pt/C as
   cathode catalysts, the effects of catalyst and bonding layer in the
   catalyst layer (CL) on the power generation performances are thoroughly
   investigated for alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs). Through single
   cell tests, several observations are reached as follows: (1) For N-S-MPC
   cathode, with increasing N-S-MPC loading from 1.00 to 5.00 mg cm(-2),
   the power density reached the maximum (21.7 mW cm(-2)) when the catalyst
   loading is 3 mg cm(-2). However, for Pt/C cathode the power density
   reached the maximum (21.3 mW cm 2) for a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg
   cm(-2), with increasing loading from 0.3 to 0.5 mg cm(-2); (2)
   Increasing the thickness of catalyst layer resulted in an increase in
   power density. Thus, raising the local hydroxyl ion concentration was in
   favor of the process of oxygen reduction reaction. (3) The bonding layer
   also has a significant influence on the MEA fabrications, where the MEA
   using 30 mu L bonding layer produced a maximum power density of 20.8 mW
   cm(-2). (C) 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The root causes of the differences in electroluminescence stability
   among phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PHOLEDs) utilizing
   different emitter guests are studied. The results show that the host
   material plays a more influential role in limiting device stability in
   comparison to the guest. During the operation of a PHOLED, the host
   undergoes aggregation as a result of interactions between the excitons
   and positive polarons. The rate of this aggregation is found to be the
   limiting factor for device lifetime and is influenced by the choice of
   the guest material and its concentration. Finally, it is shown that
   phase segregation between the host and the guest is an important aspect
   of the aggregation process. As a result of this segregation, energy
   transfer from the host to the guest becomes increasingly less efficient,
   resulting in the observed gradual loss in electroluminescence efficiency
   in the devices over time. The findings explain why PHOLEDs utilizing
   different guest materials but otherwise identical material systems can
   have significantly different lifetimes and provide an answer to a
   long-lasting question in the field.}},

   Engineering the number of layers in phosphorene FETs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Thickness or the number of layers in 2D semiconductors is a key
   parameter to determine the material's electronic properties and the
   overall device performance of 2D material electronics. Here, we discuss
   the engineering practice of optimizing material and device parameters of
   phosphorene field-effect transistors (FETs) by means of self-consistent
   atomistic quantum transport simulations, where the impacts of different
   numbers of phosphorene layers on various device characteristics are
   explored in particular, considering two specific target applications of
   high-performance and low-power devices. Our results suggest that, for
   high-performance applications, monolayer phosphorene should be utilized
   in a conventional FET structure since it can provide the equally large
   on current as other multilayer phosphorenes (I-on > 1 mA/mu m) without
   showing a penalty of relatively lower density of states, along with
   favorableness for steep switching and large immunity to gate-induced
   drain leakage. On the other hand, more comprehensive approach is
   required for low-power applications, where operating voltage, doping
   concentration, and channel length should be carefully engineered along
   with the thickness of phosphorene in tunnel FET (TFET) structure to
   achieve ultra-low leakage current without sacrificing on current
   significantly. Our extensive simulation results revealed that either
   bilayer or trilayer phosphorene can provide the best performance in TFET
   with the maximum I-on/I-off of similar to 2 x 10(11) and the
   subthreshold swing as low as 13 mV/dec. In addition, our comparative
   study of phosphorene-based conventional FET and TFET clearly shows the
   feasibility and the limitation of each device for different target
   applications, providing irreplaceable insights into the design strategy
   of phosphorene FETs that can be also extended to other similar layered
   material electronic devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{A coaxial cable-like stainless steel wire@conducting polymer
   (polyaniline or polypyrrole) with special hierarchical micro-nanoscale
   roughness was successfully synthesized using a facile, inexpensive and
   controlled pulse electro-polymerization method (PPM). Conjugated with
   stearoyl chloride (SC) through an acylation reaction, the obtained
   meshes exhibit both superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties with
   a water contact angle of 154 degrees and an oil contact angle of 0
   degrees, which was successfully applied in separating a series of
   oil/water mixtures with a separation efficiency of over 98\%. The
   separation efficiency also remains high even after 25 reuse cycles
   (99.90\% for a hexane/water mixture). More importantly, owing to their
   self-adaption aging protection and antioxidant properties, the obtained
   meshes retain ultrastable superhydrophobicity and high separation
   efficiency in long-term storage, ultrasonic treatment, and even under
   extreme environment conditions of strong acidic, alkaline, hyperhatine
   and oxidizing solutions. In addition, electrochemical measurements
   indicate that the corrosion dynamic rate of the superhydrophobic mesh is
   1/60 lower than that of bare stainless steel mesh. Therefore, this work
   provides a novel method to fabricate a high quality superhydrophobic and
   superoleophilic mesh for effective oil/water separation.}},

Abstract = {{Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is one of the most important
   characteristics of soft magnetic materials, which practically sets the
   maximum operation speed of these materials. There are two FMR modes in
   exchange coupled ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet sandwich films. The
   acoustic mode has relatively lower frequency and is widely used in
   radio-frequency/microwave devices, while the optical mode is largely
   neglected due to its tiny permeability even though it supports much
   higher frequency. Here, a realistic method is reported to enhance the
   permeability in the optical mode to an applicable level. FeCoB/Ru/FeCoB
   trilayers are carefully engineered with both uniaxial magnetic
   anisotropy and antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling. This
   special magnetic structure exhibits a high optical mode frequency up to
   11.28 GHz and a maximum permeability of 200 at resonance. An abnormally
   low inverse switch field (<200 Oe, less than 1/5 of the single layer) is
   observed which can effectively switch the system from optical mode with
   higher frequency into acoustic mode with lower frequency. The optical
   mode frequency and inverse switch field can be controlled by tailoring
   the interlayer coupling strengths and the uniaxial anisotropy fields,
   respectively. The tunable optical mode resonance thus can increase
   operation frequency while reduce operation field overhead in FMR based
   devices.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Within the context of total deformation plasticity, an axisymmetric
   model is developed for materials with asymmetric yield and hardening
   behaviours. The model employs the variable material properties (VMP)
   method which is an axisymmetric method of analysis widely used for
   problems such as pressure vessels. The original VMP method is applicable
   only to materials with symmetric hardening behaviour. In this study, the
   VMP method is extended to materials with asymmetric yield and hardening
   to examine the importance of considering the asymmetry within
   elastoplastic analyses. The asymmetric and isotropic Cazacu-Barlat yield
   criterion is employed. For residual stress calculations, actual
   unloading stress-strain curves obtained from experiments are directly
   incorporated into the proposed method. The results of the proposed model
   are first compared to the experimental results from a cylindrical
   magnesium specimen loaded under internal pressure and axial push/pull.
   The results are in very good agreement for the load cases where the
   stress state is uniaxial; the results deviate slightly for multi-axial
   stress states. An extensive comparison is made between the proposed
   asymmetric solution results and the results of symmetric solutions. The
   symmetric solutions adopt von Mises yield criterion and a symmetric
   hardening rule, e.g., isotropic and kinematic. The residual stress field
   results demonstrate that, for asymmetric materials, the results obtained
   from a symmetric solution can be significantly different under biaxial
   loading, and consideration of an asymmetric yield criterion along with
   an asymmetric hardening model is necessary. The loading and unloading
   responses of a thick-walled cylinder under internal pressure obtained
   from the proposed model are compared to those obtained from the LS-DYNA,
   MAT124 model. It is shown that the stress distributions are
   substantially different both after loading and unloading reversals. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent requirements for sustainable development and increasing trend for
   public-private partnerships (PPPs) have added additional complexities to
   the policy-making process in the infrastructure management domain. To
   support policy analysis, this paper presents a system dynamics (SD)
   model to analyse the impact of different strategic policies (e.g.
   budgeting, PPP involvement) on infrastructure serviceability, backlog
   accumulation and sustainability. The proposed model has been implemented
   on a network of school buildings from the Toronto District School Board
   asset inventory. Four sets of experiments with different policy
   scenarios over a 50-year strategic planning horizon have been conducted
   to investigate policies related to rehabilitation, budget distribution,
   government investment and PPP involvement. The proposed model was
   implemented on a commercial SD software incorporating all the dynamic
   interactions among the strategic parameters. The experiment results show
   that the model works as a practical decision support tool that enables
   asset managers to test the effectiveness of various strategic policy
   scenarios on long-term infrastructure performance.}},

   simulation and high-pressure diesel spray simulation. For the standard
   KH-RT model, the model constant Cbl for the breakup length has a
   significant effect on the predictability of the model, and a fixed value
   of the constant Cbl cannot provide a satisfactory result for different

   inspecting a set of m-trails traversing through the node. This paper
   investigates the m-trail allocation problem under the NL-UFL scenario by

   analysis is performed using combinatorial group testing (CGT) theory and

Abstract = {{Accurate automated quantitative analysis of living cells based on
   fluorescence microscopy images can be very useful for fast evaluation of
   experimental outcomes and cell culture protocols. In this work, an
   algorithm is developed for fast differentiation of normal and apoptotic
   viable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. For effective segmentation of
   cell images, a stochastic segmentation algorithm is developed by
   combining a generalized polynomial chaos expansion with a level set
   function-based segmentation algorithm. This approach provides a
   probabilistic description of the segmented cellular regions along the
   boundary, from which it is possible to calculate morphological changes
   related to apoptosis, i.e., the curvature and length of a cell's
   boundary. These features are then used as inputs to a support vector
   machine (SVM) classifier that is trained to distinguish between normal
   and apoptotic viable states of CHO cell images. The use of morphological
   features obtained from the stochastic level set segmentation of cell
   images in combination with the trained SVM classifier is more efficient
   in terms of differentiation accuracy as compared with the original
   deterministic level set method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an online intelligent demand coordination of plug-in

   based on the assignment of scores to PEVs through a fuzzy expert system.
   As well, without violation of grid operational constraints, the PEVs are
   optimally charged in order to maximize the owners' satisfaction in terms
   of the energy delivered. The optimization problem of online PEV charging
   is defined as mixed-integer nonlinear programming. Simulation on a
   typical distribution network proves the effectiveness of the proposed
   methodology. Results of the analysis indicate that for more critical
   PEVs, which have shorter parking duration and higher required charging
   time, the proposed solution outperforms in more robust energy delivery
   to the PEV and, accordingly, more satisfaction for the owner.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{With time and usage, systems become less reliable as performance
   measures continuously degrade. In frequency-domain design, a
   sufficiently large number of performance measures are selected at
   discrete frequencies to act as surrogates for the frequency bands. Over
   discretized life-time, the system failure event grows into an ever
   larger number of highly correlated elementary failure events in terms of
   both frequency and time. This paper replaces the complex system failure
   event with an equivalent minimum extreme-value event: it is shown that
   this single event retains all of the original correlation information
   and is invariant to the number of elemental events. The novelty of the
   new and elegant approach is that it standardizes the failure probability
   evaluation via one-dimensional pdfs at either selected times, or
   importantly, selected frequencies. Further, pdfs of the frequencies
   causing failure over life-time are shown to be a useful design tool. The
   pdfs are easily represented by sampling techniques. Error analysis
   identifies three errors and the paper gives strategies to control. Case
   studies of an analogue filter show the proposed methodology has
   engineering applications. The impact of the proposed methodology is
   two-fold: it presents a standard way to assess and manage the
   uncertainty in the degradation process, and it provides a launching
   platform for timely design optimization.}},

Abstract = {{A generalized integrated control strategy for vehicle dynamics using an
   optimal torque vectoring control approach is extended in this paper. The
   central objective of this approach is to generate optimal additional
   tire forces and yaw moment over the vehicle through the application of
   individual wheel torque to keep the vehicle on a target path. This is
   achieved by minimizing the error between the actual and target forces
   and moment at the center of gravity ( CG). In this paper, this
   methodology is extended to a constrained optimal control approach that
   handles additional real-time constraints, which has several vehicle
   control applications. An online optimization strategy is used to solve
   the resulting constrained optimization problem that gives the necessary
   tire force adjustments at the tire level. Some typical applications are
   1) differential braking on all wheels, which is applicable to both
   electric and conventional cars and 2) hybrid torque vectoring on the
   front wheels and differential braking on the rear wheels. Both
   simulations and experimental results show the usefulness of this
   approach of handling constraints with this optimal torque vectoring
   control.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive controller ( NMPC) with a
   multiagent heuristic optimizer, which is called dynamic particle swarm
   optimization ( DPSO), is proposed to reduce the cold-start hydrocarbon (
   HC) emission of an automotive spark-ignited engine. In general, the
   cold-start HC emission reduction has been proven to be a very
   challenging control problem that has attracted increasing attention from
   the automotive research community. The main contribution of this paper
   lies in the implementation of a model-based predictive control scheme
   that uses a discrete nonlinear control-oriented model for calculating
   the control commands. In the first part of the experiments, the
   developed control-oriented model is validated with some data obtained
   through experiments. Then, by applying the controller to different
   cold-starting conditions, the values of exhaust gas temperature Texh and
   engine-out HC emissions are controlled to reduce the cumulative tailpipe
   emissions HC cum. To ascertain the veracity of the proposed control
   scheme, the same problem is solved using Pontryagin's minimum principle.
   The conducted simulations indicate the applicability of DPSO as an
   effective solver at the heart of the NMPC. Moreover, the results of
   modelin-the-loop simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing demonstrate
   the acceptable performance of the proposed control scheme for real-time
   applications, which is based on the NMPC method for the considered
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper expounds a complexity-reduced generalized memory polynomial
   (CR-GMP) model for multi-band power amplifier (PA) digital predistortion
   (DPD). First, PA block diagrams characterizing the behavior of PAs under
   multi-band stimulus are proposed. Second, CR-GMP forward models are
   derived from the feedback block diagrams of the PA, driven with both
   dual-and tri-band signals, leading to a general formulation for PAs
   driven with multi-band signals. The resulting models are used to
   linearize two PAs driven with dual-and tri-band signals. The proposed
   CR-GMP models are compared to a dual-input digital predistortion
   (2D-DPD) model and a triple-input digital predistortion (3D-DPD) model
   and show similar linearization performance while requiring fewer
   coefficients. Due to the presence of cross terms in the dual-band CR-GMP
   formulation, the proposed model is robust against time-delay
   misalignment between dual-band signals, whereas the 2D-DPD is not. With
   a reduced number of coefficients and the presence of cross terms, the
   proposed CR-GMP models represent excellent candidates for the
   linearization of highly nonlinear PAs driven with multi-band signals.}},

   Transform and Active Contour}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel method based on the curvelet transform and active contour method
   to automatically detect the ice edge in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
   imagery is proposed. The method utilizes the location of high curvelet
   coefficients to determine regions in the image likely to contain the ice
   edge. Using an ice edge from passive microwave sea ice concentration for
   initialization, these regions are then joined using the active contour
   method to obtain the final ice edge. The method is evaluated on four
   dual polarization SAR scenes of the Labrador sea. Through comparison of
   the ice edge with that from image analysis charts, it is demonstrated
   that the proposed method can detect the ice edge effectively in SAR
   images. This is particularly relevant when the marginal ice zone is
   diffuse or the ice is thin, and using the definition of ice edge from
   the passive microwave ice concentration would underestimate the ice edge
   location. It is expected that the method may be useful for operations in
   marginal ice zones, such as offshore drilling, where a high resolution
   estimate of the ice edge location is required. It could also be useful
   as a first guess for an ice analyst, or for the assimilation of SAR

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Productivity and project performance can be improved through
   implementing best practices. This paper describes the development of a
   best productivity practices implementation index (BPPII) for
   infrastructure projects. The index is a checklist of practices that are
   considered to have a positive influence on labor productivity at the
   project level for infrastructure projects. These practices have been
   grouped together into a formalized set of categories, sections, and
   elements. Each practice and its planning and implementation levels were
   defined and assigned a relative weight on the basis of its importance in
   affecting labor productivity. The productivity factor (PF), defined as a
   ratio of estimated productivity and actual productivity, was used as a
   metric to collect information about labor productivity to validate the
   accuracy of the BPPII for infrastructure projects. Data were collected
   for infrastructure projects in regards to their planning and
   implementation level of practices in addition to their PF and project
   schedule performance. The statistical tests confirmed that the higher
   implementation of best practices as defined in the index have a strong
   positive relationship with the PF and project schedule performance.
   Projects that have a high level of implementation of practices
   experienced better productivity and schedule performance than those
   having low implementation. This research contributes new insight into
   the relationships between sets of practices and project performance as
   well as a tool for planning practice implementation on infrastructure
   projects. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the stability and performance of
   randomized dynamic routing schemes for jobs based on the
   Join-the-Shortest Queue (JSQ) criterion in a heterogeneous system of
   many parallel servers. In particular, we consider servers that use
   processor sharing but with different server rates, and jobs are routed
   to the server with the smallest occupancy among a finite number of
   randomly sampled servers. We focus on the case of two servers that is
   often referred to as a Power-of-Two scheme. We first show that in the
   heterogeneous setting, uniform sampling of servers can cause a loss in
   the stability region and thus such randomized dynamic schemes need not
   outperform static randomized schemes in terms of mean delay in
   opposition to the homogeneous case of equal server speeds where the
   stability region is maximal and coincides with that of the static
   randomized routing. We explicitly characterize the stationary
   distributions of the server occupancies and show that the tail
   distribution of the server occupancy has a super-exponential behavior as
   in the homogeneous case as the number of servers goes to infinity. To
   overcome the stability issue, we show that it is possible to combine the
   static state-independent scheme with a randomized JSQ scheme that allows
   us to recover the maximal stability region combined with the benefits of
   JSQ, and such a scheme is preferable in terms of average delay. The
   techniques are based on a mean field analysis where we show that the
   stationary distributions coincide with those obtained under asymptotic
   independence of the servers and, moreover, the stationary distributions
   are insensitive to the job-size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a system for hand movement recognition using
   multichannel electromyographic (EMG) signals obtained from the forearm

   multi-class distance based classification of multi-dimensional
   sequences. More specifically, the extraction of multi-channel EMG
   activation trajectories underlying hand movements, and classifying the
   extracted trajectories using a metric based on multi-dimensional dynamic
   time warping are investigated. The developed methods are evaluated using
   the publicly available NINAPro database comprised of 40 different hand
   movements performed by 40 subjects. The average movement error rate
   obtained across the 40 subjects is 0.09 +/- 0.047. The low error rate
   demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed trajectory extraction method

Abstract = {{Nanoantennas are optical wave radiating structures operating based on
   the same physical principles as those underlying their radio-frequency
   counterparts. However, the physical properties of materials in the
   optical range of frequency cause different response to the incident
   electromagnetic field leading to novel applications in optics. The
   conventional methods for the analysis and design of antennas need to be
   modified for these structures. In this paper, an integral equation
   formulation using the complex images Green's function technique is
   employed to model the optical wave interactions with nanoantennas
   embedded in multilayer media. The developed method is combined with the
   simulated annealing algorithm to design and optimize structures composed
   of strongly coupled nanoscale scatterers. It is shown that not only can
   they lead to improved efficiency in optical devices, but also orthogonal
   transmission channels are attainable when they are excited properly. The
   latter provides a new scheme for encoding and multiplexing signals in
   optical information systems.}},

Title = {{Analyzing and automatically labelling the types of user issues that are

Journal = {{EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Mobile app reviews by users contain a wealth of information on the
   issues that users are experiencing. For example, a review might contain
   a feature request, a bug report, and/or a privacy complaint. Developers,
   users and app store owners (e.g. Apple, Blackberry, Google, Microsoft)
   can benefit from a better understanding of these issues - developers can
   better understand users' concerns, app store owners can spot anomalous
   apps, and users can compare similar apps to decide which ones to
   download or purchase. However, user reviews are not labelled, e.g. we do
   not know which types of issues are raised in a review. Hence, one must
   sift through potentially thousands of reviews with slang and
   abbreviations to understand the various types of issues. Moreover, the
   unstructured and informal nature of reviews complicates the automated
   labelling of such reviews. In this paper, we study the multi-labelled
   nature of reviews from 20 mobile apps in the Google Play Store and Apple
   App Store. We find that up to 30 \% of the reviews raise various types
   of issues in a single review (e.g. a review might contain a feature
   request and a bug report). We then propose an approach that can
   automatically assign multiple labels to reviews based on the raised
   issues with a precision of 66 \% and recall of 65 \%. Finally, we apply
   our approach to address three proof-of-concept analytics use case
   scenarios: (i) we compare competing apps to assist developers and users,
   (ii) we provide an overview of 601,221 reviews from 12,000 apps in the
   Google Play Store to assist app store owners and developers and (iii) we
   detect anomalous apps in the Google Play Store to assist app store
   owners and users.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile app stores provide a unique platform for developers to rapidly
   deploy new updates of their apps. We studied the frequency of updates of
   10,713 mobile apps (the top free 400 apps at the start of 2014 in each
   of the 30 categories in the Google Play store). We find that a small
   subset of these apps (98 apps representing (similar to)1 \% of the
   studied apps) are updated at a very frequent rate - more than one update
   per week and 14 \% of the studied apps are updated on a bi-weekly basis
   (or more frequently). We observed that 45 \% of the frequently-updated
   apps do not provide the users with any information about the rationale
   for the new updates and updates exhibit a median growth in size of 6 \%.
   This paper provides information regarding the update strategies employed
   by the top mobile apps. The results of our study show that 1) developers
   should not shy away from updating their apps very frequently, however
   the frequency varies across store categories. 2) Developers do not need
   to be too concerned about detailing the content of new updates. It
   appears that users are not too concerned about such information. 3)
   Users highly rank frequently-updated apps instead of being annoyed about
   the high update frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm (abnormal swelling of blood vessel in the
   brain) will cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, and will result in an
   alarming rate of mortality and morbidity. A joint
   computational-experimental study is conducted to assess the importance
   of the aspect ratio in the dynamics of blood flow. The aspect ratio is
   defined here to be the ratio of the height of the aneurysm to the linear
   dimension of the neck. Idealized models of such aneurysms located near a
   bifurcation point were investigated. Numerical simulations for
   hemodynamic properties like shear stress and flow rate were performed.
   The computational results were verified experimentally with specially
   fabricated phantoms, blood mimicking fluid and Doppler ultrasound
   imaging. Excellent agreements were obtained. Two features are
   highlighted, providing information in the intensely debated link between
   rupture risk and geometric factors. On increasing the aspect ratios,
   firstly, a jet impinging on the distal part of the neck can be observed,
   and secondly, a region of positive shear stress gradient can be found
   there. Furthermore, computational analyses for four patient-specific
   models were conducted to correlate with the results of idealized models
   and to provide further clinical insight.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for the dip coating process has been developed for
   cylindrical geometries with non-Newtonian fluids. This investigation
   explores the effects of the substrate radius and hydrodynamic behavior

   fiber optics and used as a matrix to suspend 1 vol. \% titanium dioxide
   particles. The coating substrate is a 100 mu m diameter fiber optic
   diffuser. Ellis viscosity model is applied as a non-Newtonian viscous
   model for coating thickness prediction, including the influence of
   viscosity in low shear rates that occurs near the surface of the
   withdrawal film. In addition, the results of the Newtonian and power law
   models are compared with the Ellis model outcomes. The rheological
   properties and surface tension of fluids were analyzed and applied in

Title = {{Mode Shape Expansion for Lively Pedestrian Bridges through Kriging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of kriging as a powerful tool for mode
   shape interpolation in flexible pedestrian bridges. Kriging can be used
   to interpolate a set of sparse mode shape coordinates obtained through
   experimental modal identification techniques onto a dense structure
   geometry, leading to better mode shape visualization and efficient model
   updating. Kriging does not require a finite-element (FE) model
   (analytical modes) to be available a priori, as it is purely statistical
   in nature. Despite this key advantage, kriging has not been adopted for
   mode shape interpolation due in part to the relative lack of exposure
   within the modal analysis community and the arbitrariness of the
   parameter defining the spatial correlation between discrete geometry
   points. The first objective of this paper is to describe kriging in
   detail, especially focusing on pedestrian bridges. Second, modifications
   to the computational procedure for kriging are presented with a new
   metric to automatically tune the correlation parameter and a batch
   process to undertake kriging for mode shape interpolation. Details of
   the procedure are discussed through both numerical and experimental
   field data obtained from flexible pedestrian bridges. It is anticipated
   that through the modifications described in this paper, kriging will
   spur greater interest from the pedestrian bridge modal analysis
   community. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to develop an observer-based disturbance
   rejection electric power steering (EPS) controller to provide steering
   assistance and improve the driver's steering feel. For the purpose of
   control design, a control-oriented model of a vehicle with a
   column-assist EPS system is developed and verified against a
   high-fidelity multibody dynamics model of the vehicle. The high-fidelity
   model is used to mimic vehicle dynamics to study controller performance
   in realistic driving conditions. Then, a linear quadratic Gaussian
   approach is used to design an EPS optimal controller, in which a Kalman
   filter estimates the unmeasured steering system's states and external
   disturbance. A new formulation for the linear quadratic regulator
   objective function is proposed to take advantages of the known
   information about the system dynamics to attenuate the disturbance and
   magnify the driver's torque. Finally, the EPS controller is applied to
   the high-fidelity vehicle model in a software-in-the-loop simulation to
   evaluate its robustness and performance under realistic conditions. The
   results show that the proposed controller can effectively reduce the
   disturbance induced in the steering rack, and simultaneously magnify the
   driver's steering torque by use of a bi-linear EPS characteristic curve.
   Then, to show the disturbance rejection properties of this EPS
   controller, its performance is compared with H-2/H and PID control
   designs using time and frequency domain analysis.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the relative motion and point feature model
   configurations leading to solution degeneracy is presented, for the case
   of a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system using multicamera
   clusters with non-overlapping fields-of-view. The SLAM optimization
   system seeks to minimize image space reprojection error and is
   formulated for a cluster containing any number of component cameras,
   observing any number of point features over two keyframes. The
   measurement Jacobian is transformed to expose a reduced-dimension
   representation such that the degeneracy of the system can be determined
   by the rank of a dense submatrix. A set of relative motions sufficient
   for degeneracy are identified for certain cluster configurations,
   independent of target model geometry. Furthermore, it is shown that
   increasing the number of cameras within the cluster and observing
   features across different cameras over the two keyframes reduces the
   size of the degenerate motion sets significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The inner workings of semiconductor electronic and photonic devices,
   such as dopants, free charge carriers, electric potential, and electric
   field, are playing a crucial role in the function and performance of the
   devices. Electrical scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques have been
   developed and deployed to measure, with nanometric spatial resolution
   and high quantitative accuracy, the two-dimensional profiles of dopant,
   potential, electric field, and free carrier distribution, within
   unbiased and/or operating electronic and photonic devices. In this
   review paper, we summarize our latest SPM experimental results,
   including the scanning spreading resistance microscopy and scanning
   capacitance microscopy of terahertz quantum cascade lasers, scanning
   capacitance microscopy of non-volatile memory devices, scanning voltage
   microscopy of terahertz quantum cascade lasers, and scanning voltage
   microscopy of interband cascade lasers. Interpretation of the measured
   quantities are presented and calibrated, demonstrating that important
   internal physical quantities and inner mechanisms of device operation
   can be uncovered. It reveals that the novel SPM techniques would find
   more applications to the emerging semiconductor quantum devices and
   nanoelectronics.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A microscopic gap acceptance model is presented that simulates
   overtaking behavior on two-lane highways. The decision to initiate
   overtaking is expressed as a function of each driver's perception of the
   expected time-to-collision (TTC) with the nearest opposing vehicle at
   the end of maneuver. The available gap is accepted if the driver's
   perception of TTC exceeds a predetermined threshold for safe return
   (critical TTC). The gap acceptance model is calibrated and validated
   based on overtaking video-recording data for a two-lane highway. The
   overtaking gap acceptance model is then compared, for consistency and
   transferability, with independent aggregate field data, as well as with
   two other simulation models and values given in the Highway Capacity
   Manual for similar two-lane highways. The gap acceptance simulation
   demonstrated that the proposed overtaking model is able to provide
   reliable measures of traffic attributes for two-lane highway operation,
   as verified experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Sustaining acceptable service in large facility networks is a complex
   task, particularly under limited budgets, rapid deterioration, and
   increasing service demands. Policy-makers are, therefore, challenged to
   make efficient balance between the construction of new facilities and
   the renewal of existing ones to suit both the short and the long-term
   needs. To support policy-makers, this paper proposes an efficient
   decision support system using the system dynamics simulation technique
   to analyze the impact of various budget allocation policies and to
   optimize policy decisions. The proposed system dynamics model was tested
   using a case study from the Toronto District School Board involving more
   than 400 schools. It can find the optimum budgeting strategy that
   minimizes the overall facility condition index and total life cycle cost
   over a long-term strategic plan. The system dynamics model proved its
   ability to find a budget allocation policy with much better results than
   the typical enrolment-based approach.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates quality of service (QoS) provisioning for
   Internet of Things (IoT) in long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A)
   heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with partial spectrum usage (PSU). In
   HetNets, the IoT users with ubiquitous mobility support or low-rate
   services requirement can connect with macrocells (MCells), while
   femtocells (FCells) with PSU mechanism can be deployed to serve the IoT
   users requiring high-data-rate transmissions within small coverage.
   Despite the great potentials of HetNets in supporting various IoT
   applications, the following challenges exist: 1) how to depict the
   unplanned random behaviors of the IoT-oriented FCells and cope with the
   randomness in user QoS provisioning and 2) how to model the interplay of
   resource allocation (RA) between MCells and FCells under PSU mechanism.
   In this work, the stochastic geometry (SG) theory is first exploited to
   statistically analyze how the unplanned random behaviors of the
   IoT-oriented FCells impact the user performance, considering the user
   QoS requirements and FCell PSU policy. Particularly, to satisfy the QoS
   requirements of different IoT user types, the concept of effective
   bandwidth (EB) is leveraged to provide the users with probabilistic QoS
   guarantee, and a heuristic algorithm named QA-EB algorithm is proposed
   to make the EB determination tractable. Then, the interplay of RA
   between the MCells and FCells is formulated into a two-level Stackelberg
   game, where the two parties try to maximize their own utilities through
   optimizing the macro-controlled interference price and the
   femto-controlled PSU policy. A backward induction method is proposed to
   achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, extensive simulations are
   conducted to corroborate the derived SINR and ergodic throughput
   performance of different user types and demonstrate the Stackelberg
   equilibrium under varying user QoS requirements and spectrum aggregation
   capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Trip planning is a well-cited problem that has been typically addressed,
   to a large extent, as a shortest distance path-finding problem that can
   be extended to reflect temporal objectives and/or constraints. This
   paper takes an alternative perspective to the trip-planning problem in
   the sense of it being a behavioral driven problem, thus allowing for
   multitudes of traveler centric objectives and constraints, as well as
   aspects of the environment, as they pertain to the traveler preferences
   to be incorporated in the process. This paper introduces a Behavior
   Driven Trip Planner (BDTP) to operate as an in-vehicle guidance system.
   The BDTP is designed as a modular system that combines linguistic road
   assessment with traveler-centric decision-making. This paper introduces
   traveler's doctrines, a concept that synthesizes the traveler's specific
   demands. Hard attributes/objectives, such as time windows and trip
   monetary allowances, are enforced in the process of determining the
   final decision about the trip. This paper introduces the underlying
   mathematical formulation for the developed system and explains how the
   formulation works to achieve the optimal performance. Simulation results
   are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the system to capture and
   respond to traveler preferences under a wide range of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir welding (FSW) of dissimilar joints has recently attracted
   great interest for the fabrication of bimetallic and layered composite
   structures. In this paper, dissimilar joining of an aluminum-matrix
   hybrid nanocomposite to commercial pure aluminum is reported for the
   first time. An aluminum hybrid nanocomposite reinforced with Al2O3 (2
   vol\%; 15 nm) and SiC (2 vol\%; 50 nm) nanoparticles was prepared by
   powder metallurgy routes including mechanical milling and hot powder
   consolidation techniques. Different joint designs at various ranges of
   rotational (w) and traverse velocities (v) were evaluated to determine
   process window for the dissimilar solid-state welding. Macro-and
   micro-structural studies showed that sound joints, which were free of
   voids, cracks or un-bonded areas, could be attairied by applying w=1200
   rpm and v=50 mm/min, while locating the nanocomposite at retreating
   side. Optical microscopy revealed that the stir zone consisted of
   micro-scale mechanical inter-locks. Mechanical characterization
   indicated that the mechanical properties of the dissimilar joint were
   superior to that of commercial aluminum but lower that of the hybrid
   nanocomposite by an order of 128-70\% (in terms of tensile strength) and
   135-70\% (hardness). Fractographic analysis showed a ductile fracture
   mode around the interface of aluminum/stir zone and a combined
   ductile-brittle fracture mode for the interface region of the
   nanocomposite/stir zone. The role of nano-scale hard particles on the
   weldability, microstructural development, mechanical strength, and
   fracture behavior was elaborated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This letter addresses the robustness problem when learning a large
   margin classifier in the presence of label noise. In our study, we
   achieve this purpose by proposing robustified large margin support
   vector machines. The robustness of the proposed robust support vector
   classifiers (RSVC), which is interpreted from a weighted viewpoint in
   this work, is due to the use of nonconvex classification losses. Besides
   the robustness, we also show that the proposed RSCV is simultaneously
   smooth, which again benefits from using smooth classification losses.
   The idea of proposing RSVC comes from M-estimation in statistics since
   the proposed robust and smooth classification losses can be taken as
   one-sided cost functions in robust statistics. Its Fisher consistency
   property and generalization ability are also investigated. Besides the
   robustness and smoothness, another nice property of RSVC lies in the
   fact that its solution can be obtained by solving weighted squared hinge
   loss-based support vector machine problems iteratively. We further show
   that in each iteration, it is a quadratic programming problem in its
   dual space and can be solved by using state-of-the-art methods. We thus
   propose an iteratively reweighted type algorithm and provide a
   constructive proof of its convergence to a stationary point.
   Effectiveness of the proposed classifiers is verified on both artificial
   and real data sets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a quantitative radiomics feature model for
   performing prostate cancer detection using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI).
   It incorporates a novel tumor candidate identification algorithm to
   efficiently and thoroughly identify the regions of concern and
   constructs a comprehensive radiomics feature model to detect tumorous
   regions. In contrast to conventional automated classification schemes,
   this radiomics-based feature model aims to ground its decisions in a way
   that can be interpreted and understood by the diagnostician. This is
   done by grouping features into high-level feature categories which are
   already used by radiologists to diagnose prostate cancer: Morphology,
   Asymmetry, Physiology, and Size (MAPS), using biomarkers inspired by the
   PI-RADS guidelines for performing structured reporting on prostate MRI.
   Clinical mpMRI data were collected from 13 men with histology-confirmed
   prostate cancer and labeled by an experienced radiologist. These
   annotated data were used to train classifiers using the proposed
   radiomics-driven feature model in order to evaluate the classification
   performance. The preliminary experimental results indicated that the
   proposed model outperformed each of its constituent feature groups as
   well as a comparable conventional mpMRI feature model. A further
   validation of the proposed algorithm will be conducted using a larger
   dataset as future work.}},

Title = {{The Application of Visual Saliency Models in Objective Image Quality
   Assessment: A Statistical Evaluation}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Advances in image quality assessment have shown the potential added
   value of including visual attention aspects in its objective assessment.
   Numerous models of visual saliency are implemented and integrated in
   different image quality metrics (IQMs), but the gain in reliability of
   the resulting IQMs varies to a large extent. The causes and the trends
   of this variation would be highly beneficial for further improvement of
   IQMs, but are not fully understood. In this paper, an exhaustive
   statistical evaluation is conducted to justify the added value of
   computational saliency in objective image quality assessment, using 20
   state-of-the-art saliency models and 12 best-known IQMs. Quantitative
   results show that the difference in predicting human fixations between
   saliency models is sufficient to yield a significant difference in
   performance gain when adding these saliency models to IQMs. However,
   surprisingly, the extent to which an IQM can profit from adding a
   saliency model does not appear to have direct relevance to how well this
   saliency model can predict human fixations. Our statistical analysis
   provides useful guidance for applying saliency models in IQMs, in terms
   of the effect of saliency model dependence, IQM dependence, and image
   distortion dependence. The testbed and software are made publicly
   available to the research community.}},

Title = {{Further property of ionic liquids: Hildebrand solubility parameter from
   new molecular thermodynamic model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{332-341}},

Abstract = {{A molecular thermodynamic-based approach has been previously employed to
   correlate the surface tension of ionic liquids (ILs). This paper aims to
   calculate further property of ILs, the solubility parameter of 27 ILs
   having imidazolium, pyrrolidinium, pyridinium, phosphonium, piperidinium
   and ammonium cations by the help of that approach along with an ion
   contribution-based equation of state (EOS). The proposed model
   calculates the internal pressure of ILs using a statistical mechanical
   expression and subsequently their solubility parameters through a simple
   relation. In this respect, contributions to internal pressure from the
   hard-sphere repulsion, Lennard-Jones dispersion force, and columbic
   interactions are considered and assumed to be additive in the
   development of the model. The performance of the proposed model is
   checked against the literature solubility parameters of ILs over
   temperature range within 298-358 K. The proposed model has a sound basis
   of statistical-mechanics which incorporates contributions arising from
   the hard-sphere repulsion, Lennard-Jones dispersion forces. Further, the
   electrostatic interaction is taken into account using the mean spherical
   approximation (MSA). The outcomes of our model are also compared with
   those obtained based on the vaporization enthalpies and molar volumes,
   for which their values are available in literature. Generally, the new
   molecular model represents accurately the solubility parameters of
   studied ILs with uncertainty of the order of +/- 2.33\%. The miscibility
   of some non-polar and polar hydrocarbons in ILs is also investigated by
   the use of their solubility parameters and Flory-Huggins interaction
   parameter. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple methodology is developed for the in-situ preparation of
   flexible, three-dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) TiO2 electrodes
   with greatly enhanced mass transfer. The 3DOM electrode is fabricated
   using a polystyrene colloidal crystal templated carbon cloth, and
   provides significant improvements over conventional nanoparticle
   electrodes without the use of binder or other additive. When evaluated
   as an anode in a Li-ion battery, the 3DOM electrode provides outstanding
   high rate performance. The electrode provides a specific capacity of 174
   mA h g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1), which is 2.6 times greater
   than that achieved with a nanoparticle electrode (68 mA h g(-1)). The
   3DOM electrode also achieves excellent cycling stability, with a
   capacity retention of 94.8\% (181 mA h g(-1)) over 1000 cycles at 10 C
   (1.7 A g(-1)) compared to 93.7\% (67 mA h g(-1)) for the nanoparticle
   electrode. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of our 3DOM
   electrode is among the highest of binder-free, flexible TiO2 electrodes.
   We believe that this methodology is highly useful and is easily
   transferable to other materials and applications (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   data collected at different stages of the fermentation and purification
   process were treated employing principal component analysis (PCA).
   Through PCA, it was feasible to identify sources of variability in PRN
   production. Then, partial least square (PLS) was employed to correlate
   the fluorescence spectra obtained from pure PRN samples and the final
   protein content measured by a Kjeldahl test from these samples. In view

   fluorescence and PRN levels, this approach could be further used as a

   diameter of 1 mm on the physical and mechanical properties of
   additive-manufactured porous titanium (Ti) structures, which can be used
   as bone implants. Different orientations and numbers of channels within
   the additive-manufactured structures were used in this study. The
   produced samples were characterized through porosity, shrinkage
   measurements, as well as mechanical compression tests. The results
   demonstrate that the channel orientation in the structure influences the
   shrinkage rate in the parts made with horizontally or vertically
   orientated channels, in which a relatively isotropic shrinkage is
   achieved after sintering. In addition, mechanical ultimate strength of
   the structure can be tailored to the desired properties (such as the
   surrounding bone) via the channel orientation in the structure, where
   the overall porosity is affected by the number of channels existing in
   the structure.}},

Abstract = {{The progression of a cell population where each individual is
   characterized by the value of an internal variable varying with time
   (e.g. size, mass, and protein concentration) is typically modelled by a
   population balance equation, a first-order linear hyperbolic partial
   differential equation. The characteristics described by internal
   variables usually vary monotonically with the passage of time. A
   particular difficulty appears when the characteristic curves exhibit
   different slopes from each other and therefore cross each other at
   certain times. In particular, such a crossing phenomenon occurs during
   T-cell immune response when the concentrations of protein expressions
   depend upon each other and also when some global protein (e.g.
   Interleukin signals) that is shared by all T-cells is involved. At these
   crossing points, the linear advection equation is not possible by using
   the hyperbolic conservation laws in a classical way. Therefore, a new
   transport method is introduced in this article that is able to find the
   population density function for such processes. A multi-scale
   mathematical modelling framework is employed. At the first scale, two
   processes, the activation and reaction terms (assimilated as nucleation
   and growth in particulate processes), are studied as independent
   processes. At the second scale, the dynamic variation in the population
   density of activated T-cells is investigated in the presence of
   activation and reaction terms. The newly-developed transport method is
   shown to work in the case of crossing characteristics and to provide a
   smooth solution at the crossing points in contrast to the classical
   numerical techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Movement primitive segmentation enables long sequences of human movement
   observation data to be segmented into smaller components, termed
   movement primitives, to facilitate movement identification, modeling,
   and learning. It has been applied to exercise monitoring, gesture
   recognition, humanmachine interaction, and robot imitation learning.
   This paper proposes a segmentation framework to categorize and compare
   different segmentation algorithms considering segment definitions, data
   sources, application-specific requirements, algorithm mechanics, and
   validation techniques. The framework is applied to human motion
   segmentation methods by grouping them into online, semionline, and
   offline approaches. Among the online approaches, distance-based methods
   provide the best performance, while stochastic dynamic models work best
   in the semionline and offline settings. However, most algorithms to date
   are tested with small datasets, and algorithm generalization across
   participants and to movement changes remains largely untested.}},

Title = {{Compressibility effects on the structural evolution of transitional
   high-speed planar wakes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{796}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The compressibility effects on the structural evolution of the
   transitional high-speed planar wake are studied. The relative Mach
   number (Mar) of the laminar base flow modifies two fundamental features
   of planar wake transition: (i) the characteristic length scale defined
   by the most unstable linear mode; and (ii) the domain of influence of
   the structures within the staggered two-dimensional vortex array. Linear
   stability results reveal a reduced growth (approximately 30\% reduction
   up to Ma(r) = 2.0) and a quasilinear increase of the wavelength of the
   most unstable, two-dimensional instability mode (approximately 20\%
   longer over the same Mar range) with increasing Ma. The primary
   wavelength defines the length scale imposed on the emerging transitional
   structures; naturally, a longer wavelength results in rollers with a
   greater streamwise separation and hence also larger circulation. A
   reduction of the growth rate and an increase of the principal wavelength
   results in a greater ellipticity of the emerging rollers.
   Compressibility effects also modify the domain of influence of the
   transitional structures through an increased cross-wake and inhibited
   streamwise communication as characteristic paths between rollers are
   deflected due to local Ma gradients. The reduced streamwise domain of
   influence impedes roller pairing and, for a sufficiently large relative
   Ma, pairing is completely suppressed. Thus, we observe an increased
   two-dimensionality with increasing Mach number: directly contrasting the
   increasing three-dimensional effects in high-speed mixing layers.
   Temporally evolving direct numerical simulations conducted at Ma = 0.8
   and 2.0, for Reynolds numbers up to 3000, support the physical insight
   gained from linear stability and vortex dynamics studies.}},

Journal = {{SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The quest for a universal quantum computer has renewed interest in the
   growth of superconducting materials on semiconductor substrates.
   High-quality superconducting thin films will make it possible to improve
   the coherence time of superconducting quantum bits (qubits), i.e., to
   extend the time a qubit can store the amplitude and phase of a quantum
   state. The electrical losses in superconducting qubits highly depend on
   the quality of the metal layers the qubits are made from. Here, we
   report on the epitaxy of single-crystal Al (011) layers on GaAs (001)
   substrates. Layers with 110 nm thickness were deposited by means of
   molecular beam epitaxy at low temperature and monitored by in situ
   reflection high-energy electron diffraction performed simultaneously at
   four azimuths. The single-crystal nature of the layers was confirmed by
   ex situ high-resolution x-ray diffraction. Differential interference
   contrast and atomic force microscopy analysis of the sample's surface
   revealed a featureless surface with root mean square roughness of 0.55
   nm. A detailed in situ study allowed us to gain insight into the
   nucleation mechanisms of Al layers on GaAs, highlighting the importance
   of GaAs surface reconstruction in determining the final Al layer
   crystallographic orientation and quality. A highly uniform and stable
   GaAs (001)-(2 x 4) reconstruction reproducibly led to a pure Al (011)
   phase, while an arsenic-rich GaAs (001)-(4 x 4) reconstruction yielded
   polycrystalline films with an Al (111) dominant orientation. The
   near-atomic smoothness and single-crystal character of Al films on GaAs,
   in combination with the ability to trench GaAs substrates, could set a
   new standard for the fabrication of superconducting qubits.}},

Abstract = {{The application of fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor natural organic
   matter (NOM) reduction as a function of biofiltration performance was
   investigated. This study was conducted at pilot-scale where a
   conventional media filter was compared to six biofilters employing
   varying enhancement strategies. Overall reductions of NOM were
   identified by measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and UV
   absorbance at 254 nm, as well as characterization of organic
   sub-fractions by liquid chromatography -organic carbon detection
   (LC-OCD) and parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrices (FEEM). The biofilter using granular
   activated carbon media, with exhausted absorptive capacity, was found to
   provide the highest removal of all identified PARAFAC components. A
   microbial or processed humic-like component was found to be most
   amenable to biodegradation by biofilters and removal by conventional
   treatment. One refractory humic-like component, detectable only by
   FEEM-PARAFAC, was not well removed by biofiltration or conventional
   treatment. All biofilters removed protein-like material to a high degree
   relative to conventional treatment. The formation potential of two
   halogenated furanones, 3-chloro-4(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (MX)
   and mucochloric acid (MCA), as well as overall treated water
   genotoxicity are also reported. Using the organic characterization
   results possible halogenated furanone and genotoxicity precursors are
   identified. Comparison of FEEM-PARAFAC and LC-OCD results revealed
   polysaccharides as potential MX/MCA precursors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
