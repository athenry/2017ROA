Abstract = {{Few results for state estimation, or observer design, for nonlinear
   distributed parameter systems exist. The most practical approach is to
   approximate the solution to the corresponding partial differential
   equation and use a method for estimation of nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations. A comparison of different popular observation
   techniques - Unscented Kalman filter (UKF), extended kalman filtering
   (EKF), and new nonlinear version of sliding mode observer (SMO) - is
   conducted. The proposed nonlinear SMO combines the efficiency of a
   nonlinear observer with the robustness of the SMO. The estimation of
   linear, a quasi-linear and nonlinear diffusion equations is considered.
   The simulation results show good performance of the UKF and EKF in the
   absence of disturbances. However, the nonlinear SMO performs better when
   disturbances exist.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors to
   estimate the states of linear dynamical systems. Specifically, the goal
   is to choose (at design-time) a subset of sensors (satisfying certain
   budget constraints) from a given set in order to minimize the steady
   state error covariance produced by a Kalman filter. In this paper, we
   show that this sensor selection problem is NP-hard, even under the
   additional assumption that the system is stable. We then provide bounds
   on the worst-case performance of sensor selection algorithms based on
   the system dynamics, and show that certain typical objective functions
   are not submodular or supermodular in general. While this makes it
   difficult to evaluate the performance of greedy algorithms for sensor
   selection, we show via simulations that a certain greedy algorithm
   performs well in practice. We also propose a variant of the greedy
   algorithm which is based on the Lyapunov equation and show that the
   corresponding (relaxed) cost function is modular.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connection allows electricity exchange between
   electric vehicles (EVs) and grid, i.e., EVs are used as temporary
   storage for extra generated power. However, V2G connections suffer from
   certain security threats, such as EV's privacy and authenticating it to
   grid. In this paper, we propose a lightweight secure and
   privacy-preserving V2G connection scheme, in which the power grid
   assures the confidentiality and integrity of exchanged information
   during (dis) charging electricity sessions and overcomes EVs'
   authentication problem. The proposed scheme guarantees the financial
   profits of the grid and prevents EVs from acting maliciously. Meanwhile,
   EVs preserve their private information by generating their own pseudonym
   identities. In addition, the scheme keeps the accountability for the
   electricity-exchange trade. The simulation results show that the
   proposed scheme significantly reduces the total communication and
   computation load for V2G connection especially for EVs.}},

Abstract = {{At present, single network and technology could be impotent when facing:
   1) the rocketing proliferation of mobile devices; and 2) the
   heterogeneity of data services and users' contexts. Therefore,
   offloading some specific traffic to other networks is a natural yet
   effective solution. To this end, this paper engineers the cellular
   offloading oriented vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which
   concentrate on offloading users' bandwidth-hungry traffic in vehicular
   environment. Specifically, a two-phase resource allocation process is
   adopted, where utilization patterns of both wireless and backhaul links
   are studied for the sake of resource exploitation efficiency, with
   considerations on practical issues including link quality variety,
   fairness and caching. The former is formulated as an integer linear
   programming (ILP) problem aiming at system throughput maximization, and
   a heuristic algorithm is developed as solution due to the problem's
   NP-hardness nature. The latter's objective is identified and a simple
   implementation algorithm is designed correspondingly. Extensive
   simulations are conducted and the results show the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Hyper-dense deployment of small cells and reuse of available spectrum
   resources within a wireless cellular network are two promising
   techniques that can enhance network capacity to satisfy the ever
   increasing demand for high volumes of mobile data traffic. With the use
   of these techniques in a network, the network is prone to severe
   co-channel interference (CCI), due to short distances between the
   densely deployed small cells. Therefore, to avoid degradation of the
   network capacity, it is necessary to manage CCI by jointly allocating
   resources of the small cells. Further, the resource allocation scheme
   should minimize the computational burden for low-cost small cell base
   stations (BSs), be able to adapt to time-varying network load
   conditions, and reduce signaling overhead in the small cell backhauls
   with limited capacity. To this end, in this paper we present a resource
   allocation scheme which operates on two time-scales and utilizes cloud
   computing to determine resource allocation decisions. The resource
   allocation decisions are made at the cloud in a slow time-scale, and are
   further optimized at the BSs in a fast time-scale in order to adapt the
   decisions to fast varying wireless channel conditions. Achievable
   network capacity enhancements using the proposed scheme are demonstrated
   through simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting (EH) cognitive relays are an exciting solution to the
   problem of inefficient use of spectrum while achieving green
   communications and spatial diversity. In a spectrum sharing scenario, we
   investigate the performance of a cognitive relay network, where a
   secondary source communicates with its destination over Nakagami-m
   channels via decode-and-forward EH relays while maintaining the outage
   probability of the primary user below a predefined threshold.
   Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for the secondary
   outage probability and show that it is a function of the probability of
   an EH relay having sufficient energy for relaying, which in turn,
   depends on the energy harvesting and consumption rates of the EH relay
   and the primary outage probability threshold. We also show that relaxing
   the primary outage constraint may not always benefit the cognitive EH
   relay network due to the limitations imposed on the relay's transmit
   power by the energy constraint.}},

Abstract = {{In smart grid, to monitor, predict and control the power consumption in
   real time, energy usage data have to be periodically collected through
   publicly accessible communication channels, and are stored in a
   centralized operation center. However, electricity consumption data may
   disclose the privacy information of users. Therefore, protecting privacy
   of users and validity of power usage reports becomes a crucial security
   issue. In this paper, we propose a security-enhanced data aggregation
   scheme for smart grid communications based on homomorphic cryptosystem,
   trapdoor hash functions and homomorphic authenticators. Our scheme can
   achieve data confidentiality and integrity against the malicious
   aggregator (e.g. gateway), meaning that the aggregator is not able to
   access users' private information or corrupt the power consumption
   reports during the aggregation process. Through extensive analysis, we
   demonstrate that our scheme can resist potential threats and be proved
   secure under cryptographic hard assumptions. It has less computational
   and communication overheads than existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Enabling vehicular communications is expected to revolutionize the
   transport infrastructure and support many traffic management
   applications such as platooning. Sharing vehicle information such as
   speed and acceleration wirelessly among platoons plays an effective role
   in platoon control by maintaining a constant inter-vehicle and
   inter-platoon distances. However, the performance of (inter and intra-)
   platoon communications in terms of throughput, transmission delays and
   packet transmission collisions can undermine the effectiveness of
   information sharing on platoon control. In this paper, we present
   probabilistic performance analysis of IEEE 802.11p Distributed
   Coordination Function (DCF) for inter-platoon communications in a
   multiplatooning scenario (i.e, a chain of platoons). The expressions for
   the transmission attempt probability, packet collision probability,
   network throughput and packet delay are derived accordingly. Numerical
   results show that the performance of inter-platoon communications
   depends on the vehicle's role in one platoon and its platoon position
   within the multiplatoon and that the end-to-end delay of platoons can be
   reduced by adjusting the contention window size.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present three network evolution models for generating
   fault-tolerant and energy-efficient largescale peer-to-peer wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) based on complex networks theory. Being
   scale-free is one of the intrinsic features of complex networks-based
   evolution models that generates fault-tolerant topologies. In this work,
   we argue that fault-tolerant topologies are not necessarily energy
   efficient. The three proposed energy-aware evolution models are
   energy-aware common neighbors (ECN), energy-aware large degree promoted
   (ELDP) and energy-aware large degree demoted (ELDD). ECN considers
   neighborhood overlap, whereas ELDP and ELDD consider topological overlap
   for node attachment. The ELDP model promotes the establishment of links
   to nodes with a large degree, whereas the ELDD model demotes this
   strategy. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed models
   outperform a candidate clustering-based model, thereby providing greater
   energy savings and fault-tolerance. Among the proposed models, ECN is
   the winner in-terms of energy efficiency, ELDD performs best in-terms of
   fault-tolerance, and ELDP conveniently provides balance between the two.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the PHY-layer authentication in wireless
   networks, which exploits PHY-layer channel information such as the
   received signal strength indicators to detect spoofing attacks. The
   interactions between a legitimate receiver node and a spoofer are
   formulated as a PHY-authentication game. More specifically, the receiver
   chooses the test threshold in the hypothesis test of the spoofing
   detection to maximize its expected utility based on Bayesian risk to
   detect the spoofer. On the other hand, the spoofing node decides its
   attack strength, i.e., the frequency to send a spoofing packet that
   claims to use another node's MAC address, based on its individual
   utility in the zero-sum game. As it is challenging for most radio nodes
   to obtain the exact channel models in advance in a dynamic radio
   environment, we propose a spoofing detection scheme based on
   reinforcement learning techniques, which achieves the optimal test
   threshold in the spoofing detection via Q-learning and implement it over
   universal software radio peripherals (USRP). Experimental results are
   presented to validate its efficiency in spoofing detection.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting (EH), which explores renewable energy as a
   supplementary power source, is a promising 5G technology to support the
   huge energy demand of heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). However,
   the random arrival of renewable energy brings new challenges to network
   management. Through adjusting the distribution of traffic load in
   spatial domain, traffic shaping helps to balance the cell-level power
   demand and supply, enhancing the utilization of renewable energy. In
   this paper, we investigate the power saving performance of traffic
   shaping in an analytical way. Specifically, an energy-optimal traffic
   shaping scheme (EOTS) is devised for HCNs with EH, whereby the on-off
   state of the off-grid small cell and the amount of offloading traffic
   are adjusted dynamically, based on the statistic information of energy
   arrival and traffic load. Numerical results are given, which show that
   EOTS scheme can significantly reduce the on-grid power consumption for
   the daily traffic and solar energy profiles, compared with the greedy
   method where users are always offloaded to the off-grid small cell with
   priority.}},

Abstract = {{Time-frequency resource conversion (TFRC) is a recently proposed network
   resource allocation strategy. By exploiting user behavior, it withdraws
   spectrum resources strategically from connection(s) not focused on by
   the user, to relieve network congestion effectively. Aiming at
   supporting the exponentially increasing traffic volume, especially
   on-demand data services, in this work we propose TFRC-based scheduling
   techniques. Considering an LTE-type cellular network, we formulate the
   problem of service scheduling as a joint request, channel, and slot
   allocation problem, which is a mixed integer nonlinear programming
   (MINLP) problem. A deflation and sequential fixing based algorithm with
   only polynomial-time complexity is proposed to solve the MINLP problem.
   Simulation results not only demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm in terms of quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning and network
   resource utilization, but also show the effectiveness of the proposed
   TFRC-based scheduling techniques when integrating with the existing
   scheduling strategies such as first in first served (FIFS) and earliest
   deadline first (EDF).}},

Abstract = {{We address outage analysis for a two-user parallel Gaussian interference
   channel consisting of two sub-channels. Each sub-channel is modelled by
   a two-user Gaussian interference channel with quasi-static and flat
   fading. Both users employ single-layer Gaussian codebooks and maintain a
   statistical correlation rho between the signals transmitted over the
   underlying sub-channels. If the receivers treat interference as noise
   (TIN) or cancel interference (CI), the value of rho minimizing the
   outage probability approaches 1 as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   approaches infinity, while rho = 0 is optimum under joint decoding (JD)
   regardless of the value of SNR. Motivated by these observations, we let
   rho = 1 under TIN and CI and rho = 0 under JD and compute the outage
   probability in finite SNR assuming the direct and crossover channel
   coefficients are independent zero-mean complex Gaussian random variables
   with possibly different variances. In the asymptote of large SNR and
   assuming the transmission rate per user is r log snr, we show that the
   outage probability scales as snr(-(1-r)) under both TIN and CI, while it
   vanishes at least as fast as snr(-min\{2-r,4(1-r)\}) log snr under JD.}},

   between the master and slave systems. The source of latency between the
   master and slave systems was studied and formulated. Furthermore,

Abstract = {{A cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) possesses significant advantages
   over common rigid-link mechanisms including: large workspace, low
   inertia, small size actuators, and high speed motion. However. CDPRs
   have considerable restrictions consist of: holding tension in all
   cables, cables axial flexibility, and mechanism low rigidity resulting
   in mechanism undesired vibrations. In majority of previous studies
   related to redundant CDPRs control, the cables' flexibility is assumed
   negligible and redundancy problem is solved regardless of mechanism
   stiffness. Vibration control of a new flexible redundant
   kinematically-constrained CDPR with warehousing applications is studied
   in this research. In proposed methods, for minimization of undesired
   vibrations, the CDPR redundancy problem is solved based on maximizing
   its stiffness. Proposed controllers are designed based on linear methods
   of pole placement and also linear quadratic regulation (LQR) technique.
   Transforming the designed controllers to adaptive ones has shown
   performance improvements in case of moving platform mass and inertia
   uncertainty. Simulations results show robustness and high performance of
   designed controllers beside practicality of the inputs. (C) 2015, IFAC

Abstract = {{Limitation of fossil fuels and the environmental constraints established
   by the Kyoto Protocol and other governmental initiatives caused the
   allocation of distributed generation (DG) to be a vital pillar in power
   system planning. Improper selection of the sizing and siting of DG
   systems can reduce their advantages. Network reconfiguration problem is
   to find a best configuration of distribution systems that gives minimum
   energy loss with satisfying the imposed operating constraints. This
   paper investigates the effect of load model on DG allocation and network
   reconfiguration problems. The proposed algorithm implemented and tested
   on the 25-bus unbalanced distribution system and the impact of load
   models is demonstrated. The constraints involved include voltage limits,
   line current limits, and radial topology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an automated method for segmenting color images
   based on a modified stochastic region merging strategy with multi-scale
   spatial constraints. First, a bilateral decomposition is performed, and
   an over-segmentation process is then performed based multichannel
   information and multi-scale gradients. Next, each sub-region is
   represented using a normalized color histogram in the CIE L{*}a{*}b{*}
   color space, and a region adjacency graph is constructed based on the
   over-segmentation results. Finally, a stochastic region merging strategy
   with spatial constraints is performed on the region adjacency graph to
   construct one segmentation map for each scale of representation. Our
   preliminary visual and quantitative experimental results on the Berkeley
   image database (BSDS500) are encouraging, and suggest that our proposed
   approach can provide accurate segmentation results.}},

Abstract = {{Perceptual similarity between any two independent images is addressed
   with a set mapping perspective by first expanding each image A into a
   set phi(A) of images, and then defining the similarity between any two
   images A and B as the smallest average distortion d per pixel between
   any pair of images, one from phi(A) and the other from phi(B). The
   resulting similarity metric is dubbed the set mapping induced similarity
   distance (SMID) between A and B and denoted by do(A, B). Several
   examples of the set mapping phi are illustrated; each of them gives a
   set phi(A) of images, which may contain images perceptually similar to A
   to certain degree. It is shown that under some mild conditions, do (A,
   B) is indeed a pseudo distance over the set of all images. Analytic
   formulas for and lower bounds to do(A, B) are also developed for some
   set mappings phi. When compared with other similarity metrics such as
   those based on histogram-based methods, SIFT, autocorrelogram, etc., the
   SMID shows better discriminating power on image similarity. Experimental
   results also show that the SMID is well aligned with human perception
   for image similarity.}},

Abstract = {{many attempts have been made to fabricate polymer carbon nanotube
   composites. Previous studies are focused on the methods of improving
   specific performance of the composites, by increasing the dispersion
   quality and stability. There are still no practical methods to
   characterize the dispersion of a nano-material in a polymer. Entropy is
   a concept used as a measure of disorder or chaos originally come from
   thermodynamic. The most popular utilization of entropy concept is
   thermodynamic entropy and information entropy. Furthermore, entropy is
   also widely used in social science, economics, and life science. The
   concept of entropy is used in plastic and polymer research to
   quantitative study the quality of mixture. Carbon nanotube differs from
   the powder materials in conventional industrial, because of the 1-D
   structure and high aspect ratio. As a result, the geometry of the CNTs
   must be counted in to calculate the entropy to quantitatively assess the
   degree of mixing of CNT filled polymer nano-composites. In this article,
   a theoretical description of entropy of mixing is given. A Monte Carlo
   model is created as an initial simulation algorithm to quantitatively
   study the entropy of mixing.}},

   Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) technology is a fundamental
   building block for many applications. The main purpose of a torsional

   electromagnetic MEMS micromirrors have been designed with the composite
   of PDMS and Nd-Fe-B micropowder (MQFP-12-5) and actuated by external
   spiral coils. Considering the requirement of high performance in optical
   switching applications and poor performance at the open loop response,
   proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller is designed to
   improve transient response. The experimental results of angle tracking
   have demonstrated that the 95\% setting time is shortened from 50 to 15
   ms while the 70\% overshoot is improved obviously with high positioning
   performance by using the proposed scheme. The results also confirm that

Abstract = {{A known challenge of designing large public interactive displays is to
   create an interface that attracts a passerby's attention and
   communicates its interactivity. However, typical ``in-the-wild{''} field
   study methods of assessing public display design solutions require
   costly system implementation and deployment, creating challenges for
   assessing early stage design concepts. Such studies also limit the
   amount of experimental control researchers have over the environment,
   limiting the precision of results. To address these issues, we developed
   a complementary laboratory-based study methodology that employs
   experimental deception to assess the ability of an interface design
   solution to attract a passerby's attention. Our methodology enables more
   rigorous control of confounding factors, study of early-stage
   prototypes, and requires minimal setup. We used this methodology to
   assess existing visual design solutions for drawing attention and
   enticing interaction, compare our results to previous studies, and
   reflect on the benefits and limitations of this assessment approach.}},

Abstract = {{The popular Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index has shown to be a good
   perceptual criterion for testing and optimizing video encoders such as
   the MPEG-H/H.265 High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). However, it is
   still unclear how to compare two HEVC encoders with a number of bit
   rates and SSIM values. In this work, we study the video quality
   comparison of HEVC encoders based on the Bit Rate-SSIM (RS) curves. Our
   contributions are three-fold. First, we exploit how to interpolate an
   R-S curve when only a small number of R-S samples are available. We also
   develop to minimize the weighted sum of squared errors during the
   interpolation process, where the weights are pre-defined by users to
   satisfy the diversified requirements. Second, we propose an approach to
   evaluate the perceptual coding gain in terms of the R-S improvement
   between two individual video encoders. Third, as an application, we
   utilize the proposed approach to compare the R-S performances of HEVC
   encoders with different configurations.}},

   rock stiffness, three case scenarios are assessed: seal rocks with high
   stiffness values; flexible seal rocks, and seal rocks with minimal
   stiffness. For each case, a comprehensive analysis is performed on the
   evolution of stresses, strains, and pore pressures throughout the
   transient period of an injection cycle. Numerical results are compared

   presented of potential investments for the aviation industry to reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aviation industry has an interest in
   increased efficiency due to political and public pressure to reduce

   analysis utilizes four criteria (return on investment, carbon dioxide
   (CO2) emissions, minimal disruption, and popularity) to evaluate
   combinations of actions. Possible interdependencies between any two
   actions are also taken into account. This paper ascertains that the use
   of algae biofuels and high bypass engines are the most preferred actions
   based on the synergistic interdependence between these two actions. The
   results of the study are supported by the preferences of the aviation

Abstract = {{Most coding schemes, proposed for the interference channel, take
   advantage of joint decoding to achieve a larger rate region. However,
   joint decoding significantly increases decoding complexity. This paper
   investigates the achievable sum-rate of the two-user Gaussian
   interference channel when successive decoding is employed instead of
   joint decoding. First, this study proves that when interference is
   strong and the powers of the transmitters satisfy certain conditions,
   the sum-capacity can be achieved by successive decoding. The number of
   the required splits, the amount of power allocated to each split, and
   the order of decoding at receivers are explicitly determined. Moreover,
   the maximum sum-rate loss when simultaneous non-unique decoding is
   replaced by successive decoding is characterized. Second, it is proved
   that successive decoding achieves the sum-rate of simultaneous
   non-unique decoding, when interference is weak and the powers of the
   transmitters satisfy certain conditions. Rate-splitting is shown to be
   beneficial, if the powers of the transmitters are greater than a
   threshold. However, when the powers are below the threshold, still
   single-split successive decoding can achieve the sum-capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Delay, guaranteeing causality, is inevitable in cooperative
   communication systems. Traditionally, delay granularity has been limited
   to one symbol; however, channel delay is in fact governed by channel
   memory and can be shorter. For example, the delay requirement in
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), captured in the
   cyclic prefix, is typically much shorter than the OFDM symbol itself.
   This perspective is used to study the two-user Gaussian interference
   channel with full-duplex transmitters. By superimposing the signal from
   the other node on its own signal, each transmitter cancels the
   interference at its receiver. Among other results, it is shown that
   under a mild condition, the maximum multiplexing gain of this channel is
   in fact two, rather than the limit of one, previously proved under the
   traditional constraint of causal delay {[}1]. Further, the optimal power
   allocation among orthogonal sub-carriers, which maximizes the achievable
   sum-rate, is shown to be a generalization of the well-known water
   filling.}},

   conventional stochastic decoders, the proposed algorithm achieves more
   than 20-percent reduction in the decoding latency for the (1056,528)

   adaptive decentralized droop controls that are built upon conventional
   droop controls with extra feedback loops; angle droop controls that
   operate based on drooping the power angle instead of the frequency; and
   a proposed hybrid controller that merges the advantages of both the

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to dispatch taps of Load Tap Changing
   (LTC) transformers, switched capacitors and Plug-in Electric Vehicle
   (PEV) charging in distribution feeders to minimize feeder daily peak
   demand, using a nonparametric Bootstrap technique, an alternative to
   Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), to account for the PEV charging temporal
   uncertainties. From an initial sample of independent observations
   generated using a deterministic Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based
   optimization framework, Bootstrap samples are generated, which yield an
   estimate of the mean daily system peak demand, and the hourly tap,
   capacitor and PEV charging schedules. The proposed technique is applied
   to a distribution feeder model of an actual primary feeder in Ontario,
   considering a significant PEV charging penetration level. The results
   for an actual distribution feeder show the feasibility of the proposed
   approach, with a significant reduction of computational burden with
   respect to an MCS approach while still using a global search technique,
   which yields adequate tap and capacitor daily schedules for a Local
   Distribution Company (LDC) that properly accounts for PEV charging

Abstract = {{Static posturography can be used to assess postural balance, which is
   important for activities of daily living. For older adults, poor
   postural balance can indicate increased fall risk. This study
   investigated eyes open and eyes closed static posturography assessments
   of 100 elderly participants (65 years) in two-feet stance. Twenty-four
   of these people had fallen in the previous six months. Range in
   anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) motion; center of
   pressure (CoP) root mean square distance from mean; AP, ML, and
   resultant CoP velocity; and percent body weight on left and right feet
   were calculated from Wii Balance Board vertical force data. All AP
   measures and resultant CoP velocity were significantly greater with eyes
   closed than eyes open for fallers and non-fallers. ML CoP velocity was
   significantly greater with eyes closed than open for fallers. The
   largest percent increase from eyes open to eyes closed was for AP
   velocity, followed by 2D velocity for both fallers and non-fallers.
   Therefore, AP-based center of pressure-derived posturography measures
   appear to be sensitive to changes in postural control due to elimination
   of visual input. Significant differences were not found between fallers
   and non-fallers.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud storage enables users to remotely store their data and share the
   data through the cloud. Existing integrity auditing schemes for shared
   data are often not identity-preserving and have high auditing cost, and
   hence are still far from practical application. In this work, we propose
   a public auditing scheme for shared data in cloud storage with identity
   privacy preservation. To preserve identity privacy against the auditor,
   we convert signatures computed by different users into signatures
   computed by the challenge user with proxy re-signature. Our scheme
   supports user revocation without re-signing signatures computed by
   revoked users, while the integrity of shared data can still be correctly
   checked. Furthermore, the auditing is efficient in the sense that the
   number of pairing operations during auditing is independent of the
   number of challenged blocks and users. We further present a batch
   auditing supporting multiple auditing delegations from different groups
   instead of only the same group. Security analysis demonstrates that our
   scheme is provably secure. Numeric analysis and simulation results show
   that both computation and communication costs of our scheme are lower
   than in existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and implement a new approach, Document-Assisted Symbolic
   Execution (DASE), to improve automated test generation and bug
   detection. DASE leverages natural language processing techniques and
   heuristics to analyze program documentation to extract input constraints
   automatically. DASE then uses the input constraints to guide symbolic
   execution to focus on inputs that are semantically more important.
   We evaluated DASE on 88 programs from 5 mature real-world software
   suites: COREUTILS, FINDUTILS, GREP, BINUTILS, and ELFTOOLCHAIN. DASE
   detected 12 previously unknown bugs that symbolic execution without
   input constraints failed to detect, 6 of which have already been
   confirmed by the developers. In addition, DASE increases line coverage,
   branch coverage, and call coverage by 14.2-120.3\%, 2.3-167.7\%, and
   16.9-135.2\% respectively, which are 6.0-21.1 percentage points (pp),
   1.6-18.9 pp, and 2.8-20.1 pp increases. The accuracies of input
   constraint extraction are 97.8-100\%.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an achievable decode-forward rate region for the two-way
   multi-relay network. The region is the outcome of a carefully mediated
   attempt, through a so-called ``reverse-order{''}ranking policy, to
   privilege the disadvantaged nodes in the network over the advantaged. We
   use the word ``advantage{''}in reference to the ability of a node to
   recover the decode-forward outer-bound by virtue of its position in the
   network. The proposed rate-region shows promise in recovering most of a
   decode-forward outer-bound which, due to a fundamental deadlock problem
   we identify, is not tight. The rate region itself is derived from (n -
   2) ! individual regions, each corresponding to a unique decode-forward
   scheme, which geometrically fit together into an intelligible whole. The
   underlying theory, offset encoding, appears to be well suited for
   multi-source multi-relay networks with bidirectional information flow.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns and depletion of fossil fuel resources have led
   to increased penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in recent
   times. However, such electrification of the transportation sector is
   expected to impact the distribution grid adversely. These effects will
   require local distribution companies (LDCs) to accurately assess the
   impact of PEV penetration and develop plans, policies and solutions for
   alleviating the consequent network constraints. This paper presents a
   novel framework to assess the appropriate level of PEV penetration that
   distribution systems can accommodate under normal and contingency
   conditions of operation. The model incorporates the impact of different
   factors such as charging level, vehicle types, vehicle users habits,
   feeder thermal limits, and bus voltage limits. The distribution system
   margins from PEV penetration are examined and compared across a wide
   range of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The system of connected vehicles can be considered as a complicated
   cyber-physical system, which will be fully provided with the ability of
   cooperative awareness, adaptive communication and collaborative control
   in future intelligent transportation systems. It is now imminent to
   consider how to construct a set of comprehensive evaluation system so
   that the key technology of connected vehicles can be effectively tested
   and verified. In this contribution a lightweight testbed framework for
   connected vehicles was proposed based on the cyber-physical fusion and
   hardware-in-loop simulation technology. Miniature vehicles were
   developed as the physical prototype equipped with Arduino
   microprocessor, ZigBee radio module and other sensing elements. Some
   typical cooperative scenarios can be evaluated using the miniature
   vehicles under indoor laboratory environments. Through collaborative
   information interaction between physical layer and top layer, the
   synchronized simulation measurement can be realized in a virtual
   scenario of connected vehicles. Owing to the coordination between
   physical nodes and simulated ones, the testbed will be possessed of
   flexibility, scalability and practicability. Some experimental results
   presented in this contribution indicate the proposed testbed is feasible
   and reasonable. This research is beneficial to develop more intelligent
   connected vehicles in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing threat of the environmental impact of vehicle
   emissions, actions need to be taken against them. As a response,
   Electric Vehicles (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are
   introduced to the market with the purpose of mitigating the quantity of
   pollutions emitted by fuel consumption. This paper shows that with the
   increasing adoption of EVs and PHEVs, emissions decrease significantly
   through 2012 - 2050, specifically in three zones which are The
   Metropolitan Area of Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa Ontario. This is
   presented by assuming three different scenarios considering different
   rate of EVs and PHEVs penetration. The number of related EVs and PHEVs
   through each scenario is forecasted. To show the quantity of emissions
   produced in the zones considering the scenarios, the emissions factor
   for Greenhouse Gases pollutants are found. In the next step, the total
   commuting distances of vehicles in each scenario are found and when
   combined with the emissions factors, the total emissions produced in
   each scenario are presented. The main contribution of this paper
   confirms that by adopting modern vehicles in three main zones of
   Ontario, Canada, the total emissions could decrease by almost 40\% to
   50\%, which would be very significant amount.}},

Abstract = {{The automotive industry is constantly looking for alternative solutions
   to reduce manufacturing cost and use renewable materials. Implementing
   agro-fibres as polymer fillers in thermoplastic matrix will satisfy the
   automotive criteria without sacrificing the mechanical properties
   currently set by the conventional fillers such as glass fibre, talc, or
   mica. This paper proposes the use of wheat straw as filler in
   polypropylene for automotive industry and investigates models for
   determining compositions of the materials to correspond to mechanical
   properties. Data collection is performed by varying weight percentages
   of wheat straw and polypropylene to create the biocomposites through an
   extrusion process. The end products are molded into proper shapes for
   mechanical testing. Different modeling approaches that include
   polynomial regression, artificial neural networks and support vector
   machines are investigated to prepare predictive models for the
   biocomposite properties. A comparison between the methods shows that
   support vector machines produced the best model, followed by artificial
   neural networks, and then polynomial regression.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for cleaner and alternative energy is growing rapidly leading
   to interest in methanol production. Methanol is a high value chemical
   that serves as an intermediate for producing common chemicals, use as a
   fuel additive, and as a method of energy storage. This work is about a
   design of a methanol plant with a production capacity of 5000 metric
   tonnes per day (MTPD). The design of the plant is also limited by the
   quality of methanol produced - Grade AA (99.85\% methanol minimum, 0.1\%
   water maximum), and to produce no more than 0.54 tonne CO2 emissions per
   tonne methanol produced. The heart of the design is to model the low
   pressure methanol technologies and to identify the advantages of
   different reactor types. In terms of economics, the growth in the demand
   for methanol has been seen to have a steady increase over the past few
   years. Based on the initial estimates for the plant costs, the capital
   required to build the plant is between 1-1.1 billion USD. Current market
   prices for a 5000 MTD plant would make a yearly gross income of
   approximately 50-100 million.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen is an important storage medium and can be produced by the water
   electrolysis. In this research, energy transfer loss between a
   photovoltaic (PV) unit and electrolyzer is minimized by optimizing the
   size and operating condition of an electrolyzer directly connected to a
   PV module. In directly coupled photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV/EL)
   systems, there is a mismatch between output PV's maximum power point
   characteristic and input PEM electrolyzer's characteristic. With proper
   sizing optimization methods, it is possible to directly couple
   photovoltaic-electrolyzer systems. The evolutionary optimization
   algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization
   (PSO) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) are ideal for handling
   this kind of problems due to nonlinear behavior of the system during a
   year. However, each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages.
   In this paper a PV/EL system is simulated and then comparisons among the
   three evolutionary algorithms are presented for optimization of the
   system; in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of
   the results. Based on the comparative analysis, the performance of the
   algorithms differs in various aspects which make them more or less best
   suited for such a kind of problem.}},

Abstract = {{This research involves the technical design, economic, and environmental
   analysis of using anaerobic digestion to supply the heating fuel needs
   of a 2000 home community. To understand the technical challenges
   involved in biogas production for a community, a technical model (AMD1)
   was utilized as the basis of modeling development centered on methane
   production and feed material inhibition. Through analysis, it was
   determined that a key component of selecting whether to run year-round
   vs. partial season was in the heat loss versus increased heat
   generation. From both a capital and operating cost point of view, the
   net gas production in shortened seasons could not account for the
   increased production intensity needed to meet the overall goal. Beyond
   the findings regarding operational efficiency, the fixed cost of the
   project was identified as under \$2100 per home of initial investment
   and a gas production cost of \$0.35/m(3) of gas versus the market rate
   of \$0.33/m(3) of non-renewable sourced gas. Beyond the carbon neutral
   nature of the biogas produced, the decentralized production system of
   anaerobic digestion also allows for a 23\% decrease in net CO2 emissions
   compared to conventional natural gas systems, yielding a greater
   environmental benefit.}},

Abstract = {{One of the effects of climate change is the drop in the extreme

   the addition of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP), poses a challenge to
   enduring extremely low temperatures. This study examines the performance
   of typical Ontario Superpave surface course HMA to thermal cracking.
   Thermal Stress Restrained Specimen Tests (TSRST) and Disk-Shaped Compact
   Tension Tests (DC(T)) were conducted on six laboratory prepared hot
   mixtures with varying RAP contents and Asphalt Binder Performance Grade
   (PG). The results suggest that the Recycled Hot Mixtures (RHM) do not
   always withstand the expected critical temperatures, but they could
   exhibit a lower impact in fracture strength when the extreme low

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel m-trail allocation method for achieving
   local unambiguous failure localization (L-UFL) in all-optical mesh
   networks under the monitoring burst (m-burst) framework, in which a
   single monitoring node (MN) can localize any multi-link failure with up
   to d links in a (d + 1) - connected network by inspecting the optical
   bursts traversing through the MN where each m-trails is originated from
   the MN. The proposed m-trail allocation method is based on the theory
   that when each undirected link is traversed by a unique set of m-trails
   and the m-trail set is not a subset of the m-trails traversing any
   shared risk link group (SRLG) having d links whenever the SRLG is
   disjoint from the link, each SRLG having 1 to d links will be traversed
   by a unique set of m-trails. We prove the theorem for m-trail
   allocation, formulate an integer linear program (ILP) based on the
   theorem, and implement the method for up to 3-link failures. Numerical
   results show that the proposed method outperform the previous arts that
   do not use post-processing to reduce the m-trails in the solution.}},

   predict the performance parameters of the application under the new

   In this paper, we concentrate on model-driven development and provide a
   methodology to estimate the execution-time performance of application
   models under different toolchains. Our approach has low cost compared to
   the migration effort of an entire application. As part of the approach,
   we provide methods for characterizing model-driven applications, an
   algorithm for generating application-specific microbenchmarks, and
   results on using different methods for estimating the performance. In
   the work, we focus on SCADE as the development toolchain and use a

Abstract = {{Pattern-based debugging compares the engineer's model to a pre-computed
   library of patterns, and generates discriminating examples that help the
   engineer decide if the model's constraints need to be strengthened or
   weakened. A number of tactics are used to help connect the generated
   examples to the text of the model. This technique augments existing
   example/counter-example generators and unsatisfiable core analysis
   tools, to help the engineer better localize and understand defects
   caused by complete overconstraint, partial overconstraint, and
   underconstraint. The technique is applied to localizing, understanding,
   and fixing a defect in an Alloy model of Dijkstra's Dining Philosopher's
   problem. Automating the search procedure remains as essential future
   work.}},

Abstract = {{The current computer-aided melanoma diagnostic technique employs the
   features that extracted from the surface level of skin, and any
   under-skin information is ignored. Since the colour formation of lesion
   is vastly influenced by the concentration of melanin, the quantitative
   features of spatial heterogeneity of melanin concentration was proposed.
   To quantify the spatial heterogeneity of eumelanin and pheomelanin
   concentrations, the concentration maps were divided into two and the
   Earth mover's distance between the concentration clusters on both sides
   was measured. The proposed features were evaluated on 206 dermatological
   images (119 melanoma cases, 87 benign cases) using a cross-validation
   scheme. The results show that adopting spatial heterogeneity of melanin
   concentrations improved the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of
   diagnosing melanoma.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion imaging has become a powerful diagnostic imaging tool for the
   detection of prostate cancer. Recently, a new form of diffusion imaging
   called correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) was introduced, where the
   tissue being imaged is characterized by the joint correlation of
   diffusion signal attenuation across multiple gradient pulse strengths
   and timings. While CDI has been shown to provide a strong signal
   delineation between cancerous tissue and healthy tissue within the
   prostate gland, it does not capture anatomical information. As such,
   additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities are required to
   be studied by the radiologists at the same time as CDI to provide
   anatomical context for accurate cancer localization within the prostate
   gland. In this study, we address this issue by introducing a new form of
   CDI called dual-stage correlated diffusion imaging (D-CDI), where an
   additional signal mixing stage is performed between the correlated
   diffusion signal from the first signal mixing stage and an auxiliary
   diffusion signal to incorporate anatomical context. Quantitative
   evaluation using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures, and
   visual assessment by an expert radiologist for datasets of 13 patient
   cases with confirmed prostate cancer suggest that D-CDI not only
   provides strong delineation between healthy and cancerous tissues, it
   allows for accurate cancer localization in the prostate gland without
   the need for additional MRI modalities to be studied.}},

Abstract = {{Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States,
   regardless of gender. Lung cancer staging is a critical process for
   diagnosis and prognosis that is commonly done through the analysis of
   computed tomography of the chest. Analysis can be done by extracting
   quantitative metrics from clinician defined contours; however, defining
   contours manually can be a time consuming process which, in an
   environment where fast staging is necessary, is undesirable.
   Semi-automatic methods are desirable for minimizing user input while
   achieving similar contouring results. However, they can be hampered by
   image noise and complex shapes. In this paper, we present a
   single-click, semi-automatic contouring method for lung nodules that
   formulates the problem as a texture-based hierarchical conditional
   random field, making it robust to noise and capable of contouring
   complex shapes. Comparing against other semi-automatic contouring
   methods using clinician contours as ground truth, the proposed method
   achieves higher results in the sensitivity, Dice, and Jaccard metrics
   while achieving comparable results with the specificity and accuracy
   metrics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents stochastic energy management system (S-EMS) in
   hybrid ac/dc smart grids. The developed S-EMS coordinates the operations
   of various distributed resources (DRs), i.e., distributed generators
   (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs). It also ensures coordinated
   charging of the plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The energy management
   problem is formulated as a two-stage day-ahead resource scheduling
   problem with both the intermittent supply and the variable PEV demand
   modeled as random variables. The first-stage determines the unit
   commitment (UC) decisions for the next 24 hours, while the second-stage
   determines the corrective decisions, which include the import/export
   schedule, the storage charging/discharging cycles, and the PEV charging
   patterns for a set of possible scenarios. The objective is to minimize
   the expected total operating cost while satisfying the operational and
   technical constraints. The developed centralized two-stage stochastic
   EMS model is tested on a 38-bus hybrid ac/dc distribution system. The
   simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed EMS
   model to optimally coordinate the various components of the future
   hybrid ac/dc smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) present a promising solution to mitigate
   greenhouse gas emissions but on the other hand, their increased
   penetration can impact power system operation, particularly so in an
   isolated microgrid. Similarly, demand response (DR) has the potential to
   provide significant flexibility in the operation of an isolated
   microgrid, with limited generation capacity, by altering the demand and
   introducing an elasticity effect. This paper examines uncontrolled and
   controlled PEV charging strategies, in the presence of DR and battery
   energy storage systems (BESS), using an optimal energy management model
   for isolated microgrids. The model develops energy management strategies
   considering power flow constraints and different objective functions
   from the perspective of the microgrid operator and the owners of PEVs.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution systems have been gradually improved with new technologies.
   They have been upgraded from the traditional system with low-level
   control to a smart-grid system with high-level control. In the present
   work, a mathematical model of an unbalanced three-phase distribution
   system, including ZIP loads and other components of distribution systems
   is used, and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) -based Distribution Optimal Power
   Flow (DOPF) model is applied to find the optimal integer solutions for
   discrete system control elements such as Load Tap Changers (LTCs) and
   Switched Capacitors (SCs) in a practical feeder. In order to reduce the
   computational burden and consequently the run-time, a communication
   Middleware System for smart grids is used to solve the GA-based DOPF
   problem on a decentralized computer system using a parallel computing
   approach. This system is responsible for running the model, managing all
   communication between the nodes, and transferring the results between
   various parts of the parallel system. Comparing with heuristic methods
   with faster sub-optimal solutions in a centralized computer system, the
   present work is expected to yield better optimal solution within
   acceptable practical runtimes.}},

   adversarial models: 1) untrusted relay attack model; 2) trusted relay
   with eavesdropper attack model. Finally, we conduct three simulations of
   our proposed scheme. The simulation results agree with the theoretical

Abstract = {{The main quest for cloud stakeholders is to find an optimal deployment
   architecture for cloud applications that maximizes availability,
   minimizes cost, and addresses portability and scalability.
   Unfortunately, the lack of a unified definition and adequate modeling
   language and methodologies that address the cloud domain specific
   characteristics makes architecting efficient cloud applications a
   daunting task. This paper introduces StratusML: a technology agnostic
   integrated modeling framework for cloud applications. StratusML provides
   an intuitive user interface that allows the cloud stakeholders (i.e.,
   providers, developers, administrators, and financial decision makers) to
   define their application services, configure them, specify the
   applications' behaviour at runtime through a set of adaptation rules,
   and estimate cost under diverse cloud platforms and configurations.
   Moreover, through a set of model transformation templates, StratusML
   maintains consistency between the various artifacts of cloud
   applications. This paper presents StratusML and illustrates its
   usefulness and practical applicability from different stakeholder
   perspectives. A demo video, usage scenario and other relevant
   information can be found at the StratusML webpage {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{The smart grid allows its consumers to participate in producing cost
   effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly electricity. The
   consumers in a smart grid, for example, can plug their Electric Vehicles
   (EVs) into the grid to charge and discharge their vehicles' batteries.
   However, charging of the electric vehicles, especially during the peak
   periods, can adversely impact the grid performance. Thus, in this paper,
   the coordinated charging of the electric vehicles problem is tackled. A
   fuzzy logic-based approach is developed to coordinate the electric
   vehicle charging such that the system minimum voltage is within the
   allowable limits. The inputs to the Fuzzy Charging Controller (FCC)
   include the States of Charge (SOC) of the electric vehicles, the grid
   parameters represented in the system minimum voltage, and the hourly
   energy price. The output of the FCC is the charging levels of the
   electric vehicles' batteries. The developed fuzzy logic-based charging
   strategy was validated on the 69-bus test system. The Fuzzy Charging
   (FC) was compared with three modes of uncoordinated charging, namely
   Slow Charging (SC), Medium Charging (MC), and Fast Charging (FC). The
   results of the comparative study prove the superiority of the developed
   fuzzy charging approach over uncoordinated charging schemes.}},

   literature. The modeling accuracy for most of them is directly related
   to their complexity and computational effort. Recently, two newly
   developed PV models featuring low computational effort and high accuracy
   appeared in the literature. The first model is developed based on
   Gompertz model which is originally used to model human mortality, and
   the second relies on a polynomial function which represents the voltage
   drop in the model series resistance. Because both models have similar
   features, their pros and cons are not clear and thus it is challenging
   for users to decide which model is more suitable for a particular PV
   application. This paper constructs a comparison between the two models
   showing their pros and cons. The results of the paper would be
   beneficial for PV system designers and researchers to select the

   networks present a unique degree distribution pattern, where the
   majority of the proteins are sparsely connected, while densely-connected

   model to depict protein-protein interaction networks, where the gene
   duplication process is modeled as random vertex duplication. And we show
   that it is the gene duplication process combined with the
   sparsely-connected initial condition that leads to the unique degree
   distribution pattern of protein-protein interaction networks. In
   addition, we make a further prediction based on our degree distribution
   function: as the gene duplication process proceeds, the percentage of
   densely-connected proteins becomes higher.}},

   approach is a novel communication protocol that enables
   self-organization of agents in post-fault state. The approach maximizes
   the amount of restored power while preserving the radial structure of

   design is made of 4 cascaded bit units where every bit has two different
   paths, the first path is a conventional CPW while the second path is a
   CPW loaded with an inter-digitated capacitor. The measured maximum
   capacitance when all loaded CPW are engaged in almost 20 pF. The minimum
   measured capacitance however is 0.7 pF, at 1 GHz. The measured tuning

Abstract = {{Harnessing structural elements with strings, power cables, and signal
   cables increases the complexity in modelling the dynamic behaviour of
   such structures. Developing models capable of accurately predicting the
   dynamic behaviour of these systems is of great importance for space
   structures that cannot be tested prior to launch. The focus of this work
   is obtaining an equivalent continuum model for string-harnessed
   beam-like structures with periodic wrapping patterns. The tension in the
   string is assumed to vary as the beam deflects. The displacement field
   with second order terms is determined and from which the Green-Lagrange
   strain tensor is obtained. After finding kinetic and potential energy
   expressions Hamilton's principle is used to obtain the partial
   dlfferential equation and boundary conditions., Numerical results for
   the shift in the natural frequencies are presented for various string
   properties to investigate their effects on the structure.}},

Abstract = {{The water distribution system hydraulic model for an Ontario, Canada
   town has been calibrated by engineers familiar with the system. Their
   calibration procedure was mainly an expert-based approach using judgment
   and trial-and-error and did not rely on optimization. The purpose of
   this study is to resolve the corresponding calibration problem with
   optimization tools and compare the calibration solutions in terms of
   quality (closeness to measured data) and calibration parameter values.
   The calibration problem is posed as a multi-objective optimization
   problem and solved with the PA-DDS algorithm described in {[}1]. The
   precise calibration objectives are roughly matched to the manual
   calibration objectives specified by the engineers who calibrated the
   model. Multi-objective optimization results are compared with the
   current solution to determine if the current solution is non-dominated.

Abstract = {{Software as a Service (SaaS) has become an important application
   development and service delivery model. Among different architectures,
   multi-tenant architecture (MTA) not only has advantage on maintenance,
   but also increases resource utilization by sharing instances. However,
   sharing instances brings challenges to the security of the service. As
   one of the three principal properties of the security, availability
   receives more and more attentions. Recently, there are extensive efforts
   on technical methods to implement a secure multi-tenant SaaS, but few
   works on the modeling and analysis of its availability. In this paper,
   we firstly present the availability issues of the multi-tenant SaaS. Two
   important mechanisms to implement the MTA SaaS are then introduced:
   network isolation and database sharing. After that, a stochastic Petri
   net (SPN) model is developed to analyze the availability. Specific
   metrics are proposed to measure the availability both from the aspects
   of the system and the tenant. To extend the SPN model for large scale
   analysis, we solve the state space explosion problem of SPN model based
   on the theory of Markov chain aggregation. Finally, numerical results
   are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPN model and the
   analysis is efficient.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to examine whether the retinal image
   quality metrics calculated from the optical aberrations of the eye
   account for variation in visual acuity (VA) as measured by high contrast
   single letter chart. Strehl ratios and modulation transfer functions
   (MTF) were calculated from the ocular aberrations obtained from
   Hartmann-Shack images of pre-school children aged from 3 to 6 years. The
   Strehl ratios were grouped into three VA groups of 6/6, 6/9 and 6/12 and
   compared. No significant differences in Strehl ratios were observed.
   This finding suggests that optical aberrations alone do not completely
   describe the visual performance of the eye.}},

Abstract = {{Being able to monitor a large area is essential for intelligent
   warehouse automation. Complete depth map of a plant floor allows
   Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) to navigate the environment and safely
   interact with nearby people and equipment, eliminating the need for
   installation of guide tracks and range sensors on individual robots.
   A single camera does not have sufficient field of view or resolution to
   monitor a large scene, and a camera mounted on a moving platform
   introduces delays and blind spots that could put people at risk in busy
   areas. Multi-camera arrays are needed in order to reconstruct the scene
   from simultaneous captures. Existing iterative closest point (ICP) based
   algorithms fail to produce meaningful results due to ICP attempting to
   minimize Euclidean distance between non-matching pairs.
   This paper describes a method for accurate and computationally efficient
   simultaneous scene reconstruction and autocalibration using depth maps
   captured with multiple downward looking overhead cameras. The proposed
   method extends upon standard ICP algorithm by incorporating constraints
   imposed by the camera setup. The common field of view constraint imposed
   on the ICP algorithm matches a subset of points that are simultaneously
   in two camera's field of view. The planar constraint restricts the
   search space for closest points between 2 point clouds to be on a
   projected planar surface.
   To simulate a typical warehouse environment, depth maps captured from
   two overhead Microsoft Kinect cameras were used to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate the
   proposed algorithm successfully reconstructed the scene and produced
   auto-calibrated extrinsic camera matrix, where as standard ICP algorithm
   did not generate meaningful results.}},

Abstract = {{Acquiring accurate dense depth maps is crucial for accurate 3D
   reconstruction. Current high quality depth sensors capable of generating
   dense depth maps are expensive and bulky, while compact low-cost sensors
   can only reliably generate sparse depth measurements. We propose a novel
   multilayer conditional random field (MCRF) approach to reconstruct a
   dense depth map of a target scene given the sparse depth measurements
   and corresponding photographic measurements obtained from
   stereophotogrammetric systems. Estimating the dense depth map is
   formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference problem where a
   smoothness prior is assumed. Our MCRF model uses the sparse depth
   measurement as an additional observation layer and describes relations
   between nodes with multivariate feature functions based on the depth and
   photographic measurements. The method is first qualitatively analyzed
   when performed on data collected with a compact stereo camera, then
   quantitative performance is measured using the Middlebury stereo vision
   data for ground truth. Experimental results show our method performs
   well for reconstructing simple scenes and has lower mean squared error
   compared to other dense depth map reconstruction methods.}},

Abstract = {{Early detection of lung cancer can help in a sharp decrease in the lung
   cancer mortality rate, which accounts for more than 17\% percent of the
   total cancer related deaths. A large number of cases are encountered by
   radiologists on a daily basis for initial diagnosis. Computer-aided
   diagnosis (CAD) systems can assist radiologists by offering a second

   nodules as either malignant or benign. We use 4303 instances containing
   4323 nodules from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Lung Image
   Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset to obtain an overall accuracy of
   75.01\% with a sensitivity of 83.35\% and false positive of 0.39/patient

Abstract = {{Code comments are an integral part of software development. They improve
   program comprehension and software maintainability. The lack of code
   comments is a common problem in the software industry. Therefore, it is
   beneficial to generate code comments automatically. In this paper, we
   propose a general approach to generate code comments automatically by
   analyzing existing software repositories. We apply code clone detection
   techniques to discover similar code segments and use the comments from
   some code segments to describe the other similar code segments. We
   leverage natural language processing techniques to select relevant
   comment sentences.
   In our evaluation, we analyze 42 million lines of code from 1,005 open
   source projects from GitHub, and use them to generate 359 code comments
   for 21 Java projects. We manually evaluate the generated code comments
   and find that only 23.7\% of the generated code comments are good. We
   report to the developers the good code comments, whose code segments do
   not have an existing code comment. Amongst the reported code comments,
   seven have been confirmed by the developers as good and committable to
   the software repository while the rest await for developers'
   confirmation. Although our approach can generate good and committable
   comments, we still have to improve the yield and accuracy of the
   proposed approach before it can be used in practice with full
   automation.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by cloud computing applications, we consider a multi-server
   system, consisting of a large number of parallel servers, where jobs
   arrive according to a Poisson process and are assigned to the servers
   for processing. Each server has the capacity to process only a finite
   number of jobs simultaneously and different servers have different
   capacities. A job is accepted for processing only if there is a vacancy
   available at the server to which it is assigned. Otherwise, the job is
   discarded or blocked. We consider randomized schemes to assign jobs to
   servers with the aim of reducing the average blocking probability of
   jobs in the system. In particular, we consider a scheme that assigns an
   incoming job to the server having maximum available vacancy among d
   randomly sampled servers. We consider the system in the limit where both
   the number of servers and the arrival rate of jobs are scaled by a large
   factor. This gives rise to a mean field analysis. We show that in the
   limiting system servers behave independently. Stationary tail
   probabilities of server occupancies are obtained from the stationary
   solution of the mean field which is shown to be unique and globally
   attractive. We further characterize the rate of decay of the stationary
   tail probabilities. Numerical results suggest that the proposed scheme
   significantly reduces the average blocking probability of jobs compared
   to static schemes that probabilistically route jobs to servers
   independently of their states.}},

Abstract = {{North American utilities are increasingly concerned with their ageing
   ceramic insulator assets as they are either fast approaching their
   expected end of life or have already exceeded them. Defects like broken,
   cracked and punctured discs are some of the most adverse problems that
   the utilities encounter. These defects give rise to the initiation of
   partial discharge (PD) activities within the samples which has a
   detrimental effect on the insulator life. Hence it is important for the
   utilities to identify such defective samples as early as possible so
   that appropriate replacement strategies can be devised. Currently used
   PD techniques are off-line and are not suitable for detecting defective
   insulators in the field without interrupting the power supply. In this
   work, experiments are performed; simulating the actual field environment
   in an effort to develop a non-contact radio frequency (RF) based
   condition monitoring system for defective ceramic insulators. RF
   signatures captured in the field due to PD activities from two different
   defects are post processed; which involves noise removal and other
   signal processing techniques to extract appropriate wavelet packet based
   features. These features are then used to train and test artificial
   neural network (ANN) classifier. For the tests conducted, high
   recognition rates above 90\% have been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{High frame rate video has been a hot topic in the past few years driven
   by a strong need in the entertainment and gaming industry. Nevertheless,
   progress on perceptual quality assessment of high frame rate video
   remains limited, making it difficult to evaluate the exact perceptual
   gain by switching from low to high frame rates. In this work, we first
   conduct a subjective quality assessment experiment on a database that
   contains videos compressed at different frame rates, quantization levels
   and spatial resolutions. We then carry out a series of analysis on the
   subjective data to investigate the impact of frame rate on perceived
   video quality and its interplay with quantization level, spatial
   resolution, spatial complexity, and motion complexity. We observe that
   perceived video quality generally increases with frame rate, but the
   gain saturates at high rates. Such gain also depends on the interactions
   between quantization level, spatial resolution, and spatial and motion
   complexities.}},

Abstract = {{How to measure the perceptual quality of depth information in
   stereoscopic natural images, especially images undergoing different
   types of symmetric and asymmetric distortions, is a fundamentally
   important issue that is not well understood. In this paper, we present
   two of our recent subjective studies on depth quality. The first one
   follows the absolute category rating (ACR) protocol that is widely used
   in general image quality assessment research. We find that traditional
   approaches such as ACR is problematic in this scenario because monocular
   cues and the spatial quality of images have strong impacts on the depth
   quality scores given by subjects, making it difficult to single out the
   actual contributions of stereoscopic cues in depth perception. To
   overcome this problem, we carry out the second subjective study where
   depth effect is synthesized at different depth levels before various
   types and levels of symmetric and asymmetric distortions are applied.
   Instead of following the traditional approach, we ask subjects to
   identify and label depth polarizations, and a Depth Perception
   Difficulty Index (DPDI) is developed based on the percentage of correct
   and incorrect subject judgements. We find this approach highly effective
   at quantifying depth perception induced by stereo cues and observe a
   number of interesting effects regarding image content dependency,
   distortion type dependency, and the impacts of symmetric versus
   asymmetric distortions. We believe that these are useful steps towards
   building comprehensive 3D quality-of-experience models for stereoscopic
   images.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a perceptual two-pass rate control scheme for High Efficiency
   Video Coding (HEVC). The target bits are optimally allocated by
   hierarchically constructing a perceptual uniform space derived based on
   an SSIM-inspired divisive normalization mechanism for each group of
   pictures (GoP), each frame, and each coding unit (CU). The Lagrange
   multiplier lambda, which controls the trade-off between perceptual
   distortion and bit rate, is adopted as the GoP level complexity measure.
   After the first pass compression, Laplacian based rate and perceptual
   distortion models are established to adaptively derive lambda, and the
   target bits are dynamically allocated by maintaining an uniform Lagrange
   multiplier level through lambda equalization. Within each GoP, rate
   control is further performed at frame and CU levels in the perceptually
   uniform space. Extensive simulations verify that, the proposed scheme
   can achieve high accuracy rate control and superior rate-SSIM
   performance.}},

   Frequency Division Multiple (OFDM)-based cellular network with underlay

   with two types of queues to model the flow-level system behavior, where
   the service rates are derived based on the stochastic point processes of
   user positions. Since the state space of the queuing model grows
   exponentially with the number of D2D users and cells, we use the model
   decomposition and iteration technique to derive its approximate
   steady-state solution and obtain the flow-level performance in terms of
   mean delay and energy consumption. Simulations are performed to verify
   the analytical results under different traffic loads. The proposed

Abstract = {{Software as a Service (SaaS) is an increasingly important service
   delivery model in cloud computing, and multi-tenancy makes it possible
   to support large scale customized tenants with only one code base.
   However, the complexity of multi-tenant architecture may lead to poor
   performance and low resource utilization. The customized demands may
   also lead to high operating cost. It is very important to develop an
   accurate model to predict the performance of the multi-tenant SaaS. To
   this end, a multi-tenant queueing network model is developed. Based on
   the model, a balanced SLA-aware tenant placement algorithm is proposed
   considering that customized tenants may need more resources to be placed
   together. The algorithm is effective in nearly 90\% of the simulations
   comparing with other heuristic algorithms. Furthermore, the optimization
   problem on dynamic resource provision to minimize the operating cost is
   studied. As the original optimization problem is NP-hard, a continuous
   upper bound is used to convert the original optimization problem into a
   convex optimization which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time.
   Finally, it is demonstrated that the approximate ratio of the proposed
   approach is no greater than 1.2 in more than 90\% of the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Security and privacy are growing concerns in modern embedded software,
   given the increasing level of connectivity as well as complexity and
   features in embedded devices. Use of cryptographic techniques is often a
   requirement on which the security of the device relies. However,
   important challenges arise when potential attackers have physical access
   to the device. Side-channel analysis, including simple power analysis
   (SPA), is a class of powerful non-intrusive attacks that are suitable
   for adversaries with physical access to the device. Countermeasures
   exist, but they typically involve a considerable performance penalty,
   and some of them in turn introduce a vulnerability to induced fault
   attacks.
   In this work, we present several new efficient cryptographic
   exponentiation algorithms that work by splitting the exponent in two
   halves for simultaneous processing while using special representations
   derived from signed-digit encoding that improve computational
   efficiency. A key detail in the design of these algorithms is that they
   are compatible with the idea of buffering the operations to provide
   resistance to SPA. Experimental results are presented, including
   implementations of the proposed methods with both modular integer
   exponentiation and elliptic curve (ECC) scalar multiplication. We also
   performed statistical analysis of the traces, showing that trace
   segments for different exponent bits are statistically
   indistinguishable. Our proposed techniques also exhibit better
   resistance against fault attacks and combined fault and side-channel
   attacks, compared to previous SPA-resistant techniques.}},

Abstract = {{NoSQL storage systems are used extensively by web applications and
   provide an attractive alternative to conventional databases when the
   need for scalability outweighs the need for transactions. Several of
   these systems, notably Amazon's Dynamo and its open-source derivatives,
   provide quorum-based replication and present the application developer
   with a choice of multiple client-side ``consistency levels{''} that
   determine the number of replicas accessed by reads and writes. This
   setting, in turn, affects both the latency and the consistency observed
   by the client application. Since using a fixed combination of read and
   write consistency levels for a given application provides only a limited
   number of discrete options for tuning the consistency-latency trade-off,
   we investigate techniques that allow more fine-grained tuning as may be
   required to support consistency guarantees through service level
   agreements (SLAs). We consider two such techniques, a novel technique
   that assigns the consistency level on a per-operation basis by choosing
   randomly between two options (e.g., weak vs. strong consistency) with a
   tunable probability, and a known technique that uses weak consistency
   and injects delays into storage operations artificially. We compare and
   contrast these two techniques experimentally against each other and
   against combinations of fixed consistency levels using Apache Cassandra
   deployed in Amazon's EC2 environment.}},

Abstract = {{With the help of an automatic servo-controlled triaxial rock creep
   system, typical whole process rheological curve is obtained through
   laboratory experiment on the surrounding diorite rock of a large
   underground water-sealed cavern project. Creep experiments show that
   diorite exhibits obvious creep behaviour under the high in situ stress.
   Based on the experiment results, this article studies the creep
   behaviour under different stress levels, analyses the creep failure mode
   and mechanism, and obtains the triaxial creep properties of diorite.
   Using a three-dimensional nonlinear numerical method and the modified
   hydro-mechanical coupled Cvisc creep model, creep behaviour of the
   surrounding rock during the long-term operation is simulated and
   time-dependent stability is analysed. The results indicate that creep
   deformation is evident, and local stress concentration is relieved due
   to stress redistribution. After a period of time, the creep rate becomes
   stable and the deformation is stabilised. Because of its theoretical and
   practical significance, hydro-mechanical coupled creep analysis is
   important for the long-term stability and safety evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Baitieba landslide, located on the left bank of Xiluodu reservoir, is an
   ancient landslide. The landslide slides along the shallow and deep
   sliding surfaces after excavation. Sliding along the shallow sliding
   surface has become stabilised by and large; whereas sliding along the
   deep sliding surface still continues after some effective and systematic
   treatments. Based on the data of inclinometer boreholes observed in the
   field, a detailed investigation into the mechanism of continuous sliding
   along the deep sliding surface is carried out. It is found that slow
   creep of the ancient sliding zone is a predominant factor, and its creep
   deformation has undergone two stages: attenuation of creep deformation
   and linear increase of creep deformation. A numerical simulation,
   considering creep behaviour of the ancient slip zone, is also conducted
   to verify the mechanism of movement of the landslide inferred from the
   monitoring data of inclinometer boreholes. Using the monitoring data,
   long-term stability of the landslide is analysed and it is concluded
   that the landslide is stable overall.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is of fundamental
   importance in deciphering cellular processes. Predicting PPls is thus
   critical in making new discoveries in the biological domains.
   Traditionally, new PPls are identified through biochemical experiments
   but such methods are labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming and
   technically ineffective due to high false positive rates. Computational
   docking is an alternative but requires the three-dimensional structures
   of the target proteins which are not always accessible. Sequence-based
   prediction is the most readily applicable and cost-effective method. It
   exploits known PPI Databases to construct classifiers for predicting
   unknown PPls based only on sequence data. However, existing methods,
   adopting features that fix the pattern length and use exact patterns,
   are biologically unrealistic. Also, those based on SVM and String Kernel
   are hardly biologically interpretable since they do not compute the
   features. Recently, we have developed a new method for predicting PPI
   known as WeMine-P2P based on our WeMine Aligned Pattern Clustering
   algorithm which discovers and identifies the localized and co-occurring
   conserved patterns and regions allowing variable length and pattern
   variations. As our first attempt, under 40 independent experiments, we
   showed that (1) WeMine-P2P outperforms the well-known algorithm, PIPE2
   which also utilizes co-occurring amino acid sequence segments but does
   not allow variable lengths and pattern variations; (2) Unlike SVM-based
   methods, WeMine-P2P renders interpretable biological features; (3)
   WeMine-P2P achieves satisfactory PPI prediction performance, comparable
   to the SVM-based methods particularly in unseen protein sequences, with
   a potential reduction of feature dimension of 1280x. WeMine-P2P is
   extendable to other biosequence interactions such as predicting
   Protein-DNA interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The electrification of vehicles is now considered an effective solution
   that will reduce fuel consumption and emissions as well as increase
   energy security through the diversification of available energy sources.
   The electric energy generated from low-emission renewable resources will
   play a vital role to meet the electricity needs of the transportation
   sector and will also address concerns about shifting emissions from the
   transportation sector to the electricity generation sector. This paper
   proposes a new approach to evaluate the power system reliability indices
   incorporating plug-in electric vehicles. The proposed method relies on
   developing virtual scenarios that cover all possible occurrences for
   normal demand, conventional generation, renewable resources, and plug-in
   electric vehicles demand. These scenarios are generated using Monte
   Carlo Simulation and Marcov Chains}},

Abstract = {{Various photovoltaic PV models of different complexity exist in the
   literature. The modeling accuracy for most of them is directly related
   to their complexity and computational effort. Recently, two newly
   developed PV models featuring low computational effort and high accuracy
   appeared in the literature. The first model is developed based on
   Gompertz model which is originally used to model human mortality, and
   the second relies on a polynomial function which represents the voltage
   drop in the model series resistance. Because both models have similar
   features, their pros and cons are not clear and thus it is challenging
   for users to decide which model is more suitable for a particular PV
   application. This paper constructs a comparison between the two models
   showing their pros and cons. The results of the paper would be
   beneficial for PV system designers and researchers to select the
   appropriate model for a specific PV application.}},

Abstract = {{Most structures and components are fabricated using welded joints. A
   very high percentage of all fatigue failures locally occur at welded
   locations due to high tensile residual stresses and stress
   concentrations resulting from the weld process. High frequency
   mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment has been increasingly used as an
   effective post-weld treatment technique to improve fatigue strength of
   welded structures. Fatigue tests have been conducted for as-welded and
   HFMI treated 5083-H321 grade aluminum and ASTM A514 steel welded
   specimens to investigate the effects of the HFMI treatment under
   constant amplitude R = 0.1 and variable amplitude loading. This paper
   presents fatigue test results including local properties (residual
   stresses) of welded specimens under the as-welded and the HFMI treated
   conditions. Test results showed that the HFMI treatment significantly
   improved fatigue life performance of the aluminum and steel welded
   specimens under both constant and variable amplitude load conditions.
   Therefore, the HFMI treatment is a quite promising post-weld treatment
   technique and its potential applications on the fatigue design of welded
   structures and components can lead to lighter structures and products,
   in which components and structures can be down-sized and optimized to
   reduce weights. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Cable-based robots generally perform better than other parallel robots
   with rigid links in terms of wider workspace and higher acceleration of
   end effector because of lightweight of robot links. Cable based robots
   allow an easy mounting and remounting for outside applications; however,
   this requires a precise assembly of components at the cable anchor
   points. In this study, firstly a parametric model is developed for
   estimation of position errors of anchor points for fully constrained and
   redundant planar cable robots. A novel method based on inclusion of
   virtual cables facilitates the linear separation of the uncertain
   parameters from the input-output signals for redundant planar robots. In
   addition, the adaptive law (parameter estimator) updates the estimated
   parameters using the least squares algorithm. The simulation results
   show that the least squares method reduces the time of estimation
   convergence compared to gradient algorithms. Furthermore, the least
   squares method allows simple persistent excitation signals to estimate

Abstract = {{The detection of marine oil spill candidate from synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) images is largely hampered by SAR speckle noise and the
   complex marine environment. In this paper, we develop a
   thresholding-guided stochastic fully-connected conditional random field
   (TGSFCRF) model for inferring the binary label from SAR imagery. First,
   an intensity thresholding approach is used to estimate the initial
   labels of oil spill candidates and the background. Second, a Gaussian
   mixture model (GMM) is trained using all the pixels based on the initial
   labels. Last, based on the GMM model, a graph-cut optimization approach
   is used for inferring the final labels. By using a threholding-guided
   approach, TGSFCRF can exploit the statistical characteristics of the two
   classes for better label inference. Moreover, by using a stochastic
   clique approach, TGSFCRF efficiently addresses the global-scale spatial
   correlation effect, and thereby can better resist the influence of SAR
   speckle noise and background heterogeneity. Experimental results on
   RADARSAT-J ScanSAR imagery demonstrate that TGSFCRF can accurately
   delineate oil spill candidates without committing too much false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing demand in embedded systems, safety and non-safety
   critical parts are integrated together although guaranteeing safety is a
   hard problem to tackle due to the complexity of possible interactions
   between components involving communication. However, it is sufficiently
   recognized that separation of computation and communication can reduce
   the complexity of guaranteeing safety involved in interactions between
   components.
   In this work, we propose to use component interfaces derived from
   periodic resource supplies that can meet the demand of components
   experiencing bounded delays. The advantage of using interfaces is to
   provide minimal information of components without requiring the entire
   task specifications to generate a multi-mode communication schedule. We
   use integer linear programming to find assignments in generating
   schedules that are guaranteed to have low average mode-change delay. A
   video monitoring case study demonstrates the advantages on using our
   approach in generating communication schedules.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time embedded programs are time sensitive and, to trace such
   programs, the instrumentation mechanism must honor the programs' timing
   constraints. We present a time-aware instrumentation technique that
   injects program code with slack-based conditional instrumentation. The
   central idea is to execute instrumentation code only when its execution
   does not increase the worst-case execution time beyond a program's
   deadline. This occurs at run-time. Unlike previous efforts, this work
   allows instrumenting on the path that results in the worst case
   execution time of the program. We propose a software, and a hardware
   method of allowing for slack-based conditional instrumentation. We
   evaluate and compare these two alternatives using a common benchmark
   suite for real-time systems. Our results show that, on average, the two
   proposed methods achieve 57\% and 80\% instrumentation coverage,
   respectively, compared to only a 3\% coverage by previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), comprising a larger number of
   battery-powered sensor nodes for event monitoring and data gathering,
   have been widely deployed into various military and industrial
   applications. Since most of WSN applications aim to make full use of the
   energy-limited sensor nodes to monitor a wide area for a long time,
   energy efficiency and scalability become two important performance
   metrics for WSNs. Clustering has been proved to be an effective way to
   improve energy efficiency and network lifetime for WSNs. However, with
   the increasing scale of WSNs, existing clustering schemes would face
   significant limitations in improving energy efficiency and prolonging
   network lifetime. Inspired by the similar features between large scale
   WSNs and complex networks, some analysis methods in complex networks can
   be utilized to address these limitations. In this paper, we propose a
   clustering scheme, named Energy-aware and Scalable Clustering Scheme
   (ESCS), to enhance the energy efficiency and scalability in WSNs. The
   proposed scheme is based on the inherent characteristics of WSNs and
   evolution idea of Barabasi-Albert (BA) model. Extensive simulation
   results demonstrate that ESCS can prolong the network lifetime and
   significantly improve the scalability of WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme based on
   Stackelberg game for a heterogeneous network to simultaneously offer
   mobile social users with bandwidth via multiple homing access. In
   specific, network operators in the heterogeneous network compete with
   each other to determine the price of the bandwidth based on the
   prediction of mobile social users' demands. Then, mobile social users
   with the same interests form a social community as a coalition to
   dynamically request bandwidth and share the cost with each other. We
   formulate the bandwidth allocation problem as a Stackelberg game to
   model the interactions among mobile social users and network operators.
   In addition, with a backward induction, an iterative algorithm is
   proposed to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, simulation
   results show that the proposed scheme can improve both the efficiency
   ratio of bandwidth allocation and load balance of networks compared with
   uniform bandwidth allocation, random bandwidth allocation, and single

Abstract = {{A robust economic nonlinear predictive controller is proposed for batch

   maximizing an economic objective subject to the LP based model. To
   address robustness the DFBM model is represented by using a Polynomial
   Chaos Expansion model which allows quick propagation of the uncertainty
   in parameters onto the cost function to be optimized by the controller.
   The performance of the robust algorithm is applied to E.coli batch

   input from a maximum likelihood based Fitting of the predicted and
   measured output variables. Simulation studies compare the proposed
   method with a Particle Filter (PF) to estimate the value of an unknown
   feed mass fraction of a chemical process. The proposed method is shown
   to be significantly more computational efficient and less sensitive to
   user defined tuning parameters than PF. (c) 2015, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{In this paper, an extensive study on plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)

   (NHTS) data is carried out and the PEV charging behavior is modeled.
   Thereafter, a stochastic optimization model is proposed considering
   different PEV charging scenarios with their associated probabilities and
   the impact on system load, feeder loss and voltage deviation are
   studied. A Distribution Optimal Power Flow (DOPF) model with various
   objectives such as feeder loss minimization, energy drawn minimization
   and PEV charging cost minimization subject to feeder operational
   constraints including PEV charging within a 33-bus balanced distribution
   system is presented. In the uncontrolled charging case, the worst case
   scenarios are discussed. The proposed smart charging model provides with
   the optimal charging schedules which result in flattening the load

Abstract = {{The increasing usage of mobile electrical units demands higher energy
   efficiencies for these devices. Self-sustaining units that harvest
   various forms of ambient energy can help significantly with their
   regular battery replacements. In this chapter two hybrid energy
   harvesting units are proposed that employ piezoelectric,
   magnetostrictive, and electromagnetic technologies to capture ambient
   vibrational energy. The first harvester is made of piezoelectric and
   magnetostrictive materials while the second harvester is composed of a
   piezoelectric layer and a magnet. Both proposed harvesters employ a
   spiral piezoelectric layer in order to reduce the compliance of the
   piezoelectric unit. The advantages of the first design is that it allows
   for more efficient harvesting over a wider range of frequencies than
   traditional harvesting units while the second design reduces the natural
   frequency of the system that results in better energy harvesting at low
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a stereo filtering approach to augment the detection
   of lane markings in the Bird's Eye View image before the Inverse
   Perspective Mapping is applied with an existing lane detection
   algorithm. It also completely reformulates the semi-supervised learning
   process used so that it requires much less labour and is much more
   effective than the previously used method, allowing the approach to be
   extended to much larger and more complicated images. These improvements
   are then tested against an open and challenging KITTI data set to
   demonstrate the improved results. This paper then provides an analysis
   of the lane marking hypotheses filtered by our augmentation to
   illustrate that the candidates removed by our filter can produce highly
   confident erroneous results if not removed before Inverse Perspective
   Mapping due to their visual similarity to lane markings in the grayscale

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a detailed placement algorithm targeting
   detailed routability for designs at or smaller than 22nm. The sheer
   number and complexity of routing design rules at these feature sizes
   preclude direct incorporation of detailed routing rules into a placement
   algorithm. However, using the detail routing information to guide the
   placement can significantly reduce the overall design time and improve
   the performance of the circuit. Our proposed detailed routing-aware
   detailed placement (DrDp) is developed as an add-on to the detailed
   placement process to improve detailed routability in a relatively short
   runtime. The proposed technique is added to the code obtained from one
   of the top three teams in the ISPD 2014 detailed routing-driven
   placement contest and tested on ISPD 2014 benchmark suite. Numerical
   results show that the proposed technique can improve the detailed
   routing quality with no significant change in detailed placement score,

Abstract = {{Context: Software source code is frequently changed for fixing revealed
   bugs. These bug-fixing changes might introduce unintended system
   behaviors, which are inconsistent with scenarios of existing regression
   test cases, and consequently break regression testing. For validating
   the quality of changes, regression testing is a required process before
   submitting changes during the development of software projects. Our
   pilot study shows that 48.7\% bug-fixing changes might break regression
   testing at first run, which means developers have to run regression
   testing at least a couple of times for 48.7\% changes. Such process can
   be tedious and time consuming. Thus, before running regression test
   suite, finding these changes and corresponding regression test cases
   could be helpful for developers to quickly fix these changes and improve
   the efficiency of regression testing. Goal: This paper proposes
   bug-fixing change impact prediction (BFCP), for predicting whether a
   bug-fixing change will break regression testing or not before running
   regression test cases, by mining software change histories. Method: Our
   approach employs the machine learning algorithms and static call graph
   analysis technique. Given a bug-fixing change, BFCP first predicts
   whether it will break existing regression test cases; second, if the
   change is predicted to break regression test cases, BFCP can further
   identify the might-be-broken test cases. Results: Results of experiments
   on 552 real bug-fixing changes from four large open source projects show
   that BFCP could achieve prediction precision up to 83.3\%, recall up to
   92.3\%, and F-score up to 81.4\%. For identifying the might-be-broken
   test cases, BFCP could achieve 100\% recall.}},

   the construction of two local subprojects. Strategic analysis can

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are becoming increasingly popular in
   recent years due to their properties such as large recovery strain,
   silent actuation and low weight. Actuation in SMA wires depends strongly
   on temperature which is difficult to measure directly. Therefore, a
   reliable model is required to predict wire temperature, in order to
   control the transformation, and hence the actuation, and to avoid
   potential degradation due to overheating. The purpose of this
   investigation is to develop resistance and natural convection heat
   transfer models to predict temperature of current-carrying SMA wires
   using indirect temperature measurement methods.
   Experiments are performed on electrically heated 0.5 mm diameter NiTi
   SMA wire during phase transformation. Convection heat transfer
   experiments are performed in an environment of air that allows for
   control of the ambient pressure and in turn the thermofluid properties,
   such as density and viscosity. By measuring convective heat loss at a
   range of pressures, an empirical natural convection heat transfer
   correlation is determined for inclination angles from horizontal to
   vertical, in the Rayleigh number range of 2.6 x 10(-8) <= Ra-D <= 6.0 x
   10(-1). Later, effect of temperature changes on electrical resistance
   and other control parameters such as applied external stress, wire
   inclination angle, wire length and ambient pressure is investigated.
   Based on experimental results a resistance model is developed for SMA
   wires that combined with the heat transfer correlation previously
   derived can be used to predict temperature and natural convection heat
   transfer coefficient of NiTi SMA wires during phase transformation for
   different wire lengths and inclination angles under various applied
   external stresses.}},

Abstract = {{In hot forming die quenching, furnaces are used to austenitize steel
   blanks and transform an Al-Si layer into a permanent Al-Si-Fe coating.
   Application of a simplified heat transfer model to thermocouple
   measurements on steel blanks heated in industrial furnaces showed
   specific heats that varied with blank thicknesses, raising questions
   about the accuracy of these measurements. A detailed experimental study
   on a lab scale muffle furnace shows that natural convection and
   variations in the surrounding temperatures has a strong influence on the
   inferred specific heat. An improved heat transfer model is used to
   qualitatively assess how austenitization influences the effective
   specific heat.}},

Abstract = {{The micropolar elasticity theory provides a useful material model for
   dealing with fibrous, coarse granular; and large molecule materials.
   Though being a well-known, and well developed elasticity model, the
   linear theory of micropolar elasticity is not without controversy.
   Specially simplification of the microppolar elasticity theory to the
   couple-stress and classical elasticity theories and the required
   conditions on the material elastic constants for this simplification
   have not been discussed consistently. In this paper the linear theory of
   micropolar elasticity is reviewed first. Then the correct approach for a
   consistent and step-by-step simplification of the micropolar elasticity
   model with six elastic constants to the couple-stress elasticity model
   with four elastic constants and the classical elasticity model with two
   elastic constants is presented. It is shown that the classical
   elasticity is a special case of the couple-stress theory which itself is
   a special case of the micropolar elasticity theory.}},

Abstract = {{A physical testing program is performed in support of finite element
   model creation for a 50-series passenger car tire. ABAQUS finite element
   analysis software is used along with its standard material models.
   Uniaxial tension testing of tire samples cut from the tread composite,
   tread rubber and sidewall composite is performed in order to obtain
   material properties. Hyper elastic material coefficients for tread
   rubber are fit using uniaxial tension test data. Results show that the
   Arruda-Boyce hyper elastic material model fits the test data well and it
   predicts reasonable overall behavior in uniaxial tension and uniaxial
   compression. Most other hyperelastic material models are found to
   predict unrealistic behavior in uniaxial compression for the tire
   samples, especially in the 0 to 20\% compressive strain range.
   Frequency response testing of two inflated passenger car tires of
   different sizes, makes and models is also performed to assist in
   defining the viscoelastic material model for tread rubber. Test results
   show that tire modal damping is in the 2 to 4\% range for most modes
   below 200 Hz, and the response curves, modal density and modal damping
   are remarkably similar for the two tires tested. The tire finite element
   model with updated material properties is simulated for nine
   combinations of air inflation pressure and vertical load in order to
   calculate static loaded radius. The analysis results are compared with
   physical test results and the analysis results are found to deviate at
   most by 3\% coin pared to the tests.}},

Abstract = {{A longitudinal force estimation based on wheel dynamics and unscented
   Kalman filter is proposed in this report to address the difficulties in
   the conventional tire-based approaches. Although it seems that
   implementation of a tire model in the estimation procedure should result
   in more accurate results, especially for non-linear regions,
   complexities in identifying the tire parameters due to the variation of
   the road and tire conditions leads to inaccurate results for harsh
   maneuvers on slippery roads. Moreover, the estimation process requires
   reliable measurements and this necessitates utilizing dynamic models
   with feasible measurements. Consequently, wheel dynamics is employed to
   extend the fidelity of the algorithm. For such a model, wheel speeds as
   reliable and feasible measurements are available. In this strategy, the
   complex tire-road interaction can be discarded since the wheel speeds
   are being observed by wheel sensors and the values of the effective
   torques are provided by motor drives then the longitudinal forces at
   each individual corner of the vehicle can be estimated independently.
   Experimental and simulation results confirm the validity of the
   algorithm in slippery road conditions as well as normal conditions. The
   newly developed structure has a strong potential to be integrated with
   other state estimation, such as longitudinal/lateral velocities and
   lateral forces.}},

Abstract = {{Guaranteeing stability of a vehicle without considering the driver in
   the control loop is difficult. In this paper, a driver in-the-loop
   control strategy is proposed to improve the lateral vehicle behavior and
   extend the stability margin. The driver is modeled as a delayed linear
   controller with the aim of tracking the desired path. The main aim of
   the controller design is to track the desired yaw rate of the vehicle
   considering the driver effects. To make an implementable approach, it is
   assumed that the desired road information and the exact values of
   longitudinal and lateral forces are not available for the control level
   and the controller treats them as bounded uncertainties. The non-linear
   damping technique is adopted to stabilize the yaw rate error. For two
   different robust designs, we have shown that the yaw rate error will
   confine inside a certain neighborhood even in the presence of
   uncertainty. The size of this neighborhood is directly proportionate to
   the gain of the robust control terms and the driver characteristics. A
   standard harsh double lane change scenario is simulated as the desired
   path for the drivel: The results demonstrate that the design process
   improves the overall behavior of the driver-vehicle system in the

Abstract = {{For high productivity weld fabrication, gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is
   typically used since it offers a combination of high deposition rate and
   travel speed. Recent advances in power supply technologies have
   increased the deposition rates in hot-wire tungsten inert gas (HW-TIG)
   welding, such that it is possible to achieve parameters which may be
   comparable to those used in GMAW for pressure vessels and some pipeline
   applications. However, these two processes have drastically different
   deposition efficiencies and heat input characteristics. The purpose of
   the present study is to examine GMAW and HW-TIG bead-on-plate deposits
   in terms of mechanical properties, deposition rate, and heat affected
   zone (HAZ) thermal cycles when identical travel speed and wire feed
   speeds are applied with a ER90S-G filler metal. The results demonstrate
   that HW-TIG can be applied with comparable travel and wire feed speeds
   to GMAW, while providing a more uniform weld bead appearance. Based on
   weld metal microhardness values, it is suggested the effective heat
   input is lower in HW-TIG compared to GMAW, since the hardness of the
   weld metal is slightly higher.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive yet practical driver
   model to be used in studying driver-vehicle interactions. Drivers
   interact with their vehicle and the road through the steering wheel.
   This interaction forms a closed-loop coupled human-machine system, which
   influences the driver's steering feel and control performance. A
   hierarchical approach is proposed here to capture the complexity of the
   driver's neuromuscular dynamics and the central nervous system in the
   coordination of the driver's upper extremity activities, especially in
   the presence of external disturbance. The proposed motor control
   framework has three layers: the first (or the path planning) plans a

Abstract = {{Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has attracted a great deal of
   attention due to the increasing demand in industry and the promising
   recent progress in academia. To bridge the gap between academic research
   accomplishment and industrial needs, high efficiency BIQA approaches
   that allow for real-time computation are highly desirable. In this
   paper, we propose a novel BIQA method by selecting statistical features
   extracted from binary patterns of local image structures. This allows us
   to largely reduce the feature space to eventually one dimension.
   Somewhat surprisingly, such a single feature, faster -than -real-time
   approach named local pattern statistics index (LPSI) exhibits impressive
   generalization ability across different distortion types and achieves
   competitive quality prediction performance in comparison with
   stateof-the-art approaches on public databases such as LIVE II and
   TID2008.}},

Abstract = {{Superpixels have been widely used for compact image representation in a
   large number of computer vision applications such as object recognition,
   segmentation, and depth estimation. Recently, a novel seam carving
   approach for superpixel generation called Grid Seams was introduced that
   significantly improved image structure preservation while maintaining
   global spatial constraints. While Grid Seams was able to achieve
   state-of-the-art superpixel accuracy, it only took advantage of
   rudimentary edge information in its energy function and as such did not
   account for other important image characteristics such as texture.
   Motivated by this, we present Return of Grid Seams (RGS), a novel
   extension of Grid Seams that takes advantage of not only structural
   variations, but also textural variations (in the form of texture
   distinctiveness) into a unified multi-functional energy along with
   global spatial constraints. Furthermore, RGS incorporates discontinuous
   seams in the optimization process to allow for greater flexibility in
   preserving structural information. Experimental results using the
   Berkeley Segmentation Dataset show that RGS is able to outperform Grid
   Seams as well as a number of other seam carving based superpixel
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Compression of screen content has recently emerged as an active research
   topic due to the increasing demand in many applications such as wireless
   display and virtual desktop infrastructure. Screen content images (SCIs)
   exhibit different statistical properties in textual and pictorial
   regions, and the human visual system (HVS) also behaves differently when
   viewing the textual and pictorial regions in terms of the extent of
   visual field. Here we propose a perceptual SCI quality assessment
   approach that incorporates visual field adaptation and information
   content weighting. Furthermore, we propose a perceptual coding scheme in
   an attempt to optimize the HEVC Screen Content Coding encoder.
   Experimental results show that the proposed quality assessment method
   not only better predicts the perceptual quality of SCIs, but also leads
   to an effective way to optimize screen content coding schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A limitation of active contours models (both parametric and geometric)
   is their sensitivity to noise. Many solutions to noise sensitivity have
   been proposed in the literature, with the current state-of-the-art based
   on image blurring and multiresolution processing. However a significant
   drawback of both approaches is the side effect of edge delocalization.
   In this paper, gradient information extracted from all resolutions of
   the undecimated wavelet transform is used to build the external force
   map for the active contour. The new map accurately drives the active
   contour and improves edge localization. The proposed method builds on
   both Gradient Vector Flow and Vector Field Convolution active contours.
   Comparisons to classical and state-of-the-art methods show a dramatic
   improvement in active contour convergence for all levels of noise.}},

Abstract = {{In comparison with H.264/AVC, the newest video coding standard, High
   Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), improves video coding rate distortion
   (RD) performance, but at the price of significant increase in its
   encoding complexity, due to its complicated inter mode decision process.
   In HEVC inter coding, the actual RD costs of all combinations of coding
   units (CUs), prediction units (PUs), and transform units (TUs) have to
   be computed and then the combination (i.e., mode) with the minimum cost
   is selected and encoded. To reduce the inter mode decision complexity in
   HEVC while maintaining its coding efficiency, in this paper, a fast
   inter mode decision method based on a newly proposed Transparent
   Composite Model (TCM) is developed. Spatially and temporally
   homogeneities are identified by TCM, and then used, together with
   spatiotemporal correlation between CUs, to determine PU and CU
   partitions so that cost computations of unnecessary modes can be
   skipped. Experimental results show that, for the low delay main test
   configuration of HEVC, our method reduces, on average, the encoding time
   by 60.71\% with an insignificant loss in coding efficiency (1.06\%
   BD-Rate increase).}},

Abstract = {{We propose a patch-wise approach for multi-exposure image fusion (MEF).
   A key step in our approach is to decompose each color image patch into
   three conceptually independent components: signal strength, signal
   structure and mean intensity. Upon processing the three components
   separately based on patch strength and exposedness measures, we uniquely
   reconstruct a color image patch and place it back into the fused image.
   Unlike most pixel-wise MEF methods in the literature, the proposed
   algorithm does not require significant pre/post-processing steps to
   improve visual quality or to reduce spatial artifacts. Moreover, the
   novel patch decomposition allows us to handle RGB color channels jointly
   and thus produces fused images with more vivid color appearances.
   Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
   algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively.}},

Abstract = {{Local saliency models are a cornerstone in image processing and computer
   vision, used in a wide variety of applications ranging from keypoint
   detection and feature extraction, to image matching and image
   representation. However, current models exhibit difficulties in
   achieving consistent results under varying, non-ideal illumination
   conditions. In this paper, a novel texture-illumination guided energy
   response (TIGER) model for illumination robust local saliency is
   proposed. In the TIGER model, local saliency is quantified by a modified
   Hessian energy response guided by a weighted aggregate of texture and
   illumination aspects from the image. A stochastic Bayesian
   disassociation approach via Monte Carlo sampling is employed to
   decompose the image into its texture and illumination aspects for the
   saliency computation. Experimental results demonstrate that higher
   correlation between local saliency maps constructed from the same scene
   under different illumination conditions can be achieved using the TIGER
   model when compared to common local saliency approach, i.e., Laplacian
   of Gaussian, Difference of Gaussians, and Hessian saliency models.}},

Abstract = {{The reconstruction of high dynamic range (HDR) images via conventional
   camera systems and low dynamic range (LDR) images is a growing field of
   research in image acquisition. The radiance map associated with the HDR
   image of a scene is typically computed using multiple images of the same
   scene captured at different exposures (i.e., bracketed LDR imzages).
   This approach, though inexpensive, is sensitive to noise under high
   camera ISO. Each bracketed image is associated with a different level of
   noise due to the change in exposure time, and the noise is further
   amplified when tone-mapping the HDR image for display. A new framework
   is proposed to address the associated noise in the context of random
   fields. The estimation of the HDR image from a set of LDR images is
   formulated as a stochastically fully connected conditional random field
   where the spatial information is incorporated to compute the HDR value
   in combination with the LDR image values. Experimental results show that
   the proposed framework compensated the non-stationary ISO noise while
   preserving the boundaries in the estimated HDR images.}},

Abstract = {{Local Binary Patterns (LBP) are among the most computationally efficient
   amongst high-performance texture features. However, LBP is very
   sensitive to image noise and is unable to capture macrostructure
   information. To best address these disadvantages, in this paper we
   introduce a novel descriptor for texture classification, the Median
   Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern (MRELBP). In contrast to
   traditional LBP and many LBP variants, MRELBP compares local image
   medians instead of raw image intensities. We develop a multiscale
   LBP-type descriptor by efficiently comparing image medians over a novel
   sampling scheme, which can capture both microstructure and
   macrostructure. A comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets reveals
   MRELBP's remarkable performance (robust to gray scale variations,
   rotation changes and noise) relative to state-of-the-art algorithms, but
   nevertheless at a low computational cost, producing the best
   classification scores of 99.82\%, 99.38\% and 99.77\% on three popular
   Outex test suites. Furthermore, MRELBP is also shown to be highly robust
   to image noise including Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, Salt-and-Pepper
   noise and random pixel corruption.}},

Abstract = {{Markov random fields (MRFs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) are
   influential tools in image modeling, particularly for applications such
   as image segmentation. Local MRFs and CRFs utilize local nodal
   interactions when modeling, leading to excessive smoothness on
   boundaries (i.e., the short-boundary bias problem). Recently, the
   concept of fully connected conditional random fields with stochastic
   cliques (SFCRF) was proposed to enable long-range nodal interactions
   while addressing the computational complexity associated with fully
   connected random fields. While SFCRF was shown to provide significant
   improvements in segmentation accuracy, there were still limitations with
   the preservation of fine structure boundaries. To address these
   limitations, we propose a new approach to stochastic clique formation
   for fully connected random fields (G-SFCRF) that is guided by the
   structural characteristics of different nodes within the random field.
   In particular, fine structures surrounding a node are modeled
   statistically by probability distributions, and stochastic cliques are
   formed by considering the statistical similarities between nodes within
   the random fields. Experimental results show that G-SFCRF outperforms
   existing fully connected CRF frameworks, SFCRF, and the principled deep
   random field framework for image segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Images captured in outdoor scenes often suffer from poor visibility and
   color shift due to the presence of haze. Although many algorithms have
   been proposed to remove the haze, not much effort has been made on
   quality assessment of dehazed images. In this paper, we first build a
   database that contains 25 hazy images as well as dehazed images created
   by eight dehazing algorithms. A subjective user study is then carried
   out based on the database, from which we have several useful findings.
   First, considerable agreement between human subjects on the perceived
   quality of hazy and dehazed images is observed. Second, not a single
   dehazing algorithm performs the best for all test images. Third,
   existing objective image quality assessment (IQA) models are very
   limited in providing proper quality predictions of dehazed images.}},

Abstract = {{Towards effective and efficient image matching or retrieval tasks, the
   emerging MPEG standard, named Compact Descriptors for Visual Search
   (CDVS), has fulfilled compact descriptors for still images, consisting
   of compressed local and global descriptor. Nevertheless, the frame-level
   coding of CDVS descriptors from a video sequence does not address the
   inter-frame redundancy issue, which may consume considerable bandwidth
   and storage resources. In this work, we propose an efficient coding
   framework of CDVS descriptors to generate compact descriptors for video
   sequences. For local descriptors, we propose a multiple reference
   predictive technique to exploit the temporal correlation of local
   descriptors and location coordinates over a sequence of frames. To
   further improve the prediction performance, keypoint tracking is applied
   to identify temporally repeated keypoints. For global descriptors, a
   propagation coding way is employed to compress the global descriptors of
   adjacent frames. The empirical evaluation has shown that the proposed
   coding approach has yielded a low bit rate of less than 40kbps on
   average, while maintaining comparable matching and retrieval
   performance. Compared to the sequence of original frame-level CDVS
   descriptors, the proposed approach has achieved over 25x bit rate
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the field of medical imaging have led to an immense increase
   in the volume of images being acquired. A fast growing application is to
   enable physicians to access image data remotely from any viewing device.
   This casts new challenges for data rate compression. Meanwhile medical
   images typically have High Dynamic Range (HDR), which needs to be
   transformed to Low Dynamic Range (LDR) through a so-called
   ``windowing{''} operation in order for them to be viewed on standard
   displays to best visualize specific types of content such as tissues or
   bone structures. This leads to a basic question: Should data compression
   be performed before windowing or vice versa? Answering this question
   needs domain knowledge and also requires comparing HDR and LDR images in
   terms of objective measures, which has only recently become possible. In
   this paper, we compare the two alternative schemes by using a recently
   proposed structural fidelity measure. Our study suggests that data
   compression followed by windowing delivers better performance than the
   other alternative.}},

Abstract = {{In hot forming die quenching (HFDQ) operations, steel sheets are
   austenitized in a furnace and then transferred to a cooled die, where
   they are simultaneously formed and quenched in a single stroke. In this
   process Usibor (R) 1500P, a 22MnB5 steel, is used which has an Al-Si
   coating for oxidation protection. Detailed quantitative knowledge of the
   austenitization kinetics of these blanks during reheating is crucial in
   optimizing the amount of heat transfer exchange required in this
   industrial process in order to ensure the part is fully austenitized and
   able to achieve the desired high-strength, fully martensitic properties
   after forming. The purpose of this study is to develop an experimental
   database to quantitatively model the austenitization process during
   reheating of the steel blank in a roller-hearth furnace. To conduct this
   study, industrially produced Usibor (R) coupons were heated using a
   Gleeble (R) 3500 thermomechanical simulator to a range of temperatures
   and held isothermally for a period of time. The dilation of the test
   coupons was measured as an indirect way to quantify the austenitization
   kinetics. Using the measured data, the resulting austenitizaiton curves
   were modelled using a JMAK phase transformation model. Scheil's
   additivity rule was also applied so that the non-isothermal
   austenitization phase transformation associated with a range of
   different heating rates could also be quantified and compared to
   experimental measurements.}},

   the origins of incomplete austenitization of patched blanks, and
   evaluates several candidate remediation strategies. Detailed heat
   transfer models of single gage and patched blanks are derived and used
   to predict the occurrence of incomplete austenitization. Various
   strategies to optimize the heating process for patched blanks are
   proposed and evaluated, including the use of a high emissivity coating

Abstract = {{Tailoring material properties in hot-formed die-quenched (HFDQ)
   body-in-white components introduces a combination of strong martensitic
   structures and other softer, more ductile daughter phases such as
   bainite, ferrite, and pearlite. Most tailoring efforts have focused on
   controlling the localized quenching rate during the forming stage
   through selective heating and cooling of the forming dies. This work
   presents an alternative, based on direct contact heating, in which
   tailoring is achieved through nonuniform austenitization during the
   heating stage of HFDQ. Experiments carried out on Usibor (R) 1500P
   coupons show that the as-formed hardness and yield strength are
   comparable to the furnace-treated samples, with a well-defined
   transition from martensite to softer phases.}},

Abstract = {{A tailored hot stamping was developed using the in-die heating
   tailoring, process. A segmented die-set was used to hot stamp a
   hat-sectioned rail, in which the flanges of the rail were tailored due
   to the heated die regions. During hot stamping, the steady-state heated
   die temperature was varied at 400 degrees C and 600 degrees C. In
   addition, a fully cooled die was considered to produce a fully hardened
   part. Vickers hardness measurements, uniaxial tensile tests and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) testing was conducted on the tailored regions
   to reveal that a 400 degrees C heated die resulted in an as-formed
   microstructure consisting of bainite and martensite at a hardness of 354
   HVi000. The resulting average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and total
   elongation for this material condition was 1120 MPa and 0.10 strain,
   respectively. Elevating the heated die temperature to 600 degrees C
   resulted in a predominantly ferritic as-formed tailored microstructure
   with some bainite and a small area fraction of martensite (or other hard
   phase). The measured hardness of this material condition was 221 HV1000.
   The tensile properties of the tailored regions were excellent from a
   crash energy absorption perspective with an average UTS and total
   elongation of 717 MPa and 0.22 strain, respectively. The hardness and
   tensile properties of the tailored regions were examined from multiple
   replicate parts and the excellent repeatability of the measured hardness
   and stress-strain curves indicated that the in-die heating process
   developed in this work was repeatable.}},

Abstract = {{Future small cells are expected to be energy-efficient and utilize green
   technologies. To this end, a promising solution is to employ automatic
   energy harvesting techniques, such as power splitting (PS) which
   harvests energy from ambient radio frequency (RF) signals in modern
   communication systems. In this paper, optimization on PS ratio design is
   investigated to maximize the average harvested energy in the context of
   general largescale K-tier heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs).
   Specifically, coverage probabilities and average energy harvesting
   expressions are derived with the stochastic geometry treatment to
   elucidate the performance of future green networks. Then optimal fixed
   PS ratios for each tier are obtained under coverage performance
   constraints. Moreover, with receivers' position information effortlessly
   provided in future networks, a dynamic location-based PS ratio design
   (DLPS) is proposed to further enhance the energy harvesting performance.
   Simulation results are given to demonstrate that the average harvested
   energy is effectively increased by more than 30\% when coverage
   probability requirement is greater than 0.7 by our proposed DLPS
   compared with the optimal fixed PS ratio while maintaining the coverage
   performance. Furthermore, rather than drawing the conclusions about the
   merits of our PS strategy, this work is to provide a tractable
   analytical framework for addressing the energy harvesting issues in such
   HCNs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of an interrupted pulse
   electromagnetic (EM) expanding ring experiment to study the high rate
   properties of AA5182 aluminum commercial sheet alloys at strain rates in
   excess of 5,000 s(-1). Experiments are performed to compare two commonly
   adopted methods of driving the expanding ring: EM expansion versus an
   exploding wire. After studying and testing both methods, it was
   determined that EM expansion had the greatest potential for being
   developed into a test that would result in free-flight of the samples.
   By interrupting the current pulse in the EM expanding ring test, the
   ring is allowed to achieve free-flight, thus eliminating the need to
   determine the induced EM forces and significantly reducing the
   uncertainty of the stress-strain behaviour determined from the test.
   Once the free-flight condition is established, the stress-strain
   behaviour of the material is determined from the free-flight
   deceleration of the sample, as calculated from the velocity measured
   using a Photon Doppler Velocimeter (PDV). Results are presented for
   AA5182 at strains rates between 1,000 to 5,500 s(-1) and exhibit low
   strain rate sensitivity, are comparable to tensile split-Hopkinson bar
   results at strain rates of 1,000 s(-1).}},

   validated in this work to perform high strain rate shear testing.
   Digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were employed to measure the
   strains in the experiments, and a criterion to detect the onset of
   fracture based on the hardening rate of the materials is proposed. At
   equivalent strains greater than 20\%, the DP600 and AA5182 alloys
   demonstrated a reduced work hardening rate at elevated strain rates. At
   lower strains, the DP600 shows positive rate sensitivity while the
   AA5182 was not sensitive to strain rate. For both alloys, the equivalent
   fracture strain and elongation to failure decreased with strain rate. A
   conversion of the shear stress to an equivalent stress using the von
   Mises yield criterion provided excellent agreement with the results from
   tensile tests at elevated strain rates. Unlike the tensile test, the
   shear test is not limited by the onset of necking so the equivalent

Abstract = {{Integration of renewable energy sources and Electric Vehicles (EVs) into
   smart grids comes with significant challenges. The uncertainty of the
   short-term forecasted energy from renewable sources increases the
   variability of the net-load in the grid. Also, EVs' charging could
   exacerbate the load peak in the grid if charging is not coordinated. In
   this work, firstly, we study the impact of the variability of renewable
   sources on the short-term forecast of the net-load in the electric grid,
   and a model of the net-load forecast error is developed. Secondly, a
   novel online charging algorithm for EVs is proposed not only to shift
   EVs' load from the system peak period to more desirable period, but also
   to decrease the variability of the net-load in the grid. Simulation
   results show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional scheduling
   algorithms which optimize the overall load in the system based on
   short-term load forecast.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of sea ice have proven to be very
   useful toward classification of ice cover into ice types. However, using
   SAR images to separate the marginal ice zone (MIZ) from consolidated ice
   and open water has not been explicitly considered before. One typical
   feature of MIZ is that it is more dynamic than consolidated ice, and
   includes floes, fast and thin ice or ice eddies. The current paper
   utilizes the dynamic feature of MIZ to investigate a curvelet-based
   feature extraction method in order to classify a SAR image into open
   water, dynamic ice and consolidated ice, as a first step toward using
   SAR imagery to identify the MIZ. An experiment of 10-fold cross
   validation is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed feature
   extraction method is effective. Finally, an SVM classifier is used on a
   SAR image to test the performance of the curvelet-based feature. The
   result shows that curvelet-based feature can classify the dynamic ice
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Although many state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithms use keyframes to
   help alleviate the computational requirements of performing online
   bundle adjustment, little consideration is taken for specific keyframe
   selection. In this work, we propose two entropy based methods which aim
   to insert keyframes that will directly improve the system's ability to
   localize. The first approach inserts keyframes based on the cumulative
   point entropy reduction in the existing map, while the second approach
   uses the predicted point flow discrepancy to select keyframes which best
   initializes new features for the camera to track against in the future.
   We implement the proposed methods within the Multi-Camera Parallel
   Mapping and Tracking framework, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   methods using ground truth data collected using an indoor positioning
   system.}},

   profile from the scattered field measured outside scatterers by
   minimizing the non-radiating objective function using Monte Carlo
   approach. Since the non-radiating objective function is inherently
   non-linear as reported in {[}1], it is necessary to use some random
   perturbation to prevent the permittivity profile estimation from getting
   trapped in a local minimum. To do so, we have employed a Monte Carlo
   approach to minimize the non-radiating objective function by searching
   over the solution space. The results indicate the Monte Carlo approach
   can converge to the correct profile despite the existence of a few local
   minima within the solution space.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we perform a detailed study to compare tunable matching
   networks and tunable antenna elements. The study is mainly focused on
   ascertaining which method will help achieve the design targets in terms
   of system capabilities for transmitting and receiving RF power. For this
   study we use a practical M2M device that is currently certified with
   multiple carriers in North America {[}1]. We used both radiated power
   and return loss to study system performance. Both simulation and
   measurement results revealed that in the low frequency band, the
   performance with tunable matching network was better than the
   performance with aperture tuning. This is valid for power accepted and
   radiated by the antenna. In the high frequency band, the power accepted
   by the antenna is improved in the case of the tunable matching network
   over the aperture tuning method; however, the power radiated was lower.
   This is due to losses introduced by the reactive elements used in the
   matching network.}},

Abstract = {{Screen content is typically composed of computer generated text and
   graphics. The contents shown on the screen exhibit various unnatural
   properties, such as sharp edges and thin lines with few color
   variations. In this paper we design a novel structure-induced quality
   metric (SIQM) for assessing the screen image quality. The proposed SIQM
   works by weighting the benchmark structural similarity index (SSIM) with
   the structural degradation measurement that is computed using SSIM as
   well. Experimental results conducted on the newly released subjective
   quality database concerning screen images show that on one hand the
   proposed technique is superior to existing quality measures, and on the
   other hand our model is able to optimize screen video coding and thus
   introduce remarkable visual quality improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a state estimator based on the use of a particle
   filter (PF). Unlike other types of filters, a PF is suitable for both
   nonlinear systems and non-Gaussian error distributions. The
   proliferation of distributed energy resources such as distributed
   generators and controllable loads has been accompanied by a high degree
   of uncertainty because the lack of sensors necessitates the use of
   pseudo-measurements rather than real measurements. For this reason, the
   proposed state estimator was tested using non-accurate measurements. Bus
   voltages and angles were chosen as state variables. A comparison of the
   PF with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) on a 5-node distribution system
   revealed that the PF provides a very high level of performance, superior
   to that obtained with the EKF. The proposed estimator was further tested
   on an IEEE 34-node.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of large interconnected power systems can be
   provided by wide-area measurement systems. Motivated by this, the use of
   on-line techniques has been developed, as well as multivariate methods
   have been proposed to extract useful patterns from a large data set. In
   this paper, a multivariable technique to identify and extract dynamic
   patterns from simultaneously measured data is proposed. One dynamic
   pattern or a limited set of dynamic patterns can be sequentially
   extracted. The technique combines blind source extraction with a
   recursive least squares adaptive filter, which exploits the temporal
   structure of the measured signals. In order to show the applicability of
   the proposed methodology, a numerical simulation of a four-machine,
   two-area test system is carried out. Results indicate that the method
   has the ability to estimate modal responses and mode shapes.}},

   the Monte Carlo simulations and the fuzzy expert system are then merged
   to determine the optimum time window for conductor replacement.
   Comparison of the model prediction and field data collected using

Abstract = {{The SAT-TSP language was recently proposed {[}1] for expressing and
   solving high-level robotic path planning problems. In this paper we show
   how different constraints that commonly appear in path planning
   problems, such as set constraints, counting constraints, and ordering
   constraints can all be expressed in the SAT-TSP language. We also show
   how the language can be used to express multi-robot path planning
   problems. We evaluate our existing solver approaches on test problems
   that include a variety of complex constraints and we demonstrate the
   language through a ROS implementation. We also provide a new approach
   that reduces the SAT-TSP language to the generalized traveling salesman
   problem language. We show that this new approach outperforms our
   existing approaches on problems that contain one-on-a-set constraints.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{469-477}},
Abstract = {{There has been significant interest in the use of fully connected
   graphical models and deep-structured graphical models for the purpose of
   structured inference. However, fully connected and deep-structured
   graphical models have been largely explored independently, leaving the
   unification of these two concepts ripe for exploration. A fundamental
   challenge with unifying these two types of models is in dealing with
   computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility
   of unifying fully connected and deep-structured models in a
   computationally tractable manner for the purpose of structured
   inference. To accomplish this, we introduce a deep-structured fully
   connected random field (DFRF) model that integrates a series of
   intermediate sparse autoencoding layers placed between state layers to
   significantly reduce the computational complexity. The problem of image
   segmentation was used to illustrate the feasibility of using the DFRF
   for structured inference in a computationally tractable manner. Results
   in this paper show that it is feasible to unify fully connected and
   deep-structured models in a computationally tractable manner for solving
   structured inference problems such as image segmentation.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{709-717}},
Abstract = {{Multiscale decomposition has been an invaluable tool for the processing
   of physiological signals. Much focus on multiscale decomposition for
   processing such signals have been based on scale-space theory and
   wavelet transforms. In this paper, we take a different perspective on
   multiscale decomposition by investigating the feasibility of utilizing a
   Bayesian-based method for multiscale signal decomposition called
   Bayesian residual transform (BRT) for the purpose of physiological
   signal processing. In BRT, a signal is modeled as the summation of
   residual signals, each characterizing information from the signal at
   different scales. A deep cascading framework is introduced as a
   realization of the BRT. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis using
   electrocardiography signals was used to illustrate the feasibility of
   using the BRT for suppressing the noise in physiological signals.
   Results in this paper show that it is feasible to utilize the BRT for
   processing physiological signals for tasks, such as noise suppression.}},

Title = {{Prostate Cancer Detection via a Quantitative Radiomics-Driven
   Conditional Random Field Framework}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{2531-2541}},
Abstract = {{The use of high-volume quantitative radiomics features extracted from
   multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) is gaining
   attraction for the autodetection of prostate tumors, since it provides a
   plethora of mineable data, which can be used for both detection and
   prognosis of prostate cancer. While current voxel-resolution
   radiomics-driven prostate tumor detection approaches utilize
   quantitative radiomics features associated with individual voxels on an
   independent basis, the incorporation of additional information regarding
   the spatial and radiomics feature relationships between voxels has
   significant potential for achieving a more reliable detection
   performance. Motivated by this, we present a novel approach for
   automatic prostate cancer detection using a radiomics-driven conditional
   random field (RD-CRF) framework. In addition to the high-throughput
   extraction and utilization of a comprehensive set of voxel-level
   quantitative radiomics features, the proposed RD-CRF framework leverages
   inter-voxel spatial and radiomics feature relationships to ensure that
   the autodetected tumor candidates exhibit interconnected tissue
   characteristics reflective of cancerous tumors. We evaluated the
   performance of the proposed framework using clinical prostate MP-MRI
   data of 20 patients, and the results of RD-CRF framework demonstrated a
   clear improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art in quantitative
   radiomics for automatic voxel-resolution prostate cancer detection.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2520}},
Pages = {{8-17}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the influence of on-street bike lanes on the
   lateral separation between motor vehicles and cyclists when the vehicle
   overtakes the cyclist and investigates the relationship between the
   passing behavior and traffic conditions. A bicycle was instrumented with
   a sensor array that consisted of an ultrasonic sensor, a GPS receiver,
   and a video camera. A total of 5,227 passing events were recorded across
   different categories of urban arterials. The results showed that the
   facilities with on-street bike lanes provided greater separation between
   bicycles and motor vehicles. Passing maneuvers with lateral separation
   of less than 1,000 mm (3.30 ft) were observed less frequently on the
   facilities with on-street bike lanes. Further, it was found that, in the
   absence of a bike lane, a higher proportion of passing vehicles moved
   laterally to the left and encroached on the adjacent lane. The analysis
   showed that for arterial roadways without on-street bike lanes, drivers
   tended to provide increased lateral clearance by either changing lanes
   or encroaching on the adjacent lane. However, drivers' ability to
   perform either of these maneuvers may be restricted by surrounding
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{In areas such as computer software and hardware, manufacturing systems
   and transportation, engineers encounter networks with arbitrarily large
   numbers of isomorphic subprocesses. Parameterized discrete event systems
   (PDES) provide a framework for modeling such networks. The analysis of
   PDES is a challenge as some key properties such as nonblocking and
   deadlock-freedom are undecidable. Previously we have established a
   procedure for deadlock analysis of a parameterized ring network of
   isomorphic subprocesses. Here we consider a network consisting of
   several parameterized sections with a more general topology. To model
   these networks we introduce Generalized Parameterized Discrete Event
   Systems (GPDES). The difficulty in analysis of a GPDES is the fact that
   some of the subprocesses interact with several parameterized sections of
   the network. Hence the analysis proposed in this paper involves careful
   study of interaction among different branches of the network. We
   investigate interactions among different components of the network,
   using a dependency graph. The dependency graph is a directed graph
   developed to characterize reachable deadlocks of proposed GPDES.}},

Abstract = {{We study state estimation of linear systems with unknown inputs. When
   the system is not strongly observable (strongly detectable), one cannot
   exactly (asymptotically) reconstruct the states without further
   information about the system or inputs; in this case, various
   formulations have been studied that require additional information about
   the nature of the unknown inputs (e.g., Kalman filtering and
   set-membership filtering). In this paper, we consider a formulation
   where the unknown inputs and initial condition of the system are bounded
   in magnitude. The objective is to construct an unknown input
   norm-observer which estimates an upper bound for the norm of the states.
   In order to characterize the existence of such an observer, we propose a
   notion of bounded-input-bounded-output-bounded-state (BIBOBS) stability;
   this concept supplements various system properties, including
   detectability, bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stability,
   bounded-input-bounded-state (BIBS) stability, and input-output-to-state
   stability (IOSS). We provide checkable conditions on the system matrices
   under which a general class of linear systems is BIBOBS stable, and show
   that the set of modes of the system with magnitude 1 plays a key role.}},

   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The SVFC is composed of a simple
   circuit architecture which measures the charge transferred over half an

Abstract = {{We present a deployment strategy for Error (slack-deficit) Detection
   Sequential (EDS) circuits to monitor non-critical paths of application
   systems at the clock falling edges, requiring neither buffer insertions
   nor extra clocks. The proposed strategy is applied to an FPGA-based
   Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) unit together with EDS and Dynamic
   Voltage Scaling (DVS) circuits as a proof of concept. It is able to
   speculatively and accurately detect slack-deficits due to dynamic
   process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations and correspondingly
   adjust the supply voltage. When processing realistic input data and
   operating at the same frequency as a highly-optimized baseline DCT
   implementation, our design produces equivalent outputs and incurs a
   0.3\% logic element overhead and 3.5\% maximum frequency degradation,
   but saves up to 16.5\% energy.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of bond geometry on bond strength and reliability is studied
   for 25 mu m Au wire bonds on standard CMOS Al pads. An accelerated
   method for parameter optimization is used to produce ball bonds with
   optimized shear strength (SS) and target values for ball diameter of
   56.5 mu m, bonded ball height (BH) of 12 mu m, 16 mu m, and 20 mu m for
   low, medium, and high BH, respectively. Low BH bonds achieve 126.1 MPa
   strength and endure up to 41.9\% US before deformation begins, whereas
   high BH bonds achieve only 109.8 MPa strength and withstand a maximum of
   39.8\% US. Low BH bonds achieve higher SS possibly due to the higher
   level of US that can be used. Bond reliability is assessed
   non-destructively in high temperature storage (HTS) tests using
   piezoresistive stress sensors. The bonds are aged at 200 degrees C for
   similar to 500 h. From features in the stress sensor signals, a
   characteristic time (t(c)) is derived during aging using an improved
   method. The t(c) value indicates the time it takes for the bonds to
   degrade severely due to intermetallics and crack formation. The t(c)
   values for low, medium, and high BH bonds were found to be 199.9+/-8.7
   h, 225.9+/-9.5 h, and 231.9+/-6.8 h respectively. The result suggests
   ball bonds with higher BH values are more reliable than the bonds with
   lower BH for a constant ball bond diameter. This result is corroborated
   by the SS before and after aging being the same for the high BH bonds
   whereas SS dropped by 3\% for the low BH bonds. The non-destructive
   method was demonstrated to have an estimated time resolution better than
   10 h which allows for precise comparisons of the reliability of various
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Searchable encryption is an important and challenging issue. It allows
   people to search on encrypted data. This is a very useful function when
   more and more people choose to host their data in the cloud and the
   cloud server is not fully trustable. Existing solutions for searchable
   encryption are only limited to some simple functions of search, such as
   boolean search or similarity search. In this paper, we propose a scheme
   for Generalized Pattern-matching String-search on Encrypted data (GPSE)
   in cloud systems. GPSE allows users to specify their search queries by
   using generalized wildcard-based string patterns (such as SQL-like
   patterns). It gives users great expressive power in specifying highly
   targeted search queries. In the framework of GPSE, we particularly
   implemented two most commonly used pattern matching search functions on
   encrypted data, the substring matching and the longest-prefixfirst
   matching. We also prove that GPSE is secure under the known-plaintext
   model. Experiments over real data sets show that GPSE achieves high
   search accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Social-based Mobile Sybil Detection (SMSD)
   scheme to detect Sybil attackers from their abnormal contacts and
   pseudonym changing behaviors. Specifically, we first define four levels
   of Sybil attackers in mobile environments according to their attacking
   capabilities. We then exploit mobile users' contacts and their pseudonym
   changing behaviors to distinguish Sybil attackers from normal users. To
   alleviate the storage and computation burden of mobile users, the cloud
   server is introduced to store mobile user's contact information and to
   perform the Sybil detection. Furthermore, we utilize a ring structure
   associated with mobile user's contact signatures to resist the contact
   forgery by mobile users and cloud servers. In addition, investigating
   mobile user's contact distribution and social proximity, we propose a
   semi-supervised learning with Hidden Markov Model to detect the colluded
   mobile users. Security analysis demonstrates that the SMSD can resist
   the Sybil attackers from the defined four levels, and the extensive
   trace-driven simulation shows that the SMSD can detect these Sybil
   attackers with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a soft+hard data fusion model is proposed that is capable
   of combining the data generated from human-based sources with those
   generated by physical sensors. The basis of this model is our previously
   introduced Fuzzy extension to the Mutli-Entity Bayesian Network (MEBN)
   language, which is a High-Level Information Fusion (HLIF) framework
   capable of expressing the semantic and causal relationships between the
   entities constituting a world model, as well as managing their ambiguity
   and uncertainty. In our proposed model, the unstructured soft data is
   presented by undergoing a novel soft-data-association process, through
   which the data is semantically analyzed, and accurately structured in a
   fuzzy random variable. Moreover, the clique tree inference algorithm for
   Bayesian Networks is modified to handle fuzzy evidence in Fuzzy-MEBN.
   The simulation results, in transportation domain, show that our improved
   HLIF model is capable of handling both soft and hard data, and
   consequently, provide the user with more precise situation assessment.}},

Abstract = {{If we are to fully understand the reasons that cells and tissues move
   and acquire their distinctive geometries during processes such as
   embryogenesis and wound healing, we will need detailed maps of the
   forces involved. One of the best current prospects for obtaining this
   information is noninvasive force-from-images techniques such as CellFIT,
   the Cellular Force Inference Toolkit, whose various steps are discussed
   here. Like other current quasistatic approaches, this one assumes that
   cell shapes are produced by interactions between interfacial tensions
   and intracellular pressures. CellFIT, however, allows cells to have
   curvilinear boundaries, which can significantly improve inference
   accuracy and reduce noise sensitivity. The quality of a CellFIT analysis
   depends on how accurately the junction angles and edge curvatures are
   measured, and a software tool we describe facilitates determination and
   evaluation of this information. Special attention is required when edges
   are crenulated or significantly different in shape from a circular arc.
   Because the tension and pressure equations are overdetermined, a select
   number of edges can be removed from the analysis, and these might
   include edges that are poorly defined in the source image, too short to
   provide accurate angles or curvatures, or noncircular. The approach
   works well for aggregates with as many as 1000 cells, and introduced
   errors have significant effects on only a few adjacent cells. An
   understanding of these considerations will help CellFIT users to get the
   most out of this promising new technique.}},

Abstract = {{Transformers installed in wind and solar power plants require specific
   design considerations in order to protect them from the adverse effects
   of voltage distortions. A number of manufacturers practice the
   implementation of electrostatic shields in transformer windings to
   filter the transferred voltages. Although this method has shown some
   improvements, effectiveness of the electrostatic shielding for a broad
   frequency range requires further studies. Through an experimental study,
   the effectiveness of electrostatic shielding in alleviating the transfer
   of high frequency distortions from LV winding to HV winding and vice
   versa. To compare the internal field enhancement at different
   frequencies in the presence and absence of an electrostatic shield, the
   frequency response of the voltage distributed inside the transformer's
   winding is also measured and analyzed. The results have shown that at
   some frequencies, the shield is beneficial in suppressing the stress,
   while at some other frequencies it amplifies the transferred voltages.}},

Abstract = {{Many components of the cathode play roles in self-discharge performance
   of the rechargeable hybrid aqueous battery (ReHAB). Effects of amount
   and type of conductive additives are investigated, and carbonaceous
   material of low specific surface area yields the best performance. The

   contains a reversible and an irreversible process. The reversible
   portion is predominant and related to lithium re-intercalation into the
   LiMn2O4 spinel framework, accompanied by Zn dissolution into the
   electrolyte. The irreversible portion of self-discharge possibly
   involves decomposition of LiMn2O4 in the acidic electrolyte, and is much
   less extensive than the reversible process. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

   Antennas}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A simple and effective dielectric rod antenna design approach based on
   geometric optics and modal analysis is presented. The tapered antennas
   from microwave to terahertz can be readily designed with the equations
   presented in this paper. The radius of antenna is determined by the
   desired traveling wave mode inside the antenna. The field inside the
   antenna consists of the fundamental mode and the second mode. For the
   end-fire operation, there is only the fundamental mode. The length of
   the antenna is designed based on geometric optics theory so that most of
   the traveling wave will be converted to the radiating field towards the
   output plane, avoiding reflection inside the antenna. Such antennas can
   achieve wide bandwidth. The gain increases with the length of the
   antenna as long as the diameters and length satisfy the conditions given
   in this paper. A number of antenna design examples with high gain and
   wide bandwidth are presented. The measurement results of a 130 GHz
   rectangular antenna with a length of 4 lambda show a bandwidth of 60 GHz
   and a gain of 12 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family plays an important

   and the mechanism of antigen-antibody binding action are under active

   Escherichia coli. In the present study, we report the optimization of
   anti-Her2 ScFv expression in an E. coli host of BL21 (DE3) pLysS using
   response surface methodology based on tuning of three cultivation
   variables, including isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
   concentration, temperature and post-induction time. A model for protein
   expression according to the Box-Behnken design predicted a maximal
   anti-Her2 ScFv expression at 37 degrees C, a post-induction time of
   10.45 h and 0.75 mM IPTG. In addition, strategies based on inclusion
   body isolation and affinity chromatography were applied to purify
   anti-Her2 ScFv. The purity of the final product for inclusion bodies
   isolation and purification by Ni-NTA resin were 70 \% and 95 \%,
   respectively. The solubilization of the inclusion bodies was carried out
   using two denaturant agents, guanidine hydrochloride and urea. The
   present study showed that guanidine hydrochloride was more effective
   than urea in solubilizing the inclusion bodies.}},

Abstract = {{A 0.6 V low energy 64 kb SRAM-based PUF macro protected with a multi-bit
   error correcting circuit is fabricated in a 28 nm LP-CMOS process. The
   static noise margin difference (Delta SNM) is proposed as a design-time
   cell asymmetry metric for characterizing bitcell PUF response
   reproducibility. The Delta SNM is then used in conjunction with a
   Pelgrom's model based design methodology to compare a set of eight 6T
   SRAM bitcells designed to operate over a 0.6 V to 1.0 V voltage range.
   Majority voting and data integrity masking is used to reduce the error
   correction parity-bit overhead by 65\% to yield 100\% reproducible PUF
   responses. Finally, measurement results over a set of five test chips
   show an average active access energy of 0.045 fJ/bit-cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Peer review of design progress and artifacts is not very common in
   engineering design education. Yet, the broader educational literature
   suggests that the impact of peer (novice) review can be superior to
   instructor (expert) only review in various ways. This paper describes a
   systematic implementation of face-to-face peer review in progress update
   meetings (PUMs) of a management engineering capstone design series of
   courses. In biweekly PUMs the instructors met jointly with two teams at
   a time, paired based on topic similarity. Teams took turns presenting to
   and critiquing each other's presentations and design progress. The
   format was well-received by students and was successful in increasing
   the diversity and wealth of knowledge teams could draw from during the
   meetings. A student survey revealed that students perceived that the
   regular joint PUMs encouraged them to maintain a steady progress in
   their design projects, facilitated peer-to-peer sharing of ideas, and
   were instrumental in helping teams improve on how they communicated
   their designs by providing multiple opportunities for revisions and
   refinement.}},

Abstract = {{A classifier fusion interactive software package has been constructed
   for implementing the classification task in the electromyographic (EMG)
   signal decomposition process using the MATLAB high-level programming
   language and its interactive environment. The package employs classifier
   fusion schemes of multiple classifier combination for the purpose of
   fusing the decisions of a set of heterogeneous base classifiers to make
   a final decision that achieves improved classification performance. The
   base classifiers used are ensembles of error-independent certainty,
   fuzzy k-NN, and template matched filter classifiers. The interactive
   package consists of several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to extract
   individual motor unit potential (MUP) waveforms from raw EMG signals;
   extract relevant features; classify MUPs into motor unit potential
   trains (MUPTs) using certainty-based, assertion-based, and
   similarity-based classifiers; and combine classifier decisions. The
   proposed software package is useful for enhancing the EMG signal
   analysis quality and providing a systematic approach to the EMG signal
   decomposition process. It worked as a very helpful environment for
   testing and evaluating algorithms developed for EMG signal decomposition

Abstract = {{Proposed in this work is the notion of spectral emotion profile. The
   purpose of spectral emotion profile is to highlight the spectral
   differences of individuals in expressing emotions, and to make use of
   those differences towards personalizing recognition of emotions in
   speech. To define spectral emotion profile, we have taken advantage of
   the spectral energy distribution as a set of speech features. To
   demonstrate the idea in a more sensible way, we have made use of two
   emotional speech datasets. Results of our experimental study based on
   the proposed notion of spectral emotion profile show how different
   spectral intervals of individual speakers, as well as those of different
   genders, vary in the amount to which they contribute to the expression
   of emotions. It is also shown that using spectral emotion profile
   results in higher prediction accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we investigate the use of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
   methods to identify parameters in a nonlinear model. The model, derived
   in earlier work, describes how a person behaves when he or she is
   offered a sequence of rewards to carry out a task for which his or her
   initial attitude is negative. A main conclusion of the paper is that EKF
   methods can be used to effectively estimate a single parameter, but due
   to observability problems, estimation of multiple parameters is
   ineffective. Monte Carlo simulations are used to thoroughly study the
   performance of the EKF-based estimator to estimate a parameter (related
   to cognitive dissonance that is experienced by the person making the
   decision) in cases where only 5, 10, or 20 data samples are available.
   In addition, preliminary experimental results, based on experiments with
   10 data samples, support the validity of the underlying model and
   demonstrate feasibility of the EKF approach for estimation of the
   cognitive-dissonance parameter, despite the small size of the data set.}},

   footprints of student activities and progress in terms of data such as
   demographics, grades, recruitment and performance, they cannot provide
   information about activities and interaction in the physical study and

   platform that will provide context aware information to students through
   the integration of learning analytics with data sensed using
   cyber-physical devices in order to provide a holistic view of the
   environments that universities offer to students. However, designing the
   interaction of students and staff in the smart university ecology of
   information and sensing devices requires an understanding of how they
   work as individuals, as members of teams and communities. Through two
   use cases we illustrate how insights obtained from social cognitive work
   analysis can be used for the design guidelines of the different

Abstract = {{The placement problem has become challenging due to a variety of
   complicated constraints imposed by modern process technologies. Some of
   the most challenging constraints were highlighted during the ISPD 2015
   placement contest and include fence region and target density
   constraints; these constraints are in addition to those issues that
   affect detailed routability such as pin shorts, pin access problems and
   cell spacing issues. These constraints not only make cell placement more
   difficult, but can impact the placement objectives such as wire length,
   routability and so forth. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
   technique to address fence region constraints in global placement and
   legalization while still considering detailed-routing issues. We combine
   concepts from image processing such as region coloring with parallel
   programming to efficiently deal with fence regions. We also introduce a
   heuristic method to adjust target densities while avoiding adverse
   effects on the quality of global routability. Numerical results using
   both the released and hidden benchmarks from the ISPD 2015 placement
   contest demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques.}},

   A demand management plan is specified and incorporated into the two-step

   plan is able to lead to a further increase of the aggregated net

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Abstract = {{Base-year floor space data are essential for integrated land use
   transport models. This information has traditionally been estimated on
   the basis of limited population or employment data provided by the
   census, with unknown accuracy. Advances in geographic information
   systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology enable the accuracy of this
   conventional method to be evaluated with geographic data of high
   precision. This study assessed the accuracy of the census-based approach
   in estimating base-year floor space data; the paper describes the use of
   a hybrid method that combines lidar and geographic vector data (referred
   to as the ``lidar-GIS method{''}) to develop a ground truth building
   floor space database for the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.
   A ground survey proved that the developed ground truth building data set
   provided highly accurate estimates of building heights, footprint areas,
   and therefore floor space. Through a case study, the floor space at the
   dissemination area level estimated with the traditional census-based
   method was compared with the floor space estimated with the lidar-GIS
   method for various land use categories. The results showed that for the
   residential floor space estimation, the average absolute percentage
   error of the census-based approach was 15\%. The accuracy of the
   conventional method was much lower for nonresidential land use
   categories, with average errors of 50\% or higher. These statistics
   indicate that the traditional census-based approach is unreliable and
   inaccurate for use in the estimation of base-year floor space and
   suggests that a method that incorporates the above-mentioned modern
   information technologies be used.}},

   the CALPUFF modeling system. Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) data
   for the full year of 2012 was used with CALMET to model the

   to summarize the hourly, daily, and monthly simulation results and
   produce monthly average contour plots of the plume trajectory of PM10.
   The highest 2012 average hourly, daily and monthly concentrations

   the contrary, the highest average hourly, daily and monthly
   concentrations were found to be the lowest out of all months at

Abstract = {{Multispectral sensing is specifically designed to provide quantitative
   spectral information about various materials or scenes. Using spectral
   information, various properties of objects can be measured and analysed.
   Microscopy, the observing and imaging of objects at the micron- or
   nano-scale, is one application where multispectral sensing can be
   advantageous, as many fields of science and research that use microscopy
   would benefit from observing a specimen in multiple wavelengths.
   Multispectral microscopy is available, but often requires the operator
   of the device to switch filters which is a labor intensive process.
   Furthermore, the need for filter switching makes such systems
   particularly limiting in cases where the sample contains live species
   that are constantly moving or exhibit transient phenomena. Direct
   methods for capturing multispectral data of a live sample simultaneously
   can also be challenging for microscopy applications as it requires an
   elaborate optical systems design which uses beamsplitters and a number
   of detectors proportional to the number of bands sought after. Such
   devices can therefore be quite costly to build and difficult to
   maintain, particularly for microscopy. In this paper, we present the
   concept of virtual spectral demultiplexing imaging (VSDI) microscopy for
   low-cost in-situ multispectral microscopy of transient phenomena. In
   VSDI microscopy, the spectral response of a color detector in the
   microscope is characterized and virtual spectral demultiplexing is
   performed on the simultaneously-acquired broadband detector measurements
   based on the developed spectral characterization model to produce
   microscopic imagery at multiple wavelengths. The proposed VSDI
   microscope was used to observe colorful nanowire arrays at various
   wavelengths simultaneously to illustrate its efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{How to deliver videos to consumers over the network for optimal
   quality-of-experience (QoE) has been the central goal of modern video
   delivery services. Surprisingly, regardless of the large volume of
   videos being delivered everyday through various systems attempting to
   improve visual QoE, the actual QoE of end consumers is not properly
   assessed, not to say using QoE as the key factor in making critical
   decisions at the video hosting, network and receiving sites. Real-world
   video streaming systems typically use bitrate as the main video
   presentation quality indicator, but using the same bitrate to encode
   different video content could result in drastically different visual
   QoE, which is further affected by the display device and viewing
   condition of each individual consumer who receives the video. To correct
   this, we have to put QoE back to the driver's seat and redesign the
   video delivery systems. To achieve this goal, a major challenge is to
   find an objective video presentation QoE predictor that is accurate,
   fast, easy-to-use, display device adaptive, and provides meaningful QoE
   predictions across resolution and content. We propose to use the newly
   developed SSIMplus index (https ://ece.uwaterloo.ca/similar to
   z70wang/research/ssimplus/) for this role. We demonstrate that based on
   SSIMplus, one can develop a smart adaptive video streaming strategy that
   leads to much smoother visual QoE impossible to achieve using existing
   adaptive bitrate video streaming approaches. Furthermore, SSIMplus finds
   many more applications, in live and file-based quality monitoring, in
   benchmarking video encoders and transcoders, and in guiding network
   resource allocations.}},

Abstract = {{Polarimetry is a common technique used in chemistry for solution
   characterization and analysis, giving insight into the molecular
   structure of a solution measured through the rotation of linearly
   polarized light. This rotation is characterized by the Boits law.
   Without large optical path lengths, or high concentrations of solution,
   these optical rotations are typically very small, requiring elaborate
   and costly apparatuses. To ensure that the rotation measurements are
   accurate, these devices usually perform complex optical procedures or
   time-averaged point measurements to ensure that any intensity variation
   seen is a product of optical rotation and not from inherent noise
   sources in the system, such as sensor or shot noise. Time averaging is a
   lengthy process and rarely utilizes all of the information available on
   the sensor. To this end, we have developed a novel integrated,
   miniature, computational imaging system that enhances polarimetric
   measurements by taking advantage of the full spot size observed on an
   array detector. This computational imaging system is capable of using a
   single acquisition at unity gain to enhance the polarimetric
   measurements using a probabilistic framework, which accounts for
   inherent noise and optical characteristics in the acquisition process,
   to take advantage of spatial intensity relations. This approach is
   faster than time-averaging methods and can better account for any
   measurement uncertainties. In preliminary experiments, this system has
   produced comparably consistent measurements across multiple trials with
   the same chemical solution than time averaging techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The peak blood velocity is a parameter of high medical interest, which
   is used, for example, in the determination of carotid stenosis grade.
   The standard approach, which typically exploits the maximum frequency
   detectable in the Doppler spectrum, is prone to two main sources of
   errors: the ambiguity of the Doppler angle and the spectral broadening.
   A novel method, based on a mathematical model, was recently introduced
   and shown to be unaffected by the spectral broadening. The method
   directly measures the maximum velocity component in a large sample
   volume that includes all the vessel section. Furthermore, its
   combination with a vector Doppler approach allows automatically
   correcting for the angle. This technique produced good results when
   verified in straight tubes, but tests in a more realistic configuration
   are necessary for an accurate validation. In this work, the proposed
   technique is compared against 2 already validated methods by
   investigating the common and internal branches of an anthropomorphic
   phantom, which mimics a carotid bifurcation with a 50\% stenosis on the
   internal artery.}},

Abstract = {{Image deconvolution is an important post-processing methodology allowing
   a substantial improvement it terms of both the resolution and contrast
   of medical ultrasound scans. Unfortunately, the intrinsic
   bandlimitedness of ultrasound scanners renders the problem of image
   deconvolution ill-posed, and, as a result, the latter rarely admits a
   stable and unique solution, unless properly regularized. To be
   successful, the regularization needs to properly reflect the actual
   reflectivity properties of insonified tissues. Unfortunately, the
   inherent complexity of biological tissues makes it extremely difficult
   (if at all possible) to justify the use of a single statistical model
   for the description of their acoustic reflectivity structure. Thus, for
   example, Gaussian and Laplacian statistical priors can provide adequate
   description of the characteristics of diffusive scattering and specular
   reflection, respectively, while yielding inaccurate estimates when
   either of the two is used exclusively for concurrent description of both
   reflectively types. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to use a
   concomitant scale estimation framework, which allows one to learn the
   parameters of a prior model along with its associated reflectivity
   properties directly from the data. The proposed method is formulated in
   the form of a convex optimization problem that admits a unique and
   efficiently computable solution.}},

Abstract = {{We show how the fuel efficiency of heavy mining trucks can be improved

   Dynamic programming was used to optimise the low-order model of the
   specialised off-road 30-tonne truck over a fixed route in a mining area.
   There were two competing objectives: fuel use and trip time, which were
   combined in a single objective function using weighting coefficients. A
   Pareto curve was created to analyse the effect of the weights on the
   fuel use and trip time. Applying the control strategy obtained from
   dynamic programming to the high-fidelity model, it is estimated that

Abstract = {{A sensor based method for detecting and locating defects and/or flaws in
   coated metallic surfaces is investigated. This method involves
   non-destructive testing and evaluation of such surfaces under coating
   layers, using arrays of small microwave resonators. Four numerical
   sensor models were built for structural health monitoring of coated
   aluminum structures. Considering the implemented resonators were
   designed to resonate at different frequencies and arranged in an array
   scheme, not only were defects identified but also their position,
   direction, and length. For the reason that each resonator in the array
   of the proposed sensors was designed to work at a specific frequency for
   defect-free structures, the sensors' overall response patterns are
   subject to perturbation based on the existence of defects and/or flaws
   in their surrounding environment. This pattern change in the data
   collected by the proposed models makes detecting and locating defects
   using pattern-recognition models a practical solution. Consequently, the
   second contribution of this work is integrating artificial intelligent
   models with the proposed sensors for detecting and locating defects

Abstract = {{Product lines are an established framework for software design. They are
   specified by special diagrams called feature models. For formal
   analysis, the latter are usually encoded by propositional theories with
   Boolean semantics. We discuss a major deficiency of this semantics, and
   show that it can be fixed by considering that a product is an
   instantiation process rather than its final result. We call intermediate
   states of this process partial products, and argue that what a feature
   model M really defines is a poset of partial products called a partial
   product line, PPL(M). We argue that such PPLs can be viewed as special
   partial product Kripke structures (ppKS) specifiable by a suitable
   version of CTL (partial product CTL or ppCTL). We show that any feature
   model M is representable by a ppCTL theory Phi(M) such that for any ppKs
   K, K satisfies Phi(M) iff K = PPL(M); hence, Phi(M) is a sound and
   complete representation of the feature model.}},

Abstract = {{Organic contaminants and corrosion in water treatment effluents are a
   current global problem and the development of effective methods to
   facilitate the removal of organic contaminants and corrosion control
   strategies are required to mitigate this problem. TiO2 nanomaterials
   that are exposed to UV light can generate electron-hole pairs, which
   undergo redox reactions to produce hydroxyl radicals from adsorbed
   molecular oxygen. They hydroxyl radicals are able to oxidize organic
   contaminants in water. This same process can be used in conjunction to
   protect metals from corrosion via cathodic polarization. In this work,
   TiO2 nanomaterials were synthesized and electrophoretically deposited on
   conductive substrates to serve as films or membranes. An illuminated
   TiO2 film on a conductive surface served as the photoanode and assisted
   in the cathodic protection of stainless steel (SS304) and the
   degradation of organic pollutants, in this case glucose. This
   proof-of-concept relied on photoelectrochemical experiments conducted
   using a potentiostat and a xenon lamp illumination source. The
   open-circuit potential changes that determine whether a metal is
   protected from corrosion under illumination was observed; and the
   electrical characteristics of the TiO2 film or membrane under dark and
   arc lamp illumination conditions were also analyzed. Furthermore, the
   effect of organic contaminants on the photocathodic protection mechanism
   and the oxidation of glucose during this process were explored.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent imaging, often synonymous with microscopic imaging, is an
   imaging modality whereby various features of a target are observed based
   on assignment of chemical labels. These labels are in most cases
   indirect tracers of specific structures or chemical compounds which
   cannot be otherwise identified. The tracers are excited by an
   illuminating source and they in turn emit light at specific wavelengths.
   This light is then captured by an imaging device and represented as an
   indirect observation of the specific feature in the sample. The process
   of excitation and imaging of the emitted light is performed sequentially
   and is proportional to the number of tracers or fluorescence species
   present in the sample. We present an imaging system that can image
   fluorescent tracers, in the visible and the near Infra-red,
   simultaneously. This system is capable of illuminating the target with
   different excitation light sources and capture the corresponding
   fluorescence images in one snapshot using a series of mirrors to capture
   different views of the sample. The simultaneously captured image are
   fused using a computational reconstruction process to present a coherent
   multispectral fluorescence image. The system is proposed for use in
   applications where the rapid enumeration of fluorescent species in a
   large field of view is paramount as opposed to their microscopic image
   in a narrow field of view. The system was tested using a controlled
   cocktail solution of four different types fluorescent microspheres and
   was able to enumerate the microspheres based on their different
   fluorescent signatures as captured by the system.}},

Abstract = {{Safe drinking water is essential for human health, yet over a billion
   people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water. Due to the
   presence and accumulation of biological contaminants in natural waters
   (e.g., pathogens and neuro-, hepato-, and cytotoxins associated with
   algal blooms) remain a critical challenge in the provision of safe
   drinking water globally. It is not financially feasible and practical to
   monitor and quantify water quality frequently enough to identify the
   potential health risk due to contamination, especially in developing
   countries. We propose a low-cost, small-profile multispectral (MS)
   system based on Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) and investigate
   methods for rapidly capturing holographic data of natural water samples.
   We have developed a test-bed for an MSDHM instrument to produce and
   capture holographic data of the sample at different wavelengths in the
   visible and the near Infra-red spectral region, allowing for resolution
   improvement in the reconstructed images. Additionally, we have developed
   high-speed statistical signal processing and analysis techniques to
   facilitate rapid reconstruction and assessment of the MS holographic
   data being captured by the MSDHM instrument. The proposed system is used
   to examine cyanobacteria as well as Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts which
   remain important and difficult to treat microbiological contaminants
   that must be addressed for the provision of safe drinking water
   globally.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-known that hole transport layers (HTLs) in organic light
   emitting devices (OLEDs) are more sensitive to morphological changes
   than other organic layers due to the lower glass transition
   temperatures. A high operational temperature can alter the HTL
   morphology, severely impacting OLED performance and stability. Although
   joule heating is a known factor affecting OLED stability during
   operation, its effect in experimental studies is typically simulated
   through thermal annealing of the devices rather than applying current.
   In this work, a comparison of the effects of joule heating vs thermal
   annealing on the morphological stability of
   N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (NPB) and N,
   N'-Dicarbazolyl-4,4'-biphenyl (CBP) HTLs and the impact this has on OLED
   performance is investigated. While thermal annealing of an OLED can be
   used as an approximation of joule heating, the temperature distribution
   profile of the OLED is different under the two stress conditions and
   thus can impact the morphology of the HTL differently. However, joule
   heating introduces a confounding factor whereby the OLEDs experience
   intrinsic degradation by the flow of current, aside from thermal stress.
   Therefore, in this work, joule heating is studied in unipolar devices
   that comprise solely of the HTL. Device JVL and morphology as a function
   of temperature for both joule heating and thermal annealing are
   presented as a means to evaluate stability and performance.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) is shown to
   significantly depend on both the thickness and roughness of the indium
   tin oxide (ITO) anode. The effects of changing the ITO thickness from 45
   nm to 130 nm are found to be able to vary the current efficiency by
   40\%. The underlying mechanism is studied and revealed to be related to
   microcavity effects. The transmittance of the ITO substrate changes
   significantly with the ITO thickness, resulting in variations in
   microcavity, and thus light outcoupling efficiency. On the other hand,
   the effects of increasing the ITO roughness (rms) from 3.3 nm to 8.5 nm
   are found to increase light scattering at the ITO/organic interface,
   thus improving extraction of light trapped in the organic/ITO
   wave-guided mode. In addition to the enhancement in current efficiency,
   the device fabricated on rough ITO shows similar driving voltage to that
   made on smooth ITO, indicating that charge balance is not altered by ITO
   roughness. Contrary to common belief in the community, the lifetime of
   the OLED is not affected when using rough ITO. The results demonstrate
   the significant efficiency benefits of using ITO with optimal
   thicknesses and higher roughness in OLEDs.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) for the very first time were converted
   into highly porous nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanorods that display
   promising capacitive performance as electrode materials for
   supercapacitors. CNCs were used as both a carbon source and a template
   for the controlled-growth of the N precursor to form
   melamine-formaldehyde (MF) coated CNC nanorods (MFCNCs). The resulting
   hybrid material was further subjected to a one-step pyrolysis to yield
   N-doped carbon nanorods (N-MFCNCs) of high N doping content and
   favourable micro-, meso-, and macropores. An optimal capacitance of
   328.5 F g(-1) from the CV test at 0.01 V s(-1) and 352 F g(-1) from the
   CD test at 5 A g(-1) was achieved for N-MFCNCs in sulfuric acidic
   electrolyte (1 M). The material also exhibits high cycling stability
   (less than 4.6\% loss after 2000 cycles) at a high current density of 20
   A g(-1). The versatility of the material was further demonstrated by
   high capacitive performance in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Our
   work offers a promising alternative approach to fabricate
   high-performance nanostructured carbon from abundant biomass via facile
   and low-cost processing for energy storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{The power cost of running a data center is a significant portion of its
   total annual operating budget. With the aim of reducing power bills of
   data centers, ``Green Computing{''} has emerged with the primary goal of
   making software more energy efficient without compromising the
   performance. Developers play an important role in controlling the energy
   cost of data center software while writing code. In this paper, we show
   how software developers can contribute to energy efficiency of servers
   by choosing energy efficient APIs (Application Programming Interface)
   with the optimal choice of parameters while implementing file reading,
   file copy, file compression and file decompression operations in Java;
   that are performed extensively on large scale servers in data centers.
   We performed extensive measurements of energy cost of those operations
   on a Dell Power Edge 2950 machine running Linux and Windows servers.
   Measurement results show that energy costs of various APIs for those
   operations are sensitive to the buffer size selection. The choice of a
   particular Java API for file reading with different buffer sizes has
   significant impact on the energy cost, giving an opportunity to save up
   to 76\%. To save energy while copying files, it is important to use APIs
   with tunable buffer sizes, rather than APIs using fixed size buffers. In
   addition, there is a trade off between compression ratio and energy
   cost: because of more compression ratio, xz compression API consumes
   more energy than zip and gzip compression APIs. Finally, we model the
   energy costs of APIs by polynomial regression to avoid repeated
   measurements. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Title = {{Trust-Based Anomaly Detection in Emerging Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of a large number of small-size,
   energy-constrained nodes and generally are deployed to monitor
   surrounding situation or relay generated packets in other devices.
   However, due to the openness of wireless media and the inborn
   self-organization feature of WSNs, that is, frequent interoperations
   among neighbouring nodes, network security has been tightly related to
   data credibility and/or transmission reliability, thus trust evaluation
   of network nodes is becoming another interesting issue. Obviously, how
   to describe node's behaviors and how to integrate various
   characteristics to make the final decision are two major research
   aspects of trust model. In this paper, a new trust model is proposed to
   detect anomaly nodes based on fuzzy theory and revised evidence theory.
   By monitoring the behaviors of the evaluated nodes with multidimensional
   characteristics and integrating these pieces of information, the
   malicious nodes in a network can be identified and the normal operation
   of the whole network can be verified. In addition, to accelerate the
   detection process, a weighting judgment mechanism is adopted to deal
   with the uncertain states of evaluated nodes. Finally extensive
   simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed
   trust model can achieve higher detection ratio of malicious nodes in
   comparison with the previously reported results.}},

   A subjective experiment was designed where radiologists were asked to
   rate the quality of compressed medical images in a setting similar to
   clinical. We propose a modified Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
   analysis method for comparison of the image quality measures where the
   ``ground truth{''} is considered to be given by subjective scores. The
   best performance was achieved by the SSIM index and VIF for brain and
   body CT images. The worst results were observed for VSNR.
   We have utilized a logistic curve model which can be used to predict the
   subjective assessments with an objective criteria. This is a practical
   tool that can be used to determine the quality of medical images.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of multi-modal images has been a challenging task due to
   the complex intensity relationship between images. The standard
   multi-modal approach tends to use sophisticated similarity measures,
   such as mutual information, to assess the accuracy of the alignment.
   Employing such measures imply the increase in the computational time and
   complexity, and makes it highly difficult for the optimization process
   to converge. A new registration method is proposed based on introducing
   a structural representation of images captured from different
   modalities, in order to convert the multi-modal problem into a
   mono-modal one. Structural features are extracted by utilizing a
   modified version of entropy images in a patch-based manner. Experiments
   are performed on simulated and real brain images from different
   modalities. Quantitative assessments demonstrate that better accuracy
   can be achieved compared to the conventional multi-modal registration
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed form of cancer, but survival rates
   are relatively high with sufficiently early diagnosis. Current
   computer-aided image-based cancer detection methods face notable
   challenges including noise in MRI images, variability between different
   MRI modalities, weak contrast, and non-homogeneous texture patterns,
   making it difficult for diagnosticians to identify tumour candidates. We
   propose a novel saliency-based method for identifying suspicious regions
   in multi-parametric MR prostate images based on statistical texture
   distinctiveness. In this approach, a sparse texture model is learned via
   expectation maximization from features derived from multi-parametric MR
   prostate images, and the statistical texture distinctiveness-based
   saliency based on this model is used to identify suspicious regions. The
   proposed method was evaluated using real clinical prostate MRI data, and
   results demonstrate a clear improvement in suspicious region detection
   relative to the state-of-art method.}},

Abstract = {{A series of five thionated naphthalene diimides (NDIs) with linear alkyl

   the electron mobilities of the thionated derivatives are three orders of
   magnitude higher than the non-thionated parent analogue, with the
   highest mobility measured for cis-S2 (mu(max) = 7.5 x 10(-2) cm(2) V-1
   s(-1)). In contrast to branched chain PDIs and NDIs, the electron
   mobility does not increase appreciably with degree of thionation, and
   the average mobilities are quite consistent ranging from 3.9 x 10(-2) to
   7.4 x 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for one to three sulfurs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the field evaluation of a smartphone-based winter
   road surface condition (RSC) monitoring system. The system was deployed
   on eight maintenance and patrol vehicles and tested during the winter of
   2013-2014 on a section of Highway 6 in Ontario, Canada. The study
   focused on data obtained from four of the vehicles. This paper details
   the evaluation of the system from three perspectives: spot-wise
   monitoring, route-level monitoring, and system reliability. The study
   compared the system's RSC monitoring results with manual
   classifications, patrol records, and the Traveller's Road Information
   Portal, a public-facing website. The system's consistency with current
   RSC monitoring methods was assessed, and it was found that the
   smartphone-based system was capable of providing reliable results in
   comparison with the current method of patrol reporting for route-level
   monitoring of winter road conditions. Key performance factors were
   investigated, and the paper presents recommendations for system
   improvement.}},

   overlaid cellular networks, whose performance has been studied at the
   packet level for a static user population assuming infinite backlogs. In
   this paper, we aim at the flow-level performance with user dynamics
   governed by the arrival and completion of random service demands over
   time. We demonstrate the flow-level performance can be evaluated based
   on a queuing model with a dispatcher that assigns the service demands to
   two independent Processor Sharing servers. The queue model provides
   closed-form expressions for the mean number of users, the mean delay and
   the mean throughput, based on which the optimal spectrum partition and
   mode selection parameters can be derived and useful insights for the
   design principle can be obtained. Finally we perform numerical
   experiments to validate our model.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the vertical and lateral charge transport characteristics of
   a diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer donor (D)-PC61BM acceptor (A) system by
   measuring the space charge limited current (SCLC) mobility and
   field-effect mobility respectively. It was found that with an increase
   in annealing temperature, the SCLC hole mobility decreased for the pure
   polymer (PDBFBT) but increased for the PDBFBT:PC61BM blends, which could
   be explained by changes in the crystallinity and crystal orientation
   (edge-on versus face-on). The pure PDBFBT and most blend films showed
   the maximum field-effect hole mobility (mu h) when annealed at 100
   degrees C, which then declined as the annealing temperature was further
   increased. Surprisingly, the D/A - 1/1 blend films annealed at high
   temperatures exhibited an abrupt increase in the field-effect mh. This
   unusual phenomenon was interpreted by the antiplasticization effect of
   PC61BM, which promoted the molecular organization of the polymer. The
   effect of annealing on the carrier mobility was further correlated with
   the performance of inverted organic solar cell devices with the PDBFBT:
   PC61BM blend (D/A = 1/3). Thermal annealing at high temperatures (>100
   degrees C) was found to obstruct electron transport and cause the device
   performance to significantly deteriorate.}},

   electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and
   Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) were applied to characterize
   as-obtained Fe-TiNTs. Moreover, we have studied the photocatalytic
   properties of the Fe-TiNTs in the degradation of OTC. The results of our
   investigation and analysis have shown that regularly uniform nanotubes
   were fabricated by the hydrothermal treatment, and they had homogeneous
   tubular structures and open ends. UV-vis spectra of Fe-TiNTs
   demonstrated its absorption edge had remarkable red shift to the visible

Abstract = {{Development of high performance membranes requires deep insights about
   the various design, fabrication and operational parameters involved in
   the process. In the present study, the influence of input parameters
   such as active fiber length, feed temperature, feed composition and feed
   pressure is investigated to analyze the efficiency of the mathematical
   models developed for the separation of O-2/N-2 mixtures in an asymmetric
   hollow fiber membrane permeator. In addition, the effect of various
   non-idealities on the membrane performance are studied, individually.
   Results reveal that in contrast to pressure, temperature changes have no
   influential effects on the concentrations of O-2 and N-2 at permeate and
   retentate streams. The influence of feed composition on the product
   purities is more significant compared to active fiber length. Moreover,
   analysis of non-ideal effects indicates that pressure changes and
   concentration polarization are the most significant non-idealities among
   the effects. Results of this investigation can effectively be used for
   having a comprehensive overview about the impact of influential
   parameters and non-ideal effects on the membrane performance for O-2/N-2
   separation application.}},

Title = {{Real-Time Estimation of Saturation Flow Rates for Dynamic Traffic Signal
   Control Using Connected-Vehicle Data}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2487}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Abstract = {{Existing adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems rely on
   dedicated fixed-point sensors, such as inductive loop detectors or video
   cameras, for measuring traffic demands and discharge saturation flow
   rates. The cost associated with installation, operation, and maintenance
   of these sensors is one of the factors that limit the deployment of
   ATSCs. The emergence of connected vehicles (CVs), which continuously
   broadcast their speed, position, heading, and other information to other
   vehicles and to roadside infrastructure, provides an opportunity to
   reduce the reliance of ATSC on data from fixed sensors and potentially
   to reduce ATSC deployment costs. However, so that existing ATSC systems
   can operate by using CV data, a methodology is needed for estimating
   demands and saturation flow rate based on CV data instead of fixed
   sensor data. This paper focuses on estimating the time-varying
   saturation flow rate for individual lane groups at signalized
   intersections solely on the basis of CV data. The accuracy of a proposed
   methodology is quantified through microsimulation for a range of traffic
   conditions, lane group configurations, and levels of market penetration
   (LMP) of CVs. The analysis shows that the proposed methodology can
   capture temporal variations in the saturation flow rate caused by road
   incidents, queues spilling back from downstream bottlenecks, and lane
   closures. The evaluation results show that the mean absolute relative
   error of the lane group saturation flow rate ranged from approximately
   2\% to 9\% when LMP = 20\% and only 1\% to 2\% when LMP = 100\%.}},

Pages = {{4285-4309}},
Abstract = {{Chitosan on its own is a well-established natural polymer and is widely
   regarded as a biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic material for
   drug delivery applications. Although unmodified chitosan has some
   mucoadhesive properties on its own, its bioavailability is limited due
   to its short retention time in the body. Moreover, the high solubility
   of chitosan at acidic pH levels limits its use for mucosal drug delivery
   (especially through the oral route). Chemically-modified mucoadhesive
   chitosan, especially thiolated chitosan, has arisen as an alternative to
   create novel mucosal drug delivery systems. The mucoadhesive properties
   that are conferred to the thiolated chitosan certainly set this novel
   class of second or third-generation thiomers apart. To understand the
   significance of mucoadhesive chitosan, we first present the mechanism of
   mucoadhesion and provide comprehensive coverage of description of a
   variety of chemical modifications to prepare mucoadhesive thiolated
   chitosan derivatives. We then present the plethora of applications of
   these modified chitosan variants in a wide range of drug delivery
   fields, including the delivery of antigens, proteins and genes through a
   variety of routes, including oral, nasal, pulmonary, vaginal and others.
   By presenting the range of applications for mucoadhesive chitosan drug
   carriers we herein demonstrate that chemically-modified thiolated
   chitosan is a versatile and effective material for a new class of drug
   delivery vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Cardinality-based feature models provide the most expressive language
   among the existing feature modeling languages. We provide a reduction
   process, which allows us to transform a cardinality-based feature
   diagram to an appropriate regular expression. As for crosscutting
   constraints, we propose a formal language interpretation of them. In
   this way, we provide a formal language-based semantics for
   cardinality-based feature models. Accordingly, we describe a
   computational hierarchy of feature models, which guides us in how
   feature models can be constructively analyzed. We also characterize some
   existing analysis operations over feature models in terms of languages
   and discuss the corresponding decidability problems.}},

Abstract = {{Coalition fuzzy stability concepts are developed within the Fuzzy

   specifically, coalition versions of fuzzy Nash stability, fuzzy general
   metarationality, fuzzy symmetric metarationality, and fuzzy sequential
   stability are proposed. They constitute a natural generalization of the
   corresponding non-cooperative fuzzy preference-based definitions for
   Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality, and
   sequential stability, respectively. Coalition fuzzy stability
   definitions are employed to analyze an actual dispute over groundwater
   contamination in Elmira, Ontario, Canada, demonstrating how these new
   concepts can be conveniently applied to practical problems in order to

Title = {{Label-free high-throughput detection and content sensing of individual
   droplets in microfluidic systems}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4008-4019}},
Abstract = {{This study reports a microwave-microfluidics integrated approach capable
   of performing droplet detection at high-throughput as well as content
   sensing of individual droplets without chemical or physical intrusion.
   The sensing system consists of a custom microwave circuitry and a
   spiral-shaped microwave resonator that is integrated with microfluidic
   chips where droplets are generated. The microwave circuitry is very cost
   effective by using off-the-shelf components only. It eliminates the need
   for bulky benchtop equipment, and provides a compact, rapid and
   sensitive tool compatible for Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) platforms. To evaluate
   the resonator's sensing capability, it was first applied to
   differentiate between single-phase fluids which are aqueous solutions
   with different concentrations of glucose and potassium chloride
   respectively by measuring its reflection coefficient as a function of
   frequency. The minimum concentration assessed was 0.001 g ml(-1) for
   potassium chloride and 0.01 g ml(-1) for glucose. In the droplet
   detection experiments, it is demonstrated that the microwave sensor is
   able to detect droplets generated at as high throughput as 3.33 kHz.
   Around two million droplets were counted over a period of ten minutes
   without any missing. For droplet sensing experiments, pairs of droplets
   that were encapsulated with biological materials were generated
   alternatively in a double T-junction configuration and clearly
   identified by the microwave sensor. The sensed biological materials
   include fetal bovine serum, penicillin antibiotic mixture, milk (2\% mf)
   and D-(+)-glucose. This system has significant advantages over optical
   detection methods in terms of its cost, size and compatibility with LOC
   settings and also presents significant improvements over other
   electrical-based detection techniques in terms of its sensitivity and
   throughput.}},

   and the relatively low anti-oxidation property of the latter limit their
   applications. In this study, Ag-Cu alloy nanoparticles with the size of
   20-50 nm were synthesized with glucose as the reducing agent and NaOH as
   accelerator. The Ag-Cu nanoparticle paste showed no oxidation after
   sintering up to 350 degrees C in the air, indicating that the
   antioxidant capacity was superior to that of the mechanically mixed Ag
   nanoparticles and Cu nanoparticles. In addition, the electrochemical
   migration resistance of the sintered Ag-Cu alloy pastes was better than
   that of the Ag nanoparticle paste. This paste can be used to effectively
   bond silver-plated copper bulks with maximum shear strength of 35 MPa.}},

Title = {{Regioisomeric control of charge transport polarity for indigo-based
   polymers}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{39}},
Pages = {{6998-7004}},
Abstract = {{In this work we report the opposite charge transport polarity observed
   for two regioisomeric polymer semiconductors. Previously, we observed
   n-type electron transport behaviour for a polymer semiconductor,
   6,6'-PIDBDT, which contains 6,6'-indigo units. Electron distributions in
   the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied
   molecular orbital (HOMO) of indigo calculated by density functional
   theory (DFT) could explain the electron transport behaviour since
   electrons can be delocalized along the polymer backbone through the LUMO
   rather than the HOMO via the 6-and 6'-positions. Serendipitously, we
   found that the 5- and 5'-positions of indigo are occupied by electrons
   in the HOMO but empty in the LUMO, opposite to the 6-and 6'-positions.
   This suggests that 5,5'-PIDBDT containing the 5,5'-indigo units, a
   regioisomer of 6,6'-PIDBDT, may exhibit the opposite p-type charge
   transport behaviour. To prove our assumption, we synthesized 5,5'-PIDBDT
   and found that this polymer indeed showed p-type semiconductor
   behaviour. Hence we demonstrated a novel approach to control the
   electron or hole charge transport polarity by simply varying the main
   chain regiochemical connections.}},

Title = {{Assimilation of ice and water observations from SAR imagery to improve
   estimates of sea ice concentration}},
Journal = {{TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the assimilation of binary observations calculated from
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of sea ice is investigated. Ice
   and water observations are obtained from a set of SAR images by
   thresholding ice and water probabilities calculated using a supervised
   maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). These ice and water observations are
   then assimilated in combination with ice concentration from passive
   microwave imagery for the purpose of estimating sea ice concentration.
   Due to the fact that the observations are binary, consisting of zeros
   and ones, while the state vector is a continuous variable (ice
   concentration), the forward model used to map the state vector to the
   observation space requires special consideration. Both linear and
   non-linear forward models were investigated. In both cases, the
   assimilation of SAR data was able to produce ice concentration analyses
   in closer agreement with image analysis charts than when assimilating
   passive microwave data only. When both passive microwave and SAR data
   are assimilated, the bias between the ice concentration analyses and the
   ice concentration from ice charts is 19.78\%, as compared to 26.72\%
   when only passive microwave data are assimilated. The method presented
   here for the assimilation of SAR data could be applied to other binary
   observations, such as ice/water information from visual/infrared
   sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophages play an important role in the elimination of infections, the
   removal of debris and in tissue repair after infection and trauma. In
   vitro models that assess ocular biomaterials for toxicity typically
   focus on the effects of these materials on epithelial or fibroblast
   cells. This investigation evaluated known ocular toxins deposited on
   model materials for their effects on the viability and activation of
   macrophages. THP-1-derived macrophages were cultured onto silicone films
   (used as a base biomaterial) deposited with chemical toxins
   (benzalkonium chloride (BAK), zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (ZDEC) and
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). Utilizing three fluorescent dyes calcein,
   ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) and annexin V, the viability of
   macrophages attached to the biomaterial was determined using confocal
   microscopy. Propidium iodide (PI) staining and alamarBlue (R)
   (resazurin) reduction were used to assess cell death and metabolic
   activity. CD14, CD16, CD33, CD45, and CD54 expression of adherent
   macrophages, were also evaluated to detect LPS activation of macrophages
   using flow cytometry. The sensitivity of this test battery was
   demonstrated as significant toxicity from treated surfaces with ZDEC
   (0.001-0.01\%), and BAK (0.001\%-0.1\%) was detected. Also, macrophage
   activation could be detected by measuring CD54 expression after exposure
   to adsorbed LPS. These in vitro methods will be helpful in determining
   the toxicity potential of new ocular biomaterials.}},

   Acetyltransferase Activity and Its Relation with Cholinergic Dysfunction
   through Two-Enzyme/Two-Compartment Model}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The effect of beta-amyloid aggregates on activity of choline
   acetyltransferase (ChAT) which is responsible for synthesizing
   acetylcholine (ACh) in human brain is investigated through the
   two-enzyme/two-compartment (2E2C) model where the presynaptic neuron is
   considered as compartment 1 while both the synaptic cleft and the
   postsynaptic neuron are considered as compartment 2 through suggesting
   three different kinetic mechanisms for the inhibition effect. It is
   found that the incorporation of ChAT inhibition by beta-amyloid
   aggregates into the 2E2C model is able to yield dynamic solutions for
   concentrations of generated beta-amyloid, ACh, choline, acetate, and pH
   in addition to the rates of ACh synthesis and ACh hydrolysis in
   compartments 1 and 2. It is observed that ChAT activity needs a high
   concentration of beta-amyloid aggregates production rate. It is found
   that ChAT activity is reduced significantly when neurons are exposed to
   high levels of beta-amyloid aggregates leading to reduction in levels of
   ACh which is one of the most significant physiological symptoms of AD.
   Furthermore, the system of ACh neurocycle is dominated by the
   oscillatory behavior when ChAT enzyme is completely inhibited by
   beta-amyloid. It is observed that the direct inactivation of ChAT by
   beta-amyloid aggregates may be a probable mechanism contributing to the
   development of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Although accident frequencies at railway grade crossings have shown a
   decreasing trend over the last two decades (partly due to implemented
   safety improvements and technological advances), safety at grade
   crossings is still a major concern since crossing accidents are usually
   associated with devastating consequences. This paper investigates the
   effect of various site attributes on railway crossing safety outcomes
   using recent Canada wide data from a 6-year period (2008-2013). The new
   data sets allow adjusting previous accident models according to latest
   circumstances (e.g., vehicles' improved safety features) affecting
   safety dynamics at crossings. Employing Bayesian hierarchical models
   including the non-conventional Poisson-Weibull model, different safety
   performance functions were separately developed for crossings with the
   following major warning systems: (1) flashing light and bell (FLB), (2)
   flashing light, bell, and gate (FLBG), (3) standard reflectorized
   crossing sign (SRCS), and (4) standard reflectorized crossing sign and
   stop sign (SRCS \& STOP). Among other findings, the results indicated
   that traffic exposure (product of train and vehicle), number of lanes,
   whistle prohibition, train speed, and road speed were the most important
   factors affecting accident frequencies at Canadian railway crossings. It
   should be also noted that safety performance functions vary, in terms of
   independent variables and their associated coefficients, between the
   aforementioned warning devices.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{89}},
Pages = {{72805-72815}},
Abstract = {{The all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is one of the most promising
   energy storage systems to be associated with the grid. The system has
   been developed for almost 30 years. A key component for VRFBs is the
   membrane separator, which separates the positive and negative half-cells
   and prevents the cross-mixing of vanadium ions, while providing required
   ionic conductivity. In general, research is conducted to solve a
   multi-variable problem which requires optimization in both physical
   characteristics and electrochemical performance of the membrane. Nafion
   and its derivatives are still important materials thanks to their high
   chemical stability and ionic conductivity. However, weaknesses of these
   materials, such as high vanadium ion crossover and high cost, stimulate
   new approaches in materials design for VRFBs. New achievements in
   material sciences and polymer chemistry allow further development of
   other types of polymeric materials and composites as separators in
   VRFBs. This includes new cation exchange membranes, anion exchange
   membranes, amphoteric ion-exchange membranes, and non-ionic porous
   materials. Each type of material exhibits its advantages, accompanied by
   its weaknesses. Recent articles in polymer-containing membranes for use
   as separators in VRFBs are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{We study a problem of stochastic control in mathematical finance, with
   the goal of maximizing expected utility of investment and consumption
   over a finite trading horizon. The asset prices are modeled by Ito
   processes, for which the market parameters are subject to regime
   switching in the sense of being adapted to the joint filtration of the
   driving Brownian motion and a finite-state Markov chain which models
   ``regime states{''} of the market. The vector of portfolios is
   constrained to a specified closed and convex set, and margin payments
   are levied on the investor, resulting in a wealth equation which is
   nonlinear in the portfolio. We proceed by the method of conjugate
   duality to construct a dual optimization problem together with
   optimality relations between putative solutions of the given (i.e.,
   ``primal{''}) optimization problem and the dual optimization problem.
   These optimality relations are then used to address the specific cases
   of power-type and logarithmic utility functions, with convex cone
   portfolio constraints, and a higher rate of interest for borrowing than
   for lending. We get completely explicit optimal portfolios and
   characterize the optimal consumption rate as the solution of a backward
   stochastic differential equation (BSDE) ``driven{''} by the canonical
   martingales of the regime-state Markov chain. For the power utility
   function this is a rather unconventional BSDE, to which standard
   existence results do not apply, and accordingly we establish existence
   and uniqueness of solutions for this BSDE.}},

   communications and networking. In this survey, we mainly focus on
   energy-efficient techniques in base stations and mobile terminals as
   they constitute the major sources of energy consumption in wireless
   access networks, from the operator and user perspectives, respectively.
   Unlike the existing articles and surveys, we aim to present a unified
   treatment of green solutions and analytical models for both network
   operators and mobile users. Such a unified treatment will help in the
   future to develop green solutions that enable an improved and balanced
   efficient usage of energy by operators and end users.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and
   sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling are popular methods for
   uncertainty analysis in hydrological modelling. However, application of
   these methodologies can incur significant computational costs. This
   study investigated using model pre-emption for improving the
   computational efficiency of MCMC and SMC samplers in the context of
   hydrological modelling. The proposed pre-emption strategy facilitates
   early termination of low-likelihood simulations and results in reduction
   of unnecessary simulation time steps. The proposed approach is
   incorporated into two samplers and applied to the calibration of three
   rainfall-runoff models. Results show that overall pre-emption savings
   range from 5 to 21\%. Furthermore, results indicate that pre-emption
   savings are greatest during the pre-convergence `burn-in' period (i.e.,
   between 8 and 39\%) and decrease as the algorithms converge towards high
   likelihood regions of parameter space. The observed savings are achieved
   with absolutely no change in the posterior set of parameters.}},

Title = {{An assessment of the utility of LiDAR data in extracting base-year
   floorspace and a comparison with the census-based approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{708-729}},
Abstract = {{A literature review indicates that most integrated land-use transport
   models (ILUTMs) estimate base-year floorspace data according to limited
   population and employment data provided by the census and, in general,
   the accuracy is unknown. This paper assesses the utility of airborne
   Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology as a valuable tool for
   extracting base-year floorspace using the following three datasets: a
   geographic vector building footprint layer, a LiDAR dataset, and field
   survey data for the south side of the City of Fredericton, Canada. It is
   found through a statistical comparison with the results from the field
   survey that LiDAR data can be used to extract buildings and estimate
   floorspace with a good degree of accuracy. Further, two base-year
   floorspace estimation methods, one based on the LiDAR data and the other
   on census data, are compared. In general, our results show that the
   traditional census-based approach may not be reliable for estimating
   base-year floorspace. Using the extracted floorspace from the LiDAR data
   as the basis, for residential floorspace estimation the average absolute
   percentage errors (APE) of the census-based approach is 16\% and the
   95th percentile APE is 34\%. On the other hand, for employment
   floorspace estimation, the accuracy of the census-based approach is even
   lower, with average errors of 50\% or higher and the 95th percentile
   APEs as high as 163\% up to 400\% for several land-use categories. All
   the above statistics indicate that the traditional census-based approach
   is unreliable and inaccurate for modelers and planners to prepare their
   base-year floorspace, and therefore suggest a better way be explored.
   Study results clearly show the utility of LiDAR data and imply that it
   can be used as a powerful add-on for ILUTMs in general.}},

Abstract = {{Today's users extensively download video files on their wireless

   have shown that video downloading accounts for a large portion of the

   downloading algorithm with three tunable parameters namely, buffer size,
   low water mark and socket-reading size. By implementing the algorithm on
   a smartphone and measuring the actual energy cost, we show the impacts
   of the three parameters on the energy cost of video downloads. By tuning
   the buffer size, low water mark, and socket-reading, we observed energy
   savings to the extent of 60\%, 64\%, and 63\%, respectively. By
   incorporating our algorithmic approach into the process of video
   downloading, mobile application developers will be better positioned to
   fine-tune their apps to reduce the total energy cost of downloading

Abstract = {{Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with about 40 nm diameter covered with 5-8 nm
   organic shell were prepared by chemical reduction reaction. The thermal
   characteristics of Ag nanoparticle (NP) paste were measured by
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). The low-temperature sintering bonding processes using Ag NP paste
   were carried out at the temperature range of 150-350 degrees C for 5 min
   under the pressure of 3 MPa. The microstructures of the sintered joint
   and the fracture morphology were evaluated by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The shear strength was used to evaluate the mechanical
   property of the sintered joint. TGA-DSC test showed that the Ag content
   is approximately 95.5 mass\% in Ag NP paste. The average shear strength
   of the joint fabricated at 250 degrees C for 5 min under the pressure of
   3 MPa was about 28 MPa, which could meet the requirements of electronics
   packaging working at high temperature. The joint shear strength
   increased with the increase of the sintering temperature due to much
   denser sintered Ag NPs and more comprehensive metallurgical bonds formed

Title = {{Using a Collaborative Research Approach to Develop an Interdisciplinary
   Research Agenda for the Study of Mobile Health Interventions for Older

Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Seniors with chronic diseases are often called on to
   self-manage their conditions. Mobile health (mHealth) tools may be a
   useful strategy to help seniors access health information at the point
   of decision-making, receive real-time feedback and coaching, and monitor
   health conditions. However, developing successful mHealth interventions
   for seniors presents many challenges. One of the key challenges is to
   ensure the scope of possible research questions includes the diverse
   views of seniors, experts and the stakeholder groups who support seniors
   as they manage chronic disease.
   Objective: Our primary objective was to present a case-study of a
   collaborative research approach to the development of an
   interdisciplinary research agenda. Our secondary objectives were to
   report on the results of a nominal group technique (NGT) approach used
   generate research questions and to assess the success of including
   non-academic researchers to enrich the scope, priority, and total number
   of possible research questions.
   Methods: We invited researchers and stakeholders to participate in a
   full day meeting that included rapid-style presentations by researchers,
   health care professionals, technology experts, patients and community
   groups followed by group discussions. An NGT was used to establish group
   consensus on the following question: In your opinion, what research
   needs to be done to better understand the effectiveness, usability and
   design of mobile health apps and devices for older adults?
   Results: Overall, the collaborative approach was a very successful
   strategy to bring together a diverse group of participants with the same
   end goal. The 32 participants generated 119 items in total. The top
   three research questions that emerged from the NGT were related to
   adoption, the need for high quality tools and the digital divide. Strong
   sub-themes included privacy and security, engagement and design. The NGT
   also helped us include the perspectives information from non-academic
   researchers that would not have been captured if the process had been
   limited to the research team.
   Conclusions: Developing ways for patients and other stakeholders to have
   a voice when it comes to developing patient awareness as related to
   mHealth may guide future research into engagement, ownership, usability
   and design. It is our intention that our paper be used and adapted by
   other researchers to engage small or vulnerable populations often
   excluded from mHealth research and design.}},

Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tobacco use remains the number one cause of preventable
   chronic disease and death in developed countries worldwide. In North
   America, smoking rates are highest among young adults. Despite that the
   majority of young adult smokers indicate wanting to quit, smoking rates
   among this age demographic have yet to decline. Helping young adults
   quit smoking continues to be a public health priority. Digital mobile
   technology presents a promising medium for reaching this population with
   smoking cessation interventions, especially because young adults are the
   heaviest users of this technology.
   Objective: The primary aim of this trial is to determine the
   effectiveness of an evidence-informed mobile phone app for smoking
   cessation, Crush the Crave, on reducing smoking prevalence among young
   adult smokers.
   Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms will
   be conducted in Canada to evaluate Crush the Crave. In total, 1354 young
   adult smokers (19 to 29 years old) will be randomized to receive the
   evidence-informed mobile phone app, Crush the Crave, or an
   evidence-based self-help guide known as ``On the Road to Quitting{''}
   (control) for a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure is a
   30-day point prevalence of abstinence at the 6-month follow-up.
   Secondary outcomes include a 7-day point prevalence of abstinence,
   number of quit attempts, reduction in consumption of cigarettes,
   self-efficacy, satisfaction, app utilization metrics, and use of smoking
   cessation services. A cost-effectiveness analysis is included.
   Results: This trial is currently open for recruitment. The anticipated
   completion date for the study is April 2016.
   Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial will provide the evidence
   to move forward on decision making regarding the inclusion of
   technology-based mobile phone interventions as part of existing smoking
   cessation efforts made by health care providers. Evidence from the trial
   will also inform the development of future apps, provide a deeper
   understanding of the factors that drive change in smoking behavior using
   an app, and improve the design of cessation apps. This trial is among
   the first to assess the effect of a comprehensive and evidence-informed
   mHealth smoking cessation app on a large sample of young adult smokers.
   Strengths of the trial include the high-quality research design and
   in-depth assessment of the implementation of the intervention. If
   effective, the trial has the potential to demonstrate that including
   mHealth technology as a population-based intervention strategy can
   cost-effectively reach a greater proportion of the population and help
   young adult smokers to quit.}},

Title = {{Activation of Apoptotic Signal in Endothelial Cells through
   Intracellular Signaling Molecules Blockade in Tumor-Induced Angiogenesis}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Tumor-induced angiogenesis is the bridge between avascular and vascular
   tumor growth phases. In tumor-induced angiogenesis, endothelial cells
   start to migrate and proliferate toward the tumor and build new
   capillaries toward the tumor. There are two stages for sprout extension
   during angiogenesis. The first stage is prior to anastomosis, when
   single sprouts extend. The second stage is after anastomosis when closed
   flow pathways or loops are formed and blood flows in the closed loops.
   Prior to anastomosis, biochemical and biomechanical signals from
   extracellular matrix regulate endothelial cell phenotype; however, after
   anastomosis, blood flow is the main regulator of endothelial cell
   phenotype. In this study, the critical signaling pathways of each stage
   are introduced. A Boolean network model is used to map environmental and
   flow induced signals to endothelial cell phenotype (proliferation,
   migration, apoptosis, and lumen formation). Using the Boolean network
   model, blockade of intracellular signaling molecules of endothelial cell
   is investigated prior to and after anastomosis and the cell fate is
   obtained in each case. Activation of apoptotic signal in endothelial
   cell can prevent the extension of new vessels and may inhibit
   angiogenesis. It is shown that blockade of a few signaling molecules in
   endothelial cell activates apoptotic signal that are proposed as
   antiangiogenic strategies.}},

   60 and 80 MHz in the tunneling frequency when 2 x 2 x 1.6 mm(3) samples
   of FR4 and Rogers 6006 materials are placed on the wire tip. This kind
   of energy tunneling probe can bring a special advantage in the area of
   biomedical and forensic analysis where, usually the samples are small in

Title = {{Retinal response to departure from perfect power coupling: implications
   for the Stiles-Crawford effect}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1278-1282}},
Abstract = {{Maximum power transfer occurs in an oscillatory system driven by an
   external periodic force matching the natural frequency. Here, we analyze
   the role of matching in the biological phenomenon of waveguiding of
   light in a photoreceptor cone. When the fraction of light power that is
   not able to be coupled to a fundamental mode of a foveal cone is
   computed, it is found that the mismatch is proportional to the degree of
   departure from the perfect matching for one hundred percent coupling.
   Thus, Stiles-Crawford effect of the first kind is shown to be the
   response of the retina to departure from perfect matching. We show by
   correlating how the diminution in luminous efficiency recorded in
   psychophysical measurements for beams entering the pupil +/- 4 mm from
   the point of optimum efficiency in Stiles-Crawford effect of the first
   kind is due to a departure of either six or one-sixth times from this
   perfect match. The Stiles-Crawford function is recreated by interpreting
   perfect matching for axial entry of the beam and proportionate
   mismatching for corresponding degree of peripheral entries. Now the
   fundamental question is: Does a biological system respond by decreasing
   the efficiency by same amount irrespective of increase or decrease so
   long the product of departures from the value for optimum efficiency is
   unity?}},

Title = {{Conditional Moment Closure Modelling of a Lifted H-2/N-2 Turbulent Jet
   Flame Using the Presumed Mapping Function Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMBUSTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A lifted hydrogen/nitrogen turbulent jet flame issuing into a vitiated
   coflow is investigated using the conditional moment closure (CMC)
   supplemented by the presumed mapping function (PMF) approach for the
   modelling of conditional mixing and velocity statistics. Using a
   prescribed reference field, the PMF approach yields a presumed
   probability density function (PDF) for the mixture fraction, which is
   then used in closing the conditional scalar dissipation rate (CSDR) and
   conditional velocity in a fully consistent manner. These closures are
   applied to a lifted flame and the findings are compared to previous
   results obtained using beta-PDF-based closures over a range of coflow
   temperatures (T-c). The PMF results are in line with those of the
   beta-PDF and compare well to measurements. The transport budgets in
   mixture fraction and physical spaces and the radical history ahead of
   the stabilisation height indicate that the stabilisation mechanism is
   susceptible to T-c. As in the previous beta-PDF calculations,
   autoignition around the ``most reactive{''} mixture fraction remains the
   controlling mechanism for sufficiently high T-c. Departure from the
   beta-PDF predictions is observed when T-c is decreased as PMF predicts
   stabilisation by means of premixed flame propagation. This conclusion is
   based on the observation that lean mixtures are heated by downstream
   burning mixtures in a preheat zone developing ahead of the stabilization
   height. The spurious sources, which stem from inconsistent CSDR
   modelling, are further investigated. The findings reveal that their
   effect is small but nonnegligible, most notably within the flame zone.}},

Title = {{Optimized Maintenance Standards for Unpaved Road Networks Based on
   Cost-Effectiveness Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2473}},
Pages = {{56-65}},
Abstract = {{Unpaved roads play a crucial role in the economic and social development
   of societies, linking rural communities to education, health services,
   and markets. The asset value of unpaved roads is low compared with
   national and provincial road networks, because agencies responsible for
   rural roads management lack the resources to assess and maintain the
   network properly. Lack of resources is especially critical in developing
   countries, where the majority of the population lives in rural areas and
   where few tools are available for sustainable management of the unpaved
   network. The main objective for this study was to develop and validate
   cost-effective maintenance standards for unpaved rural roads. The study
   was directed at improving the management process of unpaved road
   networks that serve rural populations. The scope was to develop
   maintenance standards that can be used by agencies in charge of network
   management, given available resources and technical skills. The
   developed four-step methodology evaluates an unpaved road network for 4
   years, identifies the effects of maintenance treatments on the condition
   of roads from field data analysis, defines maintenance strategies, and
   develops optimal maintenance standards. The study was part of a 4-year
   project conducted at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada,
   that resulted in the development of a sustainable management system for
   rural road networks in developing countries. The proposed standards were
   applied and successfully validated and were demonstrated to be adaptable
   to varying climates, budgets, traffic, and road structures.}},

Title = {{Time and frequency domain evaluation of bender element systems}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{548-562}},
Abstract = {{Bender elements are used to measure the low-strain shear-wave velocity
   of soils in many geotechnical laboratories worldwide. Despite their
   popularity, the method remains without a standard, mainly owing to the
   difficulties in controlling the actual behaviour of the bender element
   inside the specimen. Previous experimental and analytical studies on the
   behaviour of bender elements have found evidence that the actual
   transmitter movement is not equal in shape or frequency content of the
   electrical signal used as the input excitation. Furthermore, the size
   and geometry of the specimen influence the response of these
   piezoelectric transducers. In this study, miniature accelerometers are
   used to measure the particle vibration inside specimens during bender
   elements tests, which were performed in a resonant column device. The
   comparison between shear wave velocities obtained by resonant column and
   miniature accelerometers tests allow a better interpretation of bender
   element testing. The sine pulse bender element test results showed good
   agreement with the resonant column measurements. The results show the
   importance of the resonant frequencies of the bender element and their
   influence on frequency domain analysis of bender element testing.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{551-565}},
Abstract = {{Climatic variability and change can have profound impacts on the
   hydrologic regime of a watershed, especially in regions that are
   sensitive to changes in climate, such as the northern latitudes and
   alpine-fed regions of western Canada. Quantifying historical spatial and
   temporal changes in hydrological data can provide useful information as
   to how water resources are affected by climatic and atmospheric
   forcings, as well as create an understanding of potential future
   variability. Trends in western Canadian runoff are examined for the
   period of 1976-2010. Regional patterns of spatial variability are
   quantified using a principal component analysis (PCA) that results in
   the identification of three hydrological regions. Both watershed-scale
   and PCA trend results show increased runoff in the northern-most
   watersheds, while decreased water availability has generally affected
   the mid-latitude basins. The southern watersheds show increases and
   decreases in runoff with no significant trends. Runoff is shown to be
   positively correlated with precipitation. Runoff in some regions of
   western Canada is shown to be influenced by the Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation and Pacific North American (PNA) modes of atmospheric
   variability. The results of this analysis provide water managers with an
   indication of the direction and magnitude of changing water availability

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to examine the link between innovation
   and profit in the Canadian food processing industry and other Canadian
   manufacturing industries using firm-level data. We conduct
   non-parametric tests using a panel of 723 manufacturing firms over eight
   years (N=5,784). The main finding is that profitability is higher for
   food processing innovators vs. non-innovators, but product-process
   innovators have greater profit and profit-margins than firms that have
   product-only or process-only innovation. Thus, a ``one size fits all{''}
   policy that simply promotes innovation in manufacturing is not suitable
   for food processing, where firms that innovate in both product and
   process spheres is what really matters.}},

Abstract = {{An approximate analytical investigation for free convection of
   non-Newtonian nanofluids over an isothermal impermeable horizontal flat
   plate, which is placed in a porous quiescent medium filled with
   non-Newtonian power law nanofluids, is carried out in this paper. A
   further assumption is also made that the medium contains both
   nanoparticles and gyrotactic microorganisms. The horizontal plate is
   deemed to have uniform surface temperature, solute, nanoparticles
   concentration, and density of motile microorganisms. The governing
   equations are transformed into a system of non-linear ordinary
   differential equation using suitable similarity transformations.
   Approximate analytical solutions for the dimensionless velocity,
   temperature, nanoparticle concentration, and density of the motile
   microorganisms are obtained using the optimal homotopy asymptotic method
   (OHAM). The effects of important control parameters on the dimensionless
   velocity, temperature, nanoparticles concentration, and density of
   motile microorganisms, as well as on the local Nusselt, Sherwood, and
   motile microorganism numbers, are obtained and analyzed. It is found
   that nanofluid and bioconvection parameters have strong effects on local

Title = {{Numerical Simulations of Gravity Driven Reversible Reactive Flows in
   Homogeneous Porous Media}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The effect of reversibility on the instability of a miscible vertical
   reactive flow displacement is examined. A model, where densities and/or
   viscosities mismatches between the reactants and the chemical product
   trigger instability, is adopted. The problem is governed by the
   continuity equation, Darcy's law, and the convection-diffusion-reaction
   equations. The problem is formulated and solved numerically using a
   combination of the highly accurate spectral methods based on Hartley's
   transform and the finite-difference technique. Nonlinear simulations
   were carried out for a variety of parameters to analyse the effects of
   the reversibility of the chemical reaction on the development of the
   flow under different scenarios of the frontal instability. In general,
   faster attenuation in the development and growth of the instability is
   reported as the reversibility of the chemical reaction increases.
   However, it was observed that reversibility is capable of triggering
   instability for particular choices of the densities and viscosities
   mismatches. In addition, the effect of the reversibility in enhancing
   the instability was illustrated by presenting the total relative contact
   area between the reactants and the product.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of interface roughness (IR) scattering on device performance
   of indirectly-pumped (IDP) terahertz quantum cascade lasers are studied.
   Three different active region designs with almost the same lasing
   frequency at threshold and comparable oscillator strength are
   experimentally investigated and the measurement data are analyzed and
   compared with numerical simulation. The simulation results show that all
   structures suffer from the detrimental effect of intersubband roughness
   scattering in terms of threshold current density, and probably operating
   temperature. The intrasubband IR scattering time could also to be a
   limiting factor in the IDP structures due to the employed high energetic
   barrier.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of three different wastewater treatment configurations,
   conventional activated sludge (CAS), nitrifying activated sludge (NAS)
   and biological nutrient removal (BNR) for removal of selected
   micropollutants from authentic wastewater was investigated. The
   processes were also characterized based on their proficiency to reduce
   the estrogenic activity of the influent wastewater using the in vitro
   recombinant yeast assay. The removal efficiency of trimethoprim improved
   with the complexity of the three treatment process configurations.
   Ibuprofen, androstendione, sulfamethoxazole, nonylphenol, estrone and
   bisphenol-A had moderate to high removals (> 65\%) while carbamazepine
   and meprobamate remained recalcitrant in the three treatment process
   configurations. The removal of gemfibrozil was better in the NAS than in
   BNR and CAS treatment configurations. The yeast estrogen screen (YES)
   assay analyses showed an improvement in estrogenicity removal in the BNR
   and NAS treatment configurations as compared to the CAS treatment
   configuration. Comparing the estrogenic responses from the three
   treatment configurations, the removal efficiencies followed the order of
   BNR = NAS > CAS and all were greater than 81\%.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{While attributes such as small dimensions, low power consumption, fast
   sensor response, and a wide range of detection give one-dimensional
   nanostructures excellent potential to revolutionize sensor and detector
   industries, challenges to achieving uniform stoichiometry pose
   significant obstacles to their commercial use. Diverse characteristics
   arise from nanostructures with variable compositions and morphologies.
   Thus, investigation of physical properties of nanostructures would be
   pointless if one cannot assure the exact stoichiometry of the material.
   We studied the stoichiometry of ZnTe nanowires grown via the
   vapor-liquid-solid method. Different microscopy and composition analysis
   methods were exploited to study the stoichiometry of the nanowires. It
   was observed that nonstoichiometric wires had relatively higher defect
   concentrations. The temperature profile along the substrate during
   nanowire growth was found to be the reason for the formation of
   nanowires with different stoichiometries.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic storage system (CSS) is defined as physically interconnected and
   operationally integrated surface water and groundwater subsystems with
   full direct interactions between the subsystems. Mathematical
   development and implementation of a CSS model is very complex and all
   previous works are fully case dependent with a minimum possibility of
   generalization. This article proposes an integrated development
   environment called CSSDev, which assists researchers to create and
   design object-oriented CSS models more easily. Using CSSDev, researchers
   may skip regeneration of repetitive simulation codes for common elements
   of a CSS. CSSDev employs NSGA-II to optimally select the design
   parameters of the models. Two objective functions of the optimization
   problem are system's total costs and total loss associated with the
   development alternatives. A real-world large-scale CSS has been modeled
   and optimized to illustrate the performance of CSSDev. The final
   Pareto-front is presented and two selected solutions from the set of
   optimal non-dominated ones are evaluated and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Supramolecular hydrogels, which are held together by noncovalent bonds
   and show responses to external stimuli, are of great interest in
   therapeutic delivery and tissue engineering as the injectable depot
   systems. To obtain a supramolecular hydrogel with multifunctions, such
   as low cytotoxicity, injectability and stimuli-triggered drug release,
   we herein report on the synthesis and characterization of a
   supramolecular hydrogel, which was formed by host-guest interaction
   between alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) and a PEGylated doxorubicin
   prodrug linked with an acid-cleavable hydrazone group (mPEG-Hyd-DOX).
   The polymeric prodrug displayed lower cytotoxicity than the free DOX.
   The host-guest interaction was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   analysis. The structures and morphologies of the supramolecular
   hydrogels were systematically investigated by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The sol-gel transition process was
   monitored by dynamic and steady rheological analysis. The hydrogels
   could be degraded in the acidic environment of tumor cells and achieved
   the controlled delivery of DOX. The results of the pH-responsive
   property, in vitro cytotoxicity and drug release revealed that the
   supramolecular hydrogels can be used as a potential injectable matrix
   for the encapsulation and controlled release of anticancer drugs. This
   study provides an alternative for the construction of dual- or
   multi-drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, three PEGylated doxorubicin (DOX) prodrugs with
   acid-labile acetal and carbamate linkages have been prepared via the
   combination of Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of
   alkyne and azide (CuAAC) ``click{''} reaction and ammonolysis reaction.
   The chemical structures of the prodrugs and the drug contents were
   characterized by H-1 NMR, FT-IR and HPLC analyses. To avoid some side
   effects caused by the acidic degradation products from conventional
   hydrophobic polymers, DOX was directly linked to the PEG chain. These
   prodrugs could self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution with DOX
   as the core and PEG chains as the corona. The dissociation of prodrug
   micelles was confirmed by monitoring the size change as a function of
   time through DLS analysis. Compared with free DOX, the pH-triggered DOX
   release of prodrugs exhibited a well-controlled and faster release
   behavior at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4. In vitro cytotoxicity tests against
   HeLa cells by MTT assay demonstrated that these prodrugs displayed the
   desirable antitumor activity. The intracellular drug release was
   observed by a live cell imaging system at different DOX dosages. This
   work provides a strategy for the preparation of a new type of
   pH-cleavable and water-soluble antitumor prodrug for cancer
   chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The durability of Pt catalysts in polymer membrane electrolyte fuel
   cells (PEMFCs) is critical to successful implementation of this clean
   energy technology in transportation and stationary applications. Despite
   reports on a variety of Pt nanostructures with improved durability, a
   clear understanding of the structure-durability relationship is still
   missing as a rigorous correlative investigation is lacking. Using
   five-fold twinned Pd nanowires as templates, we have prepared Pt
   nanotubular skeleton structures which duplicate the crystal structure of
   the template. By comparing the durability of these structures with
   commercial Pt/C catalysts and Pt nanotubes, we found that grain
   boundaries in Pt nanocatalysts contribute most to the instability of the
   catalyst structures. These results not only highlight a strategy to
   prepare more durable fuel cell catalysts, but also provide a new method
   to prepare elongated Pt catalysts with controlled crystal structures,
   which together will perpetuate the commercial success of this green
   energy conversion technology.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure ulcers (PUs) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI)
   present a persistent and costly problem. Continuing effort in developing
   new technologies that support self-managed care is an important
   prevention strategy. Specifically, the aims of this scoping review are
   to review the key concepts and factors related to self-managed
   prevention of PUs in individuals with SCI and appraise the technologies
   available to assist patients in self-management of PU prevention
   practices. There is broad consensus that sustaining long-term adherence
   to prevention regimens is a major concern. Recent literature highlights
   the interactions between behavioral and physiological risk factors. We
   identify four technology categories that support self-management:
   computer-based educational technologies demonstrated improved short-term
   gains in knowledge (2 studies), interface pressure mapping technologies
   demonstrated improved adherence to pressure-relief schedules up to 3 mo
   (5 studies), electrical stimulation confirmed improvements in tissue
   tolerance after 8 wk of training (3 studies), and telemedicine programs
   demonstrated improvements in independence and reduced hospital visits
   over 6 mo (2 studies). Overall, self-management technologies
   demonstrated low-to-moderate effectiveness in addressing a subset of
   risk factors. However, the effectiveness of technologies in preventing
   PUs is limited due to a lack of incidence reporting. In light of the key
   findings, we recommend developing integrated technologies that address
   multiple risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of an x-ray detector, expressed
   as a function of spatial frequency, describes the ability to produce
   high-quality images relative to an ideal detector. While the DQE
   normally decreases substantially with increasing frequency, we describe
   an approach that can be used to improve the DQE response by increasing
   the DQE at high spatial frequencies. The approach makes use of an
   apodized-aperture pixel (AAP) design that requires use of a
   high-resolution x-ray converter such as selenium coupled to a sensor
   array with very small physical sensor elements, such as CMOS sensors.
   While sensors with elements of 10 - 25 mu m are too small for most
   practical applications in medical radiography, we describe how larger
   image pixels of a practical size can be synthesized to provide a better
   DQE than simple binning or using physical pixels of the same size. A
   theoretical cascaded-systems analysis shows the DQE at the image
   sampling cut-off frequency can be improved by up to a factor of 2.5x.
   The AAP approach was validated experimentally using a CMOS/CsI-based
   detector having 0.05-mm sensor elements. Using AAP images with 0.2-mm
   pixels, the high-frequency DQE value was increased from 0.2 to 0.4
   compared to simple 4x4 binning. It is concluded that
   ultra-high-resolution sensors can be used to optimize the high-frequency
   performance of x-ray detectors and make substantial improvements in
   image quality for visualization of small stuctures and fine image detail
   in comparison to current imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, both Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along with
   thermal expansion coefficient are allowed to vary across the radius in a
   solid ring and a curved beam. Effects of non-constant Poisson's ratio on
   the thermoelastic field in these graded axisymmetric and one-dimensional
   problems are studied. A governing differential equation in terms of
   stress function is obtained for general axisymmetric and one-dimensional
   problems. Two linearly independent solutions in terms of hypergeometric
   functions are then attained to calculate the stresses and the strains.
   Using Green's function method, a form of a solution for the stress
   functions in terms of integral equations for a curved beam and a solid
   ring are obtained. Specifically, closed form solutions for the stress
   functions, when Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are expressed as
   power law functions across the radius, are calculated. The results show
   that the effect of varying Poisson's ratio upon the thermal stresses is
   considerable for the solid ring. In addition, a non-constant Poisson's
   ratio has significant influences on the thermal strain field in solid
   rings. The effect of varying Poisson's ratio upon the thermal stresses
   is negligible for the curved beam. However, non-constant Poisson's
   ratios have substantial effects on the thermal strain field in curved
   beams. Finally, the effects of varying Poisson's ratio on the thermal
   stresses in thick solid rings and curved beams are also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(methyl methacrylate)/polystyrene/poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene)
   (PMMA/PS/NBR) tri-layer core-shell elastomeric nanoparticles were
   synthesized using a facile and robust one-pot semibatch emulsion
   polymerization technique which allows for scale-up for industrial
   production. The prepared core-shell polymer nanoparticles consist of a
   PMMA core, PS secondary layer, and diene-containing NBR outer shell.
   These nanoparticles were subsequently chemically modified via a
   ``green{''} postpolymerization process, i.e., catalytic latex
   hydrogenation without the assistance of any organic solvent. As the
   hydrogenated product, PMMA/PS/HNBR (hydrogenated NBR) tri-layer
   core-shell nanoparticles were obtained. The rate of hydrogenation was
   considerably fast and a high degree of hydrogenation was achieved.
   Meanwhile no crosslinking was observed for the polymers after the
   hydrogenation process. This study is expected to extend the research
   relating to the synthesis of polymer nanoparticles with complex
   architecture and ``green{''} chemical modification of unsaturated

Abstract = {{Today's viewers consume video content from a variety of connected
   devices, including smart phones, tablets, notebooks, TVs, and PCs. This
   imposes significant challenges for managing video traffic efficiently to
   ensure an acceptable quality-of-experience (QoE) for the end users as
   the perceptual quality of video content strongly depends on the
   properties of the display device and the viewing conditions.
   State-of-the-art full-reference objective video quality assessment
   algorithms do not take into account the combined impact of display
   device properties, viewing conditions, and video resolution while
   performing video quality assessment. We performed a subjective study in
   order to understand the impact of aforementioned factors on perceptual
   video QoE. We also propose a fullreference video QoE measure, named
   SSIMplus (https ://ece.uwaterloo.ca/similar to
   z70wang/research/ssimp1us/), that provides real-time prediction of the
   perceptual quality of a video based on human visual system behaviors,
   video content characteristics (such as spatial and temporal complexity,
   and video resolution), display device properties (such as screen size,
   resolution, and brightness), and viewing conditions (such as viewing
   distance and angle). Experimental results have shown that the proposed
   algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art video quality measures in terms
   of accuracy and speed.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Eclipse electron Monte Carlo output prediction for various

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{99-106}},
Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulation is deemed to be the leading algorithm for
   accurate dose calculation with electron beams. Patient anatomy (contours
   and tissue densities) as well as irradiation geometry is accounted for.
   The accuracy of the Monitor Unit (MU) determination is one essential
   aspect of a treatment planning system. Patient-specific quality
   assurance of a Monte Carlo plan usually involves verification of the MUs
   with an independent simpler calculation approach, in which flat geometry
   is to be assumed. The magnitude of the discrepancies between flat and
   varied surfaces for a few scenarios has been investigated in this study.
   The ability to predict MUs for various surface topologies by the
   commercial electron Monte Carlo implementation from Varian Eclipse
   system (Eclipse eMC) has been evaluated and compared to the Generalized
   Gaussian Pencil Beam (GGPB) algorithm. Ten phantoms with different
   topologies were constructed of water-equivalent material. Measurements
   with a parallel plate ionization chamber were performed using these
   phantoms to gauge their relative impact on outputs for 6, 9, 12, 16, and
   20 MeV electron beams from a Varian TrueBeam with cone sizes ranging
   from 6 x 6 cm(2) to 25 x 25 cm(2). The corresponding Monte Carlo
   simulations of the measured geometries were carried out using the CT
   scans of these phantoms. The results indicated that the Eclipse eMC
   algorithm can predict these output changes within 3\% for most
   scenarios. However, at the lowest energy, the discrepancy was the
   greatest, up to 6\%. In comparison, the Eclipse GGPB algorithm had much
   worse agreement, with discrepancies up to 17\% at the lowest energies.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion supercapacitors have been attracting tremendous research
   interest due to significantly increased energy density. However, the
   power density and cycling stability are often sacrificed by poor
   conductivity and sluggish kinetics of transitionmetal oxide-based
   electrodes. Herein, we report a composite material based on Nb2O5
   nanocrystals in situ grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a unique
   architecture exhibiting superior rate capability and long cycling
   stability. Even at 100 C-rate with charge/discharge time of 12 s, the
   composite still possesses a capacitance of similar to 160 C g(.)(-1) A
   prototype of an asymmetric lithium-ion supercapacitor composed of an
   activated carbon cathode and a CNT-Nb2O5 composite anode shows
   significantly improved energy density of similar to 50 W h kg(-1) with a
   power of 86.46 W kg(-1). Such composite materials with unique
   architecture hold great promise for future practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the cycle life of Li-S rechargeable batteries, chemically
   dispersed nanocarbon materials are usually employed as adsorbents and
   conductive matrices for cathodic nano-sized sulfur materials. Herein, a
   new assembly for Li-S cells is developed by introducing a
   montmorillonite (MMT) ceramic protective film to form an ion selective
   separator. The effect of the MMT-coated separator and the reaction
   mechanism between MMT and polysulfides are characterized via Raman and
   zeta potential analyses. The utilization of the MMT coated separator
   enables the minimization of the shuttle effect by preventing the
   diffusion of polysulfide. The best discharge capacity and cycle life are
   obtained with the MMT coated separator in a sulfur-MWCNT composite
   cathode, resulting in a discharge capacity of 1382 mA h g(-1) at a
   current density of 100 mA g(-1) and 924 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. The
   Li-S cell using the nano-sized sulfur-MWCNT composite and the MMT-coated

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to assess and reduce water residence
   times in a water distribution system in order to improve water quality.
   The methodology was developed and validated on Quebec City's main
   distribution system. A tracer study was conducted to evaluate real
   residence times and results are presented in the `companion paper' (Part
   I) in this issue. A hydraulic model was then built to simulate the mean
   residence times (MRT) and develop strategies to reduce them. An
   optimization algorithm (hybrid discrete dynamically dimensioned search,
   HD-DDS) was used to calibrate the model using flows and pressures
   measured in the distribution system. Results show that the suggested
   methodology can lead to significant reductions in MRT (25.6\%) in parts
   of the distribution system, but could also lead to significant loss in
   pressure, which should be monitored closely.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral resolution of a Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography
   (SD-OCT) image is limited by the focusing properties of the OCT imaging
   probe optics, the wavelength range which SD-OCT system operates at,
   spherical and chromatic aberrations induced by the imaging optics, the
   optical properties of the imaged object, and in the special case of
   in-vivo retinal imaging by the optics of the eye. This limitation often
   results in challenges with resolving fine details and structures of the
   imaged sample outside of the Depth-Of-Focus (DOF) range. We propose a
   novel technique for generating Laterally Resolved OCT (LR-OCT) images
   using OCT measurements acquired with intentional imbrications. The
   proposed, novel method is based on a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
   reconstruction framework which takes advantage of a Stochastic Fully
   Connected Conditional Random Field (SFCRF) model to compensate for the
   artifacts and noise when reconstructing a LR-OCT image from imbricated
   OCT measurement. The proposed lateral resolution enhancement method was
   tested on synthetic OCT measurement as well as on a human cornea SDOCT
   image to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach in lateral
   resolution enhancement. Experimental results show that applying this
   method to OCT images, noticeably improves the sharpness of morphological
   features in the OCT image and in lateral direction, thus demonstrating
   better delineation of fine dot shape details in the synthetic OCT test,
   as well as better delineation of the keratocyte cells in the human
   corneal OCT test image.}},

Abstract = {{The axial resolution of Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography
   (SD-OCT) images degrades with scanning depth due to the limited number
   of pixels and the pixel size of the camera, any aberrations in the
   spectrometer optics and wavelength dependent scattering and absorption
   in the imaged object {[}1]. Here we propose a novel algorithm which
   compensates for the blurring effect of these factors of the
   depth-dependent axial Point Spread Function (PSF) in SD-OCT images. The
   proposed method is based on a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) reconstruction
   framework which takes advantage of a Stochastic Fully Connected
   Conditional Random Field (SFCRF) model. The aim is to compensate for the
   depth-dependent axial blur in SD-OCT images and simultaneously suppress
   the speckle noise which is inherent to all OCT images. Applying the
   proposed depth-dependent axial resolution enhancement technique to an
   OCT image of cucumber considerably improved the axial resolution of the
   image especially at higher imaging depths and allowed for better
   visualization of cellular membrane and nuclei. Comparing the result of
   our proposed method with the conventional Lucy-Richardson deconvolution
   algorithm clearly demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed technique
   in better visualization and preservation of fine details and structures
   in the imaged sample, as well as better speckle noise suppression. This
   illustrates the potential usefulness of our proposed technique as a
   suitable replacement for the hardware approaches which are often very
   costly and complicated.}},

Abstract = {{This study utilized high temperature NMR and matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry to
   reveal that appreciable amounts of structural defects are present in the
   diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-quaterthiophene copolymers (PDQT) synthesized
   by the Stille coupling polymerization with Pd(PPh3)(2)Cl-2,
   Pd-2(dba)(3)/P(o-tol)(3), and Pd(PPh3)(4) catalyst systems. It was
   proposed that these structural defects were produced via homocoupling
   side reactions of the C-Br bonds and the organostannane species. Model
   Stille coupling reactions further substantiated that the amount of
   structural defects are catalyst-dependent following the order of
   Pd(PPh3)(2)Cl-2 > Pd-2(dba)(3)/P(o-tol)(3) > Pd(PPh3)(4). To verify the
   structural assignments, ``perfect{''} structurally regular PDQT polymers
   were prepared using Yamamoto coupling polymerization. When compared to
   the structurally regular polymers, the polymers containing defects
   exhibited notable redshifts in their absorption spectra. Surprisingly,
   the ``perfect{''} structurally regular polymers showed poor molecular
   ordering in thin films and very low charge transport performance as
   channel semiconductors in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). On the
   contrary, all the ``defected{''} polymers exhibited much improved
   molecular ordering and significantly higher charge carrier mobility.}},

Title = {{Effective small interfering RNA delivery in vitro via a new stearylated
   cationic peptide}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{3303-3314}},
Abstract = {{A crucial bottleneck in RNA interference-based gene therapy is the lack
   of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, a novel small interfering
   RNA (siRNA) delivery peptide, STR-HK, was constructed by conjugating a
   stearyl end to the N-terminus of the peptide sequence HHHPKPKRKV, where
   PKPKRKV is an altered sequence of the nucleus localization signal
   (PKKKRKV) and contributes to the cytosol localization of STR-HK-siRNA
   complexes. Histidine is a linker and plays an important role in
   disrupting the endosomal membrane via the proton sponge effect. As
   expected, STR-HK formed complexes with siRNA with a particle size of
   80-160 nm in diameter and efficiently delivered Cy3-labeled
   glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA into PC-3 human prostate
   cancer cells. The transfection efficiency of STR-HK at molar ratio of
   60/1 was comparable to that of Lipofectamine 2000, one of the most
   efficient commercially available transfection reagents. Furthermore, the
   STR-HK-siRNA complexes exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, which was
   significantly lower than that of Lipofectamine. Taken together, the
   strategy of conjugating the stearyl moiety with HHHPKPKRKV as a
   non-viral siRNA delivery system is advantageous.}},

Title = {{Reliability-Based Robust Design Optimization of Structures Considering
   Uncertainty in Design Variables}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the structural design optimization to cover both
   the reliability and robustness under uncertainty in design variables.
   The main objective is to improve the efficiency of the optimization
   process. To address this problem, a hybrid reliability based robust
   design optimization (RRDO) method is proposed. Prior to the design
   optimization, the Sobol sensitivity analysis is used for selecting key
   design variables and providing response variance as well, resulting in
   significantly reduced computational complexity. The single-loop
   algorithm is employed to guarantee the structural reliability, allowing
   fast optimization process. In the case of robust design, the weighting
   factor balances the response performance and variance with respect to
   the uncertainty in design variables. The main contribution of this paper
   is that the proposed method applies the RRDO strategy with the usage of
   global approximation and the Sobol sensitivity analysis, leading to the
   reduced computational cost. A structural example is given to illustrate
   the performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Pickering emulsions possess many advantages over traditional surfactant
   stabilized emulsions. For example, Pickering emulsions impart better
   stability against coalescence and, in many cases, are biologically
   compatible and environmentally friendly. These characteristics open the
   door for their use in a variety of industries spanning petroleum, food,

   considerable amounts of attention. This paper provides a concise and
   comprehensive review of Pickering emulsion systems that possess the
   ability to respond to an array of external triggers, including pH,

   the nanowire coating. Because the nanowires are 35 nm in diameter, and
   the mesh structure does not cover the entire surface like a thin-film,
   less metal is used compared to conventional silver-coated conductive
   threads. This leads to a much lower weight and mechanically flexible
   coating. The functionality of the thread as a heater and the fabrication
   of stretchable conductive thread are also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Non-contact camera-based imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) is useful
   for measuring heart rate in conditions where contact devices are
   problematic due to issues such as mobility, comfort, and sanitation.
   Existing iPPG methods analyse the light-tissue interaction of either
   active or passive (ambient) illumination. Many active iPPG methods
   assume the incident ambient light is negligible to the active
   illumination, resulting in high power requirements, while many passive
   iPPG methods assume near-constant ambient conditions. These assumptions
   can only be achieved in environments with controlled illumination and
   thus constrain the use of such devices. To increase the number of
   possible applications of iPPG devices, we propose a dual-mode active
   iPPG system that is robust to changes in ambient illumination
   variations. Our system uses a temporally-coded illumination sequence
   that is synchronized with the camera to measure both active and ambient
   illumination interaction for determining heart rate. By subtracting the
   ambient contribution, the remaining illumination data can be attributed
   to the controlled illuminant. Our device comprises a camera and an LED
   illuminant controlled by a microcontroller. The microcontroller drives
   the temporal code via synchronizing the frame captures and illumination
   time at the hardware level. By simulating changes in ambient light
   conditions, experimental results show our device is able to assess heart
   rate accurately in challenging lighting conditions. By varying the
   temporal code, we demonstrate the trade-off between camera frame rate
   and ambient light compensation for optimal blood pulse detection.}},

Abstract = {{Melanin is a pigment that is highly absorptive in the UV and visible
   electromagnetic spectra. It is responsible for perceived skin tone, and
   protects against harmful UV effects. Abnormal melanin distribution is
   often an indicator for melanoma. We propose a novel approach for
   non-contact melanin distribution via multispectral temporal illumination
   coding to estimate the two-dimensional melanin distribution based on its
   absorptive characteristics. In the proposed system, a novel
   multispectral, cross-polarized, temporally-coded illumination sequence
   is synchronized with a camera to measure reflectance under both
   multispectral and ambient illumination. This allows us to eliminate the
   ambient illumination contribution from the acquired reflectance
   measurements, and also to determine the melanin distribution in an
   observed region based on the spectral properties of melanin using the
   Beer-Lambert law. Using this information, melanin distribution maps can
   be generated for objective, quantitative assessment of skin type of
   individuals. We show that the melanin distribution map correctly
   identifies areas with high melanin densities (e.g., nevi).}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel non-contact photoplethysmographic (PPG) imaging
   system based on high-resolution video recordings of ambient reflectance
   of human bodies that compensates for body motion and takes advantage of
   skin erythema fluctuations to improve measurement reliability for the
   purpose of remote heart rate monitoring. A single measurement location
   for recording the ambient reflectance is automatically identified on an
   individual, and the motion for the location is determined over time via
   measurement location tracking. Based on the determined motion
   information motion-compensated reflectance measurements at different
   wavelengths for the measurement location can be acquired, thus providing
   more reliable measurements for the same location on the human over time.
   The reflectance measurement is used to determine skin erythema
   fluctuations over time, resulting in the capture of a PPG signal with a
   high signal-to-noise ratio. To test the efficacy of the proposed system,
   a set of experiments involving human motion in a front-facing position
   were performed under natural ambient light. The experimental results
   demonstrated that skin erythema fluctuations can achieve noticeably
   improved average accuracy in heart rate measurement when compared to

Abstract = {{Block-transform lossy image compression is the most widely-used approach
   for compressing and storing images or video. A novel algorithm to
   restore highly compressed images with greater image quality is proposed.
   Since many block-transform coefficients are reduced to zero after
   quantization, the compressed image restoration problem can be treated as
   a sparse reconstruction problem where the original image is
   reconstructed based on sparse, degraded measurements in the form of
   highly quantized block-transform coefficients. The sparse reconstruction
   problem is solved by minimizing a homotopic regularized function,
   subject to data fidelity in the block-transform domain. Experimental
   results using compressed natural images at different levels of
   compression show improved performance by using the proposed algorithm
   compared to other methods.}},

Pages = {{2869-2875}},
Abstract = {{Preconcentrating samples of dilute particles or cells to a detectable
   level is required in many chemical, environmental and biomedical
   applications. A variety of force fields have thus far been demonstrated
   to capture and accumulate particles and cells in microfluidic devices,
   which, however, all take place within the region of microchannels and
   may potentially cause channel clogging. This work presents a new method
   for the electrokinetic preconcentration of 1 mu m-diameter polystyrene
   particles and E. coli cells in a very-low-conductivity medium inside a
   microfluidic reservoir. The entire microchannel can hence be saved for a
   post-concentration analysis. This method exploits the strong
   recirculating flows of induced-charge electroosmosis to concentrate
   particles and cells near the corners of the reservoir-microchannel
   interface. Positive dielectrophoresis is found to also play a role when
   small microchannels are used at high electric fields. Such an
   in-reservoir electrokinetic preconcentration method can be easily
   implemented in a parallel mode to increase the flow throughput, which
   may potentially be used to preconcentrate bacterial pathogens in water.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The MHD flow and heat transfer from water functionalized CNTs over a
   static/moving wedge are studied numerically. Thermal conductivity and
   viscosity of both single and multiple wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   within a base fluid (water) of similar volume are investigated to
   determine the impact of these properties on thermofluid performance. The
   governing partial differential equations are converted into nonlinear,
   ordinary, and coupled differential equations and are solved using an
   implicit finite difference method with quasi-linearization techniques.
   The effects of volume fraction of CNTs and magnetic and wedge parameters
   are investigated and presented graphically. The numerical results are
   compared with the published data and are found to be in good agreement.
   It is shown that the magnetic field reduces boundary layer thickness and
   increases skin friction and Nusselt numbers. Due to higher density and
   thermal conductivity, SWCNTs offer higher skin friction and Nusselt
   numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter optimization for the conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) model
   has always been the difficult problem in hydrology since watershed
   hydrological model is high-dimensional and nonlinear with multimodal and
   nonconvex response surface and its parameters are obviously related and

   evolution (SCE-UA) global optimization method was used to calibrate the
   Xinanjiang (XAJ) model. We defined the ideal data and applied the method
   to observed data. Our results show that, in the case of ideal data, the
   data length did not affect the parameter optimization for the
   hydrological model. If the objective function was selected
   appropriately, the proposed method found the true parameter values. In
   the case of observed data, we applied the technique to different lengths
   of data (1, 2, and 3 years) and compared the results with ideal data. We
   found that errors in the data and model structure lead to significant
   uncertainties in the parameter optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical widely used both in plastics production
   as a food and beverage container and in thermal papers as a color
   developer. Dietary consumption is the main route of human exposure to
   BPA, but dermal absorption through handling different papers might be
   underestimated or ignored. In this study, BPA in different paper
   products, including different types of papers, receipts and Chinese
   currencies, were investigated. BPA was detected in receipts (n = 87) and
   Chinese currencies (n = 46) with concentrations of 0.17-2.675 x 10(4) mu
   g per g paper and 0.09-288.55 mu g per g paper, respectively. Except for
   parchment papers (n = 3), copy papers (n = 3) and food contact papers (n
   = 3), BPA was measured in all of the other paper products, with levels
   of 0.01-6.67 mu g per g paper. BPA transferred from thermal papers to
   common papers increased with the increasing contact pressure. Compared
   with that in water, the migration speed of BPA was doubled in the
   synthetic sweat. Washing hands could reduce BPA dermal exposure, and
   washing hands with lotion was the most efficient way. However, about
   19-47\% of BPA was still found on hands after different washing methods.
   Dermal absorption via handling of receipts and papers was estimated to
   be 36.45 ng per day for the general population and 1.54 x 10(-3) to
   248.73 mu g per day for a cashier. These values are below the maximum
   doses recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
   European Food Safety Authority. However, due to its uncertain adverse
   effects on human beings, long-term BPA exposure through dermal
   absorption should be paid more attention, particularly for some
   occupational populations.}},

   simulations, the shape directed growth process was found to be driven
   thermodynamically towards surface energy minimization. Control
   experiments and spectroscopy characterization were also used to
   investigate the occurrence and nature of nitrogen and sulfur doping into
   the graphitic structure of the graphene/carbon nanotube composite
   support. The impact of carbon support on ORR activity was clear, with
   the graphene/carbon nanotube composite supported CoS2 octahedra
   (CoS2-CG) outperforming CoS2 supported on just graphene or carbon
   nanotubes. Additionally, CoS2-CG provided an on-set potential (0.78 V
   vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (0.66 V vs. RHE) that was 60 mV and 150
   mV higher than the CoS2 particle agglomerates formed when no carbon
   support was included during catalyst preparation. This improved activity
   can be attributed to the beneficial properties of the nitrogen and
   sulfur doped graphene/carbon nanotube composite support, and also may
   arise due to the more favourable oxygen adsorption on the (111) surface
   of the octahedral particles predicted by theoretical calculations. By
   combining the synergistic properties of the graphene/carbon nanotube
   composite and unique shape controlled single crystal CoS2 nanoparticles,
   CoS2-CG is presented as an emerging catalyst for the ORR in fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-NiS nano-particles grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and
   single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as high-performance electrode
   materials for supercapacitors have been synthesized by a one-step
   solvothermal method. Compared to rGO, the introduction of SWNTs results
   in an obvious improvement of the electronic conductivity and keeps the
   alpha-phase crystal growth of NiS as well. The obtained NiS/SWNTs
   composite possesses outstanding electrochemical performance, giving high
   specific capacitances of 1110 F g(-1) and 825 F g(-1) at high current
   densities of 5 A g(-1) and 50 A g(-1), respectively, along with
   excellent cycling stability. Compared with rGO, the incorporation of
   SWNTs is more advantageous not only for preventing the aggregation of
   NiS particles but also for the construction of a highly conductive
   network, which allows neighboring NiS particles to achieve excellent
   high rate capacitances.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile robots that rely on vision, for navigation and object detection,
   use saliency approaches to identify a set of potential candidates to
   recognize. The state of the art in saliency detection for mobile
   robotics often rely upon visible light imaging, using conventional
   camera setups, to distinguish an object against its surroundings based
   on factors such as feature compactness, heterogeneity and/or
   homogeneity. We are demonstrating a novel multipolarimetric saliency
   detection approach which uses multiple measured polarization states of a
   scene. We leverage the light-material interaction known as Fresnel
   reflections to extract rotationally invariant multi-polarimetric
   textural representations to then train a high dimensional sparse texture
   model. The multi-polarimetric textural distinctiveness is characterized
   using a conditional probability framework based on the sparse texture
   model which is then used to determine the saliency at each pixel of the
   scene. It was observed that through the inclusion of additional
   polarized states into the saliency analysis, we were able to compute
   noticeably improved saliency maps in scenes where objects are difficult
   to distinguish from their background due to color intensity similarities
   between the object and its surroundings.}},

Abstract = {{A cell viability assay was applied to measure bacterial enteric
   pathogens in a river in southern Ontario, Canada that is used as a
   source of drinking water. Pathogen concentrations were measured using
   both propidium monoazide (PMA)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) without PMA pretreatment to compare
   viable and total (live and dead) cells. The pathogens evaluated were
   Salmonella enterica, thermophilic Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli
   O157: H7, and the suspected enteric pathogen Arcobacter butzleri was
   also investigated. Results showed that for all strains dead cells were
   detected in few river water samples, and the difference between total
   and viable cell concentrations for each pathogen group was always less
   than 0.5 log. A. butzleri was detected at concentrations 2-3 log higher
   than the other pathogens. S. enterica, Campylobacter, and E. coli O157:
   H7 were detected at low concentrations at one sample location and at
   higher concentrations at a second sampling location. Results from this
   study show qPCR with PMA pretreatment can provide reliable enumeration
   of viable pathogens in surface water, and that dead cells were rarely
   present in water used as a source for drinking water treatment.}},

   Battery Cathode}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{A716-A721}},
Abstract = {{A model-based approach to accurately predict the composition of unknown
   blended Li-ion battery cathodes by fitting to experimental discharge
   curves is demonstrated. The electrochemically active constituents of the
   electrode are first determined by coupling information from low-rate
   galvanostatic lithiation data and SEM/EDX analyses of the electrode. The
   electrode composition is then estimated using a physics-based
   mathematical model of the electrode. The accuracy of this method has
   been assessed by comparison of the estimated composition with the value
   obtained from an independent, non-electrochemical experimental technique
   involving the deconvolution of XRD spectra. The electrode compositions
   obtained in these two ways are found to be in excellent agreement,
   within 1\% of each other, demonstrating the promise of this new
   model-based approach. The method detailed in this work involves
   destructive and ex-situ testing, but only a relatively simple model is
   required to accurately determine the composition of a blended cathode in
   a Li-ion battery. This approach could also be useful for tracking the
   evolution of the blended electrode composition over the course of aging
   and gain a better understanding of the degradation mechanisms at play in
   cases where the active material loss contributes significantly to the
   overall capacity/power loss of the battery. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical

Pages = {{10-22}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The stochastic moment stability and almost-sure stability of a
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) viscoelastic system subject to
   parametric fluctuation is investigated by using the method of
   higher-order stochastic averaging. The stochastic parametric excitation
   is modeled as a wideband noise, which is taken as Gaussian white noise
   and real noise. The viscoelastic material is assumed to follow ordinary
   Maxwell linear constitutive relation. For small damping and weak
   stochastic fluctuation, analytical expressions are derived for the
   moment Lyapunov exponent and the Lyapunov exponent, which indicate
   moment stability and almost-sure stability respectively. The effects of
   various system and loading parameters on the stochastic stability are
   discussed. Both analytical and simulation results show that higher-order
   stochastic averaging improves the accuracy compared with the first-order
   stochastic averaging. However, results of the third-order averaging are
   almost overridden by those of second-order averaging and the third-order
   averaging involves far more calculation. It is advisable to consider a

   higher-order stochastic averaging. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the network throughput achieved by both
   spatial diversity and spatial frequency reuse in a wireless ad hoc
   network with randomly positioned single-hop source-destination pairs and
   relays. Compared with conventional direct transmissions, cooperative
   communication can enhance single-link transmission reliability but
   reduce network-wide spatial frequency reuse due to relay transmissions.
   To study the tradeoff between these two competing effects, we construct
   a geographically constrained region for relay selection based on channel
   state information. The network throughput, defined as the product of the
   success probability of each link and the expected number of concurrent
   transmissions, is derived as a function of the total number of links,
   relay density, size of relay selection region, and distance between the
   source and destination. The performance analysis is carried out for both
   selection combining and maximum ratio combining at the destination. Such
   analytical results can evaluate the effectiveness of cooperative
   communication and provide useful insights on the design of large-scale
   networks. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the
   performance analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider low-complexity detection of coded spatial
   data streams with uniform power and nonuniform rate distribution in a
   single-user MIMO system. The receiver decodes these different streams as
   if facing a multiple access channel (MAC). Conventional receiver
   solutions for such schemes are based on successive interference
   cancellation (SIC) by employing a linear minimum mean square error
   (MMSE) successive stripping detector, where the optimality is
   nonetheless constrained to Gaussian codebooks. As a remedy, this paper
   introduces a novel near-optimal low-complexity max-log-MAP demodulator
   for a 2 x n(r) system (n(r) is the number of receive antennas) which
   reduces the complexity of detection from O(vertical bar chi vertical
   bar(2)) to O(vertical bar chi vertical bar(1)), where vertical bar chi
   vertical bar indicates the size of the signal set. In the sequel, we
   extend the proposed low-complexity demodulation scheme to
   higher-dimensional MIMO systems via a hybrid detector, where significant
   complexity saving is realized at the expense of slight performance
   degradation.}},

Pages = {{16461-16475}},
Abstract = {{Nanostructured gold can improve the ability to detect biomolecules.
   Whether planar nanostructured surfaces or nanostructured particles are
   used, similar principles governing the enhancement apply. The two main
   benefits of nanostructured gold are improved geometry and enhancement of
   optical detection methods. Nanostructuring improves the geometry by
   making surface-bound receptors more accessible and by increasing the
   surface area. Optical detection methods are enhanced due to the
   plasmonic properties of nanoscale gold, leading to localized surface
   plasmon resonance sensing (LSPR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS), enhancement of conventional surface plasmon resonance sensing
   (SPR), surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and
   metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF). Anisotropic, particularly spiky,
   surfaces often feature a high density of nanostructures that show an
   especially large enhancement due to the presence of electromagnetic
   hot-spots and thus are of particular interest. In this review, we
   discuss these benefits and describe examples of nanostructured and spiky
   gold on planar surfaces and particles for applications in biomolecule
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that mechanical stimulus can affect cellular
   behavior. While induced differentiation in stem cells and proliferation
   and directional migration in fibroblasts are reported as responses to
   mechanical stimuli, little is known about the response of cells from the
   cornea. In the present study, we investigated whether changes in
   substrate stiffness (measured by elastic modulus) affected the behavior
   of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Polyacrylamide substrates
   with different elastic moduli (compliant, medium and stiff) were
   prepared and HCECs were cultured on them. HCECs responses, including
   cell viability, apoptosis, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
   expression, integrin-alpha(3)beta(1) expression and changes in
   cytoskeleton structure (actin fibers) and migratory behavior, were
   studied. No statistically significant cell activation, as measured by
   ICAM-1 expression, was observed. However, on compliant substrates, a
   higher number of cells were found to be apoptotic and disrupted actin
   fibers were observed. Furthermore, cells displayed a statistically
   significant lower migration speed on compliant substrates when compared
   with the stiffer substrates. Thus, corneal epithelial cells respond to
   changes in substrate stiffness, which may have implications in the
   understanding and perhaps treatment of corneal diseases, such as
   keratoconus. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Since FCC's opening for white space (WS) utilization, database-assisted
   dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has become the de facto solution for the
   realization of dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), due to its simplicity and
   compatibility with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. It is
   envisioned that such technology will strongly support the prosperous
   wireless multimedia networking (WMN) applications with satisfying QoS
   guarantees in the future. However, how to counter the time-frequency
   variant property when exploiting the WS spectrum for the provision of
   these services to secondary users (SUs) still remains a great challenge.
   In such context, a dynamic secondary access scheme for database-assisted
   spectrum sharing networks is proposed in this paper. In the beginning,
   the spectrum requirements of SUs for diverse services are modeled by
   considering the minimum required service data-rate and spectrum access
   duration. Afterwards, the spectrum demand evaluation and bidding policy
   are formulated based on the service classes of SUs. Furthermore, a
   double-phase (DP) spectrum allocation scheme, which consists of the
   initial resource allocation phase and resource allocation adjustment
   phase, is carefully designed for DSA. Finally, extensive simulations are
   conducted and the results demonstrate that our scheme can increase the
   spectrum trading revenue and adapt to varying service requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The synthetic semi-crystalline polymer poly(trimethylene carbonate)
   PTMC50 was linked to the synthetic poly(amino acid) poly(glutamic acid)
   (PGA(15)) using the peptide PVGLIG, known to be selectively cleaved by

   combination of thiol-ene coupling and ring-opening polymerization.
   Stable, monodisperse, sub-micron sized polymersomes were subsequently
   obtained by self-assembly and characterized by dynamic and static light
   scattering (DLS and SLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   These vesicles showed selective degradation in the presence of MMP-2 as
   probed by DLS. The model drug imipramine hydrochloride was loaded at
   35\% encapsulation efficiency by co-precipitation and displayed
   controlled drug-release behavior. Drug release rates showed several fold
   increases when exposed to pH, temperature and most significantly, to the
   tumor-associated enzyme MMP-2. Such structures, bearing precise location
   of the cleavable peptide sequence, may hold promise as future specific

Title = {{The dopaminergic system in upper limb motor blocks (ULMB) investigated

Abstract = {{Upper limb motor blocks (ULMB) (inability to initiate or sudden
   discontinue in voluntary movements) have been identified in both
   unimanual and bimanual tasks in individuals with Parkinson's disease
   (PD). In particular, ULMB have been observed during rhythmic bimanual
   coordination when switching between phase patterns which is required
   (e.g. between in-phase and anti-phase). While sensory-perceptual
   mechanisms have recently been suggested to be involved in lower limb
   freezing, there has been no consensus on the mechanism that evokes ULMB
   or whether motor blocks respond to dopamine replacement like other motor
   symptoms of PD. The current study investigated the occurrence of ULMB in
   PD participants without ('off') and with ('on') dopamine replacement
   using bimanual wrist flexion-extension with external auditory cues. In
   Experiment 1, coordination was performed in either in-phase
   (simultaneous flexion and extension) or anti-phase (asymmetrical flexion
   and extension between the limbs) in one of three sensory conditions: no
   vision, normal vision or augmented vision. Cycle frequency was increased
   within each trial across seven cycle frequencies (0.75-2 Hz). In
   Experiment 2, coordination was initiated in either phase pattern and
   participants were cued to make an intentional switch between phases in
   the middle of trials. Trials were performed at one of two cycle
   frequencies (1 or 2 Hz) and one of two sensory conditions: no vision or
   normal vision. Healthy age-matched control participants were also
   investigated in both experiments for the occurrence of motor blocks that
   were measured using automated detection from a computer algorithm. The
   results from Experiment 1 indicated that increasing cycle frequency
   resulted in more ULMB in individuals with PD during continuous
   coordinated movement, regardless of dopaminergic status, phase pattern
   or sensory condition. Experiment 2 also confirmed an increased
   occurrence of ULMB with increased cycle frequency. Furthermore, a large
   amount of ULMB were observed when initiating anti-phase coordination at
   2 Hz, as well as after both externally-cued switches and in `catch
   trials' with distracting auditory cues when no switch was required.
   Dopamine replacement was not found to influence the frequency of ULMB in
   either experiment. Therefore, ULMB likely result from
   non-hypodopaminergic impairments associated with PD. Specifically, ULMB
   may be caused by an inability to shift attentional control under
   increased cognitive demand that could be associated with hypoactivation
   in motor and prefrontal areas.}},

Title = {{More uniform Pd distribution in free-air balls of Pd-coated Cu bonding

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{The currently high price of gold wire has led to the development of
   bonding wire made from palladium-coated-copper as a lower cost
   alternative. Increasing the uniformity of the Pd distribution in
   free-air balls, formed by melting the wire end with an electric spark,
   is of interest as it can influence the uniformity of process and
   reliability. To study this Pd distribution, free-air balls are made
   using four distinct electrical flame-off (spark) processes with short
   and long spark times from wire bonders with fixed and movable
   electrodes. Elemental analysis of the free-air ball surfaces reveal a
   higher Pd concentration on the movable electrode free-air balls than on
   the fixed electrode free-air balls. Elemental analysis of cross-sections
   show that the Pd distribution in free-air balls made with a fixed
   electrode has Pd trails flowing from the neck into the Cu ball center.
   Furthermore, micro- and nano-voids are observed to follow the Pd trails.
   In contrast, free-air balls made with a movable electrode exhibit less
   severe voiding and retain a uniform, thin Pd layer along the surface up
   to the tip of the free-air ball (shorter spark time). This can help to
   increase process consistency and reliability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The synthesis and properties of a new polymer semiconductor comprising
   an electron accepting pyridine-flanked DPP unit and an electron-donating
   thieno{[}3,2-b] thiophene unit are reported. This polymer has rather
   low-lying energy levels, which allows transporting both electrons and
   holes. High crystallinity and a shorter pi-pi stacking distance of 0.36
   nm are achieved due to the strong intermolecular interaction, which are
   beneficial for charge carrier transport in organic thin film transistors
   (OTFTs). Well-balanced high electron and hole mobilities up to 3.36
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 2.65 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively, are obtained in
   top-gate bottom-contact OTFT devices using gold as source and drain
   contacts. When the contact electrodes are modified with an ultrathin
   layer (similar to 3 nm) of polyethylenimine (PEI) to suppress hole
   injection, a unipolar n-type semiconductor performance with a high
   electron mobility of 2.38 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) is realized.}},

Title = {{Quantifying ultraviolet inactivation kinetics in nearly opaque fluids}},
Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{34-46}},
Abstract = {{The use of ultraviolet light for inactivation of pathogens is an
   engrained, low-cost, eco-friendly method for disinfection of nearly
   transparent (UVT254 > 30\%/cm) contaminated fluids for which a
   standard-collimated beam apparatus is typically used for measurement of
   intrinsic inactivation kinetics. However, such a device cannot be used
   for low ultraviolet transmittance (UVT254 < 30\%/cm) and nearly opaque
   (UVT254 < 10\%/cm) fluids because of the lack of sufficient mixing and
   intrinsic inactivation kinetics controlled by dose distribution and
   mass-transfer effects. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) model was used to determine the validity regime for accurate
   ultraviolet inactivation kinetics studies in low transmittance and
   nearly opaque fluids when a new Taylor-Couette collimated beam
   apparatus, which exploits flow instability through the formation of
   toroidal counter-rotating vortices, is used for irradiations. A Taylor
   number of similar to 46,500 was sufficient to overcome the very short UV
   light penetration at UVT254 similar to 0.001\%/cm as long as the log(10)
   reduction value was used as controlling parameter. Specifically, it was
   identified that, in case of first-order inactivation kinetics, the
   applied average dose (AD) should not be higher than three times the dose
   required for one log(10) inactivation (also known as D-10) in order to
   generate data for accurate kinetic studies.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{User cooperation exploits nearby mobile devices as relays and offers an
   opportunity to enable multipath transmission for multi-homed mobile
   devices, even when there is no multiple access coverage. MPTCP by
   Internet Engineering Task Force is a promising solution to support
   simultaneous delivery of TCP packets over multiple paths. One key
   component of MPTCP is the coupled congestion control algorithm, which
   aims to aggregate available bandwidths of multiple paths while avoiding
   aggressive behavior to regular single-path TCP traffic sharing the
   paths. However, we find out that in a user cooperation scenario, the
   throughput of local single-path traffic of relays can be severely
   degraded by forwarding subflows of MPTCP, which can jeopardize the
   motivation for user cooperation. In this article we propose extensions
   to the congestion control of MPTCP for a user cooperation scenario in
   the Long Term Evolution network. The local traffic at relays can be
   controlled by regular TCP and more generic additive-increase and
   multiplicative-decrease protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that
   our extensions do not degrade performance for adding MPTCP subflows to
   local traffic, and thus better promote user cooperation.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Traffic monitoring in urban transportation systems can be carried out
   based on vehicular sensor networks. Probe vehicles (PVs), such as taxis
   and buses, and floating cars (FCs), such as patrol cars for
   surveillance, can act as mobile sensors for sensing the urban traffic
   and send the reports to a traffic-monitoring center (TMC) for traffic
   estimation. In the TMC, sensing reports are aggregated to form a traffic
   matrix, which is used to extract traffic information. Since the sensing
   vehicles cannot cover all the roads all the time, the TMC needs to
   estimate the unsampled data in the traffic matrix. As this matrix can be
   approximated to be of low rank, matrix completion (MC) is an effective
   method to estimate the unsampled data. However, our previous analysis on
   the real traces of taxis in Shanghai reveals that MC methods do not work
   well due to the uneven samples of PVs, which is common in urban traffic.
   To exploit the intrinsic relationship between the unevenness of samples
   and traffic estimation error, we study the temporal and spatial
   entropies of samples and successfully define the important criterion,
   i.e., average entropy of the sampling process. A new sampling rule based
   on this relationship is proposed to improve the performance of
   estimation and monitoring. With the sampling rule, two new patrol
   algorithms are introduced to plan the paths of controllable FCs to
   proactively participate in traffic monitoring. By utilizing the patrol
   algorithms for real-data-set analysis, the estimation error reduces from

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study concurrent beamforming issue for achieving high
   capacity in indoor millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. The general
   concurrent beamforming issue is first formulated as an optimization
   problem to maximize the sum rates of concurrent transmissions,
   considering the mutual interference. To reduce the complexity of
   beamforming and the total setup time, concurrent beamforming is
   decomposed into multiple single-link beamforming, and an iterative
   searching algorithm is proposed to quickly achieve the suboptimal
   transmission/reception beam sets. A codebook-based beamforming protocol
   at medium access control (MAC) layer is then introduced in a
   distributive manner to determine the beam sets. Both analytical and
   simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol can
   drastically reduce total setup time, increase system throughput, and
   improve energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Anode materials of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have been
   developed towards the aim of high power density, long cycle life, and
   environmental benignity. As a promising anode material for high power
   density batteries for large scale applications in both electric vehicle
   and large stationary power supplies, the spinet Li4Ti5O12 anode has
   become more attractive for alternative anodes for its relatively high
   theoretical capacity (175 mA h g(-1)), stable voltage plateau of 1.5 V
   vs. Li/Li+, better cycling performance, high safety, easy fabrication,
   and low cost precursors. This perspective first introduces recent
   studies on the electronic structure and performance, synthesis methods,
   and strategies for improvement including carbon-coating, ion-doping,
   surface modifications, nano-structuring and optimization of the particle
   morphology of the Li4Ti5O12 anode. Furthermore, practical applications
   of the commercial spinet lithium-ion batteries are demonstrated.
   Finally, the future research directions and key developments of the
   spinet Li4Ti5O12 anode are pointed out from a scientific and an
   industrial point of view. In addition, the prospect of the synthesis of
   graphene Li4Ti5O12 hybrid composite anode materials for next-generation
   lithium-ion batteries is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{RANS simulations of the Delft-Jet-in-Hot-Coflow (DJHC) flame operating
   in the Moderate and Intense Low Oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion mode,
   are performed using the Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE)
   approach. The non-premixed CSE formulation is extended, by introducing a
   second mixture fraction. Two flames are simulated, DJHC-I 4100 and
   DJHC-I 8800. Detailed chemistry tabulations and radiation are included.
   The objective of the current study is to assess the capabilities of CSE
   to accurately reproduce the velocity field, temperatures and lift-off
   height using the DJHC experimental conditions. The present RANS-CSE
   predictions for the axial velocity and turbulent kinetic energy agree
   well with the experimental data for both flames. For DJHC-I 4100, the
   radial CSE temperature predictions are in very good agreement with the
   experiments. The current CSE performs better compared to previous
   numerical simulations. This is explained by differences in model
   formulation and mesh configuration. For the second flame, a good
   agreement is achieved, in particular in the second half of the flame in
   the radial direction. A temperature overprediction is observed near the
   centreline. At the last axial location, CSE overpredicts the
   temperatures for most parts of the flame. These discrepancies are
   explained by some inaccuracies in the turbulent mixing due to RANS. The
   trend of lift-off height decreasing with increasing Reynolds number is
   well reproduced. However, the lift-off height appears to be lower than
   the experimental value. The present predictions are shown to be
   independent of the number of CSE ensembles. Further improvement is
   expected with LES for the turbulent flow and mixing fields. A third
   conditioning variable may also be considered to improve the lift-off
   height predictions. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Thin film composite (TFC) nanofiltration membranes were fabricated by
   interfacial polymerization using polymeric amine polyethylenimine (PEI)
   and monomeric amine piperazine (PIP) as the amine reactant. Membranes
   with a single-ply polyamide layer were produced by reacting trimesoyl
   chloride (TMC) with mixed amines of PEI and PIP, and incorporation of a
   small amount of PIP in PEI was found to increase the permeation flux
   effectively while still maintaining a good solute rejection. For
   instance, adding 10 wt\% PIP in the amine reactant solution resulted in
   a 6-fold increase in permeation flux, while a 91.6\% MgCl2 rejection was
   maintained. In addition, 2-ply polyamide membranes were also prepared by
   two cycles of PEI-TMC and PIP-TMC interfacial reactions separately, and
   they showed a higher rejection than the single-ply polyamide membrane.
   At a low PIP/PEI concentration ratio, the single-ply polyamide membranes
   formed with mixed amines of PIP and PEI tended to be more permeable than
   the 2-ply polyamide membranes. However, it was demonstrated that by
   properly controlling the PIP/PEI concentration ratio, the 2-ply
   polyamide membranes with both a higher permeation flux and salt
   rejection than conventional single-ply polyamide membranes could be
   produced. The resulting membranes were characterized for chemical
   composition, surface hydrophilicity, surface charge and morphology of
   the polyamide skin layer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   2,7-dibromocarbazole, 1,4-dibromobenzene, bithiophene,
   dithienyl-benzothiadiazole, and diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives. All

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{107-116}},

Abstract = {{A robust computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model accounting for both
   spatial and temporal dynamics of a subsurface vertical flow treatment
   wetland system was developed by combining fluid transport, solute
   transport, biokinetics, biofilm development, and biofilm
   detachment/sloughing using COMSOL Multiphysics (TM). The local porosity
   of the porous media was calculated based on the estimated biofilm
   development over time. The biofilm development sub-model considered both
   organic pollutant metabolism/degradation as a mechanism for microbial
   growth and the effect of fluid shear stress on the local biofilm
   detachment. The influence of biofilm accumulation on the permeability of
   the porous media was considered using the Kozeney-Carman relation. The
   permeability of the porous media was estimated by calibrating the model
   against experimental tracer data that had been collected in a full
   water-recirculation batch operation. As the biofilm developed from
   start-up, removal efficiency of readily biodegradable organic matter
   improved during the first 10 weeks of operation while no significant
   change was predicted after 10 weeks. A dead-zone region was predicted
   near the bottom of the system opposite to the outflow port after 100
   days of operation attributed to exponential biofilm growth and low
   biofilm detachment rates. A decrease of 95\% in the advective transport
   of organic matter in the dead-zone region occurred after 280 days of
   operation. No appreciable biofilm accumulation was predicted in the
   region near the outlet due to the high fluid shear stress acting on the
   biofilm surface. The averaged porosity of the mesocosm decreased by
   6.6\% after 365 days of operation while the local porosity in the
   dead-zone region decreased by 71\%. Good agreement was found between the
   averaged porosity of the entire system and experimental data. This is
   the first model to integrate hydrodynamics, solute transport,
   biokinetics relating to pollutant removal, biofilm development, and
   biofilm detachment into a comprehensive model. Although computationally
   intensive, this is the first model to predict bio-clogging processes in
   a spatial manner similar to what would be realistically expected. (C))

Abstract = {{Multiple channels in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often exploited
   to support parallel transmission and to reduce interference. However,
   the extra overhead posed by the multi-channel usage coordination
   dramatically challenges the energy-constrained WSNs. In this paper, we
   propose a Regret Matching based Channel Assignment algorithm (RMCA) to
   address this challenge, in which each sensor node updates its choice of
   channels according to the historical record of these channels'
   performance to reduce interference. The advantage of RMCA is that it is
   highly distributed and requires very limited information exchange among
   sensor nodes. It is proved that RMCA converges almost surely to the set
   of correlated equilibrium. Moreover, RMCA can adapt the channel
   assignment among sensor nodes to the time-variant flows and network
   topology. Simulations show that RMCA achieves better network performance
   in terms of both delivery ratio and packet latency than CONTROL {[}1],
   MMSN {[}2] and randomized CSMA. In addition, real hardware experiments
   are conducted to demonstrate that RMCA is easy to be implemented and
   performs better.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a cost-benefit based approach to the problem of
   finding the optimal location and density of road weather information
   system (RWIS) stations over a regional road network. The novelty of the
   proposed method lies in the models that can be used to estimate the
   benefits of RWIS information, including reduced maintenance costs and
   collisions, thus determining the optimal number and location of a RWIS
   network. A case study based on the existing RWIS network in Northern
   Minnesota in the US is used to show the application of the proposed
   approach. Linear regression models are developed for the annual
   maintenance costs and the expected number of collisions that could occur
   on two types of highways delineated by the existence of a RWIS station
   nearby. The calibrated models are then applied to individual highway
   segments defined on the basis of a uniform grid system to determine the
   expected benefit of having a RWIS station installed. These benefits
   along with RWIS installation and maintenance costs are converted into
   net benefits and then the net present value, which are then used in
   determining the optimal number of RWIS stations and prioritizing the
   candidate locations. It was found from the case study that a total of 45
   stations would provide the best return of investment with a 25 year net
   benefit of approximately \$6.5 million and a life-cycle benefit-to-cost
   ratio of 3.5.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs) filled with silver nanoparticle
   (Ag NP)-decorated graphene were prepared and the effect of curing
   temperature on the electrical conductivity of the ECAs was discussed.
   Mono-dispersed Ag NPs with an average size of 9 nm were successfully
   deposited and simultaneously functionalized with mercaptopropionic acid
   (MPA) on graphene surface. The surface functionalization of the NPs with
   MPA made the decorated graphene dispersible in organic solvents, which
   facilitated its dispersion inside epoxy. The decorated graphene was
   added into conventional ECAs (consisting of silver flakes and epoxy) at
   concentrations close to the percolation threshold and beyond that
   resulting in a significant electrical conductivity improvement
   (especially at concentrations close to the percolation threshold). The
   electrical resistivity of hybrid ECAs with the decorated graphene
   decreased as the curing temperature increased. Curing the ECA with 1
   wt\% of the decorated graphene at 220 A degrees C resulted in a highly
   conductive adhesive with a low electrical resistivity of 4.6 x 10(-5)
   Omega cm (close to that of eutectic lead based solders). The dramatic
   electrical conductivity improvement of ECAs is due to the sintering
   between small Ag NPs on the graphene surface and silver flakes.
   Morphological and thermal studies showed that Ag NPs start to sinter at
   approximately 150 A degrees C when the MPA layer began to decompose from
   their surface. The quality of filler-filler interaction was investigated
   by monitoring the effect of temperature on the electrical resistivity of
   conductive fillers ``thin-film{''} before their addition to epoxy.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{489}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Mg-Zn mixed oxides with different Mg to Zn mole ratio were synthesized
   using a CO2 precipitation method and studied for the transesterification
   of soybean oil with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)
   or biodiesel. The Mg to Zn optimized mole ratio was found to be about 3,
   denoted as Mg3Zn1. Different Mg3Zn1 catalysts synthesized using
   co-precipitation (Cop), impregnation (IMP) and urea hydrolysis (urea)
   methods were also studied for FAME production. All Mg-Zn mixed oxides
   were characterized by FOR, XRD, TG/DTA, CO2-TPD and HR-TEM/SEM-EDX
   techniques. Formation of FAME in this study was influenced by the Mg to
   Zn molar ratio and preparative parameters. The maximum FAME content
   (90\% mass) was obtained at 65 degrees C for the Mg3Zn1 CO2
   precipitation (Mg3Zn1 CO(2)ppt) catalyst wherein a mixed oxide lattice
   Zn-Mg-O was established by HR-TEM. The contribution towards the greater
   biodiesel content was mainly attributed to the Zn-Mg-O lattice basic
   sites. The catalytic activity of Mg-Zn mixed oxides for FAME formation
   increases as follows; ZnO approximate to Mg3Zn1 urea < Mg1Zn1
   approximate to Mg3Zn1 IMP < Mg5Zn1 < MgO < Mg3Zn1 Cop < Mg3Zn1 CO(2)ppt.

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for tools automating the processing of as-built
   3D laser scanned data, and more particularly the comparison of this
   as-built data with planned works. This paper particularly considers the
   case of tracking MEP components with circular cross-sections, which
   essentially include pipes, and some conduits and ducts. Discrepancies
   between the as-built and as-planned status of pipes, conduit and
   ductwork result from changes that occur in the field and that are either
   unnoticed (human error) or not reflected in the 3D model. Previous
   research has shown that the Hough transform, with judiciously applied
   domain constraints, is a practical and cost-effective approach to find,
   recognize and reconstruct cylindrical MEP works within point clouds
   automatically. Previous research has also shown that ``Scan-vs-BIM{''}
   systems that are based on the geometric alignment and comparison of
   as-built laser scans with as-designed BIM models can effectively
   recognize and identify MEP components as long as they are constructed
   near their as-planned locations. The research presented in this paper
   combines the two techniques in a unified approach for more robust
   automated comparison of as-built and as-planned cylindrical MEP works,
   thereby providing the basis for automated earned value tracking,
   automated percent-built-as-planned measures, and assistance for the
   delivery of as-built BIM models from as-designed ones. The proposed
   approach and its improved performance are validated using data acquired
   from an actual construction site. The results are very encouraging and
   demonstrate the added value of the proposed integrated approach over the
   rather simpler Scan-vs-BIM system. The two main areas of improved
   performance are: (1) the enabled recognition and identification of
   objects that are not built at their as-planned locations; and (2) the
   consideration for pipe completeness in the pipe recognition and
   identification metric. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The built environment serves as a dynamic interface through which human
   society and the ecosystem interact and influence each other.
   Understanding this interdependence is a key to understanding
   sustainability as it applies to civil engineering. There is a growing
   consensus that delivering a sustainable built environment starts with
   incorporating sustainability thoughts at the planning and design stages
   of an infrastructure construction project. Geotechnical engineering can
   significantly influence the sustainability of infrastructure development
   because of its early position in the construction process. In this
   paper, the scope of geotechnical engineering towards sustainable
   development of civil infrastructure is reviewed. The philosophies and
   definitions of sustainability as applicable to geotechnical engineering
   are discussed. A comprehensive review of the research and case studies
   performed in geotechnical engineering, in relation to sustainable
   development, is presented in an effort to outline the scope and goals of
   sustainable geotechnical engineering.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{353-357}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An ordinary patch antenna can be modeled as a simple resonance LC
   parallel circuit. This means that the resonant frequency may be lowered
   if the patch has slot cuts to increase the inductance L without
   affecting the parallel C. This communication presents a novel design of
   miniaturizing: a square patch with 4-C shaped slots of two
   polarizations. The antenna is miniaturized to lambda(o)/8 size but with
   excellent port isolation of more than -30 dB. It has two polarizations,
   with a simulated bandwidth of about 6.9\%. The T-probes are used to feed
   the 4-C slot-cut patches to widen the bandwidth. A lumped circuit
   feeding for the 4-C slot-cut patch antenna is also introduced. The
   lumped components can replace the single-stubs of the T-shaped proximity
   feed and thus maintain the miniature size. Although our design has a low
   radiation efficiency of similar to 20\%, it provides a low-cost solution
   that is useful for applications of short-range two-way communications
   (e.g., antenna of wireless mouse). The idea can be used to simplify the
   industrial transceiver design.}},

Abstract = {{Latching RF MEMS Switches of Single-PoleSingle- Throw (SPST),
   Single-Pole-Double-Throw (SPDT) and Single-Pole-Triple-Throw (SP3T)
   types are proposed. The switches are built of a 20 mu m thick nickel
   layer covered with a plated 2 mu m gold on the top and side walls of
   nickel layer eliminating any potential warping due to thermal mismatch.
   The switches are actuated using a high stroke latching thermal actuator
   that exhibits a 32 mu m displacement with a dc power of 250 mW under
   ambient pressure at 25 degrees C (298 degrees K) to and 153 mW under
   vacuum at -193 degrees C (80 degrees K). The measured velocity for the
   actuator is 2.3 mu m/msec. The RF measurement of the SPST switch is done
   under ambient and vacuum and over a wide range of temperatures from 25
   degrees C (298 degrees K) to (80 degrees K). The switches survived a
   temperature cyclic test from 25 degrees C (298) to 85 degrees C (358
   degrees K) with a total variation of 0.2 dB in insertion loss. The
   switch demonstrates a worst IP3 of 60.14 dBm and high power handling
   capabilities that exceeds 30Watt, only tested for an hour in 1 cycle.
   The RF performance of the SPST, SPDT and SP3T exhibits a worst insertion
   loss of 0.8 dB, 1.2 dB and 1.5 dB up to 40 GHz, 40 GHz and 18 GHz,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Gene therapy using RNA interference (RNAi) technology has been explored
   to treat cancers, by regulating the expression of oncogene. However,
   even though small interfering RNA (siRNA), which triggers RNAi, may have
   great therapeutic potential, efforts at using them in vivo have been
   hampered by the difficulty of effective and safe delivery into cells of
   interest. In this study, to develop a safe and efficient carrier for in
   vitro and in vivo siRNA delivery, we designed a peptide library. These
   peptides are improved variants of a known peptide based siRNA carrier
   C6. All the modifications improved the transfection efficiency of C6 to
   some degree. After completing prescreening for activity, several
   promising candidates were used for further evaluation. Selected peptides
   C6M3 and C6M6 could form stable complexes with siRNA. These complexes
   could be greatly uptaken by cells and showed a punctate perinuclear
   distribution. Moreover, peptide/siRNA complexes achieved high
   transfection efficiency in vitro without inducing substantial
   cytotoxicity. We have validated the therapeutic potential of this
   strategy for cancer treatment by targeting Bcl-2 gene in mouse tumor
   models, and demonstrated that tumor growth was inhibited. In order to
   address possible immune side effects of these peptide carriers,
   biocompatibility study in terms of complement activation and cytokine
   activation assay were carried out, whereas none of the peptides induced
   such effects. In conclusion, these results support the potential of
   these peptides as therapeutic siRNA carrier.}},

Abstract = {{In the past four decades, non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs) have been
   extensively studied as low-cost catalyst alternatives to Pt for the
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM)
   fuel cells. However, the role of transition metal playing in the
   catalysts' active sites is still a subject of controversy. In order to
   further clarify the nature of the active sites of NPMCs, in this work,
   using aminopyrine (Apyr) as the nitrogen precursor, Co-, Fe-, Cu-, Mn-,
   and Ni-incorporated nitrogen-containing electrocatalysts are synthesized
   for fuel cell ORR in alkaline media. The catalysts' ORR performance can
   be significantly improved by pyrolysis when the catalysts are
   incorporated by different transition metals. The observed catalytic
   activity order is: Co >> Fe similar to Cu > Mn >> Ni. However, with
   respect to the electron transfer numbers (selectivity), the order is: Fe
   > Mn > Co >> Cu > Ni. XRD results reveal that Mn and Fe are more likely
   to be combined with S than Co, Ni and Cu. XPS analysis indicates that N
   concentration has a negative correlation with S concentration in the
   pyrolyzed catalysts, indicating a competitive mechanism between N and S
   on catalyst surfaces when metal sulfate is applied as the transition
   metal precursor. For ORR active site identification, the surface N
   species analysis reveals that catalyst containing more M-N group would
   give a higher catalytic ORR activity, while the metal incorporation is
   essential in the ORR active site structure, forming the M-Nx/C catalysts
   rather than just serving to catalyze the formation of N/C active sites.}},

Abstract = {{Strengthening in age-hardenable alloys is mainly achieved through
   nano-scale precipitates whose formation paths from the atomic-scale,
   solute-enriched entities are rarely analyzed and understood in a
   directly verifiable way. Here, we discover a pathway for the
   earliest-stage precipitation in Al-Mg-Si alloys: solute clustering
   leading to three successive variants of face-centered cubic (fcc)
   clusters, followed by the formation of non-fcc GP-zones. The clusters,
   which originally assume a spherical morphology (Cl), evolve into
   elongated clusters and orient themselves on \{111\}(Al), (C2) and
   subsequently on \{100\}(Al) planes and < 100 >(Al) directions (C3). We
   also analyze the association of quenched-in dislocations with clustering
   phenomena. The results of this work can open a new frontier in advancing
   alloy-process-property design for commercially important age-hardenable
   Al alloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We propose a simple yet effective structure-guided statistical textural
   distinctiveness approach to salient region detection. Our method uses a
   multilayer approach to analyze the structural and textural
   characteristics of natural images as important features for salient
   region detection from a scale point of view. To represent the structural
   characteristics, we abstract the image using structured image elements
   and extract rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural
   representations to characterize each element by an individual texture
   pattern. We then learn a set of representative texture atoms for sparse
   texture modeling and construct a statistical textural distinctiveness
   matrix to determine the distinctiveness between all representative
   texture atom pairs in each layer. Finally, we determine saliency maps
   for each layer based on the occurrence probability of the texture atoms
   and their respective statistical textural distinctiveness and fuse them
   to compute a final saliency map. Experimental results using four public
   data sets and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that our
   approach provides promising results when compared with existing salient
   region detection approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the following question regarding Gaussian networks:
   Is there an alternative to decoding interference or treating
   interference as Gaussian noise? To state our result, we study a
   decentralized network of one primary user (PU) and one secondary user
   (SU) modeled by a two-user Gaussian interference channel. In one
   scenario, the primary transmitter is constellation-based and PUs
   codebook is constructed over its modulation signal set. Assuming SU is
   aware of the constellation points of PU, the interference plus noise at
   the secondary receiver is modeled by a mixed Gaussian process. We show
   that SU can achieve larger rates by matching its decoder to the actual
   interference plus noise compared with the case where the secondary
   receiver performs nearest neighbor decoding (NND). In another scenario,
   we assume that PU utilizes a predetermined point-to-point code. We ask
   if SU can utilize its knowledge about PUs codebook without decoding PUs
   codewords. The proposed strategy assumes each transmitted codeword of SU
   overlaps with infinitely many transmitted codewords of PU, referred to
   as the unequal codeword-length (UCL) strategy. The secondary receiver
   views PU as a virtual user that is constellation-based and its
   modulation signal set is the codebook of the actual PU. UCL is compared
   with other strategies, namely, interference cancellation (IC), joint
   decoding, and NND. It is shown that UCL can outperform both IC and NND
   simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{The recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution
   in the use of distribution systems and the emergence of ``smart grid{''}
   concepts. Smart grids are intended primarily as a means of facilitating
   the integration of renewable energy sources and of achieving greater
   system reliability and efficiency. Energy storage systems (ESSs) offer a
   number of benefits that can help utilities move toward those goals. One
   of those benefits is the capacity to improve the utilization of network
   infrastructure by means of proper load management. This paper proposes a
   methodology for allocating ESSs in distribution systems in order to
   defer system upgrades, minimize system losses, and take advantage of the
   arbitrage benefit. The cost and arbitrage benefit of energy storage
   installation are optimized with respect to system upgrade and energy
   losses costs. The primary goal of this research is to determine the
   optimal size and location of storage units to be installed, in addition
   to their optimal operation, so that total system costs are minimized,
   while system benefits are maximized. In this paper, a probabilistic load
   model is adopted instead of utilizing time-series based models, which
   provide an optimal solution that is valid only for the time-series
   pattern that is applied.}},

Pages = {{1476-1482}},
Abstract = {{Because of its high capacity, relatively low operation potentials,
   abundance and environmental benevolence, silica is a promising anode
   material for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. In this work, to enhance
   the conductivity of silica and ensure robust connection between silica
   particles and the host structure in the anode, nanosilica/carbon
   composite spheres have been fabricated via the in situ copolymerization
   of formaldehyde and resorcinol on the surface of nanosilica particles,
   followed by carbonization in an inert atmosphere. The electrochemical
   properties of the as-prepared composite as an anode for lithium-ion
   batteries are evaluated. When cycled at a current density of 100 mA
   g(-1) with a voltage window of 0.0-3.0 V the nanosilica/carbon composite
   spheres present a stable capacity of about 620 mA h g(-1) (calculated
   from the mass of the nanosilica/carbon composite spheres), and the
   capacity retention is nearly 100\% after 300 cycles. Moreover, at
   different current densities, the as-prepared composite exhibits high
   capacity and excellent cycle stability. The good electrochemical
   performance is attributed to the relatively small volume variation of
   silica nanoparticles, existence of pores/voids in the composite and
   robust connection between silica nanoparticles and the carbon matrix.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{324}},

Abstract = {{In this work we render superhydro-oleophobic properties to the surface
   of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer through bio-inspired
   micropillar surface and chemical modification with a fluorosilane
   polymer, trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FDTS). Two
   different chemical modification approaches were applied on both flat and
   micropillar PDMS: (1) vapor deposition of FDTS on cured PDMS surface,
   and (2) blending FDTS with the liquid PDMS precursor before curing.
   Comparative studies of the water and oil contact angles on the neat and
   FDTS-modified PDMS (both flat and micropillar) indicated that
   superhydro-oleophobicity was delivered by a combination of FDTS
   chemistry and micropillar geometry. FDTS-blended PDMS micropillar
   displayed better oleophobicity with an oil contact angle of similar to
   141 degrees than FDTS-coated PDMS micropillar (similar to 151 degrees).
   In contrast to the smooth surface of FDTS-blended PDMS micropillar,
   rough surface with some structure defects were found on the FDTS-coated
   micropillar surface caused by the vapor deposition process; the surface
   defects might be responsible for the observed low oleophobicity of
   FDTS-coated PDMS micropillar. Superhydrophobicity of FDTS-blended PDMS
   micropillar in terms of water contact angles was found to be independent
   of the quantity of FDTS. However, the oleophobicity of FDTS-blended PDMS
   micropillar was found to be dependent of the quantity of FDTS; with the
   increased weight concentration of FDTS in PDMS, the oils contact angle
   first increased and then leveled out at a finite concentration. FTIR and
   XPS were applied to analyze surface chemistry information suggesting the
   blended FDTS segregated from bulk PDMS and enriched at the surface to
   reduce surface tension so as to make surface super-oleophobic. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The ability of sensors to self-organize is an important asset in
   surveillance sensor networks. Self-organize implies self-control at the
   sensor level and coordination at the network level. Biologically
   inspired approaches have recently gained significant attention as a tool
   to address the issue of sensor control and coordination in sensor
   networks. These approaches are exemplified by the two well-known
   algorithms, namely, the Flocking algorithm and the Anti-Flocking
   algorithm. Generally speaking, although these two biologically inspired
   algorithms have demonstrated promising performance, they expose
   deficiencies when it comes to their ability to maintain simultaneous
   robust dynamic area coverage and target coverage. These two coverage
   performance objectives are inherently conflicting. This paper presents
   Semi-Flocking, a biologically inspired algorithm that benefits from key
   characteristics of both the Flocking and Anti-Flocking algorithms. The
   Semi-Flocking algorithm approaches the problem by assigning a small
   flock of sensors to each target, while at the same time leaving some
   sensors free to explore the environment. This allows the algorithm to
   strike balance between robust area coverage and target coverage. Such
   balance is facilitated via flock-sensor coordination. The performance of
   the proposed Semi-Flocking algorithm is examined and compared with other

   once using a standard walking pedestrian dataset. The results of both
   experiments show that the Semi-Flocking algorithm outperforms both the
   Flocking algorithm and the Anti-Flocking algorithm with respect to the
   area of coverage and the target coverage objectives. Furthermore, the

Abstract = {{This paper presents mathematical optimization models of produce storage
   facilities to optimize the operation of their energy systems in the
   context of smart grids. In the storage facilities, climate control of
   the storage rooms consumes considerable energy; thus, in this paper, a
   mathematical model of storage facilities appropriate for their optimal
   operation is developed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory
   control in existing climate controllers. The proposed model incorporates
   weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user
   preferences to optimally operate existing climate control systems in
   storage facilities. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and
   demand charges while considering important parameters of storage
   facilities, i.e., inside temperature and humidity should be kept within
   acceptable ranges. The performance of the proposed model for various
   electricity prices and weather conditions and their variations are
   studied via Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The presented simulation
   results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total
   energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Energy storage devices (ESDs) have the potential to revolutionize the
   electricity grid by allowing the smoothing of variable-energy generator
   output and the time-shifting of demand away from peak times. A common
   approach to study the impact of ESDs on energy systems is by modeling
   them as electric circuits in simulations. Although recent circuit models
   are becoming more accurate, to obtain statistically valid results,
   extensive simulations need to be run. In some cases, existing datasets
   are not large enough to obtain statistically significant results. The
   impact of ESDs on energy systems has also been recently studied using
   analytical methods, but usually by assuming ideal ESD behavior, such as
   infinite ESD charging and discharging rates, and zero self-discharge.
   However, real-life ESDs are far from ideal. We investigate the effect of
   nonideal ESD behavior on system performance, presenting an analytical
   ESD model that retains much of the simplicity of an ideal ESD, yet
   captures many (though not all) nonideal behaviors for a class of ESDs
   that includes all battery technologies and compressed air energy storage
   systems. This allows us to compute performance bounds for systems with
   nonideal ESDs using standard teletraffic techniques. We provide
   performance results for five widely used ESD technologies and show that
   our models can closely approximate numerically computed performance
   bounds.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of our work is the use of an energy storage system (ESS) to
   integrate solar energy generators into the electrical grid. Although, in
   theory, an ESS allows intermittent solar power to be shaped to meet any
   desired load profile, in practice, parsimonious ESS dimensioning is
   challenging due to the stochastic nature of generation and load and the
   diversity and high cost of storage technologies. Existing methods for
   ESS sizing are based either on simulation or on analysis, both of which
   have shortcomings. Simulation methods are computationally expensive and
   depend on the availability of extensive data traces. Existing analytical
   methods tend to be conservative, overestimating expensive storage
   requirements. Our key insight is that solar power fluctuations arise at
   a few distinct time scales. We separately model fluctuations in each
   time scale, which allows us to accurately estimate ESS performance and
   efficiently size an ESS. Numerical examples with real data traces show
   that our model and analysis are tight.}},

Abstract = {{A Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) formulation of the species transport
   equation including differential diffusion is presented. Further, the CMC
   equation for conditional enthalpy is also derived. The objectives of the
   present study are to (1) derive the CMC equations including the
   differential effects for both the species and enthalpy in the context of
   hydrogen combustion, (2) implement the new CMC equations in RANS in two
   dimensions without any cross-stream averaging and (3) evaluate the
   benefits and drawbacks of the present CMC calculations applied to a
   non-premixed hydrogen-air flame. The current study is focused on
   improving the NO concentration near the nozzle. Predictions of the flow
   and mixing fields and CMC results for the temperature, major chemical
   species, and NO concentrations are compared with the experimental data.
   A budget of the terms in the CMC equations for the differentially
   diffusing chemical species is investigated. The model is shown to have a
   prominent effect on NO predictions, with an improvement in the regions
   close to the nozzle. Some possible sources of modeling discrepancy are

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of alternative micromechanical models
   on the macroscopic behavior of a functionally graded plate based on
   classical and shear-deformation plate theories. Several micromechanical
   models are tested to obtain the effective material properties of a
   two-phase particle composite as a function of the volume fraction of
   particles which continuously varies through the thickness of a
   functionally graded plate. The static, buckling, and free- and

   foundation. The volume fraction of particles are assumed to change
   according to the power-law, Sigmoid, and exponential functions. The
   governing partial differential equations are solved in the spatial
   coordinate by Navier solution, while a numerical time integration
   technique is employed to treat the problem in the time domain. Finally,
   the numerical results are provided to reveal the effect of explicit
   micromechanical models such as Voigt, Reuss, Hashin-Shtrikman bounds,

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a new comprehensive single-phase
   model for a flowing electrolyte-direct methanol fuel cell (FE-DMFC) to
   determine the operating range of key input parameters for the optimum
   performance of the fuel cell. These parameters include the inlet
   concentration of the FE, as well as the flow rate and thickness of the
   flowing electrolyte channel (FEC). In addition, in-house FE-DMFC
   experimental results were used to validate the model for the first time.
   It was found that the experimental and modeling results were in a good
   agreement. The results of the parametric studies showed that an FE
   concentration within the range of 1.5 and 3.2M would yield the best
   performance, while avoiding the corrosive nature of the liquid
   electrolyte. Furthermore, an FEC flow rate of 1mLmin(-1), at an FEC
   channel thickness of 0.6mm, was deemed to be sufficiently high to remove
   adequate amounts of methanol from the crossover stream. It was also
   determined that the thinnest possible FEC thickness should be used to
   provide high power output. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Based on observations of industrial construction sites, it is evident
   that most industrial projects do not effectively implement historically
   successful management practices that have the potential to improve

   practices. The BPPII Industrial is a method and metric for assessing the
   planning and implementation levels of key practices needed to ensure
   high levels of labor productivity. The practices included in the
   proposed method are those that are widely accepted in academia and
   industry to have a positive impact on labor productivity. This paper
   presents the development, verification, and validation of the BPPII
   Industrial. This paper's primary contributions are the identification of
   key productivity practices, quantification of the relative importance of

Abstract = {{A two-step galvanic displacement reaction was employed to synthesize
   Ag-Au nanoparticles grafted on Ge wafer using different equilibrium
   potentials. The Ge wafer was employed to reduce silver ions and grow Ag
   nanoparticles first, and then to reduce gold ions and to grow Au
   nanoparticles between the gaps of Ag nanoparticles. When they were
   employed as SERS substrates to detect 200 random spots, the lowest
   relative standard deviation (RSD) to our knowledge, of less than 7\% was
   obtained by using Rhodamine 6G (1 x 10(-9) M) as probe molecules in the
   aqueous detection. Crystal violet solution (1 x 10(-8) M) was also
   detected with an ultra low RSD of less than 8\%. The result of the
   electric field distribution by the finite difference time domain
   simulation further explained the distinguished sensitivity and
   uniformity of these substrates. The high uniformity and reproducibility
   of this substrate may benefit quantitative surface enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) detection in the field of biology in future.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental testing on cervical spine ligaments provides important data
   for advanced numerical modeling and injury prediction; however, accurate
   characterization of individual ligament response and determination of
   average mechanical properties for specific ligaments has not been
   adequately addressed in the literature. Existing methods are limited by
   a number of arbitrary choices made during the curve fits that often
   misrepresent the characteristic shape response of the ligaments, which
   is important for incorporation into numerical models to produce a
   biofidelic response. A method was developed to represent the mechanical
   properties of individual ligaments using a piece-wise curve fit with
   first derivative continuity between adjacent regions. The method was
   applied to published data for cervical spine ligaments and preserved the
   shape response (toe, linear, and traumatic regions) up to failure, for
   strain rates of 0.5 s(-1), 20 s(-1), and 150-250 s(-1), to determine the
   average force-displacement curves. Individual ligament coefficients of
   determination were 0.989 to 1.000 demonstrating excellent fit. This
   study produced a novel method in which a set of experimental ligament
   material property data exhibiting scatter was fit using a characteristic
   curve approach with a toe, linear, and traumatic region, as often
   observed in ligaments and tendons, and could be applied to other
   biological material data with a similar characteristic shape. The
   resultant average cervical spine ligament curves provide an accurate
   representation of the raw test data and the expected material property
   effects corresponding to varying deformation rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Among Ziegler-Natta catalysts used for 1,3-butadiene (1,3-BD)
   polymerization, the advantage of a neodymium (Nd)-based catalyst is that
   it provides butadiene rubber (BR) with a high content of cis-1,4
   configuration and a low amount of vinyl-1,2 units. Whereas, a cobalt
   (Co)-based catalyst can produce BR with a low content of trans-1,4
   configuration. Thus, this research was aimed to prepare BR containing a
   high content of cis-1,4 configuration with low amounts of both trans-1,4
   and vinyl-1,2 units using a combination of Nd- and Co-based
   Ziegler/Natta catalysts with triethyl aluminum (TEAL) and diethyl
   aluminum chloride (DEAC) acting as a co-catalyst and a chlorinating
   agent, respectively. The effects of the molar Co/Nd ratio, TEAL
   concentration, DEAC loading, 1,3-BD content, solvent type, and reaction
   temperature on \%conversion, microstructures, molecular weight, and
   molecular weight distribution of the obtained BR (Co/Nd-BR) were
   evaluated. The Co/Nd-BR having >97\% of cis-1,4 configuration, <2\% of
   trans-1,4 structure, and <1\% of vinyl-1,2 unit with >80\% conversion
   was achieved when 3.01 M of 1,3-BD concentration was treated in a
   toluene/cyclohexane mixture (7/3 {[}w/w]). The Co/Nd-BR exhibited no gel
   formation with high mechanical performance, which was equivalent to
   commercial BR produced from a Nd-based catalyst system. POLYM. ENG.

   Additionally, nanowire electrodes are shown to exhibit superior

   electrode-based PDLC smart window is both higher in the on-state and

Abstract = {{A novel method for measuring the zeta potential of PDMS-electrolyte
   solution interface is presented in this paper. When an electrolyte
   solution passes the electrode coated with PDMS film, an electrical
   current will be induced due to the electrostatic potential difference
   between the PDMS-air interface and the PDMS-electrolyte solution
   interface. Based on this principle, the relationship between the
   measured electrical signal and the zeta potential of PDMS-electrolyte
   solution interface is experimentally investigated. The results show that
   the magnitude of the measured signal is linearly proportional to this
   potential difference. An empirical correlation between the zeta
   potential and the measured voltage signal was obtained. Good agreement
   was found when comparing the zeta potential calculated by this empirical
   equation with that reported in the published journal papers. The zeta
   potential measurement method presented in this paper is simple and
   accurate and can be used for measuring zeta potentials of other
   dielectric-electrolyte interfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel distributed multi-channel medium access
   control (MAC) protocol using fast and slow hopping sequences with dual
   radio interfaces. Specifically, one interface follows fast hopping and
   is primarily for transmission, and the other interface follows slow
   hopping and is generally for reception. The proposed protocol, which is
   in line with the IEEE 802.11 MAC strategies, is based on the multiple
   rendezvous approach and able to enhance the network performance and
   resolve the congestion. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the
   network performance in terms of the aggregate throughput. Furthermore,
   the maximum saturation throughput and the upper achievable throughput
   are computed. Simulations using network simulator-2 (ns-2) are conducted
   to validate the analytical model and demonstrate the significant
   enhancement of the proposed protocol in single- and multi-hop networks.}},

Title = {{How morphology and surface crystal texture affect thermal stability of a
   metallic nanoparticle: the case of silver nanobelts and pentagonal
   silver nanowires}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{315-324}},
Abstract = {{Thermal instability of metallic nanoparticles is typically attributed to
   chemical attack by contaminants. However, thermodynamic stability is
   independent of other affecting parameters. The importance of this will
   be clarified when the structural change toward a more stable
   thermodynamic condition may be followed by a chemical reaction with the
   surroundings, which may cause a wrong diagnosis. In this research,
   molecular dynamics simulations and experimental observations were
   performed to investigate the effect of crystallography and surface
   texture on stability at high temperature using two closely related model
   nanoparticles: silver nanobelts and pentagonal nanowires. Previously,
   the instability of silver nanowires was associated with sulfidation of
   the wire at high temperature. However, we found that the silver
   nanowires are inherently unstable at high temperature, degrading due to
   the high-energy nature of the nanowire's predominately (100)
   crystallographic surface and pentagonal geometry. In contrast, the
   silver nanobelts resist thermal degradation up to 500 degrees C because
   of their predominately low-energy (111) crystallographic surfaces. In
   this case study, we successfully demonstrate that inherent thermodynamic
   stability driven by morphology is significant in metallic nanoparticles,
   and should be investigated when selecting a nanoparticle for high
   temperature applications. Moreover, we identify a new one-dimensional
   nanoparticle, the silver nanobelt, with inherent high-temperature
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the closely related problems of target capturing and
   station keeping by an autonomous vehicle agent within the limitations of
   having access to the measurements of distance from the target only,
   where station keeping refers to moving the agent to a position having
   predefined distances from a network of sensory stations or other agents.
   These problems have been recently studied for the cases where the
   position of the agent is available for measurement. The objective of
   this paper is to design a control scheme for solving the same problems
   when the self-position measurement is not available. In practical UAV
   settings, this corresponds to consideration of unavailability of GPS.
   Following the approach of another recent work for circumnavigation
   problems with the same measurement setting, a control scheme is proposed
   for each of the two aforementioned problems using agent-target range and
   range rate information. The paper provides a brief analysis of stability
   and convergence properties and some simulation results demonstrating
   performance of the proposed control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we focus on real-time implementations of a practical
   distributed adaptive formation control scheme for a multi-quadrotor
   system with uncertain inertial system parameters. We design a
   decentralized controller based on the leader-follower formation approach
   to motion control of such a system in rigid formation. The proposed
   control approach has a two-level structure: At the high level, a
   distributed control scheme is designed for the kinematic formation
   control problem. In the low-level, we analyze each single quadrotor
   control design in three parts. The first is an adaptive linear quadratic
   controller under consideration of inertial uncertainties for the pitch
   and roll dynamics, and in this case, we design an on-line parameter
   estimation with the least squares approach, excepting yaw and altitude
   dynamics. The second is proportional controller for the yaw motion. The
   third is proportional-integral-derivative controller for altitude.
   Throughout the formation control implementations, the controllers
   successfully satisfy the formation maintenance objective. Simulations
   and experimental results are presented considering various scenarios,

   To resolve this issue, two multi-parametric model predictive EMSs for a
   plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) are introduced, by considering
   the limited memory size of a control hardware. One of the EMSs is
   designed based on an improved control-oriented model that is derived by
   using the control-relevant parameter estimation (CRPE) approach. The
   results of simulation using Autonomie software shows significant fuel
   saving by using these EMSs compared to a baseline controller, while

Abstract = {{Loss of balance is prevalent in the older population and also in people
   who have mobility impairment. The primary aim of the present paper is to
   develop an efficient classifier to automatically distinguish
   compensatory balance responses (or near-falls) from regular stepping
   patterns. In this study, 5 young, healthy subjects were perturbed by
   lateral pushes while walking and the compensatory reactions were
   recorded by three wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). Time
   domain features of these signals were extracted and reduced, using
   different dimension reduction methods, i.e., PCA, SPCA and KSPCA. The
   performance of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machines
   (SVMs) classification methods for detection of compensatory balance
   responses is investigated. The results of this study advances wearable
   measurement methods to accurately and reliably monitor gait balance
   control behavior in at-home settings (unsupervised conditions), over
   long periods of time (i.e., weeks, months). Building on the current
   study, subsequent research will examine ambulatory data to identify
   balance recovery processes for clinical assessment of fall risk.}},

   treated as a significant uncertainty in the context of dispatching the
   power resources of a microgrid. Thus, in this paper the uncertainty of
   consumer response to DSM signals are treated as intervals to represent
   the corresponding range of variation based on affine arithmetic. The
   total range of total grid consumption is taken as the sum of intervals
   in each house, using data obtained through surveys regarding usage of
   appliances to obtain the individual consumer intervals. The proposed
   affine arithmetic model is then applied to the prediction of possible

Title = {{Nanostructured, complex hydride systems for hydrogen generation}},
Journal = {{AIMS ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{121-143}},
Abstract = {{Complex hydride systems for hydrogen (H-2) generation for supplying fuel
   cells are being reviewed. In the first group, the hydride systems that
   are capable of generating H-2 through a mechanical dehydrogenation
   phenomenon at the ambient temperature are discussed. There are few quite
   diverse systems in this group such as lithium alanate (LiAlH4) with the
   following additives: nanoiron (n-Fe), lithium amide (LiNH2) (a
   hydride/hydride system) and manganese chloride MnCl2 (a hydride/halide
   system). Another hydride/hydride system consists of lithium amide
   (LiNH2) and magnesium hydride (MgH2), and finally, there is a
   LiBH4-FeCl2 (hydride/halide) system. These hydride systems are capable
   of releasing from similar to 4 to 7 wt.\% H-2 at the ambient temperature
   during a reasonably short duration of ball milling. The second group
   encompasses systems that generate H-2 at slightly elevated temperature
   (up to 100 degrees C). In this group lithium alanate (LiAlH4) ball
   milled with the nano-Fe and nano-TiN/TiC/ZrC additives is a prominent
   system that can relatively quickly generate up to 7 wt.\% H-2 at 100
   degrees C. The other hydride is manganese borohydride (Mn(BH4)(2))
   obtained by mechano-chemical activation synthesis (MCAS). In a ball

Abstract = {{Two lightweight block cipher families, Simon and Speck, have been
   proposed by researchers from the NSA recently. In this paper, we
   introduce Simeck, a new family of lightweight block ciphers that
   combines the good design components from both Simon and Speck, in order
   to devise even more compact and efficient block ciphers. For
   Simeck32/64, we can achieve 505 GEs (before the Place and Route phase)
   and 549 GEs (after the Place and Route phase), with the power
   consumption of 0.417 mu W in CMOS 130nm ASIC, and 454 GEs (before the
   Place and Route phase) and 488 GEs (after the Place and Route phase),
   with the power consumption of 1.292 mu W in CMOS 65nm ASIC. Furthermore,
   all of the instances of Simeck are smaller than the ones of
   hardware-optimized cipher Simon in terms of area and power consumption
   in both CMOS 130nm and CMOS 65 nm techniques. In addition, we also give
   the security evaluation of Simeck with respect to many traditional
   cryptanalysis methods, including differential attacks, linear attacks,
   impossible differential attacks, meet-in-the-middle attacks, and slide
   attacks. Overall, all of the instances of Simeck can satisfy the area,
   power, and throughput requirements in passive RFID tags.}},

Abstract = {{In bender element (BE) testing, shear-wave velocities are measured using
   two main methods: time (pulse excitation) and frequency (sine sweep
   excitation) domain analysis. The time domain analysis is simple but
   requires subjective judgment for the non-automatic determination of the
   arrival time. Conversely, the frequency domain analysis can be performed
   automatically. However, its results show high variability because they
   are affected by the selection of different variables such as the
   frequency content of the excitation, the resonant frequency of the BE
   system, and the resolution of the frequency domain analysis. The
   reliability of the frequency domain method is studied in this paper by
   using experimental results from bender element and resonant column
   tests. Laboratory results show that amplification peaks in the transfer
   function of the BE system can significantly affect the shear wave
   velocity measurements (up to 300\%). In addition, the high correlations
   coefficients typically observed at high frequencies are finally
   explained. A modified frequency domain analysis is proposed to enhance
   the reliability of the method using a high frequency narrowband
   excitation outside the resonant peaks of the BE system. Results from the
   modified frequency domain analysis tests show less than 10\% error in
   the measurement of the shear wave velocity with respect to the RC
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFRFT) is a generalization of
   discrete Fourier transform. There are a number of DFRFT proposals, which
   are useful for various signal processing applications. This paper
   investigates practical solutions toward the construction of
   unconditionally secure communication systems based on DFRFT via
   cross-layer approach. By introducing a distort signal parameter, the
   sender randomly flip-flops between the distort signal parameter and the
   general signal parameter to confuse the attacker. The advantages of the
   legitimate partners are guaranteed. We extend the advantages between
   legitimate partners via developing novel security codes on top of the
   proposed cross-layer DFRFT security communication model, aiming to
   achieve an error-free legitimate channel while preventing the
   eavesdropper from any useful information. Thus, a cross-layer strong

Abstract = {{In mobile cloud computing, a fundamental application is to outsource the
   mobile data to external cloud servers for scalable data storage. The
   outsourced data, however, need to be encrypted due to the privacy and
   confidentiality concerns of their owner. This results in the
   distinguished difficulties on the accurate search over the encrypted
   mobile cloud data. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we develop the
   searchable encryption for multi-keyword ranked search over the storage
   data. Specifically, by considering the large number of outsourced
   documents (data) in the cloud, we utilize the relevance score and
   k-nearest neighbor techniques to develop an efficient multi-keyword
   search scheme that can return the ranked search results based on the
   accuracy. Within this framework, we leverage an efficient index to
   further improve the search efficiency, and adopt the blind storage
   system to conceal access pattern of the search user. Security analysis
   demonstrates that our scheme can achieve confidentiality of documents
   and index, trapdoor privacy, trapdoor unlinkability, and concealing
   access pattern of the search user. Finally, using extensive simulations,
   we show that our proposal can achieve much improved efficiency in terms
   of search functionality and search time compared with the existing
   proposals.}},

Abstract = {{Gasoline and electric powertrain components can be connected in numerous

   generate system equations, dynamic programming to evaluate fuel
   consumption and generate an objective score, and Pattern Search to
   optimise the sizing of each component. A multi-stage screening process
   was used to reduce computation time. Parallel and powersplit-like
   topologies with additional discrete gearboxes were found to be the most

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT COMPUTING AND CYBERNETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the structural and
   computational potentials of a powerful class of neural networks (NNs),
   called multiple-valued logic neural networks (MVLNN), for predicting the
   behavior of phenomenological systems with highly nonlinear dynamics.
   MVLNNs are constructed based on the integration of a number of neurons
   working based on the principle of multiple-valued logics. MVLNNs possess
   some particular features, namely complex-valued weights, input, and
   outputs coded by kth roots of unity, and a continuous activation as a
   mean for transferring numbers from complex spaces to trigonometric
   spaces, which distinguish them from most of the existing NNs.
   Design/methodology/approach - The presented study can be categorized
   into three sections. At the first part, the authors attempt at providing
   the mathematical formulations required for the implementation of
   ARX-based MVLNN (AMVLNN). In this context, it is indicated that how the
   concept of ARX can be used to revise the structure of MVLNN for online
   applications. Besides, the stepwise formulation for the simulation of
   Chua's oscillatory map and multiple-valued logic-based BP are given.
   Through an analysis, some interesting characteristics of the Chua's map,
   including a number of possible attractors of the state and sequences
   generated as a function of time, are given.
   Findings - Based on a throughout simulation as well as a comprehensive
   numerical comparative study, some important features of AMVLNN are
   demonstrated. The simulation results indicate that AMVLNN can be
   employed as a tool for the online identification of highly nonlinear
   dynamic systems. Furthermore, the results show the compatibility of the
   Chua's oscillatory system with BP for an effective tuning of the
   synaptic weights. The results also unveil the potentials of AMVLNN as a
   fast, robust, and efficient control-oriented model at the heart of NMPC
   control schemes.
   Originality/value - This study presents two innovative propositions.
   First, the structure of MVLNN is modified based on the concept of ARX
   system identification programming to suit the base structure for coping
   with chaotic and highly nonlinear systems. Second, the authors share the
   findings about the learning characteristics of MVLNNs. Through an
   exhaustive comparative study and considering different rival
   methodologies, a novel and efficient double-stage learning strategy is
   proposed which remarkably improves the performance of MVLNNs. Finally,
   the authors describe the outline of a novel formulation which prepares
   the proposed AMVLNN for applications in NMPC controllers for dynamic
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Rail infrastructure renewal maintenance is capital intensive. As a
   contributor to rail deterioration, corrosion damage needs to be
   accurately analysed for renewal maintenance planning. The main
   contribution of this study is to introduce an information-dense forensic
   analysis method for characterizing rail corrosion damage in situ based
   on 3D imaging. Two state-of-the-art technologies, an arm laser scanner
   and handheld laser scanner, are employed for onsite digitization of the
   rail surface. Acquired 3D image data is analysed to characterize pitting
   corrosion in terms of volume, surface area coverage and average pit
   depth. Cyclic loading of the sampled rail is simulated using finite
   element analysis of the 3D image to establish risk potential for crack
   initiation. A case project was used to validate the feasibility of the
   developed approach. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness
   of applying forensic methodology to renewal maintenance planning.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates how to implement a novel system dynamics (SD)
   tool for strategic water utility management and financial planning. With
   the use of data from several local water utilities in Ontario, Canada,
   the tool was run to simulate 20 years to investigate: (1) long-term fee
   hike rates requited for system financial sustainability; (2) service and
   financial performance metrics for pay-as-you-go, borrowing, and capital
   reserving strategies; and (3) consumer affordability as a result of
   water use charges. For the case study, reserving cash and allowing water
   fees to increase by up to 7\% per year were found to be the best
   financing strategies to eliminate infrastructure backlog/deficit. The
   study demonstrates the benefits of an SD model for developing and
   preparing strategic and tactical asset management, water conservation,
   and financial plans. The SD model parameterization and implementation
   for the demonstration case study can be helpful to other utilities in

Abstract = {{In this investigation, an intelligent technique is used to analyze the
   deposition efficiency (DE) of micro-particles in a realistic human upper
   airway model. To do so, firstly a numerical framework including
   computerized tomography (CT) imaging, geometry production software and
   mesh generation tool is utilized to provide a bed for simulating the
   human airway. Thereafter, the simulated airway is exposed to
   computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) system to study the
   complete upper tracheabronchial airway from trachea (G0) to second
   generation of bifurcations (G2). At the numerical phase, low Reynolds
   number (LRN) k-omega turbulence model is considered to simulate the
   laminar to turbulent occurred airflow. At the final stage, the obtained
   knowledge is used to provide a continuous model suited for analyzing the
   DE value in different sections of human upper airway. Here, the authors
   utilize a fast yet accurate intelligent interpolator called extreme
   learning machine (ELM) neural network to capture the knowledge of the
   obtained database. Bio-inspired metaheuristics are also used to evolve
   the architecture of ELM neural network such that it can predict the DE
   values with a high degree of accuracy and robustness. The results of the
   conducted experiments indicate that the proposed bio-inspired ELM
   interpolator is capable of providing a fast and accurate model which can
   yield proper information in a very short period of time as compared to
   the existing numerical techniques such as CFD. On the other hand, by
   using different types of bio-inspired metaheuristics, i.e. mutable smart
   bee algorithm (MSBA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly
   algorithm (FA) and scale-factor local search differential evolution
   (SFLSDE), it is observed that the structure of ELM neural network can be
   easily trained using metaheuristics. In general, the experimental
   results demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of soft computing
   techniques for predicting the DE values in human upper airway.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced decision support system (DSS) for implementing the Graph

   stability and equilibrium results according to a rich range of solution
   concepts that explain human behaviour under conflict. Then the inverse

   of states must be in order to produce stable states and equilibria as
   specified by the user. Other features incorporated into GMCR+ include
   coalition analysis, graph and tree diagram visualisation, narrative
   reporting of results and a tracing feature that shows how the conflict

Title = {{Microeconomic optimization and what-if analysis for facilities renewal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{350+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a microeconomic-based
   approach to support fund-allocation decisions for a large number of
   assets. Under the prevailing financial constraints and rapid
   deterioration of facilities, arriving at optimum fund allocation for
   capital renewal projects has become very challenging. Due to the
   complexity of modeling multi-year life cycle cost analysis, existing
   fund-allocation methods have serious drawbacks when handling a large
   portfolio of assets, and their results are difficult to justify.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts well-established
   theories from microeconomics and proposes a new microeconomic-based
   decision support framework that has two novel components: a heuristic
   procedure to optimize and justify fund-allocation decisions by balancing
   the funding among the different asset categories; and a visual what-if
   analysis approach inspired by the economic indifference maps.
   Findings - Applying the proposed framework on a real case study of 800
   building components proved that optimum decisions can be achieved
   through an equilibrium state at which fair and equitable allocations are
   made such that the utility per dollar is balanced for all asset
   categories. The visual what-if analysis approach presented a powerful
   graphical tool to visualize decisions, along with their costs and
   benefits, and facilitate sensitivity analysis under changes in budget
   levels.
   Originality/value - This paper, using the proposed microeconomic
   framework, sheds a new light on how fund-allocation optimization
   problems can be simplified, from an economic perspective, to arrive at
   accurate and justifiable decisions for a large portfolio of facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Novel nanocomposite membranes aimed for both proton-exchange membrane
   fuel cell (PEMFC) and direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) are presented in
   this work. The membranes are based on blending bacterial nanocellulose
   pulp and Nation (abbreviated as BxNy, where x and y indicates the mass
   ratio of bacterial cellulose to Nafion). The structure and properties of
   BxNy membranes are characterized by FTIR, SEM, TG, DMA and EIS, along
   with water uptake, swelling behavior and methanol permeability tests. It
   is found that the BxNy composite membranes with reinforced concrete-like
   structure show excellent mechanical and thermal stability regardless of
   annealing. The water uptake plus area and volume swelling ratios are all
   decreased compared to Nafion membranes. The proton conductivities of
   pristine and annealed B1N9 are 0.071 and 0.056 S cm(-1), respectively,
   at 30 degrees C and 100\% humidity. Specifically, annealed B1N1
   exhibited the lowest methanol permeability of 7.21 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1).
   Through the selectivity analysis, pristine and annealed B1N7 are
   selected to assemble the MEAs. The performances of annealed B1N7 in
   PEMFC and DMFC show the maximum power densities of 106 and 3.2 mW
   cm(-2), respectively, which are much higher than those of pristine B1N7
   at 25 degrees C. The performances of the pristine and annealed B1N7
   reach a level as high as 21.1 and 20.4 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C in
   DMFC, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology capable of
   directly converting the abundant biomass on the planet into electricity.
   Prior studies have adopted a variety of nanostructured materials with
   high surface area to volume ratio (SAV), yet the current and power
   density of these nanostructured materials do not deliver a significant
   leap over conventional MFCs. This study presents a novel approach to
   implement a miniaturized MFC with a high SAV of 4000 m(-1) using three
   different CNT-based electrode materials: Vertically Aligned CNT (VACNT),
   Randomly Aligned CNT (RACNT), and Spin-Spray Layer-by-Layer (SSLbL) CNT.
   These CNT-based electrodes show unique biofilm morphology and thickness.
   The study of performance parameters of miniaturized MFCs with these
   CNT-electrodes are conducted with respect to a control bare gold
   electrode. The results show that CNT-based materials attract more
   exoelectrogens, Geobacter sp., than bare gold, yielding thicker biofilm
   formation. Among CNT-based electrodes, low sheet resistance electrodes

Abstract = {{A soft-sensor based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that combines
   data obtained using a fluorescence-based soft-sensor with a dynamic
   mechanistic model, was investigated as a tool for continuous monitoring
   of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultivation process. A standalone
   fluorescence based soft-sensor, which uses a combination of an empirical
   multivariate statistical model and measured spectra, was designed for
   predicting key culture variables including viable and dead cells,
   recombinant protein, glucose, and ammonia concentrations. The standalone
   fluorescence sensor was then combined with a dynamic mechanistic model
   within an EKF framework, for improving the prediction accuracy and
   generating predictions in-between sampling instances. The dynamic model
   used for the EKF framework was based on a structured metabolic flux
   analysis and mass balances. In order to calibrate the fluorescence-based
   empirical model and the dynamic mechanistic model, cells were grown in
   batch mode with different initial glucose and glutamine concentrations.
   To mitigate the uncertainty associated with the model structure and
   parameters, non-stationary disturbances were accounted for in the EKF by
   parameter-adaptation. It was demonstrated that the implementation of the
   EKF along with the dynamic model could improve the accuracy of the
   fluorescence-based predictions at the sampling instances. Additionally,
   it was shown that the major advantage of the EKF-based soft-sensor,
   compared to the standalone fluorescence-based counterpart, was its
   capability to track the temporal evolution of key process variables
   between measurement instances obtained by the fluorescence-based
   soft-sensor. This is crucial for designing control strategies of CHO
   cell cultures with the aim of guaranteeing product quality. (C) 2014

Title = {{The durability of carbon supported Pt nanowire as novel cathode catalyst

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},

Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{Carbon supported platinum nanowires (PtNW/C) synthesized by a simple and
   inexpensive template-free methodology has been used for the first time
   as a cathode catalyst in a 15 cell with an active area of 250 cm(2), 1.5
   kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack. Drive cycle testing
   along with in-situ and ex-situ accelerated degradation testing (ADT)
   showed that the PtNW/C catalyst exhibited better durability than
   commercial Pt/C. After a 420 h dynamic drive cycle durability testing,
   the PEMFC stacks exhibited a performance degradation rate of 14.4\% and
   17.9\% for PtNW/C and commercial Pt/C based cathodes, respectively. It
   was found that the majority of performance loss was due to degradation
   of the commercial Pt/C anode materials, resulting from the rapidly
   changing load frequencies used in the testing protocol, ultimately
   leading to harsh fuel/air starvation conditions and subsequent Pt
   nanoparticle growth and agglomeration. Notably, based on post-testing
   characterization, the structure, electrochemically active surface area
   (ECSA) and oxygen reduction activity of the PtNW/C cathode catalyst
   remained unchanged during the drive cycling, indicating its excellent
   stability under these practical conditions. Conversely, when using
   commercial Pt/C as a cathode catalyst, significant Pt nanoparticle
   growth and agglomeration were observed, resulting in the reduced PEMFC
   stack durability. Therefore, PtNW/C materials are presented as promising
   replacements to conventional Pt/C as cathode electrocatalysts for
   PEMFCs, and particularly demonstrate improved stability under the
   practical conditions encountered for automotive applications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this paper we quantified the corrosion rates of active steel in
   atmospheric environment, cyclic wetting and drying, and active steel and
   passive steel in saturated concrete. The microstructure of the
   interfacial transition zone between the corroded bar and the concrete
   was observed with an Electron Microscope. The time-dependent dominating
   factors in the rebar corrosion processes under different environmental
   conditions were explained by the polarization curves. Results indicate
   that the corrosion current (I-corr) of passive steel in concrete
   immersed in NaCl solution is low due to low oxygen availability. I-corr
   of the active steel in saturated concrete reaches the maximum because
   the corrosion product (FeOOH) on the steel surface acts as new strong
   cathodic depolarization agent. However, the corrosion process stops
   after FeOOH in corrosion layer is completely consumed. Furthermore,
   I-corr of active steel subjected to cyclic wetting and drying remains at
   a high level because of high concentrations of FeOOH and oxygen. The
   maximum I-corr corresponds to the area under cyclic wetting and drying.

Abstract = {{We examine the significance of the energy loss mechanisms active in
   electrostatic MEMS actuators. We find that the dominant loss mechanism
   changes depending on the actuator mode of operation. We find that the
   active mechanisms in the order of their significance are:
   fluid-structure interactions dominant for actuators operating in air,
   actuator-substrate interactions dominant for actuators in contact with a
   substrate under vacuum, and intrinsic loss mechanisms dominant for
   actuators in-flight under vacuum. Further, experimental results show
   that the quality factor of an electrostatic MEMS actuator drops
   drastically as the actuator first comes into line contact with a
   substrate. As the contact area expands along the actuator length, the
   quality factor increases. Measurements under 1 Torr vacuum show a
   three-fold increase in the quality factor as the contact area expands
   from a line to 30\% of the actuator area. This increase in the quality
   factor is attributed to the drop in the contribution of friction forces
   into energy losses as contact expands and adhesion forces increase. (C)

Abstract = {{A series of novel zinc oxide-silica composites with three-dimensionally
   ordered macropores (3DOM) structure were synthesized via colloidal
   crystal template method and used as sorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   removal at room temperature for the first time. The performances of the
   prepared sorbents were evaluated by dynamic breakthrough testing. The
   materials were characterized before and after adsorption using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was
   found that the composite with 3DOM structure exhibited remarkable
   desulfurization performance at room temperature and the enhancement of
   reactive adsorption of hydrogen sulfide was attributed to the unique
   structure features of 3DOM composites; high surface areas,
   nanocrystalline ZnO and the well-ordered interconnected macroporous with
   abundant mesopores. The introduction of silica could be conducive to
   support the 3DOM structure and the high dispersion of zinc oxide.
   Moisture in the H2S stream plays a crucial role in the removal process.
   The effects of Zn/Si ratio and the calcination temperature of 3DOM
   composites on H2S removal were studied. It demonstrated that the highest
   content of ZnO could reach up to 73 wt \% and the optimum calcination
   temperature was 500 degrees C. The multiple adsorption/regeneration
   cycles showed that the 3DOM ZnO-SiO2 sorbent is stable and the sulfur
   capacity can still reach 67.4\% of that of the fresh sorbent at the
   fifth cycle. These results indicate that 3DOM ZnO-SiO2 composites will
   be a promising sorbent for H2S removal at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple non-data-aided (or unsupervised) and universal cycle
   slip detection and correction (CS-DC) technique based on locating the
   minimum of the sliding average of twice estimated phase noise. The CS-DC
   can be appended to any carrier phase estimation(CPE) technique and is
   modulation format independent. We analytically derive the probability
   density function of the CS detection metric and study how the sliding
   window length and detection threshold affects CS detection performance.
   Simulation results reveal significant cycle slips reduction for various
   modulation formats with a residual CS probability of 2 x 10(-7) for
   single carrier system even in unrealistic highly nonlinear system
   setups. In addition, we show that a second stage of CS-DC with a
   different sliding window length can further reduce the cycle slip
   probability by at least an order of magnitude. We also show that CS-DC
   is tolerant to inter-channel nonlinearities and residue frequency offset
   effects. Overall, the proposed CS-DC technique can be used in
   conjunction to other CS reduction techniques to maximize the ability of
   CS mitigation in next generation optical transceivers. (C)2014 Optical

Abstract = {{Single phase cubic spinet LiMn2O4 nanosized particles are synthesized by
   a novel solution-mediated solid state method. The obtained LiMn2O4
   nanoparticles have a narrow particle size distribution in a range from
   100 to 300 nm. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge
   tests of the LiMn2O4 samples are performed in an aqueous solution of
   lithium and zinc acetates, using zinc as anode. Cells containing
   nanosized LiMn2O4 cathodes have higher specific discharge capacity,
   coulombic efficiency, better cyclability and rate capability than the
   cells containing conventional bulk LiMn2O4. The superior electrochemical
   performance can be ascribed to the much smaller particle size and less
   agglomeration, which not only shorten the diffusion pathway for
   electrons and lithium ions but also provide a larger specific surface
   area for lithium transportation during high C-rate charge-discharge
   cycling. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a camera-independent method of avoiding image
   saturation in three-dimensional (3D) shape measurement of objects with a
   high range of reflectivity variation across the surface. Multiple sets
   of phased-shifted sinusoidal fringe patterns of different maximum gray
   level are first projected onto the object surface while images are
   captured of the fringe patterns. Then composite images are constructed
   pixel-by-pixel, by using at each pixel, only the highest intensity
   without saturation across a set of phase-shifted images. The composite
   images are then used in phase map and surface generation. Measurements
   of a surface with large range of reflectivity and high luminance
   variation across the surface demonstrated measurement accuracy
   improvements of 0.20 mm to 0.32 mm, using the composite-images based on
   multiple maximum projected gray levels, compared to measurement with the
   best single uniform maximum gray level across the projected patterns.
   This saturation avoidance method can be performed automatically
   independent of any camera-lens hardware and would permit a wide range of
   measurement applications in uncontrolled environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Thin film composite (TFC) nanofiltration membranes were formed by
   interfacial polymerization from polyethylenimine (PEI) and trimesoyl
   chloride (TMC) on a microporous polyethersulfone (PES) substrate.
   Membranes with a layer-by-layer structure were prepared by repeated
   cycles of sequential reactant depositions and reactions to improve the
   salt rejection. The resulting membranes were characterized for chemical
   composition, surface charge and morphology of the polyamide skin layer.
   The effects of the sequence of reactant depositions, the number of
   cycles of reactant deposition and reaction, the concentrations of the
   reactant solutions and temperature of heat treatment on the membrane
   performance were investigated. The resulting membrane formed by a single
   cycle of interfacial polymerization with 3.5 wt\% PEl and 0.7 wt\% TMC
   had a positively charged surface and showed a good nanofiltration
   performance; salt rejections of 95.1\% for MgCl2, 94.4\% for MgSO4,
   80.5\% for Na2SO4 and 85.1\% for NaCl with a pure water permeation flux
   of 24.5 L/(m(2) h) were obtained at a feed pressure of 0.8 MPa gauge.
   The membranes formed with the PEI-TMC deposition sequence exhibited
   valley-ridge structures evenly distributed on the membrane surface,
   while the membranes made with a reversed deposition sequence (i.e.,
   TMC-PEI) showed irregularly distributed nodular like structures. In
   general, the PEI-TMC membranes were much more permeable than the TMC-PEI
   membranes. The salt rejections of the interfacially formed composite
   membranes were improved by proper heat treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Charge generation in a typical intermediate connector, composed of
   ``n-type doped layer/transition metal oxide (TMO)/hole transporting
   layer (HTL),{''} of a tandem organic light-emitting device (OLED) has
   recently been found to arise from charge transfer at the TMO/HTL
   interfaces. In this paper, we investigate the effect of hole injection
   barriers from intermediate connectors on the performance of tandem
   OLEDs. The hole injection barriers are caused by the offset of the
   highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels between HTLs
   contained in the intermediate connector and the top electroluminescence
   (EL) unit. We also find that although charge generation can occur at the
   interfaces between the TMO and a wide variety of HTLs of different HOMO
   values, an increase in the hole injection barrier however limits the
   electroluminescence efficiency of the top EL units. In the case of large
   hole injection barriers, significant charge accumulation in the HTLs
   makes the intermediate connector lose its functionality gradually over
   operating time, and limits device stability. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{This study studies a distributed estimation problem in relay assisted
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Different from most existing works, the
   network consists of two kinds of nodes, that is, sensor nodes (SNs)
   which is capable of sensing and computing and relay nodes (RNs), which
   is only capable of simple data aggregation. The problem of how to
   coordinate two kinds of nodes to facilitate distributed estimation is
   challenging because of their heterogeneous capability. The authors first
   develop a min-weighted rigid graph-based topology optimisation scheme to
   reduce the redundancy of communication links such that the energy
   consumption in the relay assisted WSN can be reduced. With the optimised
   topology, a consensus-based estimation algorithm is proposed for SNs and
   RNs, respectively. The asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency of the
   estimation algorithm are analysed in the presence of measurement and
   communication noises. The proposed method is applied to estimate the
   distribution of slab temperature in the hot rolling process. It is
   demonstrated that the topology optimisation reduces communication energy
   consumption, while the deployment of RNs improves temperature estimation
   accuracy as compared to a homogeneous WSN with SNs only.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, graphene-based titanium dioxide and zinc oxide composites
   (TiO2-G, ZnO-G) were synthesized using a hydrothermal process. Materials
   were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Photocatalytic
   activity of the composite materials under simulated solar light was
   studied using phenol as a model compound. A ca. 30\% improvement on the
   degradation performance by the TiO2-G composite (and ZnO-G) was observed
   when reaction rate constants were compared with TiO2 (and ZnO) only.
   This demonstrates the positive effect of graphene on suppressing charge
   recombination and extending the light absorption range. Further
   improvement on the photocatalytic degradation rate of phenol was
   obtained by coupling the two composites, ZnO-G and TiO2-G. This is
   attributed to more efficient charge separation and longer lifetime of
   the charge carriers, which eventually enhances the photocatalytic
   activity. The optimum stoichiometric amount of each component was
   obtained experimentally. Systematic parametric studies were also
   performed to study the effect of catalyst loading, initial phenol
   concentration, solution pH, and solar light intensity. Complete solar
   degradation of 40 ppm phenol was achieved within 60 min while using the
   coupled ZnO-G/TiO2-G photocatalysts at the optimum conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of oligomerization of isobutene was studied on a
   NiSO4/gamma-alumina catalyst in a stirred batch autoclave at
   temperatures of 50-90 degrees C and a pressure of 2170 kPa with
   different concentrations of isobutene. Experimental results revealed
   that the catalyst has high dimer selectivity and did not show any
   significant deactivation during the reaction. A generalized kinetic
   model based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH)-type reaction sequence was
   developed. The intraparticle diffusion effects inside the catalyst
   particle were correlated to the reaction rates and mass-transfer rate
   between the catalyst particle and liquid phase. The developed intrinsic
   kinetic model with estimated model parameters was found to describe the
   experimental data accurately. The magnitude of the activation energies
   was found to be in the range of 13-27 kJ mol(-1), which suggests that
   the oligomerization reaction proceeds via surface rearrangement, as
   considered in the present LH-type kinetic model.}},

Title = {{The impact of video-quality-level switching on user quality of
   experience in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) has become a promising
   solution for video delivery services over the Internet in the last few
   years. Currently, several video content providers use the DASH solution
   to improve the users' quality of experience (QoE) by automatically
   switching video quality levels (VQLs) according to the network status.
   However, the frequency of switching events between different VQLs during
   a video streaming session may disturb the user's visual attention and
   therefore affect the user's QoE. As one of the first attempts to
   characterize the impact of VQL switching on the user's QoE, we carried
   out a series of subjective tests, which show that there is a correlation
   between the user QoE and the frequency, type, and temporal location of
   the switching events. We propose a novel parameter named switching
   degradation factor (SDF) to capture such correlation. A DASH algorithm
   with SDF parameter is compared with the same algorithm without SDF. The
   results demonstrate that the SDF parameter significantly improves the
   user's QoE, especially when network conditions vary frequently.}},

Title = {{An evolving fuzzy neural predictor for multi-dimensional system state
   forecasting}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{381-391}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{In many applications of system state forecasting, the prediction is
   performed using multi-dimensional data sets. The traditional methods for
   dealing with multi-dimensional data sets have some short-comings, such
   as a lack of nonlinear correlation modeling capability (e.g., for vector
   autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models), and an inefficient linear
   correlation modeling mechanism (e.g., for generic neural fuzzy systems).
   To tackle these problems, an evolving fuzzy neural network (eFNN)
   predictor is proposed in this paper to extract representative
   information from multi-dimensional data sets for more accurate system
   state forecasting. In the proposed eFNN predictor, linear correlations
   among multi-dimensional data sets are captured by a VARMA filter, while
   nonlinear correlations of the data sets are modeled by a fuzzy network
   scheme, whose fuzzy rules are generated adaptively using a novel
   evolving algorithm. The proposed predictor possesses online learning
   capability and can address non-stationary properties of data sets. The
   effectiveness of the proposed eFNN predictor is verified by simulation
   tests. It is also implemented for induction motor system state
   prognosis. Test results show that the proposed eFNN predictor can
   capture the dynamic properties involved in the multi-dimensional data
   sets effectively, and track system characteristics accurately. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this study, the co-fermentability of four different pretreated corn

   autohydrolysis comprising one purge and one squeeze. The ``Purge{''}
   stream was taken from the steam percolation reactor during cooling and
   the ``Squeeze{''} stream was recovered from the cooked biomass with a
   pressing step. In addition, the impact of furfural and
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) on biohydrogen production potential was
   evaluated. The DP:DS mix at 50:50 by volume achieved the maximum H-2
   yield of 265 (mL/gCOD sugars consumed). Furfural at concentrations of
   0.21-1.09 g/L had no impact on H-2 production rates and yields and HMF
   was below the inhibitory threshold of 0.14 g/L. A positive correlation
   was observed between the monomeric-to-polymeric sugars ratio and H-2

Abstract = {{The objectives of this paper are to integrate the structural health
   monitoring (SHM) technique with the structural seismic analysis, and to
   make the SHM technique serve, benefit and promote the structural seismic
   analysis integrally. Therefore, considering a concrete-filled steel

   the finite element (FE) model through the model-updating scheme to
   minimise the structural response differences caused by FE model errors.
   Effects of model updating on structural seismic responses are
   investigated using the stochastic vibration analysis approach. It is
   observed that effects of model updating are significant on structural
   seismic responses, and these effects may become more evident in
   structural nonlinear dynamic analysis. Hence, it is of prime importance
   to calibrate the FE models through the SHM technique for seismic
   evaluations of some operational critical structures.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging synthesis methods open a new door to help scientists for further
   study on porous materials. High resolution images are required to
   analyze the macroscopic properties of porous media. However, a few
   degenerated high resolution samples are available because of
   constraints, and low resolution measurements (such as MRI images) cannot
   fully describe the medium. Computer-aided approaches can help the
   science of porous media by generating many artificial high resolution
   samples using the information of available data. In this paper, a novel
   discriminative graphical framework is proposed which statistically
   models the synthesis problem. The probability distribution of high
   resolution image of a porous medium given a low resolution measurement
   is modeled by conditional random fields (CRF). A Monte Carlo approach is
   proposed to sample the constructed model and to generate high resolution
   samples. Moreover, a hierarchical CRF is proposed for gradual synthesis
   of high resolution porous media images. The success of the models is
   shown and compared through several experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an effective solution for the crest factor reduction
   (CFR) of inter-band carrier aggregated signals composed of multiple
   widely spaced component carriers (CC). This solution embeds a peak
   estimator, which determines the amount of clipping to apply to the
   instantaneous samples of the individual CCs. The resulting CFR runs at a
   sampling rate proportional to the bandwidth of the constituent CCs and
   is not impacted by the frequency spacing between them. This allows for a
   significant decrease in the computational complexity and power overhead
   associated with classical CFR techniques that need to operate at much
   higher sampling rates. The proposed CFR solution is extended to address

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a compact, low-loss, and low cost phase shifter for
   millimeter-wave phased array systems. The basic idea is to modify the
   propagation mode of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) by placing a high
   dielectric constant (40 < epsilon(r) < 170) slab on top of it. The phase
   shift is varied by changing the air gap between the CPW line and the
   dielectric slab. A piezoelectric transducer has been used to control
   this air gap precisely. For fast but accurate modeling of the proposed
   phase shifter, two methods one based on spectral domain analysis and the
   other based on the conformal mapping have been developed and verified
   with full wave simulations and measurements. A prototype structure with
   the operational frequency range from 20 to 40 GHz is presented. The
   maximum phase shift obtained for the electrically controlled version at
   40 GHz is 103 degrees with loss variation of 0.2 dB. The total length is
   2 mm.}},

Abstract = {{To satisfy the ever increasing wireless service demand, it is effective
   to form a converged network by utilizing interworking mechanisms, such
   that the resources of heterogeneous wireless networks can be allocated
   in a coordinated and efficient manner. Despite the potential advantages
   of a converged network, its performance needs further improvement,
   especially at cell edges and rural areas where only one network is
   available. In this article, we investigate how to leverage
   device-to-device, D2D, communication to further improve the performance
   of a converged network which consists of an LTE-A cellular network and
   IEEE 802.11n WLANs. Three main technical challenges that complicate
   resource allocation are identified: allocation of resources capturing
   diverse radio access technologies of the networks, selection of users'
   communication modes for multiple networks to maximize hop and reuse
   gains, and interference management. To address these challenges, we
   propose a resource allocation scheme that performs mode selection,
   allocation of WLAN resources, and allocation of LTE-A network resources
   in three different timescales. The resource allocation scheme is
   semi-distributedly implemented in the underlying converged D2D
   communication network, and the achievable performance improvements are
   demonstrated via simulation results.}},

   of friction stir butt welding between AA5059 alloy and high density

   parameters and tool alignment were investigated until sound joints were
   achieved by positioning approximately 85\% of the rotating tool in the
   aluminum material on the advancing side (1.4 mm offset) at constant
   spindle speed and traverse speed of 710 rpm and 63 mm/min, respectively.
   The results indicate that AA5059 aluminum and high density polyethylene
   sheets can be successfully joined with a combination of secondary
   bonding and mechanical interlocking of the materials, which provides a
   potential alternative to adhesive bonding or mechanical fastening. (C)

Abstract = {{Asphaltene deposition is a recognized phenomenon in petroleum industry
   with undesirable outcomes so that it may lead to wellbore plugging and
   formation damage, resulting in a large amount of remedial costs to
   decrease its negative impacts on oil production. Therefore, it has
   attracted lots of research interests in the literature. In this study,
   an attempt is made to introduce the least square support vector machine
   (LSSVM) for prediction of asphaltene deposition. This technique with
   high capabilities which captures the complex nature of asphaltene could
   be inferred as a scaling model. As there is no a standard procedure to
   determine the main parameters of the LSSVM model, the particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) technique is employed to synchronously optimize the
   LSSVM parameters. The modeling results clearly demonstrate that the
   optimized LSSVM is able to handle the nonlinearities well and attain
   satisfactory results. The comparison of available predictive equations
   for asphaltene deposition confirms that the LSSVM technique linked with
   PSO exhibits higher robustness and greater precision with an R-2 of
   0.989 for the testing phase. Crown Copyright (c) 2014 Published by

   used to achieve flexible, highly power-efficient large-area green and

   simultaneously extracting light in waveguide and substrate modes and
   reducing the surface plasmonic losses, flexible white OLEDs exhibit a
   power efficiency of 106 lm W-1 at 1000 cd m(2) with angular color

   resource allocation restrictions to represent the semi-static and
   dynamic selections of the three resource sharing modes. A queuing model
   is developed when the routing mode for every D2D connection is chosen,
   and an exact numerical analysis and an approximate decomposition and
   iteration approach are proposed. The performance measures are obtained
   from the decomposition approach and validated by means of simulation. We
   further introduce a mode selection scheme that adaptively chooses to
   semi-statically or dynamically select the resource sharing modes

Abstract = {{In this paper, to address network congestion stemmed from traffic
   generated by advanced user equipment, we propose a novel network
   resource allocation strategy, i.e., time-frequency resource conversion
   (TFRC), via exploiting user behavior, a specific kind of context
   information. The key idea is to use radio resources mainly on the
   traffic/connection to which a user pays attention. The TFRC withdraws
   spectrum resources strategically from connection(s) not focused on by
   the user, providing reuseable spectrum called ``virtual spectrum
   hole{''}. Considering an LTE-type cellular network, a double-threshold
   guard channel policy is proposed to facilitate the implementation of
   TFRC. An analytical model is established to study benefits of exploiting
   TFRC in terms of call-level performance, including new call blocking,
   handoff call dropping, and recovering call dropping probabilities.
   Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach, in increasing the cell capacity (maximum user number per cell)
   while limiting potential service quality degradation introduced by the
   newly proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel base station (BS) coordination approach for
   intercell interference mitigation in the orthogonal frequency-division
   multiple access based cellular networks. Specifically, we first propose
   a new performance metric for evaluating end user's quality of experience
   (QoE), which jointly considers spectrum efficiency, user fairness, and
   service satisfaction. Interference graph is applied here to capture and
   analyze the interactions between BSs. Then, a QoE-oriented resource
   allocation problem is formulated among BSs as a local cooperation game,
   where BSs are encouraged to cooperate with their peer nodes in the
   adjacent cells in user scheduling and power allocation. The existence of
   the joint-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) has been proved, in which no BS
   player would unilaterally change its own strategy in user scheduling or
   power allocation. Furthermore, the NE in the formulated game is proved
   to lead to the global optimality of the network utility. Accordingly, we
   design an iterative searching algorithm to obtain the global optimum
   (i.e., the best NE) with an arbitrarily high probability in a
   decentralized manner, in which only local information exchange is
   needed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both validate the
   convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm with fairness
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofluids are becoming increasingly popular as heat transfer fluids in
   a variety of industrial applications, due to their enhanced heat
   transfer characteristics. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids is
   usually found to be much larger than that predicted from the classical
   models, such as the Maxwell model. The key mechanism of enhancement of
   thermal conductivity of dilute nanofluids is the solvation of
   nanoparticles with a layer of matrix liquid. As of now, little is known
   quantitatively about the thermal conductivity of the interfacial layers
   surrounding the nanoparticles. In this article, a novel method is
   presented to determine the thermal conductivity of the interfacial
   layers of the nanoparticles. The proposed method allows the estimation
   of the thermal conductivity of interfacial layers based on the combined
   measurements of the intrinsic viscosity and intrinsic thermal
   conductivity of a bulk nanofluid. From the measured intrinsic viscosity
   of the nanofluid, the thickness of the interfacial layer is estimated.
   Using the known interfacial layer thickness along with the measured
   intrinsic thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, the thermal
   conductivity of the interfacial layer is estimated. The proposed method
   is validated by simulation and experimental results.}},

Title = {{Speed limit reduction in urban areas: A before-after study using

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{In fall 2009, a new speed limit of 40 km/h was introduced on local
   streets in Montreal (previous speed limit: 50 km/h). This paper proposes
   a methodology to efficiently estimate the effect of such reduction on
   speeding behaviors. We employ a full Bayes before-after approach, which
   overcomes the limitations of the empirical Bayes method. The proposed
   methodology allows for the analysis of speed data using hourly
   observations. Therefore, the entire daily profile of speed is
   considered. Furthermore, it accounts for the entire distribution of
   speed in contrast to the traditional approach of considering only a
   point estimate such as 85th percentile speed. Different reference speeds
   were used to examine variations in the treatment effectiveness in terms
   of speeding rate and frequency. In addition to comparing rates of
   vehicles exceeding reference speeds of 40 km/h and 50 km/h (speeding),
   we verified how the implemented treatment affected ``excessive
   speeding{''} behaviors (exceeding 80 km/h). To model operating speeds,
   two Bayesian generalized mixed linear models were utilized. These models
   have the advantage of addressing the heterogeneity problem in
   observations and efficiently capturing potential intra-site
   correlations. A variety of site characteristics, temporal variables, and
   environmental factors were considered. The analyses indicated that
   variables such as lane width and night hour had an increasing effect on
   speeding. Conversely, roadside parking had a decreasing effect on
   speeding. One-way and lane width had an increasing effect on excessive
   speeding, whereas evening hour had a decreasing effect. This study
   concluded that although the treatment was effective with respect to
   speed references of 40 km/h and 50 km/h, its effectiveness was not
   significant with respect to excessive speeding-which carries a great
   risk to pedestrians and cyclists in urban areas. Therefore, caution must
   be taken in drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of speed limit
   reduction. This study also points out the importance of using a
   comparison group to capture underlying trends caused by unknown factors.

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that monodispersed triangular gold nanoplates with high
   morphological yield (>90\%) can be synthesized through a rapid one-pot
   seedless growth process. The edge length of triangular Au nanoplates can
   be readily tuned between 40 and 120 nm by varying the reaction
   parameters. Systematic studies reveal that distinct from previous
   hypothesis that the formation of nanoplates is mainly determined by the
   selective binding of iodide ions, our results show that iodide ions
   could have dual functions: it can selectively bind to the Au \{111\}
   facets and also selectively remove other less stable shape impurities
   through oxidative etching by forming tri-iodide ions (I-3(-)), thus
   facilitating the formation of nuclei with dominant planar structure.
   This new synthetic route will not only help to better understand the
   growth mechanism of triangular gold nanoplates but also promote the
   research in anisotropic noble metal nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{Since the earliest use of this technology, a growing number of
   researchers have employed passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
   transponders to track sediment transport in gravel rivers and coastal
   environments. RFID transponders are advantageous because they are
   inexpensive, durable and use unique codes that allow sediment particle
   mobility and displacement to be assessed on a clast-by-clast basis.
   Despite these advantages, this technology is in need of a rigorous error
   and detection analysis. Many studies work with a precision of similar to
   1 m, which is insufficient for some applications, and signal shadowing
   can occur due to clustering of tagged particles. Information on in-field
   performance is also incomplete with respect to burial and submergence,
   especially for different transponders and antennae combinations. The
   objectives of this study are to qualify and quantify the factors that
   influence the detection zone of RFID tracers including antenna type,
   transponder size, transponder orientation, burial depth, submergence and
   clustering. Results of this study show that the detection zone is
   complex in shape due to a set of lobes in the detection field and
   provide a better understanding of transponder detection shape for
   different RFID transponder/antenna combinations. This study highlights a
   strong influence of clustering and submergence, but no significant
   effect of burial. Finally we propose standard operating procedures for
   tagging and tracking in rivers and coastal environments. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Ecohydrological linkages between phosphorus (P) production, stream
   algae, benthic invertebrate, and fish communities were studied for
   4years after severe wildfire in the Rocky Mountains (Alberta, Canada).
   Mean concentrations of all forms of P (soluble reactive, total
   dissolved, particulate, and total) were 2 to 13 times greater in burned
   and post-fire salvage-logged streams than in unburned streams (p<0.001).
   Post-disturbance recovery of P was slow with differences in P-discharge
   relationships still evident 5years after the fire (p<0.001). Coupled P
   and sediment interactions were likely responsible for slow recovery of P
   regimes in fire-disturbed watersheds. P loading was associated with
   strong ecological responses in stream biota. Annual algal productivity
   was 5 to 71 times greater in streams within burned watersheds than in
   reference watersheds and persisted for 5years after the fire (p<0.001).
   Elevated algal production was associated with strong differences in
   benthic invertebrate community structure, including greater invertebrate
   densities, biomass, species diversity, and shifts in species
   composition. Monotonic shifts in invertebrate stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotope ratios indicated increased consumption of autochthonous food
   sources and effects on energy pathways for invertebrates from
   fire-affected streams. Wildfire-related changes at lower trophic lead to
   increases in size (weight and length) and growth rate (weight:age
   ratios) of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). This cascading series
   of effects of wildfire on stream productivity (primary production,
   secondary invertebrate consumers, and fish) may be long-lived legacies
   of wildfire because of the slow recovery of P regimes. Copyright (c)
