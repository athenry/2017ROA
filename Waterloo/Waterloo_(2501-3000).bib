Abstract = {{This paper presents a high-efficiency wideband planar dielectric tapered
   antenna designed for 60-GHz integrated applications fabricated through a
   novel process compatible with silicon technology. The antenna is
   composed of five parts: a CPW line, a balun, a tapered slot line, a
   dielectric tapered antenna, and parasitic elements. Single antenna has a
   simulated impedance bandwidth from 52.4 to 66.4 GHz, and a peak gain
   between 8.5 and 10.25 dBi over the bandwidth. Furthermore, a two-element
   array of this antenna is designed using a CPW power divider with a
   simulated 12-dBi gain and 9-GHz bandwidth. Single-element antenna and
   two-element array prototypes are fabricated on high-resistive bonded
   silicon wafers through a novel 11-step fabrication process designed for
   double-sided etching. The measured results of single antenna show over
   15-GHz bandwidth and 9.6-dBi gain. For the two-element array measured,
   the bandwidth and gain are 10 GHz and 10.8 dBi, respectively. The
   antenna performance is suitable for integrated mm-wave applications
   requiring wide bandwidth, particularly mm-wave imaging.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of dynamic vehicle routing under exact-time
   constraints on servicing demands. Demands are sequentially generated in
   an environment, and every demand needs to be serviced exactly after a
   fixed finite interval of time after it is generated. We design routing
   policies for a service vehicle to maximize the fraction of demands
   serviced at steady state. The main contributions are as follows. First,
   we demonstrate that this problem is described by an appropriate directed
   acyclic graph structure which leads to a computationally efficient
   routing algorithm based on a longest-path computation. Second, under the
   assumption of the demands being generated uniformly randomly in the
   environment and via a Poisson process in time, we provide two analytic
   lower bounds on the service fraction of the longest path policy. The
   first bound is relative to an optimal noncausal version of the policy,
   i.e., a policy based on knowledge of all future demand requests. The
   second bound is an explicit function of the vehicle dynamics and demand
   generation rate and, therefore, useful as a design tool. Finally, we
   present numerical results to support the analytic bounds.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the frequent observation of a persistent opening in the
   posterior cartilaginous glottis in normal and pathological phonation,
   its influence on the self-sustained oscillations of the vocal folds is
   not well understood. The effects of a posterior gap on the vocal fold
   tissue dynamics and resulting acoustics were numerically investigated
   using a specially designed flow solver and a reduced-order model of
   human phonation. The inclusion of posterior gap areas of 0.03-0.1 cm(2)
   reduced the energy transfer from the fluid to the vocal folds by more
   than 42\%-80\% and the radiated sound pressure level by 6-14 dB,
   respectively. The model was used to simulate vocal hyperfucntion, i.e.,
   patterns of vocal misuse/abuse associated with many of the most common
   voice disorders. In this first approximation, vocal hyperfunction was
   modeled by introducing a compensatory increase in lung air pressure to
   regain the vocal loudness level that was produced prior to introducing a
   large glottal gap. This resulted in a significant increase in maximum
   flow declination rate and amplitude of unsteady flow, thereby mimicking
   clinical studies. The amplitude of unsteady flow was found to be
   linearly correlated with collision forces, thus being an indicative
   measure of vocal hyperfunction. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being an indispensable tool for both researchers and clinicians,
   traditional endoscopic imaging of the human vocal folds is limited in
   that it cannot capture their inferior-superior motion. A
   three-dimensional reconstruction technique using high-speed video
   imaging of the vocal folds in stereo is explored in an effort to
   estimate the inferior-superior motion of the medial-most edge of the
   vocal folds under normal muscle activation in vivo. Traditional
   stereo-matching algorithms from the field of computer vision are
   considered and modified to suit the specific challenges of the in vivo
   application. Inferior-superior motion of the medial vocal fold surface
   of three healthy speakers is reconstructed over one glottal cycle. The
   inferior-superior amplitude of the mucosal wave is found to be
   approximately 13 mm for normal modal voice, reducing to approximately 3
   mm for strained falsetto voice, with uncertainty estimated at sigma
   approximate to 2 mm and sigma approximate to 1 mm, respectively. Sources
   of error, and their relative effects on the estimation of the
   inferior-superior motion, are considered and recommendations are made to
   improve the technique. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Poor-quality longitudinal joints can cause premature failure on asphalt
   pavements; they are characterized by exhibiting low density and high
   permeability. These conditions generate surface distresses such as
   longitudinal cracking. Previous ultrasonic methods for condition
   assessment, e.g., Fourier and wavelet transmission coefficient, require
   user input, making the automatic data processing difficult. Furthermore,
   the coupling between ultrasonic transducers and the asphalt surface is
   not practical for testing in-service roads. This paper presents a new
   data analysis technique and the results of an experimental program for
   the condition assessment of longitudinal asphalt joints using ultrasonic
   surface waves. A new coupling system between the ultrasonic transducers
   and the asphalt surface is presented. The new data processing technique
   reduces user input and increases testing reliability. The new coupling
   system uses polyurethane foam and calibrated weights to provide a spring
   action on the transducers. The proposed data analysis technique, called
   instantaneous transmission coefficient (ITC), is based on the evaluation
   of instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios. The main advantage of
   the new procedure is that it can be performed automatically, reducing
   user input and increasing test repeatability. A laboratory scale asphalt
   slab is used to show the potential of the new methodology and coupling
   system. Laboratory validation results show good agreement between the
   new ITC method and previous methods, and a significant reduction in
   testing time, while improving test reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional steel connection systems rely on on-site welding and

   Reducing welding and bolting efforts in structural steel erection
   presents an opportunity to improve steel structure construction

   the main goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of steel quick
   connection systems on construction productivity and cost. To accomplish
   this goal, the authors performed analyses of data from nine SQCS
   projects and conducted two case studies. The authors also utilized a
   building information modeling based simulation to compare the schedule
   impact of SQCS and conventional structural steel connections systems.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of flow velocity at high frequencies (20-200 Hz) has
   been made easier over the last couple of decades by the development and
   commercialization of a variety of instruments, many of which are capable
   of measuring multiple sampling volumes simultaneously. A variety of
   methods has been proposed to remove errors in velocity time series and
   classify the quality of data. However, most methods are applied using
   custom algorithms written to treat custom data formats and remain hidden
   from a wider audience. The objective of this paper is to introduce and
   document a new set of open-source algorithms, written in Matlab, that
   comprise the Multi-Instrument Turbulence Toolbox (MITT). The algorithms
   are designed to: (i) organize the data output from multiple instruments
   into a common format; (ii) present the data in a variety of interactive
   figures for visualization and assessment; (iii) clean the data by
   removing data spikes and noise; and (iv) classify data quality. We hope
   that these algorithms will form the nucleus of an evolving toolbox that
   will help to accelerate the training of hydraulic researchers and
   practitioners, ensure a consistent application of methods for turbulence
   analysis, remove the bias of poor quality data from scientific
   literature, and ease collaboration through the sharing of data and
   methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This brief covers the design and fabrication of a ring oscillator-based
   truly random number generator (TRNG), which was fabricated in 0.13-mu m
   CMOS technology. The randomness originates from the phase noise in a
   ring oscillator. Timing jitter resulting from crossing the threshold
   multiple times, i.e., last passage time (LPT), is exploited. Previously,
   the jitter model was developed and applied to the core delay cell of the
   slow VCO, part of the ring oscillator, where a slow slew rate phase was
   introduced to greatly increase phase noise. In this brief, the
   successful design of the entire TRNG was performed. This includes
   designing the circuit to avoid introducing correlation in the TRNG.
   Toward this end, novel timing circuitry is designed to properly control
   both the beginning and termination of this slow slew rate phase by
   tapping into the previous stage's output. 1/f noise also has to be
   minimized. Furthermore, the entire TRNG is now designed/implemented and
   fabricated, and experimental results are shown. The fabricated ring
   oscillator was shown to possess a timing jitter of 1.5 ns. Simulation
   under PVT variations of the entire cell shows that jitter variations are
   within 30\%, showing that the designed control circuit was able to
   perform under such PVT variations. Entropy simulation with power supply
   variations applied to the TRNG was also run to assess its effectiveness
   as the biasing condition is changing. The randomness of the entire TRNG
   was assessed by applying the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) tests. On those tests recommended by NIST to have
   longer bit streams, additional test measurements were performed on bit
   streams with increased length. Entropy tests for 20 k, 200 k, and 400 k
   measured bits were performed, resulting in entropy values all close to
   1.}},

Abstract = {{The recent advances in wireless communication techniques have made it
   possible for fast-moving vehicles to download data from the roadside
   communications infrastructure {[}e.g., IEEE 802.11b Access Point (AP)],
   namely, Drive-thru Internet. However, due to the high mobility, harsh,
   and intermittent wireless channels, the data download volume of
   individual vehicle per drive-thru is quite limited, as observed in
   real-world tests. This would severely restrict the service quality of
   upper layer applications, such as file download and video streaming. On
   addressing this issue, in this paper, we propose ChainCluster, a
   cooperative Drive-thru Internet scheme. ChainCluster selects appropriate
   vehicles to form a linear cluster on the highway. The cluster members
   then cooperatively download the same content file, with each member
   retrieving one portion of the file, from the roadside infrastructure.
   With cluster members consecutively driving through the roadside
   infrastructure, the download of a single vehicle is virtually extended
   to that of a tandem of vehicles, which accordingly enhances the
   probability of successful file download significantly. With a delicate
   linear cluster formation scheme proposed and applied, in this paper, we
   first develop an analytical framework to evaluate the data volume that
   can be downloaded using cooperative drive-thru. Using simulations, we
   then verify the performance of ChainCluster and show that our analysis
   can match the simulations well. Finally, we show that ChainCluster can
   outperform the typical studied clustering schemes and provide general
   guidance for cooperative content distribution in highway vehicular
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture size is often estimated from trace length measurements. It is
   well recognized to be a typical non-unique inverse problem. This paper
   presents a distribution-free method for estimating the fracture diameter
   distributions using moments in conjunction with the maximum entropy
   principle. In this method, moments are used to characterize the
   statistical nature of the probability distributions. The method involves
   the inference or the moments or the true trace lengths from the sampled
   trace data, the explicit expression of moments of fracture diameters
   using general stereological relationship, and the estimation of fracture
   diameter distribution using the maximum entropy principle by a given set
   of moments of fracture diameters. The proposed method makes it possible
   to achieve a universal form for the fracture diameter distribution
   without any particular parametric form, and to match the moments of
   fracture diameters up to the fourth order. The overall behavior of the
   method is validated by an example, and the results show that it is
   capable of estimating the fracture diameter distributions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, various magnetic nanomaterials have been developed
   as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents; the greatest
   challenges encountered for clinical application have been insufficient
   stability. In this paper, a lyophilization method for 2,
   3-dimercaptosuccinic acid-modified iron oxide (-Fe2O3@DMSA)
   nanoparticles was developed to simultaneously overcome two
   disadvantages; these include insufficient stability and low-magnetic
   response. After lyophilization, the clusters of -Fe2O3@DMSA with the
   size of 156.7 +/- 15.3 nm were formed, and the stability of the
   lyophilized powder (-Fe2O3@DMSA-LP) increased up to over 3 years. It was
   also found that rehydrated -Fe2O3@DMSA-LP could be ingested by RAW264.7
   cells in very large quantities. Results of pharmacokinetics and
   biodistribution studies in vivo indicated that -Fe2O3@DMSA-LP is a
   promising liver-targeted material. Furthermore, it also exhibited higher
   MRI efficiency and longer imaging time in the liver than the well-known
   product Feridex((R)). Moreover, results of vascular irritation and
   long-term toxicity experiments demonstrated -Fe2O3@DMSA-LP could be a
   nontoxic, biocompatible contrast agent in vivo. Therefore, the proposed
   -Fe2O3@DMSA-LP can be used as a potential MRI contrast agent in clinic
   for hepatic diseases. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{Introduction: Numerous methods for motor unit number estimation (MUNE)
   have been developed. The objective of this article is to summarize and
   compare the major methods and the available data regarding their
   reproducibility, validity, application, refinement, and utility.
   Methods: Using specified search criteria, a systematic review of the
   literature was performed. Reproducibility, normative data, application
   to specific diseases and conditions, technical refinements, and
   practicality were compiled into a comprehensive database and analyzed.
   Results: The most commonly reported MUNE methods are the incremental,
   multiple-point stimulation, spike-triggered averaging, and statistical
   methods. All have established normative data sets and high
   reproducibility. MUNE provides quantitative assessments of motor neuron
   loss and has been applied successfully to the study of many clinical
   conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and normal aging.
   Conclusions: MUNE is an important research technique in human subjects,
   providing important data regarding motor unit populations and motor unit
   loss over time. Muscle Nerve50: 884-893, 2014}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid materials that are composed of a polymeric material interfaced
   with an inorganic, metal oxide material have been a rapidly expanding
   research area in the last few decades. However, interfacial regions
   remain an important area of focus, and as such hybrid materials do not
   always possess a very robust or stable interface. Tailor-made
   interfacial molecules have been successfully reported but material
   scientists wishing to develop composite interfacial materials would
   favorably use commercial solutions. Our study shows how we can leverage
   a commercially available organophosphonic acid group that is coupled
   with a 2-bromo isobutyrate initiator for surface initiated atom transfer
   radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) for use as a strong interfacial
   molecule. We illustrate this mechanism with both nanoparticles of
   titania and flat titania substrates used as the grafting support and
   polymerization anchoring points. We demonstrate that the size of the
   organophosphonic acid initiator, specifically the carbon spacer between
   the reactive groups, controls the stability of the molecule. The actual
   covalent linkage between the phosphonic acid group and the titania
   surface while also leaving the ATRP initiating group able to start the
   polymerization, is confirmed via P-31 solid state NMR spectroscopy,
   liquid H-1 NMR spectroscopy XPS, DLS and SEM.}},

Abstract = {{Selective hydrogenation of benzophenone to benzhydrol is industrially
   relevant. In the current work, selective hydrogenation of
   3,4-dimethoxybenzophenone (3,4-DMBP) to 3,4-dimethoxybenzhydrol
   (3,4-DMBH) was investigated over 5\% w/w Pd/C and 5\% w/w Pt/C as
   catalysts in a slurry reactor. The effects of hydrogen partial pressure
   (0.2-1MPa), catalyst loading (2.0x10(-4) to 8.0x10(-4)g/cm(3)), initial
   concentration of 3,4-dimethoxybenzophenone (5.0x10(-6) to
   1.5x10(-4)mol/cm(3)) and temperature (40-70 degrees C) on rate of
   reaction and selectivity were studied. Effect of solvent such as
   methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was also
   investigated. 5\% w/w Pd/C was the better catalyst with THF as the best
   solvent, which gave 100 \% conversion and 80 \% selectivity in 1h for
   0.5MPa hydrogen pressure at 60 degrees C. The
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson model was fitted. The intrinsic
   kinetics and mechanism of hydrogenation were established.}},

Title = {{Augmenting analytic SFM filters with frame-to-frame features}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In Structure From Motion (SFM), image features are matched in either an
   extended number of frames or only in pairs of consecutive frames.
   Traditionally. SFM filters have been applied using only one of the two
   matching paradigms, with the Long Range (LR) feature technique being
   more popular because of the fact that features that are matched across
   multiple frames provide stronger constraints on structure and motion.
   Nevertheless, Frame-to-Frame (F2F) features possess the desirable
   property of being abundant because of the large similarity that exists
   between closely spaced frames. Although the use of such features has
   been limited mostly to the determination of inter-frame camera motion,
   we argue that significant improvements can be attained in online
   filter-based SFM by integrating the F2F features into filters that use
   LR features. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it
   presents a new method that enables the incorporation of F2F information
   in any analytical filter in a fashion that requires minimal change to
   the existing filter. Our results show that by doing so, large increases
   in accuracy are achieved in both the structure and motion estimates.
   Second, thanks to mathematical simplifications we realize in the filter,
   we minimize the computational burden of F2F integration by two orders of
   magnitude, thereby enabling its real-time implementation. Experimental
   results on real and simulated data prove the success of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical finite element (FE) models of the neck have been developed to
   simulate occupant response and predict injury during motor vehicle
   collisions. However, there is a paucity of data on the response of young
   cervical spine segments under dynamic loading in flexion and extension,
   which is essential for the development or validation of tissue-level FE
   models. This limitation was identified during the development and
   validation of the FE model used in this study. The purpose of this study
   was to measure the high rotation rate loading response of human cervical
   spine segments in flexion and extension, and to investigate a new
   tissue-level FE model of the cervical spine with the experimental data
   to address a limitation in available data. Four test samples at each
   segment level from C2-C3 to C7-T1 were dissected from eight donors and
   were tested to 10 deg of rotation at 1 and 500 deg/s in flexion and
   extension using a custom built test apparatus. There was strong evidence
   (p < 0.05) of increased stiffness at the higher rotation rate above 4
   deg of rotation in flexion and at 8 deg and 10 deg of rotation in
   extension. Cross-correlation software, CORA, was used to evaluate the
   fit between the experimental data and model predictions. The average
   rating was 0.771, which is considered to demonstrate a good correlation
   to the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate time series are common in many application domains,
   particularly in industrial processes with a large number of sensors
   installed for process monitoring and control. Often, such data
   encapsulate complex relations among individual series. This paper
   presents a new type of patterns in multivariate time series, referred to
   as temporal associations, to capture a wide range of local relations
   along and across individual series. A scalable algorithm is developed to
   discover frequent associations by incorporating (1) redundancy pruning
   of patterns in single time series and (2) two conditions to avoid
   over-counting the occurrences of associations, thus greatly reducing the
   space and runtime complexity of the discovery process. A statistical
   significance measure is also introduced for ranking and post-pruning
   discovered associations. To evaluate the proposed method, synthetic data
   sets and a real world data set taken from the time series mining
   repository as well as a large data set obtained from a delayed coking
   plant are used. The experiments demonstrated that the discovered
   associations capture the local relations in multiple time series and
   that the proposed method is scalable to large data sets.}},

Abstract = {{mTags is an efficient mechanism that augments inter-thread messages with
   lightweight metadata. We introduce and discuss a case study that we have
   conducted in the use of mTags for realizing a kind of mandatory

   thread-based system, we consider an implementation of it in the
   POSIX-compliant QNX Neutrino, a commercial microkernel-based system. The
   approach to mandatory security that we adopt is Usable Mandatory
   Integrity Protection, which has been proposed in recent research. We
   call our adaptation of Usable Mandatory Integrity Protection using
   mTags, MIP. We discuss the challenges we faced, and our design and
   implementation that overcomes these challenges. We discuss the
   performance of our implementation for well-established benchmarks. We
   conclude with the observation that mTags can be useful and practical to

Title = {{Changes in hormone and stress-inducing activities of municipal
   wastewater in a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{265-272}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants do not efficiently
   remove contaminants of emerging concern, and so are primary sources for
   contaminant release into the aquatic environment. Although these
   contaminants are present in effluents at ng-mu g/L concentrations (i.e.
   microcontaminants), many compounds can act as endocrine disrupting
   compounds or stress-inducing agents at these levels. Chemical fate
   analyses indicate that additional levels of wastewater treatment reduce
   but do not always completely remove all microcontaminants. The removal
   of microcontaminants from wastewater does not necessarily correspond to
   a reduction in biological activity, as contaminant metabolites or
   byproducts may still be biologically active. To evaluate the efficacy of
   conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants to remove biological
   activity, we examined the performance of a full scale conventional
   activated sludge municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Guelph,
   Ontario, Canada. We assessed reductions in levels of conventional
   wastewater parameters and thyroid hormone disrupting and stress-inducing
   activities in wastewater at three phases along the treatment train using
   a C-fin assay. Wastewater treatment was effective at reducing total
   suspended solids, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, and
   stress-inducing bioactivity. However, only minimal reduction was
   observed in thyroid hormone disrupting activities. The present study
   underscores the importance of examining multiple chemical and biological
   endpoints in evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness of wastewater
   treatment for removal of microcontaminants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The procurement and management of construction materials involve
   challenges related to reducing inventory, speeding delivery, and

Abstract = {{Dual-phase steel with ferrite-martensite-bainite microstructure
   exhibited secondary hardening in the subcritical heat affected zone
   during fiber laser welding. Rapid isothermal tempering conducted in a
   Gleeble simulator also indicated occurrence of secondary hardening at
   773 K (500 A degrees C), as confirmed by plotting the tempered hardness
   against the Holloman-Jaffe parameter. Isothermally tempered specimens
   were characterized by analytic transmission electron microscopy and
   high-angle annular dark-field imaging. The cementite (Fe3C) and TiC
   located in the bainite phase of DP steel decomposed upon rapid tempering
   to form needle-shaped Mo2C (aspect ratio ranging from 10 to 25) and
   plate-shaped M4C3 carbides giving rise to secondary hardening.
   Precipitation of these thermodynamically stable and coherent carbides
   promoted the hardening phenomenon. However, complex carbides were only
   seen in the tempered bainite and were not detected in the tempered
   martensite. The martensite phase decomposed into ferrite and spherical
   Fe3C, and interlath-retained austenite decomposed into ferrite and
   elongated carbide.}},

Abstract = {{Drive-thru Internet has become a popular solution vehicular Internet
   access. However, the quality-of-service provisioning for high-data-rate
   drive-thru Internet services poses significant challenges upon medium
   access control (MAC) in a large-scale and highly dynamic vehicular
   environment. In this paper, to achieve high throughput in drive-thru
   Internet, we exploit the mobility interdependency between neighboring
   vehicles and propose a density-adaptive MAC protocol by predicting the
   vehicle-density dynamics. Specifically, to predict the vehicle-density
   fluctuations in the drive-thru Internet scenario, we leverage
   Navier-Stokes equations to characterize the mobility interdependence and
   the dynamically waving vehicle-density which can be observed from the
   simulated vehicle traces in VISSIM. In tune with the dynamic
   vehicle-density, we propose an enhanced MAC protocol to dynamically
   adjust the contention window (CW) setting in order to improve the
   throughput. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the
   utilized mobility model, and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   MAC protocol in improving the overall resultant system throughput.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the following iterative construction of a random planar
   triangulation. Start with a triangle embedded in the plane. In each
   step, choose a bounded face uniformly at random,add a vertex inside that
   face and join it to the vertices of the face. After n-3 steps, we obtain
   a randomtriangulated plane graph with n vertices, which is called a
   Random Apollonian Network (RAN). Weshow that asymptotically almost
   surely (a.a.s.) a longest path in a RAN has length o(n), refuting
   aconjecture of Frieze and Tsourakakis. We also show that a RAN always
   has a cycle (and thus a path)of length (2n -5)(log 2/ log 3), and that
   the expected length of its longest cycles (and paths) is ohm(n(0.88)).
   Finally, we prove that a.a.s. the diameter of a RAN is asymptotic to c
   log n, where c = 1.668 is the solution of an explicit equation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Stochastic optimization methods are used for optimal design and
   operation of surface water reservoir systems under uncertainty.
   Chance-constrained (CC) optimization with linear decision rules (LDRs)
   is an old approach for determining the minimum reservoir capacity
   required to meet a specific yield at a target level of reliability.
   However, this approach has been found to overestimate the reservoir
   capacity. In this paper, we propose the reason for this overestimation
   to be the fact that the reliability constraints considered in standard
   CC LDR models do not have the same meaning as in other models such as
   reservoir operation simulation models. The simulation models have
   fulfilled a target reliability level in an average sense (i.e.,
   annually), whereas the standard CC LDR models have met the target
   reliability level every season of the year. Mixed integer nonlinear
   programs are presented to clarify the distinction between the two types
   of reliability constraints and demonstrate that the use of seasonal
   reliability constraints, rather than an average reliability constraint,
   leads to 80-150 \% and 0-32 \% excess capacity for SQ-type and S-type CC
   LDR models, respectively. Additionally, a modified CC LDR model with an
   average reliability constraint is proposed to overcome the reservoir
   capacity overestimation problem. In the second stage, we evaluate
   different operating policies and show that for the seasonal (average)
   reliability constraints, open-loop, S-type, standard operating policy,
   SQ-type, and general SQ-type policies compared to a model not using any
   operation rule lead to 190-460 \% (200-550 \%), 100-200 \% (80-300 \%),
   0-90 \% (0-60 \%), 30-90 \% (0-20 \%), and 10-90 \% (0-10 \%) excess
   capacity, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The high-speed railway dispatching command system is the nerve center of
   a high-speed railway. The construction of such a system that has high
   reliability is of great significance in ensuring the safe operation and
   all-weather operation of trains. This study analyses the collaborative
   needs of a highspeed railway dispatching system, and investigates the
   organizational coordination of the system in terms of a collaborative
   plan, organizational coordination, information coordination, etc. The
   coordination mechanism of a high-speed railway dispatching command
   system should be based on three perspectives: (1) The vertical
   hierarchical level of the high-speed railway dispatching system's
   coordination, (2) The primary and auxiliary synergies of the horizontal
   professional subsystem, and (3) The cooperation between dispatching
   stations, as well as between the high-speed railway and the existing
   line command system. In this paper, we propose a theory of coordination
   between a high-speed railway dispatching command system and the existing
   lines, as well as a method for its implementation. Together, this theory
   and method will provide theoretical guidance and technical support in
   the development of a dispatching command system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on the recent
   state-of-the-art technologies, sensor placement methodologies, dynamic
   evaluations and control strategies that have been proposed to improve
   the efficiency of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power
   plants. IGCC technologies and configurations including different types
   and designs of membranes, short residence-time gasifiers and new classes
   of turbines with higher firing temperature, represent promising
   economically attractive technologies for IGCC power plants and therefore
   are thoroughly reviewed in this work. Optimal sensor placement is
   critical since harsh operating conditions within specific IGCC
   components and budget constraints do not allow installing sensors that
   measure some key process variables for this system. The statistical
   approaches to determine the optimal number of sensors and their location
   in the plant are discussed. The dynamic performance of IGCC processes in
   closed-loop control is considered under critical scenarios using various
   tools such as process assessment under uncertainty, plant-wide and local
   control strategies. Major applications for each of these tools have been
   reported and discussed in detail. Furthermore, challenges and
   development potential for optimal sensor location and control systems
   for commercial IGCC power plants are outlined in this work. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Row-column addressed arrays for ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT)
   applications are analyzed and demonstrated in this paper. Simulation and
   experimental results of a row-column addressed 32 by 32 capacitive
   micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array are presented. The CMUT
   array, which was designed for medical imaging applications, has a center
   frequency of 5.3 MHz. The CMUT array was used to perform C-scans on test
   objects with holes that have diameters of 1.0 mm and 0.5 mm. The array
   transducer has an aperture size of 4.8 mm by 4.8 mm, and it was used to
   scan an area of 4.0 mm by 4.0 mm. Compared to an N by N fully addressed
   2-D array, a row-column addressed array of the same number of elements
   requires fewer (N instead of N-2) pairs of interconnection and
   supporting electronic components such as pulsers and amplifiers. Even
   though the resulting field of view is limit by the aperture size,
   row-column addressed arrays and the row-column addressing scheme can be
   an alternative option of 2-D arrays for NDT applications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A membrane electrode assembly is subjected to carbon corrosion
   accelerated stress tests (ASTs) involving the application of square-wave
   voltage cycles with different upper limits to measure the resulting loss
   in the mass of the carbon support at the cathode catalyst layer (CL) and
   the associated degradation in performance. Carbon loss is determined
   from the amount of CO2 evolved during degradation, while the performance
   loss is measured from the reduction in the cell voltage at 1.5 A cm(-2)
   relative to the performance obtained in its beginning-of-life state. A
   kinetic model for carbon corrosion describing the rate of evolution of
   CO2 is shown to accurately predict the carbon loss measured during the
   various carbon corrosion ASTs in this study. A plot of the performance
   losses from the various carbon corrosion ASTs versus the corresponding
   carbon losses reveals that all the data demonstrate consistent
   degradation regardless of the AST conditions, and these result can be
   fitted with an exponential function termed the `fingerprint' expression.
   By combining the carbon corrosion model and fingerprint expression, both
   the carbon loss and performance loss of a cathode CL during a carbon
   corrosion AST can be accurately predicted based only on knowledge of the
   waveform of the input voltage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The external performance of quantum optoelectronic devices is governed
   by the spatial profiles of electrons and potentials within the active
   regions of these devices. For example, in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs),
   the electric field domain (EFD) hypothesis posits that the potential
   distribution might be simultaneously spatially nonuniform and temporally
   unstable. Unfortunately, there exists no prior means of probing the
   inner potential profile directly. Here we report the nanoscale measured
   electric potential distribution inside operating QCLs by using scanning
   voltage microscopy at a cryogenic temperature. We prove that, per the
   EFD hypothesis, the multi-quantum-well active region is indeed divided
   into multiple sections having distinctly different electric fields. The
   electric field across these serially-stacked quantum cascade modules
   does not continuously increase in proportion to gradual increases in the
   applied device bias, but rather hops between discrete values that are
   related to tunneling resonances. We also report the evolution of EFDs,
   finding that an incremental change in device bias leads to a
   hopping-style shift in the EFD boundary - the higher electric field
   domain expands at least one module each step at the expense of the lower
   field domain within the active region.}},

Title = {{A nonstationary index-flood technique for estimating extreme quantiles

Volume = {{519}},

Pages = {{2040-2048}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude and timing of peak streamflow events may be affected by
   land-use changes along with climate change, thus leading to
   nonstationarity in the records. Temporal trend, along with
   change-points, in peak flow records can affect the accuracy of quantile
   estimates; therefore, these issues should not be disregarded. Commonly
   used techniques for pooled flood frequency analysis do not account for
   nonstationarity found in the data recorded for members of a region. To
   overcome this shortcoming, the objective of this research is to
   introduce a trend centered pooling approach for regionalization in which
   pooling groups are created based on the form of trend found in the
   at-site data. The approach involves the formation of regions comprised
   entirely of sites exhibiting either statistically significant increasing
   or decreasing trends. Regional parameter estimates are determined using
   a maximum likelihood approach, which is carried out with the assumption
   of second-order nonstationarity. The technique was applied to four
   homogenous regions all located in differing hydroclimatological Canadian
   regions. The uncertainty of quantile estimates calculated through the
   implementation of this technique was established using a balanced
   regional vector resampling approach. The results indicate that there is
   less uncertainty in quantile estimates found through the application of
   the trend centered pooling approach when compared to a regional
   stationary analysis of the same regions. The potential for
   overestimation/underestimation of design quantiles in the presence of
   significant regional nonstationarity (i.e. decreasing/increasing trends)
   was elucidated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an improved kinetics for the formation of
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols on gold substrates. Based on
   predictions of a computational model developed to study the SAM growth
   kinetics, SAMs of 11-mercaptoinic acid and 1-octanethiol were
   successfully formed for the first time within 15 min by incubation of
   planar gold chips in a 10 mM solution of thiols in pure ethanol. The
   performance of this new rapid SAM formation protocol is compared to the
   conventional 24 h incubation protocol by evaluating the binding capacity
   of a fluorescent-labeled antibody to the SAM samples prepared using both
   protocols. Tetramethylrhodamine conjugated polyclonal goat
   gamma-globulin (IgG) was bound to all SAMs previously modified with
   1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) to improve
   antibody immobilization. Resulting binding density of the fast SAM was
   evaluated using epifluorescence and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
   found to be comparable with reported values in the literature using
   conventional 24 h protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology application to concrete presents an innovative approach
   to improve concrete properties based on the ability to manipulate the
   cementitious material at an atomic scale. This paper presents a review
   of the nano-materials that have been used in concrete. The literature
   survey revealed that four nano-materials are most often used to modify
   concrete properties; these include nano-silica (nano-SiO2),
   nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2), carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) and carbon
   nano-fibres (CNFs). All of these four nano-materials have shown
   improvement in many concrete properties. Both nano-TiO2 and nano-SiO2
   reduce bleeding and segregation, and improve mechanical and transport
   properties. CNFs and CNTs tend to adversely affect the fresh properties
   due to agglomerations, which are overcome when a surfactant or
   ultrasonic mixer is used. However, both CNFs and CNTs significantly
   improve the mechanical properties of concrete. This paper also discusses
   how concrete durability is improved when nano-materials are added to
   concrete. In addition, this paper identifies several research needs
   based on the gaps in the current state of knowledge on using

Abstract = {{Background: Clostridium pasteurianum is one of the most promising
   biofuel producers within the genus Clostridium owing to its unique
   metabolic ability to ferment glycerol into butanol. Although an
   efficient means is available for introducing foreign DNA to C.
   pasteurianum, major genetic tools, such as gene knockout, knockdown, or
   genome editing, are lacking, preventing metabolic engineering of C.
   pasteurianum.
   Results: Here we present a methodology for performing chromosomal gene
   disruption in C. pasteurianum using the programmable lactococcus Ll.ltrB
   group II intron. Gene disruption was initially found to be impeded by
   inefficient electrotransformation of Escherichia coli-C. pasteurianum
   shuttle vectors, presumably due to host restriction. By assessing the
   ability of various vector deletion derivatives to electrotransform C.
   pasteurianum and probing the microorganism's methylome using
   next-generation sequence data, we identified a new C. pasteurianum Type
   I restriction-methylation system, CpaAII, with a predicted recognition
   sequence of 5'-AAGNNNNNCTCC-3' (N = A, C, G, or T). Following rescue of
   high-level electrotransformation via mutation of the sole CpaAII site
   within the shuttle vectors, we retargeted the intron to the cpaAIR gene
   encoding the CpaAI Type II restriction endonuclease (recognition site of
   5'-CGCG-3'). Intron insertion was potentially hindered by low
   retrohoming efficiency, yet this limitation could be overcome by a
   procedure for enrichment of the intron insertion. The resulting Delta
   cpaAIR mutant strain was efficiently electrotransformed with M.
   FnuDII-unmethylated plasmid DNA.
   Conclusions: The markerless and plasmidless Delta cpaAIR mutant strain
   of C. pasteurianum developed in this study can serve as a general host
   strain for future genetic and metabolic manipulation. Further, the
   associated gene disruption protocol should not only serve as a guide for
   chromosomal gene inactivation studies involving mobile group II introns,
   but also prove invaluable for applying metabolic engineering strategies
   to C. pasteurianum.}},

Abstract = {{We report planar integration of tapered terahertz (THz) frequency
   quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with metasurface waveguides that are
   designed to be spoof surface plasmon (SSP) out-couplers by introducing
   periodically arranged SSP scatterers. The resulting surface-emitting THz
   beam profile is highly collimated with a divergence as narrow as similar
   to 4 degrees x 10 degrees, which indicates a good waveguiding property
   of the metasurface waveguide. In addition, the low background THz power
   implies a high coupling efficiency for the THz radiation from the laser
   cavity to the metasurface structure. Furthermore, since all the
   structures are in-plane, this scheme provides a promising platform where
   well-established surface plasmon/metasurface techniques can be employed
   to engineer the emitted beam of THz QCLs controllably and flexibly. More
   importantly, an integrated active THz photonic circuit for sensing and
   communication applications could be constructed by incorporating other
   optoelectronic devices such as Schottky diode THz mixers, and graphene
   modulators and photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple one-pot co-assembly method for the synthesis of
   hierarchically structured pigment particles consisting of silica
   inverse-opal bricks that are doped with plasmonic absorbers. We study
   the interplay between the plasmonic and photonic resonances and their
   effect on the visual appearance of macroscopic collections of photonic
   bricks that are distributed in randomized orientations. Manipulating the
   pore geometry tunes the wavelength-and angle-dependence of the
   scattering profile, which can be engineered to produce angle-dependent
   Bragg resonances that can either enhance or contrast with the color
   produced by the plasmonic absorber. By controlling the overall
   dimensions of the photonic bricks and their aspect ratios, their
   preferential alignment can either be encouraged or suppressed. This
   causes the Bragg resonance to appear either as uniform color travel in
   the former case or as sparse iridescent sparkle in the latter case. By
   manipulating the surface chemistry of these photonic bricks, which
   introduces a fourth length-scale (molecular) of independent tuning into
   our design, we can further engineer interactions between liquids and the
   pores. This allows the structural color to be maintained in oil-based
   formulations, and enables the creation of dynamic liquid-responsive
   images from the pigment. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The microstructural evolution of the spot welded AZ31, AZ61 and AZ80
   magnesium alloys was studied via optical and scanning electron
   microscopy. As the Al content of the magnesium base alloy increased from
   3 wt\% (AZ31) to 6\% (AZ61) and 8\% (AZ80), columnar to equi-axed
   dendrite transition and grain refinement in the fusion zone were
   enhanced. However, the increasing amount of the beta-Mg-17(Al,Zn)(12)
   phase in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and fusion zone (FZ) resulted in
   the reduction of the tensile shear strengths of the AZ61 and AZ80 welds
   compared to those of AZ31 welds. Moreover, in the tensile-shear testing,
   the AZ61 and AZ80 welds failed in the heat affected zone along the
   fusion boundary, because micro-cracking occurred preferentially at the
   interfaces between beta particles and Mg matrix. Post-weld solutionizing
   treatment was found to significantly reduce the quantity of beta
   particles in heat affected and fusion zones of AZ61 and AZ80 welds. This
   led to an increase in the weld strengths of AZ61 and AZ80 alloys because
   the heat treatment eliminated the beta particles and cracks propagated
   into the coarse-grained heat affected zone and then base material. For
   the heat treated welds, grain size was found as a major factor in the
   failure mode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A scientific attempt was made to exclusively bridge the gap between
   theoretical modeling and experimental evaluation of thermodynamic
   parameters exhibiting the removal efficiency of biopolymer in membrane
   supported ultrafiltration. The d-election deficient metal ions are
   chelated by naturally occurring biopolymer sericin containing
   polypeptides of several amino acids. Thermodynamically, an equilibrium
   is established between chelated metal ions in retentate on one side and
   escaped metal ions in permeate solution on other side of membrane due to
   metal-sericin complexation in ultrafiltration cell. The amount of metal
   ions entrapped on account of metal-sericin complexation (MSC) is the
   function of rejection percentage R\% in polymer supported
   ultrafiltration. A novel theoretical model or relationship between R\%
   and metal-sericin complexation constant K-f was developed at Dorman
   equilibrium followed by the evaluation of thermodynamic functions such
   Delta G(0), Delta H-0 and Delta S-0 in sericin-facilitated
   ultrafiltration. High rejection percentage (R > 90\%) of Cu(II) and
   Zn(II) implies the significant stability of MSC for these metal ions at
   three different temperatures 293 K, 303 K and 313 K Greater values of
   R\% were observed at lower concentration of each metal ion on account of
   enhanced chelating power of applied biopolymer sericin which is
   susceptible to concentration of metal ions. In addition, rejection data
   were statistically elaborated to support the argument based on developed
   novel model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modelling of greenhouse gas emissions from the steady state and
   non-steady state operations of a combined cycle power plant located in
   Ontario, Canada}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{103-112}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Although often neglected, the non-steady state operations of power
   plants are more likely to result in increased emissions and process
   safety incidents compared to steady state operations. There are multiple
   challenges in predicting non-steady state emissions. Firstly, it is
   difficult to collect accurate data during such events due to their
   dynamic process variables and shorter time span. Additionally, many
   manufacturers do not have emissions data available for start-up and
   shut-down events. Also, the U.S. EPA does not provide method tests
   applicable for dynamic processes. Furthermore, developing and processing
   facility emission models are more challenging and expensive for dynamic
   processes. Moreover, integrating coupled process functions, such as
   reaction and heat transport operations, complicates the prediction of
   non-steady state emissions. In this study, the dispersion of greenhouse
   gas emissions from steady state and non-steady state operations of a
   future combined cycle power plant were modelled using CALPUFF. The
   natural gas fired plant consists of a turbine generator that exhausts
   through a heat recovery steam powered generator. The main source of
   emissions is the stack of the heat recovery generator. Nitrogen oxide,
   carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide were modelled under
   full load operation, cold start followed by full load operation, warm
   start followed by full load operation and hot start followed by full
   load operation. The results showed that nitrogen oxide and carbon
   monoxide emissions were significantly higher under non-steady state
   operation. This may be because during start-up operations, the low
   temperature will not activate any control technology operations that may
   be in place. Sulphur dioxide emissions did not change significantly with
   operating scenarios. Carbon dioxide emissions were higher under steady
   state operation, likely due to higher fuel consumption. Based on the
   results of this study, air quality impact assessments are recommended to
   consider emissions from both, steady state and non-steady state
   operation to ensure that impacts are assessed based on the worst case
   scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ocular pathogens can cause serious damages in the eye leading to severe
   vision loss and even blindness if left untreated. Identification of
   pathogens is crucial for administering the appropriate antibiotics in
   order to gain effective control over ocular infection. Herein, we report
   a gold nanostar based ``chemical nose{''} for visually identifying
   ocular pathogens. Using a spectrophotometer and nanostars of different
   sizes and degrees of branching, we show that the ``chemical nose{''} is
   capable of identifying the following clinically relevant ocular
   pathogens with an accuracy of 99\%: S. aureus, A. xylosoxidans, D.
   acidovorans and S. maltophilia. The differential colorimetric response
   is due to electrostatic aggregation of cationic gold nanostars around
   bacteria without the use of biomolecule ligands such as aptamers or
   antibodies. Transmission electron microscopy confirms that the number of
   gold nanostars aggregated around each bacterium correlates closely with
   the colorimetric response. Thus, gold nanostars serve as a promising
   platform for rapid visual identification of ocular pathogens with
   application in point-of-care diagnostics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this work, we report a spontaneous formation of copper (Cu-N-S/C)
   catalysts containing both nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) elements using a
   one-step pyrolysis of carbon supported copper phthalocyanine
   tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (CuTSPc/C). The obtained catalysts
   exhibit high catalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in
   alkaline media. Through electrochemical measurements and physical
   characterizations, several observations are reached as follows: (1)
   different pyrolysis temperatures can result in different catalyst
   structures and performances, and the optimum pyrolysis temperature is
   found to be 700 degrees C; (2) the electron transfer number of the ORR
   process catalyzed by the unpyrolyzed catalyst is about 2.5, after the
   pyrolysis, this number is increased to 3.5, indicating that the
   pyrolysis process can change the ORR pathway from a 2-electron transfer
   dominated process to a 4-electron transfer dominated one; (3) increasing
   catalyst loading from 40 mu g cm(-2) to 505 mu g cm(-2) can effectively
   improve the catalytic ORR activity, under which the percentage of H2O2
   produced decreases sharply from 39.5\% to 7.8\%; and (4) the Cu ion can
   bond on pyridinic-N, graphite-N and C-S-n-C to form Cu-N-S/C catalyst
   active sites, which play the key role in the ORR activity. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In the context of sustainable clean hydrogen production pathways,
   photovoltaic-electrolyzer systems are one of the most promising
   alternatives for acquiring hydrogen from renewable energy sources.
   In fact, determining the optimal set of design and operating variables
   are always a key issue while coupling directly renewable electricity
   sources to PEM electrolyzers. Few previous studies have attempted to
   find the optimal size and operational condition of directly coupled
   photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV/El) systems in order to maximize the
   hydrogen production or to minimize energy transfer loss between
   photovoltaic devices and the electrolyzer. Nevertheless an easy and
   efficient approach still remains to be found. Because of the nonlinear
   nature of the system, in this framework, multi-objective nonlinear
   optimization is employed, an approach based on the method of imperialist
   competitive algorithm (ICA). It considers the effect of ambient
   temperature and radiation weather data during a whole year.
   Multi-objective optimization provides a wide range of optimal design and
   operating conditions, from which these variables can be selected based
   on objectives with different weight values. This allows performing the
   system optimization by considering two different objectives, namely,
   minimization of energy transfer loss and maximization of hydrogen
   production.
   The optimum system that focuses solely on maximum hydrogen production
   can produce 2.2\% more hydrogen than with its objective being minimum
   energy transfer loss. However, it results in 68\% more energy transfer
   loss in the process. The values can be adjusted with options that
   include a combination of the two objectives. Additionally, optimal
   variables can be found through the ICA method. Copyright (C) 2014,

Abstract = {{Dark fermentative hydrogen production under the effect of zero-valent
   metal shavings (iron, aluminum and copper) was studied by using a
   sucrose medium and a mixed bacterial consortium. The iron shavings were
   found to be unique to promote the hydrogen production, the hydrogen
   yield obtained from an optimal dose of 8-16 g/L reached 4.2 mol/mol
   hexose, doubled compared with that obtained from the control without
   addition of the iron shavings. The effect was more obvious in low pH
   buffered medium than in higher buffered medium. The aluminum and copper
   shavings were either inert or toxic to the cultivation. It is evident
   that the addition of the zero-valent iron helped maintaining the pH to
   an optimal range for hydrogen production and drove more reducing
   equivalents to the production of hydrogen. A microbial corrosion system
   mediated by the hydrogen producing bacteria was proposed to be
   responsible for the improvement of hydrogen production. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The interactions between a series of poly(ethylene oxide)s covalently
   labeled at both ends with pyrene pendants (PEO(X)-Py-2, where X
   represents the number-average molecular weight of the PEO chains and
   equals 2K, 5K, 10K, and 16.5K) and an ionic surfactant, namely, sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS), in water were investigated at a fixed pyrene
   concentration of 2.5 mu M corresponding to polymer concentrations
   smaller than 21 mg/L and with an SDS concentration range between 5 x 106
   and 0.02 M, thus encompassing the 8 mM critical micelle concentration
   (CMC) of SDS in water. The steady-state fluorescence spectra showed that
   the I-2/I-3 ratio decreased from 1.73 +/- 0.06 for SDS concentration
   smaller than 2 mM where pyrene was exposed to water to 1.43 +/- 0.03 for
   SDS concentration greater than 6 mM where pyrene was incorporated inside
   SDS micelles. The ratio of excimer-to-monomer emission intensities (the
   I-E/I-M ratio) of all PEO(X)-Py-2 samples remained constant at low SDS
   concentrations, then increased, passed through a maximum at the same SDS
   concentration of 4 mM before decreasing to a plateau value that is close
   to zero for PEO(10K)-Py-2 and PEO(16.5K)-Py-2 but nonzero for
   PEO(2K)-Py-2 and PEO(5K)-Py-2. The pyrene end groups of these two latter
   samples could not bridge two different micelles due to the short PEO
   chain, and excimer was formed by intramolecular diffusion inside the
   same SDS micelle. Time-resolved fluorescence decays of the pyrene
   monomer and excimer of the PEO(X)-Py-2 samples were acquired at various
   SDS concentrations and globally fitted according to the Model Free
   analysis over the entire range of SDS concentration. The molar fractions
   of various excited pyrene species and the rate constant of pyrene
   excimer formation retrieved from the analysis of fluorescence decays
   were obtained as a function of SDS concentration. Interactions between
   SDS and PEO could not be detected by isothermal titration calorimetry,
   potentiometry with a surfactant selective electrode, and conductance
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), as a promising health-care system,
   can timely monitor human physiological parameters. Due to the limitation
   of communications, power, storage and computation in WBANs, a cloud
   assisted WBAN flourishes and provides more reliable, real-time, and
   intelligent health-care services for patients and mobile users. However,
   it is still critical to efficiently aggregate the different types of
   WBAN data to the cloud server. In addition, security and privacy
   concerns are also of paramount importance during the communications
   between WBAN and cloud. In this paper, we propose a priority based
   health data aggregation (PHDA) scheme with privacy preservation for
   cloud assisted WBANs to improve the aggregation efficiency among
   different types of health data. Specifically, we first explore social
   spots to help forward health data and enable users to select the optimal
   relay according to their social ties. According to different data
   priorities, the adjustable forwarding strategies can be selected to
   forward the user's health data to the cloud servers with the reasonable
   communication overheads. The security analysis demonstrates that the
   PHDA can achieve identity and data privacy preservation, and resist the
   forgery attacks. Finally, the performance evaluation shows that the PHDA
   achieves the desirable delivery ratio with reasonable communication
   costs and lower delay for the data in different priorities. (C) 2014

   improves process safety, but also protects the environment from
   potential impacts of the process. Current methodologies for risk
   assessment at the conceptual design stage of a chemical process need
   detailed process data, which is usually unavailable at such a phase.
   This paper presents simple new indices that require minimum data for
   risk evaluation of chemical processes at the conceptual design phase.
   The indices are applied to a hydrogenation case study to choose
   inherently safer designs among different alternatives. As an important
   result, total capacity of a process among other design array does not
   suffice for decision making unless the mass fraction of hazards in
   product streams are appreciably low. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{We report a novel strategy for the fabrication of nanoporous gold (NPG)
   films. The fabrication process involves the electrodeposition of a
   gold-tin alloy, followed by subsequent chemical dealloying of tin.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a bicontinuous nanoporous
   structure formed on the substrates after chemical dealloying. Energy
   dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis indicates that there are no impurities
   in the Au-Sn alloy film with an average composition of 58 at. \% Au and
   42 at. \% Sn. After dealloying, only gold remains in the NPG film
   indicating the effectiveness of this technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   results reveal that the as-prepared Au-Sn alloy film is composed of two
   phases (Au5Sn and AuSn), while the NPG film is composed of a single
   phase (Au). We demonstrate that this approach enables the fabrication of
   NPG films, either freestanding or supported on various conductive
   substrates such as copper foil, stainless steel sheet and nickel foam.
   The resulting NPG electrode exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity
   toward both H2O2 reduction and methanol oxidation compared to the
   polished Au disc electrode. Our strategy provides a general method to
   fabricate high quality NPG films on conductive substrates, which will
   broaden the application potential of NPG or NPG-based materials in
   various fields such as catalysis, optics and sensor technology.}},

Title = {{Discovering co-occurring patterns and their biological significance in
   protein families}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The large influx of biological sequences poses the
   importance of identifying and correlating conserved regions in
   homologous sequences to acquire valuable biological knowledge. These
   conserved regions contain statistically significant residue associations
   as sequence patterns. Thus, patterns from two conserved regions
   co-occurring frequently on the same sequences are inferred to have joint
   functionality. A method for finding conserved regions in protein
   families with frequent co-occurrence patterns is proposed. The
   biological significance of the discovered clusters of conserved regions
   with co-occurrences patterns can be validated by their three-dimensional
   closeness of amino acids and the biological functionality found in those
   regions as supported by published work.
   Methods: Using existing algorithms, we discovered statistically
   significant amino acid associations as sequence patterns. We then
   aligned and clustered them into Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs)
   corresponding to conserved regions with amino acid conservation and
   variation. When one APC frequently co-occured with another APC, the two
   APCs have high co-occurrence. We then clustered APCs with high
   co-occurrence into what we refer to as Co-occurrence APC Clusters
   (Co-occurrence Clusters).
   Results: Our results show that for Co-occurrence Clusters, the
   three-dimensional distance between their amino acids is closer than
   average amino acid distances. For the Co-occurrence Clusters of the
   ubiquitin and the cytochrome c families, we observed biological
   significance among the residing amino acids of the APCs within the same
   cluster. In ubiquitin, the residues are responsible for ubiquitination
   as well as conventional and unconventional ubiquitin-bindings. In
   cytochrome c, amino acids in the first co-occurrence cluster contribute
   to binding of other proteins in the electron transport chain, and amino
   acids in the second co-occurrence cluster contribute to the stability of
   the axial heme ligand.
   Conclusions: Thus, our co-occurrence clustering algorithm can
   efficiently find and rank conserved regions that contain patterns that
   frequently co-occurring on the same proteins. Co-occurring patterns are
   biologically significant due to their three-dimensional closeness and
   other evidences reported in literature. These results play an important
   role in drug discovery as biologists can quickly identify the target for
   drugs to conduct detailed preclinical studies.}},

   dedicated compressors, realistic cost correlations, temperature effects,
   stream-dependent properties, fuel gas specifications, heating, cooling,
   and valve expansions. Furthermore, it avoids the many bilinear and
   posynomial terms present in the existing models; thus it is easier to
   solve. Our tests with several literature examples confirm that our model
   gives better and more realistic solutions than the previous models, and

Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Linear polypropylene (PP) was modified using UV radiation in the
   presence of 0.5 wt \% of benzophenone photoinitiator to introduce long
   chain branching (LCB) to the PP backbone. Irradiation was carried out in
   the solid state and the temperature level was kept below 60 degrees C.
   The effects of radiation duration and sample thickness on the extent of
   these branching modification reactions were investigated. Viscoelastic
   properties, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and gel
   content were determined and compared for runs having different sample
   thicknesses, irradiated for different times. Comparisons were also
   conducted with the parent PP and the PP mixed with photoinitiator. It
   was found that LCB decreased by increasing the thickness of the samples.
   Conversely, an increase in radiation duration resulted in enhanced LCB
   but also led to larger gel content in the samples. Based on all these
   measurements and observations, a mechanism was suggested to explain
   formation of long chain branches (LCBs) in PP in the solid state via

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the active third-axle system as an innovative
   vehicle dynamic control method. This method can be applicable for
   different kinds of three-axle vehicles such as buses, trucks, or even
   three-axle passenger cars. In this system, an actuator on the middle
   axle actively applies an independent force on the suspension to improve
   the handling characteristics, and hence, its technology is similar to
   slow-active suspension systems. This system can change the inherent
   vehicle dynamic characteristics, such as under/over steering behaviour,
   in the linear handling region, as well as vehicle stability in the
   nonlinear, limit handling region. In this paper, our main focus is to
   show the potential capabilities of this method in enhancing vehicle
   dynamic performance. For this purpose, as the first step, the proposed
   method in both linear and nonlinear vehicle handling regions is studied
   mathematically. Next, a comprehensive, nonlinear, 10 degrees of freedom
   vehicle model with a fuzzy control strategy is used to evaluate the
   effectiveness of this system. The dynamic behaviour of a vehicle, when
   either uncontrolled or equipped with the active third axle is then
   compared. Simulation results show that this active system can be
   considered as an innovative method for vehicle dynamic control.}},

Abstract = {{A prospective approach to addressing carcinogen risk assessment is
   presented. Fuzzy reasoning is used to assess carcinogenic risk,
   characterize it, and control it. The approach is inspired by fuzzy
   control inference that deploys linguistic intelligence as input to a
   system described numerically through membership functions. Fuzzy-based
   reasoning to estimate carcinogenic risk provides several advantages as
   discussed here. The fuzzy reasoning approach has more capabilities than
   traditional models in dealing with risk agents that are probably
   carcinogens, possibly carcinogens, not classifiable as carcinogens, and
   probably not carcinogens. Input-output surfaces are presented for each
   hazard group to enable fast inferencing. Then, a hypothetical example is
   given to compare the results of traditional methods and the fuzzy-based
   approach to estimating the risk of a carcinogen to a human population.
   Results show similarity in risk characterization with less input
   information to the fuzzy-based approach. Fuzzy reasoning characterizes
   risk in more explicit and easy to grasp terms. Two outputs of the
   inferencing system are risk characterization and risk control or
   remediation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology
   enables an optical transmission system to break the limitation of
   wavelength grids due to legacy of wavelength division multiplexing. This
   constructs a flexible and elastic transmission paradigm so as to achieve
   high spectrum efficiency and flexibility of fiber resource usage. This
   paper introduces a novel adaptive transmission strategy in elastic
   coherent optical OFDM transmission systems, aiming to optimize the
   system operation in terms of energy and spectrum consumptions for a
   transmission demand with a required data rate. By jointly considering
   the nonlinear effects of Mach-Zehnder modulator and amplified
   spontaneous emission noise from optical amplifiers, as well as the
   performance impairment due to high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) in
   the electronic domain, we first provide an analytical model on the bit
   error rate performance for a single-elastic optical transmission line.
   To achieve an efficient PAPR reduction, we introduce a new method called
   simplified null switching, which is considered very suitable in the
   elastic optical transmission systems due to lower computation complexity
   and little dependence on the channel side information. Based on the
   analytical model, an optimization problem is formulated based on the
   proposed analytical model and solved via mathematical programming. Case
   studies via extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the
   proposed analytical model and gain better understanding on the solutions
   of formulated optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in multi-channel cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs) is studied. The two fundamental issues in DSA,
   spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing, for a general scenario are
   revisited, where the channels present different usage characteristics
   and the detection performance of individual secondary users (SUs)
   varies. First, spectrum sensing is investigated, where multiple SUs are
   coordinated to cooperatively sense the channels owned by the primary
   users (PUs) for different interests. When the PUs' interests are
   concerned, cooperative spectrum sensing is performed to better protect
   the PUs while satisfying the SUs' requirement on the expected access
   time. For the SUs' interests, the objective is to maximize the expected
   available time while keeping the interference to PUs under a predefined
   level. With the dynamics in the channel usage characteristics and the
   detection capacities, the coordination problems for the above two cases
   are formulated as nonlinear integer programming problems accordingly,
   which are proved to be NP-complete. To find the solution efficiently,
   for the former case, the original problem is transformed into a variant
   of convex bipartite matching problem by constructing a complete
   bipartite graph and defining proper weight vectors. Based on the problem
   transformation, a channel selection algorithm is proposed to compute the
   solution. For the latter case, the deterministic optimization problem is
   first transformed to an associated stochastic optimization problem,
   which is then solved by cross-entropy (CE) method of stochastic
   optimization. Then, the sharing of the available channels by SUs after
   sensing is modeled by a channel access game, based on the framework of
   weighted congestion game. An algorithm for SUs to select access channels
   to achieve Nash equilibrium (NE) is proposed. Simulation results are
   presented to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In a smart power grid, collecting data from a large number of smart
   meters and sensors over the conventional one-hop transmission control
   protocol (TCP) communication is prone to a high packet loss rate and
   degraded throughput due to the ineffectiveness of the TCP congestion
   control Mechanism. The Split and Aggregated TCP (SA-TCP) proposes
   upgrading intermediate devices (known as regional collectors or RCs) to
   combine meters' TCP connections and forward data over a unified TCP
   connection to the utility server.
   This paper provides a comprehensive performance analysis of the SA-TCP
   scheme. It studies the impact of varying various parameters on the
   scheme, including the impact of network link capacity, buffering
   capacity of RCs, propagation delay between the meters and the utility
   server, and finally the number of RCs utilized as SA-TCP aggregators.
   The performance results show that by adjusting those parameters, it is
   possible to tune throughput of a smart metering network to the desired
   amount while keeping the deployment cost minimal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study compared the results of modelling vinyl chloride emissions
   from a renewable energy generation plant, located in the City of
   Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, Canada, using American Meteorological
   Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) and
   California Puff (CALPUFF). The plant utilizes landfill gas emissions
   from the existing Lindsay/Ops landfill to fuel an on-site generator, and
   thus generate electricity. The modelling was performed for July 20, 2013
   and November 17, 2013, from 00h00 local standard time (LST) to 23h00 LST
   for both days. The results showed that modelling contaminant dispersion
   using CALPUFF resulted in significantly higher concentrations than when
   modelling with AERMOD. This may be due to the several limitations of
   AERMOD, including its assumptions of straight line trajectory,
   steady-state and a uniform atmosphere, its inaccuracy when determining
   long-range transport, and its inability to retain the memory of the
   previous hours' emissions. The CALPUFF modelling results also showed
   that the contaminant concentration may, in some instances, be higher
   farther away from the source than closer to it. The results also show
   that the concentration of vinyl chloride on July 20, 2013, as modelled
   by CALPUFF, exceeds the applicable regulatory limit. Thus, it is
   recommended to use CALPUFF instead of AERMOD to assess the dispersion of
   emissions from a facility more conservatively. Using CALPUFF will also
   ensure that the dispersion is assessed further away from the emissions
   sources as well as nearer to them. The appropriate selection of
   dispersion models is especially important when the results of one of the
   models may deem the facility's emissions non-compliant with the
   applicable regulatory limits. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, the effect of long chain branching (LCB) and
   polymerization conditions on thermal, mechanical, and rheological
   properties of polyethylene synthesized via a metallocene polymerization
   was studied. The LCB was varied in the range of 0.64-1.14 per 10(4)
   atoms of C. C-13 NMR spectra showed that the distributions of both short
   as well as long chain branches in the polymer backbone chain are
   influenced by polymerization conditions. The increase in ethylene
   pressure leads to rise in polymer yield, catalyst activity, molecular
   weight, and narrowing of molecular weight distribution. In contrast, the
   increase of polymerization duration results in broadening of MWD and a
   decrease in catalyst activity. In addition, the influence of frequency
   and LCB on dynamic shear and extensional melt rheology has been
   reported. The polymer crystallization was discussed in light of Avrami
   model and modified Hoffman-Lauritzen theory. LCB promoted the transport
   of chain segments but retarded the nucleation in polyethylene
   crystallization. The tensile strength decreased with the increase in LCB
   content. The different macroscopic properties were correlated to LCB
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Adequate Knowledge of reservoir fluid characteristics (e.g., bubble
   point pressure) plays a crucial role while conducting
   modeling/simulation of production processes in petroleum reservoirs.
   Although many efforts have been made to obtain proper correlations for
   prediction of bubble point pressure (BPP) of reservoir fluids, there is
   still relatively high magnitude of error with the developed predictive
   tools available in the literature. To fill this lacuna, a robust and
   effective technique, called gene expression programming (GEP), is
   employed to determine BPP of crude oil samples as a function of
   temperature, oil composition, molecular weight of C7+, and specific
   gravity of C7+. The GEP method is built based on the experimental (or
   real) data used for training and testing phases in order to develop an
   appropriate correlation. The previous predictive methods are also
   reported in this study and employed to calculate BPP as a function of
   independent parameters when the same data bank is utilized. Comparing
   the outputs obtained from the previous models with the BPP values
   predicted by the GEP technique, it was found that the GEP approach
   exhibits higher accuracy and lower uncertainty on the basis of
   statistical analysis in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2) and
   mean squared error (MSE). Great precision attained in this study through
   using GEP recommends linking reservoir simulator packages with the GEP
   tool when thermodynamic properties such as BPP are required for modeling
   and optimization purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantization table design is revisited for image/video coding where soft
   decision quantization (SDQ) is considered. Unlike conventional
   approaches, where quantization table design is bundled with a specific
   encoding method, we assume optimal SDQ encoding and design a
   quantization table for the purpose of reconstruction. Under this
   assumption, we model transform coefficients across different frequencies
   as independently distributed random sources and apply the Shannon lower
   bound to approximate the rate distortion function of each source. We
   then show that a quantization table can be optimized in a way that the
   resulting distortion complies with certain behavior. Guided by this new
   design principle, we propose an efficient statistical-model-based
   algorithm using the Laplacian model to design quantization tables for
   DCT-based image coding. When applied to standard JPEG encoding, it
   provides more than 1.5-dB performance gain in PSNR, with almost no extra
   burden on complexity. Compared with the state-of-the-art JPEG
   quantization table optimizer, the proposed algorithm offers an average
   0.5-dB gain in PSNR with computational complexity reduced by a factor of
   more than 2000 when SDQ is OFF, and a 0.2-dB performance gain or more
   with 85\% of the complexity reduced when SDQ is ON. Significant
   compression performance improvement is also seen when the algorithm is
   applied to other image coding systems proposed in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional platinum-cobalt alloy nanowires (PtCoNWs) are prepared
   by electrospinning, which provides a versatile platform for the
   synthesis of nanowires with tunable diameters and atomic compositions.
   PtCoNWs with a near unity stoichiometric ratio, excellent atomic
   distribution and an average diameter of 28 nm were evaluated for oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) activity in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. Over a
   four-fold enhancement in Pt mass-based activity at an electrode
   potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE is obtained in comparison to pure PtNWs,
   highlighting the beneficial impact of the alloying structure. A near
   7-fold specific activity increase is also observed in comparison to
   commercial Pt/C catalyst, along with improved electrochemically active
   surface area retention through repetitive (1000) potential cycles.
   Electrospinning is thereby an attractive approach to prepare morphology
   and composition controlled PtCoNWs that could potentially one day
   replace conventional nanoparticle catalysts. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{The current generation is not only facing the shortage of fossil fuels
   in the near future, but also is responsible for preserving the
   environment for future generations. As a result, the development of
   clean energy systems is becoming an urgent focus for the research
   community. Metal air batteries have attracted much attention due to
   their extremely high energy density, and the rechargeability which is
   directly governed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present a new class of hybrid
   bi-functional catalyst consisting of porous nanorod perovskite
   La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF-PR) combined with nitrogen-doped reduced
   graphene oxide (NRGO) active towards both ORR and OER. The novel
   morphology of LSCF-PR is prepared by an electrospinning method, and
   incorporated into NRGO sheets. Electron microscopy reveals interesting
   composite morphology in which LSCF-PR is embedded between the sheets of
   NRGO, forming an efficient LSCF-PR/NRGO composite morphology for the
   electrochemical oxygen reactions. Electrochemical testing of the
   LSCF-PR/NRGO composite in alkaline medium results in excellent ORR and
   OER catalytic activities, verifying the effective combination for
   bi-functionality. LSCF-PR/NRGO presents not only a comparable or
   superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst for ORR or OER,
   respectively, but also better durability. These results highlight the
   applicability of LSCF-PR/NRGO composite having unique and efficient
   morphology as a promising bi-functional catalyst for metal air battery
   applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Exergy destruction in adiabatic pipeline flow of surfactant-stabilized
   oil-in-water emulsions is investigated in five different diameter pipes.
   The dispersed-phase (oil droplets) concentration of the emulsions is
   varied from 0\% to 55.14\% vol. The emulsions are Newtonian in that the
   viscosity is independent of the shear rate. For a given emulsion and
   pipe diameter, the exergy destruction rate per unit pipe length
   increases linearly with the increase in the Reynolds number on a log-log
   scale in both laminar and turbulent regimes. However the slope in the
   turbulent regime is higher. The exergy destruction rate increases with
   the increase in the dispersed-phase concentration of emulsion and
   decreases with the increase in the pipe diameter. New models are
   developed for the prediction of exergy destruction rate in pipeline flow
   of surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. The models are based on
   the single-phase flow equations. The experimental data on exergy
   destruction in pipeline flow of emulsions shows excellent agreement with
   the predictions of the proposed models.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research has been done on the components that constitute the
   sulfur supply chain, including sulfur recovery, storage, forming, and
   distribution. The research focus was on improving the efficiency and
   environmental sustainability of each of these areas rather than focusing
   on the supply chain as a whole. The aim of this work is to design a
   sulfur supply chain that integrates these components within a single
   framework. It represents a starting point in understanding the
   trade-offs involved in the sulfur supply chain from an optimization
   point of view. Optimization and mathematical modeling techniques were
   implemented to generate a decision support system that will provide an
   indication of the optimal design and configuration of sulfur supply
   chains. The resulting single-period mixed-integer linear programming
   (MILP) model was aimed at minimizing total infrastructural and
   operational costs. The model was illustrated through a case study based
   on Albertas Industrial Heartland (AIH). A deterministic approach in an
   uncertain environment was implemented to investigate the effect of
   supply and demand variability on the design of the supply chain. This
   was applied to two scenarios, which are steady state operation and
   sulfur surplus accumulation. The results for the investigated case study
   reveal that the optimum sulfur supply chain might consist of
   medium-to-large sulfur forming facilities serving multiple producers.
   The model also identified the locations of forming facilities, the
   forming, storage and transportation technologies, and their capacities.}},

Abstract = {{New environmental regulations on CO2 emission from coal-fired power
   plants will require significant carbon capture and sequestration
   capabilities. This will increase the need to develop advanced
   model-based control systems that are able to maintain the dynamic
   operability of CO2 capture plants in the presence of operational
   constraints and disturbances. This paper presents an advanced
   centralized multivariable model predictive control (MPC) technique,
   which considers energy and environmental constraints, to address the
   controllability of a post-combustion CO2 capture process from a
   coal-based power plant. To implement the MPC-based control strategy, an
   instant client-server data communication link between the process
   simulator and the control framework was implemented using component
   objective model technology. The case studies presented in this study
   show that MPC performs significantly better in terms of close-loop
   settling time, integral squared error and compliance of operational and
   environmental constraints when compared to a decentralized multi-loop
   control scheme based on proportional-integral (PI) controllers. The
   proposed MPC scheme is further implemented in a dynamic multi-objective
   optimization framework to address the optimal scheduling of the CO2
   capture process under disturbances. The presented scheduling scenarios
   consider the dynamic performance of the system and can be used to design
   feasible and efficient operating policies for the CO2 capture plant. (C)

Abstract = {{Lift-off and direct etch are the two most popular pattern transfer
   methods for electron beam lithography. For some applications negative
   resist would offer significantly less exposure time than positive one.
   Unfortunately, lift-off using negative resist is very challenging
   because the resist profile is typically positively tapered due to
   electron forward scattering, and upon exposure, negative resist is
   cross-linked and thus insoluble in solvents. Here, the authors will show
   that low energy exposure can circumvent both issues simultaneously, and
   the authors achieved liftoff of Cr with polystyrene resist using a
   solvent xylene. Moreover, low energy exposure offers proportionally
   higher resist sensitivity. Lastly, since low energy electrons are mostly
   stopped inside the resist layer, radiation damage to the sublayer is
   greatly reduced. Thus, the current method may be employed to fabricate
   metal nanostructures on top of an organic conducting layer. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Micro- and nanostructures with a tapered sidewall profile are important
   for antireflection and light trapping applications in solar cell, light
   emitting diode, and photodetector/imager. Here, the authors will show
   two etching processes that offer a large taper angle. The first process
   involved a maskless etching of pre-etched silicon structures having a
   vertical profile, using a recipe that would give a vertical profile when
   masked. The authors obtained a moderate taper angle of 14 degrees using
   CF4/O-2 etching gas. The second process involved a one-step etching step
   with Cr as mask using a recipe that was drastically modified from a
   nonswitching pseudo-Bosch process that gives a vertical profile. The gas
   flow ratio of C4F8/SF6 was greatly increased from 38/22 to 59/1 to
   result in a taper angle of 22 degrees. Further reduction of the RF bias
   power led to an unprecedented large taper angle of 39 degrees (at the
   cost of greatly reduced etching rate), which is even higher than the
   angle obtained by anisotropic wet etching of silicon. (C) 2014 American

   and experimental analysis}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The instability dynamics of inviscid liquid jets issuing from elliptical
   orifices is studied, and effects of the surrounding gas and the liquid
   surface tension on the stability behavior are investigated. A dispersion
   relation for the zeroth azimuthal (axisymmetric) instability mode is
   derived. Consistency of the analysis is confirmed by demonstrating that
   these equations reduce to the well-known dispersion equations for the
   limiting cases of round and planar jets. It is shown that the effect of
   the ellipticity is to increase the growth rate over a large range of
   wavenumbers in comparison to those of a circular jet. For higher Weber
   numbers, at which capillary forces have a stabilizing effect, the growth
   rate decreases with increasing ellipticity. Similar to circular and
   planar jets, increasing the density ratio between gas and liquid
   increases the growth of disturbances significantly. These theoretical
   investigations are complemented by experiments to validate the local
   linear stability results. Comparisons of predicted growth rates with
   measurements over a range of jet ellipticities confirm that the
   theoretical model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the
   instability dynamics in the Rayleigh and first wind-induced regimes. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new baseband equivalent (BBE) Volterra-series
   model suitable for the behavioral modeling and linearization of wideband
   RF power amplifiers (PAs). Starting with passband Volterra series, and
   following a number of signal transformations, a discrete expression
   relating the envelopes of the output and input signals to the carrier
   frequency was derived. The new BBE Volterra series reduces the number of
   kernels, and hence, avoids resorting to the pruning approaches commonly
   applied in the literature to the classical low-pass equivalent (LPE)
   Volterra formulation. The proposed baseband Volterra series has similar
   modeling and linearization performance to the full classical LPE
   Volterra series. It also outperforms the pruned LPE Volterra models,
   which use a dynamic deviation reduction approach, in terms of both
   linearization performance and complexity. The proposed BBE Volterra
   series was successfully used to linearize different PAs (200-W LDMOS
   Doherty and 45-W broadband GaN PA) driven with wideband and intra-band
   carrier aggregated signals (mixed LTE and WCDMA signals).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the user accommodation capabilities of LTE-A
   systems with carrier aggregation for the LTE users and LTE-A users,
   respectively. The adopted performance metric is equivalent capacity
   (EC), defined as the maximum number of users allowed in the system given
   the user QoS requirements. Specifically, both LTE and LTE-A users are
   divided into heterogeneous user classes with different QoS requirements,
   traffic characteristics and bandwidth weights. Two bandwidth allocation
   strategies are studied, i.e., the fixed-weight strategy and the
   cognitive-weight strategy, where the bandwidth weights of different user
   classes are prefixed under the former and dynamically changing with the
   cell load conditions under the latter. For each strategy, closed-form
   expressions of ECs of different user classes are derived for LTE and
   LTE-A users, respectively. A net-profit-maximization problem is further
   formulated to discuss the tradeoff among the bandwidth weights.
   Extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate our analytical
   results, and demonstrate an interesting discovery that only a slightly
   higher spectrum utilization of LTE-A users than LTE users can result in
   a significant EC gain when the user traffic is bursty. Moreover, the
   cognitive-weight strategy is shown to outperform considerably the
   fixed-weight one due to stronger adaptability to the cell load
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel monitoring trail (m-trail) allocation
   method for achieving local unambiguous failure localization under the
   monitoring burst (m-burst) framework, in which a single monitoring node
   (MN) can localize any multi-link failure with up to d links in a (d +
   1)-connected network by inspecting the optical bursts traversing through
   it. Specifically, the proposed m-trail allocation method ensures that
   any healthy link is traversed by at least one uninterrupted m-trail
   during a multi-link failure, which can be achieved by launching no more
   than (d + 1) link-disjoint m-trails per link originating from the MN.
   Based on such a sufficient condition, we study the performance of the
   m-burst framework by solving an integer linear program (ILP) and a novel
   heuristic, and implement the method for up to three link failures. To
   avoid high computation complexity in solving the ILP, a heuristic
   algorithm is developed for deriving (d + 1) link-disjoint m-trails
   between the MN and each link of the network. Numerical results show that
   the proposed methods yield significantly better performance than
   previous methods in the reference backbone network topologies.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen and sulfur co-doped mesoporous carbon materials are synthesized
   by pyrolyzing FeSO4+ poly (ethyleneimine) + template SiO2 mixture at a
   high temperature without additional dopant precursors. For
   post-treatment, acid leaching is used to remove the metal, and the
   heat-treatment is tailored to optimize the catalytic activity of the
   catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic solution.
   Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, low-temperature N-2
   adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled
   plasma are used to characterize the catalysts' morphologies, structures,
   and compositions. Rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk
   electrode techniques are employed to quantitatively obtain the ORR
   kinetic constants and determine the reaction mechanisms. The ORR
   activity is highly improved by reheating the catalyst after H2SO4
   leaching with improved half-wave potential of 0.68 V vs. RHE, and ORR
   electron number larger than 3.76. Moreover, increasing the catalyst
   loading of 800 mu g cm(-2) exhibits only 36 mV deviation from Pt/C. It
   is believed that the synergetic effect between the Fe-, N- and
   S-containing active sites and the modified carbon matrix structure due
   to H2SO4 leaching and reheating should make contribution to the high ORR
   activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced exergy analysis of a water lithium bromide absorption
   refrigeration machine was conducted. For each component of the machine,
   the proposed analysis quantified the irreversibility that can be avoided
   and the irreversibility that is unavoidable. It also identified the
   irreversibility originating from inefficiencies within the component and
   the irreversibility that does not originate from the operation of the
   considered component. It was observed that the desorber and absorber
   concentrated most of the exergy destruction. Furthermore, the exergy
   destruction at these components was found to be dominantly endogenous
   and unavoidable. A parametrical study has been presented discussing the
   sensitivity of the different performance indicators to the temperature
   at which the heat source is available, the temperature of the
   refrigerated environment, and the temperature of the cooling medium used
   at the condenser and absorber. It was observed that the endogenous
   avoidable exergy destruction at the desorber, i.e. the portion of the
   desorber irreversibility that could be avoided by improving the design
   and operation of the desorber, decreased when the heat source or the
   temperature at which the cooling effect was generated increased, and it
   decreased when the heat sink temperature increased. The endogenous
   avoidable exergy destruction at the absorber displayed the same
   variations, though it was observed to be less affected by the heat
   source temperature. Contrary to the aforementioned two components, the
   exergy destruction at the evaporator and condenser were dominantly
   endogenous and avoidable, with little sensitivity to the cycle operating
   parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We recently reported the heterologous production of 1-propanol in
   Escherichia coli via extended dissimilation of succinate under anaerobic
   conditions through expression of the endogenous sleeping beauty mutase
   (Sbm) operon. In the present work, we demonstrate high-level
   coproduction of 1-propanol and ethanol by developing novel engineered E.
   coli strains with effective cultivation strategies. Various biochemical,
   genetic, metabolic, and physiological factors affecting relative levels
   of acidogenesis and solventogenesis during anaerobic fermentation were
   investigated. In particular, CPC-PrOH3, a plasmid-free propanogenic E.
   coli strain derived by activating the Sbm operon on the genome, showed
   high levels of solventogenesis accounting for up to 85 \% of
   dissimilated carbon. Anaerobic fed-batch cultivation of CPC-PrOH3 with
   glycerol as the major carbon source produced high titers of nearly 7 g/L
   1-propanol and 31 g/L ethanol, implying its potential industrial
   applicability. The activated Sbm pathway served as an ancillary channel
   for consuming reducing equivalents upon anaerobic dissimilation of
   glycerol, resulting in an enhanced glycerol dissimilation and a major
   metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis.}},

   operating margins of the thermal generators in systems with uncertain
   wind and solar generation dispatch. The AA-based approach is
   bench-marked against Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) intervals in order to
   determine its effectiveness. The proposed technique is tested and

Abstract = {{The potential of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PHEVs) to
   participate in power system control, via the vehicle-to-grid program, is
   increasing rapidly. In several recent studies, PHEVs are employed to
   participate in system frequency regulation; however, no attention has
   been paid to the impact of single-phase connection of these distributed
   energy sources. This paper addressed the use of PHEVs to stabilize the
   frequency in microgrids and/or weak grids which lack enough inertia
   considering the single-phase nature and communication delays.
   Small-signal analysis is used to evaluate the performance of both droop
   and virtual inertia control methods, and show how time delay of a
   centralized control could impact system stability. Advantages and
   disadvantages of distributed control are studied, and a new method based
   on a combination of both centralized and distributed control is proposed
   to mitigate the impact of asymmetrical virtual inertia while it allows
   the utilization of all available PHEVs for active power however
   asymmetric they are. Time-domain simulations are used to verify the
   analytical studies.}},

Abstract = {{In wafer probing, probe needles provide the physical contact between the
   wafers and the probe card. During the contact process, the shape of the
   probe needle and the mounting configuration onto the probe card has
   large influences on the stresses and contact force that the probe
   needles experience. In this paper static performance of a vertical-type
   probe needle integrated with floating mount technology was analyzed with
   a nonlinear finite element analysis. The geometry of a vertical probe
   needle was optimized in order to minimize the stress that occurs during
   the overdrive process, while maintaining adequate force for proper
   contact with the wafer Maximum stress and contact force were formulated
   using the coefficients of 4th order polynomial representing the shape of
   cobra body, and then curvature of the probe needle body was optimized by
   applying the constrained minimization function to these functions. The
   maximum stress in the vertical probe pin at 125 mu m overdrive was
   reduced from 972 MPa to 666 MPa by employing the probe needle with
   optimized geometry. The optimized design also induced the contact force

   Pavements Subjected to Freezing and Sand Application}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Pervious concrete pavement can effectively reduce both the volume of
   water and the concentration of many sediment-associated contaminants in
   urban runoff. However, chloride from road salt is recognized as a threat
   to surface and groundwater resources because it is a conservative ion
   and does not readily bind to soil particles. To better understand and
   manage water resources in urban environments experiencing annual
   freeze-thaw cycles, this study examines the impact of road salt (sodium
   chloride) and sand applications on water and chloride movement in
   pervious concrete structures in a laboratory setting. Water movement and
   salt retention were characterized within pervious concrete slabs under
   frozen and thawed conditions. Laboratory experiments were repeated using
   both brine (23\% salt solution) and fresh water as well as varying
   additions of sand (typical of winter sand application rates in Canada)
   to provide a range of temperatures experienced in cold-climate urban
   environments. Performance testing (via infiltration capacity) was
   conducted to assess the suitability of pervious concrete in climates
   where road sand and salt application is necessary. For all experimental
   conditions studied, chloride was rapidly transported through the
   pervious concrete. The complete freezing of pore water throughout the
   concrete slab reduced water and salt movement within the concrete
   matrix, while sand application reduced water movement through pores and
   delayed peak flow. The infiltration capacity of the pervious concrete
   structures, as tested, exceeds the probable maximum water loading rate
   that will be encountered in Southern Ontario, Canada, with or without
   sand, frozen or unfrozen. From a groundwater management and source water
   protection perspective, the data indicate that pervious concrete
   pavement structures may contribute to chloride contamination of
   groundwater if used in salt vulnerable areas and groundwater recharge
   zones. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Multicore technology has the potential for drastically increasing
   productivity of embedded real-time computing. However, joint use of
   hardware, e.g., caches, memory banks and on-chip buses makes the
   integration of multiple real-time applications into a single system
   difficult: resource accesses are exclusive and need to be sequenced.
   Moreover, resource access schemes of modern off-the-shelf multicore
   chips are commonly optimized for the average-case, rather than being
   timing predictable. Real-time analysis for such architectures is
   complex, as execution times depend on the deployed hardware, as well as
   on the software executing on other cores. This will ask for significant
   abstractions in the timing analysis, where the resulting pessimism will
   lead to over-provisioned system designs and a lowered productivity as
   the number of applications to be put together into a single architecture
   needs to be decreased. In response to this, (a) we present a formal
   approach for bounding the worst-case response time of concurrently
   executing real-time tasks under resource contention and almost
   arbitrarily complex resource arbitration policies, with a focus on main
   memory as shared resource, (b) we present a simulation framework which
   allows for detailed modeling and empirical evaluation of modern
   multicore platforms and applications running on top of them, and (c) we
   present experiments to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of
   the presented methodologies and compare their accuracy. For limiting
   non-determinism inherent to the occurrence of cache misses, we
   particularly take advantage from the predictable execution model as
   discussed in recent works.}},

   psi hydrogen pressure, the glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol
   selectivity catalyzed by the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst prepared via oxalate
   gel-coprecipitation were 92.3 and 94.5 \% respectively. It was found
   that the 1,2-propanediol selectivity was dependent on hydrogen pressure
   and the un-desired by-products were mainly due to the side reactions

   handheld text entry?}},

Abstract = {{Research indicates that using a cell phone to talk or text while
   maneuvering a vehicle impairs driving performance. However, few
   published studies directly compare the distracting effects of texting
   using a hands-free (i.e., speech-based interface) versus handheld cell
   phone, which is an important issue for legislation, automotive interface
   design and driving safety training. This study compared the effect of
   speech-based versus handheld text entries on simulated driving
   performance by asking participants to perform a car following task while
   controlling the duration of a secondary text-entry task. Results showed
   that both speech-based and handheld text entries impaired driving
   performance relative to the drive-only condition by causing more
   variation in speed and lane position. Handheld text entry also increased
   the brake response time and increased variation in headway distance.
   Text entry using a speech-based cell phone was less detrimental to
   driving performance than handheld text entry. Nevertheless, the
   speech-based text entry task still significantly impaired driving
   compared to the drive-only condition. These results suggest that
   speech-based text entry disrupts driving, but reduces the level of
   performance interference compared to text entry with a handheld device.
   In addition, the difference in the distraction effect caused by
   speech-based and handheld text entry is not simply due to the difference
   in task duration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{84-90}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study a flush wall scramjet combustor is tested in a supersonic
   incoming air flow with the Mach number of 3 which is generated by an air
   vitiation heater producing the stagnation temperature of 1505 K. Using
   liquid kerosene as the fuel, the flame is stabilized by means of a
   centrally mounted O-2 pilot strut after being ignited by a plasma torch.
   During experimental measurements, the fuel is injected with a constant
   equivalence ratio of 0.8 according to specified strut/wall injection
   ratios, i.e., a portion of the fuel amount is injected from the strut
   while the rest is injected from the wall. The strut and wall injectors
   are arranged at the same axial position. The combustion performance and
   wall temperature gradients are evaluated with various fuel feeding
   ratios between the wall and the strut. Experimental results show, when
   the equivalence ratio is constant and the axial injection position is
   fixed, the combustion characteristics vary significantly with the
   strut/wall fuel feeding ratio, especially when this ratio is close to
   its lowest and highest limits. Among the four fuel feeding ratios
   examined, the strut only injection mode and the average distributed
   strut/wall injection mode show the best combustion performance. However,
   the strut/wall injection mode produces a smaller wall temperature
   gradient compared to the strut only injection mode, which is due to the
   significant film cooling effect caused by the wall injected liquid
   kerosene. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a methodology based on rigorous model fitting and
   sensitivity analysis is presented to determine the parameters describing
   the physicochemical behavior of commercial pouch Li-ion batteries of
   high-capacity (16 A h), utilized in electric vehicles. It is intended
   for a rapid estimation of the kinetic and transport parameters, state of
   charge and health of a Li-ion battery when chemical information is not
   available, or for a brand new system. A pseudo 2-D model comprised of
   different contributions reported in the literature is utilized to
   describe the mass, charge and thermal balances of the cell and porous
   electrodes; and adapted to the battery chemistry under study. The
   sensitivity analysis of key model parameters is conducted to determine
   confidence intervals, using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for non-linear
   models. Also individual multi-parametric sensitivity analysis is
   conducted to assess the impact of the model parameters on battery
   voltage. The battery is comprised of multiple cells in parallel
   containing carbon anodes and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC) cathodes with
   maximum and cut-off voltages of 4.2 and 2.7 V, respectively. Mass and
   charge transfer limitations during the discharge/charge of the battery
   are discussed as a function of State of Charge (SOC). A thermal analysis
   is also conducted to estimate the temperature rise on the surface of the
   battery. This modeling methodology can be extended to the analysis of
   other chemistry types of Li-ion batteries, as well as the evaluation of
   other material phenomena including capacity fade. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing (FSP) of Al 5059 is studied in which subsequent
   heat treatment is conducted to investigate its effects on grain size and
   hardness. It was found that mainly elongated and rhomboidal morphologies
   of Al-6(Mn,Fe) particles are present in the alloy both before and after
   FSP, where the rhomboidal particles are more effective in pinning grain
   boundaries during heat treatment. The stir zone reached a temperature of
   705 K (432 A degrees C), and ThermoCalc modeling confirmed that the
   Al-6(Mn,Fe) particles will remain stable at this temperature. Negligible
   grain growth was observed during FSP of the Al 5059 due to low grain
   boundary mobility resulting from slow diffusion associated with a high
   Mg content in the alloy. During heat treatment at 448 K (175 A degrees
   C) grain growth could be correlated with time using a
   particle-controlled grain growth model. Microhardness values indicate
   that Hall-Petch behavior occurs in the processed alloy, while
   dislocation density and particle dispersion play a minor role in
   strengthening.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, wetting has been characterized by measuring the contact
   angles of AZ92 Mg alloy on Ni-electroplated steel as a function of
   temperature. Reactions between molten Mg and Ni led to a contact angle
   of about 86 deg in the temperature range of 891 K to 1023 K (618 A
   degrees C to 750 A degrees C) (denoted as Mode I) and a dramatic
   decrease to about 46 deg in the temperature range of 1097 K to 1293 K
   (824 A degrees C to 1020 A degrees C) (denoted as Mode II). Scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) indicated that AlNi +
   Mg2Ni reaction products were produced between Mg and steel
   (Mg-AlNi-Mg2Ni-Ni-Fe) in Mode I, and just AlNi between Mg and steel
   (Mg-AlNi-Fe) in Mode II. From high resolution TEM analysis, the measured
   interplanar mismatches for different formed interfaces in Modes I and II
   were -- and -, respectively. An edge-to-edge crystallographic model
   analysis confirmed that Mg2Ni produced larger lattice mismatching
   between interfaces with calculated minimum interplanar mismatches of --
   for Mode I and - for Mode II. Therefore, it is suggested that the poor
   wettability in Mode I was caused by the existence of Mg2Ni since AlNi
   was the immediate layer contacting molten Mg in both Modes I and II, and
   the presence of Mg2Ni increases the interfacial strain energy of the
   system. This study has clearly demonstrated that the lattice mismatching
   at the interfaces between reaction product(s) and substrate, which are
   not in direct contact with the liquid, can greatly influence the wetting
   of the liquid.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum matrix nanocomposites were fabricated via friction stir
   processing of an Al-Mg alloy with preinserted TiO2 nanoparticles at
   different volume fractions of 3\%, 5\% and 6\%. The nanocomposites were
   annealed at 300-500 degrees C for 1-5 h in air to study the effect of
   annealing on the microstructural changes and mechanical properties.
   Microstructural studies by scanning and transmission electron microscopy
   showed that new phases were formed during friction stir processing due
   to chemical reactions at the interface of TiO2 with the aluminum matrix
   alloy. Reactive annealing completed the solid-state reactions, which led
   to a significant improvement in the ductility of the nanocomposites
   (more than three times) without deteriorating their tensile strength and
   hardness. Evaluation of the grain structure revealed that the presence
   of TiO2 nanoparticles refined the grains during friction stir processing
   while the in situ formed nanoparticles hindered the grain growth upon
   the post-annealing treatment. Abnormal grain growth was observed after a
   prolonged annealing at 500 degrees C. The highest strength and ductility
   were obtained for the nanocomposites annealed at 400 degrees C for 3 h.

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this work was to investigate and compare the
   treatability of very high suspended solids with different biodegradable
   particulate fractions and COD fractionation, thin stillage (a by-product
   from the corn ethanol industry) as well as primary sludge from municipal
   wastewater treatment, using an anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor
   (AnFBR) employing US Mesh 30 x 40 zeolite with a diameter of (d(m)) in
   the range of 425-610 mu m and specific surface area (SSA) of 26.5 m(2)/g
   as the carrier media. Each experimental run lasted over a six-month
   period. Due to the long-term impact of accumulation of inert suspended
   solids in the AnFBR and potential active biomass washout leading to
   failure, treatability of high suspended-solid streams can be very
   challenging. Despite the very high strength of thin stillage and primary
   sludge with chemical oxygen demand of 130,000 mg TCOD/L and 42,000 mg
   TCOD/L respectively and suspended solids of 47,000 mg TSS/L and 34,000
   mg TSS/L, the AnFBR showed, up to 88\% and 82\% TCOD and 78\% and 82\%
   TSS removal efficiencies from thin stillage and primary sludge
   respectively at very high organic and solids loading rates (OLR and SLR)
   of 29 kg COD/m(3) d and 9.5 kg COD/m(3) d and 10.5 kg TSS/m(3) d and
   10.3 kg TSS/m(3) d respectively at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.5
   and 4 days. Maximum methane production yields of up to 0.31 L-CH4/g(COD)
   and 0.25 L-CH4/g(COD) were achieved for thin stillage and primary sludge
   respectively corresponding to biogas production rate per reactor volume

Abstract = {{In this study, a highly ion-conductive and durable porous polymer
   electrolyte membrane based on ion solvating polybenzimidazole (PBI) was
   developed for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). The
   introduction of porosity can increase the attraction of electrolytic
   solutions (e.g., potassium hydroxide (KOH)) and ion solvation, which
   results in the enhancement of PBI's ionic conductivity. The morphology,
   thermo-physico-chemical properties, ionic conductivity, alkaline
   stability, and the AEMFC performance of KOH-doped PBI membranes with
   different porosities were characterized. The ionic conductivity and
   AEMFC performance of 70 wt.\% porous PBI was about 2 times higher than
   that of the commercially available Fumapem (R) FAA. All KOH-doped porous
   PBI membranes maintained their ionic conductivity after accelerated
   alkaline stability testing over a period of 14 days, while the
   commercial FAA degraded just after 3 h. The excellent performance and
   good durability of KOH-doped porous PBI membrane makes it a promising
   candidate for AEMFCs. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{Role of metals in the catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) growth
   of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene was investigated using DFT.
   Crucial processes involved in the growth of CNTs/graphene: methane
   dissociation to produce C, C diffusion and nucleation kinetics were
   studied on the (1 1 1) surface of different transition metals, i.e., Fe,
   Co, Ni, and Cu. Based on the DFT calculation results, the present study
   explains why Ni-based catalyst is a suitable CVD substrate for growing
   CNTs: it has a moderate reactivity towards methane dissociation; low
   energy barrier for C atom surface diffusion, which makes C to diffuse
   easily to the metal/CNTs edges and contribute to CNTs growth; relatively
   high nucleation barriers, making it more resistant for deactivation
   caused by the cover of carbon clusters. Meanwhile, this study also shows
   that Cu may be an appropriate catalyst for graphene synthesis due to the
   particularly low diffusion and nucleation barriers of C atoms on Cu,
   which suggest that C atoms tend to be more uniformly distributed and
   nucleate easily on the Cu surface. Key limitation of Cu is the low
   reactivity of this metal towards methane dissociation. Since Fe and Ni
   are very reactive towards C-H bond breaking, Cu based alloys, e.g.
   Cu8Ni, were proposed as a suitable catalyst for graphene production. (C)

Abstract = {{A reinforcement system for short span concrete slab bridges combining
   post-tensioned carbon FRP (CFRP) tendons with non-prestressed glass FRP
   (GFRP) reinforcement can limit the stresses in the GFRP bars to
   significantly improve fatigue performance. Despite this, the failure
   mode may be governed by shear and conventional stirrups are, in general,
   not practical for the construction of slab bridges; therefore the use of
   innovative shear reinforcement methods is required. Twenty-five
   FRP-post-tensioned slabs with various types of FRP shear reinforcement
   were tested under static or fatigue loading. The main variables included
   the size, shape and type of FRP shear reinforcement used. Fatigue shear
   strengths at one million cycles were typically in the range of 50-60\%
   of the ultimate static load capacity. Double-headed shear bars were
   found to be an excellent solution for the shear reinforcement of shallow
   concrete members which were easy to install and provided high load
   capacities and good fatigue performance. The fatigue shear strengths of
   members with anchored shear reinforcement were conservatively predicted
   using the simplified modified compression field theory, accounting for
   the change in concrete tensile strength under fatigue loading. (C) 2014

Title = {{Modeling the shape hierarchy for visually guided grasping}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{The monkey anterior intraparietal area (AIP) encodes visual information
   about three dimensional object shape that is used to shape the hand for
   grasping. We modeled shape tuning in visual AIP neurons and its
   relationship with curvature and gradient information from the caudal
   intraparietal area (CIP). The main goal was to gain insight into the
   kinds of shape parameterizations that can account for AIP tuning and
   that are consistent with both the inputs to AIP and the role of AIP in
   grasping. We first experimented with superquadric shape parameters. We
   considered superquadrics because they occupy a role in robotics that is
   similar to AIP, in that superquadric fits are derived from visual input
   and used for grasp planning. We also experimented with an alternative
   shape parameterization that was based on an Isomap dimension reduction
   of spatial derivatives of depth (i.e., distance from the observer to the
   object surface). We considered an Isomap-based model because its
   parameters lacked discontinuities between similar shapes. When we
   matched the dimension of the Isomap to the number of superquadric
   parameters, the superquadric model fit the AIP data somewhat more
   closely. However, higher-dimensional Isomaps provided excellent fits.
   Also, we found that the Isomap parameters could be approximated much
   more accurately than superquadric parameters by feedforward neural
   networks with CIP like inputs. We conclude that Isomaps, or perhaps
   alternative dimension reductions of visual inputs to AIP, provide a
   promising model of AIP electrophysiology data. Further work is needed to
   test whether such shape parameterizations actually provide an effective
   basis for grasp control.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first synthesis of subcluster segregated nanoalloys formed
   through the joining of immiscible metallic nanoparticles (NPs) using
   femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation. Immiscible alloy components
   consisting of Ag and Ni, and Ag and Fe, all in the form of NPs, were
   first deposited on a carbon film in vacuum by fs laser ablation from the
   parent metals. These samples of randomly distributed NPs were then
   irradiated with multiple fs laser pulses at a fluence of 1.5 mJ/cm(2).
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations indicate that Ag and
   Ni as well as Ag and Fe NPs were successfully joined under these
   conditions. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) results show that no mixing
   layer exists at the interface. The nanostructure in the interface
   reveals the assumption of a specific angle between two matching planes
   on either side of the interface. Calculation of the lattice mismatch
   indicates that the system adjusts to this angle so as to reduce surface
   energy. Structural ledges were also formed at the interface to further
   compensate for the atomic misfit.}},

Abstract = {{The upgrading operations in the Oil Sands are a key asset to Canadas
   economy since they currently process more than 60\% of the crude bitumen
   extracted from this region. Despite their significance and relevance,
   mathematical tools that can evaluate the infrastructure and economy of
   the upgraders operations under fluctuations and variability in key
   operational and economic factors are limited. It is the purpose of this
   study to present a stochastic optimization model that has been developed
   to specify the optimal infrastructure that may be required by the Oil
   Sands upgraders to satisfy the projected production demands at minimum
   cost in the presence of uncertainty in key economic and operational
   parameters. A multiscenario approach, describing the potential
   realizations in the uncertain parameters affecting the upgrading
   operations, is employed in this work to identify the upgraders
   infrastructure that can simultaneously accommodate the projected
   production demands and the uncertainty in the systems parameters. A case
   study featuring the upgrading operations for year 2035 under uncertainty
   in key economic and operational factors is presented. The results show
   significant variability in the upgraders infrastructure, and their
   corresponding energy costs, when this system is evaluated under
   different uncertain scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoporous gold (NPG) films were fabricated on Ni foam substrates via a
   two-step procedure which involves electrodeposition of Au-Sn alloy films
   on the Ni foam surface, followed by selectively leaching the Sn
   component through a chemical dealloying process. Pd nanoparticles were
   then electrochemically deposited on the NPG/Ni foam electrode. The
   morphology of the Pd-decorated NPG/Ni foam composite electrode
   (Pd@NPG/Ni foam) was characterized by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The catalytic activity of the Pd@NPG/Ni foam composite electrode
   toward H2O2 electroreduction in acid media was evaluated by means of
   linear scan voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The Pd@NPG/Ni foam
   composite electrode exhibited high activity and excellent stability for
   the H2O2 electroreduction, generating a current density of 178 mA cm(-2)
   at 0 V in a 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.6 M H2O2 electrolyte, in comparison to 98 mA
   cm-2 on the Pd@Ni foam electrode and 36 mA cm(-2) on the NPG/Ni foam

   obtain very high efficiency with phosphorescent dopants in organic
   light-emitting devices (OLEDs). The exact electroluminescence (EL)
   mechanism, however, is still not clearly understood. In this work, we
   use time-resolved photoluminescence measurements and find that the EL
   mechanism is primarily based on efficient energy transfer from the
   exciplex to the emitter guest. By altering the distance between the
   guest and the exciplex-formation interface, we further uncover that this
   energy transfer occurs mostly by the Dexter mechanism. The results
   explain the high efficiency of phosphorescent OLEDs based on an

Title = {{Noise-compensated homotopic non-local regularized reconstruction for
   rapid retinal optical coherence tomography image acquisitions}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a minimally invasive
   imaging technique, which utilizes the spatial and temporal coherence
   properties of optical waves backscattered from biological material.
   Recent advances in tunable lasers and infrared camera technologies have
   enabled an increase in the OCT imaging speed by a factor of more than
   100, which is important for retinal imaging where we wish to study fast
   physiological processes in the biological tissue. However, the high
   scanning rate causes proportional decrease of the detector exposure
   time, resulting in a reduction of the system signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR). One approach to improving the image quality of OCT tomograms
   acquired at high speed is to compensate for the noise component in the
   images without compromising the sharpness of the image details.
   Methods: In this study, we propose a novel reconstruction method for
   rapid OCT image acquisitions, based on a noise-compensated homotopic
   modified James-Stein non-local regularized optimization strategy. The
   performance of the algorithm was tested on a series of high resolution
   OCT images of the human retina acquired at different imaging rates.
   Results: Quantitative analysis was used to evaluate the performance of
   the algorithm using two state-of-art denoising strategies. Results
   demonstrate significant SNR improvements when using our proposed
   approach when compared to other approaches.
   Conclusions: A new reconstruction method based on a noise-compensated
   homotopic modified James-Stein non-local regularized optimization
   strategy was developed for the purpose of improving the quality of rapid
   OCT image acquisitions. Preliminary results show the proposed method
   shows considerable promise as a tool to improve the visualization and
   analysis of biological material using OCT.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of friction stir processing (FSP) on wear resistance is
   studied on a thermally sprayed coating in terms of microstructure and
   mechanical properties. A high-chromium steel coating sprayed on AISI
   52100 steel has been processed, and it is shown that FSP can improve the
   sprayed layer wear resistance compared to the as-sprayed and quenched
   and tempered condition. It is suggested that improved toughness is the
   main contribution to wear performance rather than hardness. It is
   observed that FSP provides increased hardness and toughness
   simultaneously, while tempering of the quenched AISI 52100 steel
   increases toughness while hardness decreases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The VAPor EXtraction process (also known as VAPEX) is a solvent-based
   enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology that has great potential for the
   recovery of heavy oil and bitumen through mass transfer and gravity
   drainage mechanisms. In this study, laboratory tests, the multivariable
   regression technique, and the connectionist model optimized by a Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) were used to determine the oil production rate during the
   VAPEX process in homogeneous and fractured porous media. The smart
   technique and statistical models describe the VAPEX production rate in
   terms of three dimensionless numbers, namely the Schmidt number (Sc),
   the Peclet number (Pe), and a dimensionless parameter (N-S) referred to
   as the VAPEX number. The developed smart model was constructed based on
   a large number of experimental data conducted under various process
   conditions in both training and testing phases. A comparison of results
   obtained from connectionist modeling, the regressive model, and the
   experimental VAPEX data exhibits an average absolute error lower than
   7\% between the predicted and actual values. Using both experimental and
   modeling results, the statistical analysis suggests that the Peclet
   number is the most important parameter affecting the oil production rate
   in the VAPEX, and also the smart technique is superior to the regression
   model developed. This study shows the effectiveness of connectionist
   model in prediction of VAPEX production in the absence of sufficient
   laboratory and/or field data, which may lead to a proper design of heavy
   oil recovery schemes.}},

   between reacting chains. Therefore, changing the IS of the solution by
   incorporating salts affect not only the point estimates of the monomer

Abstract = {{A new method for synthesis of super-hydrophilic and acid-proof zeolite
   membranes was presented. It involved simultaneous incorporation of
   suitable amounts of Ge and Al into a Silicalite-1 framework. The
   precursor sol was prepared in an ice-water bath, and the alcohols in the
   precursor sol were removed at about 80 degrees C. It was shown that
   using the ice-water bath would prevent the formation of GeO2 and
   removing the alcohols at a relatively high temperature would lead to
   suitable amounts of Ge and Al in the membranes. The obtained Ge-ZSM-5
   membranes were acid-proof and showed high pervaporation performance for
   dehydrating acetic acid and ethanol solutions. At 353 K, for feed acetic
   acid solutions in a concentration range of 30-98 wt\%, the permeation
   flux of water was almost constant (about 0.57 kg/m(2) h), and very
   little acetic acid permeated through the membrane, resulting in a very
   high separation factor. Similarly, for dehydration of ethanol solutions
   (10-98 wt\%) at 343 K a water flux of approximately 2.4 kg/m(2) h was
   obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Tandem organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), i. e., OLEDs containing
   multiple electroluminescence (EL) units that are vertically stacked, are
   attracting significant interest because of their ability to realize high
   current efficiency and long operational lifetime. However, stacking
   multiple EL units in tandem OLEDs increases driving voltage and
   complicates fabrication process relative to their standard single unit
   counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate low driving voltage tandem
   OLEDs via utilizing exciplex-forming hosts in the EL units instead of
   conventional host materials. The use of exciplex-forming hosts reduces
   the charge injection barriers and the trapping of charges on guest
   molecules, resulting in the lower driving voltage. The use of
   exciplex-forming hosts also allows using fewer layers, hence simpler EL
   configuration which is beneficial for reducing the fabrication
   complexity of tandem OLEDs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) easily forms a high strength film but is
   unable to withstand the influence of water vapor when used in high
   moisture situations. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of a NFC
   film was as high as 5088 g/m(2) 24h (38 degrees C, 90\% RH). The
   addition of beeswax latex in a NFC casting film (NFX) lowered the WVTR
   to 3918 g/m(2) 24 h. To further reduce the WVTR, a coating agent
   comprised of acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and
   3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) was applied onto the NFX film using
   a rod coater. A combination of the suitable AESO/APTS ratio, initiator
   dosing, curing time and temperature could reduce the WVTR to 188 g/m(2)
   24 h when the coat weight was 5 g/m(2). Moreover, the coated NFX film
   was highly hydrophobic along with the improved transparency and thermal
   stability. This biodegradable polymer-coated NFC film can be used as
   potential packaging barrier in certain areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   polysulfides into its porous structure positively affecting the
   composite performance as a cathode in a Li/S cell. The resulting

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the deficiency of uncontrolled
   asymmetrical transmission power over multiple channels in ad hoc
   environments. We further propose a novel distributed transmission power
   control protocol called the distributed power level (DPL) protocol for
   multi-channel ad hoc networks without requiring clock synchronization.
   Specifically, different transmission power levels are assigned to
   different channels, and nodes search for an idle channel on the basis of
   the received power so that the maximum allowable power of the preferred
   data channel is larger than or equal to the received power. If the most
   preferred channel of the least maximum power is busy, the nodes are able
   to select the next channel and so forth. As a result, interference is
   reduced over channels because the nodes that require higher transmission
   power are separated from interfering with the nodes that require lower
   transmission power. Two transmission power control modes are introduced
   for DPL: symmetrical and asymmetrical. For the symmetrical DPL protocol
   (mode), nodes transmit at the same power level assigned to the selected
   channel. On the other hand, for the asymmetrical DPL protocol, nodes are
   allowed to transmit at a lower or equal power level that is assigned to
   the selected channel. Extensive ns-2-based simulation results are
   presented to demonstrate that the proposed protocols can enhance the
   network throughput compared with the existing uncontrolled asymmetrical
   transmission power protocol. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the performance of four types of full-wave bridge rectifiers
   designed for electromagnetic energy harvesters based on silicon diodes,
   Schottky diodes, passive MOSFETs, and active MOSFETs. Simulation and
   experimental results show that MOSFET-type rectifiers are more efficient
   than diode-type rectifiers, reaching voltage and power efficiency of
   99\% for ideal voltage source with input amplitudes larger than 800 mV.
   Since active MOSFETs require extra components and an external DC power
   supply, we conclude that passive MOSFETs are superior for micro-power
   energy harvesting systems. We demonstrate passive MOSFET rectifiers
   implemented using discrete, off-shelf components and show that they
   outperform all electromagnetic harvester rectifiers hitherto reported
   obtaining a power efficiency of 95\%. Furthermore, we show that passive
   MOSFET rectifiers do not affect the center frequency, harvesting
   bandwidth, or optimal resistance of electromagnetic harvesters. We
   demonstrate a complete power management module by adding a capacitor to
   the rectifier output terminal. We found that this configuration changed
   the optimal resistive load from 40 Omega to 55 Omega and decreased
   output power efficiency to 86\%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The increased adoption of martensite-containing advanced high strength
   steels, such as martensitic and dual-phase steels, into automotive
   applications has led to concerns among practitioners with respect to
   softening during rapid tempering cycles such as those experienced during
   laser welding. Past studies on rapid tempering have successfully modeled
   the rapid tempering process; however, the activation energies and
   softening rates calculated did not match the classic literature values
   associated with martensite tempering. The present study examined rapid
   tempering data for a martensitic steel and separated the softening
   process into two stages: carbide nucleation and carbide coarsening or
   growth. The activation energies calculated for each process were found
   to be consistent with classic literature values for diffusion controlled
   nucleation and growth of carbides during martensite tempering. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A nitrate/urea mixture was used as fuel to simply combustion-synthesize
   LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 as a high-capacity cathode material for lithium ion
   batteries. The reaction formulas and physical properties of the
   resultant cathode materials sintered at various temperatures were
   examined using thermogravimetric analysis/simultaneous differential
   thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy,
   X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, and inductively coupled plasma/atomic
   emission spectrometry. The influence of sintering temperature on the
   electrochemical performance was evaluated by analyzing the
   charge/discharge profiles and cycling and rate-capability performances.
   The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode sintered at 800 degrees C exhibited a
   discharge capacity of 170 mA h g(-1) measured at a constant 20 mA g(-1),
   98.2\% capacity retention after 30 cycles, and better rate capability
   than the cathodes sintered at 700, 900, and 1000 degrees C. The
   experimental results suggest that the enhanced electrochemical
   performance of the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode sintered at 800 degrees C
   is attributable to the pure, well-organized layered structure containing
   few mixed cations and to the shorter diffusion path resulting from the
   uniformly distributed nanoparticles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, laser additive manufacturing (LAM) of Fe-TiC composite
   coating on AISI 1030 carbon steel is investigated using a numerical and
   experimental method. In order to have a desired result using LAM, it is
   crucial to understand the effects of the process parameters' values on
   the TiC morphology and microstructure. For this purpose, the LAM process
   is numerically simulated in order to calculate cooling rate and peak
   temperature. Experimental data and numerical results are in good
   agreement in terms of the phase development. Results show that cooling
   rate plays a crucial role in phase transformation in the clad, however,
   final microstructure strongly depends on the cooling rate and powder's
   chemical composition. Two main carbide morphologies (i.e. dendritic and
   particulate) are studied and relevant cooling rates are detected. Based
   on this paper and developed map, it is possible to control the cooling
   rate in order to achieve specific carbide morphologies in the clad. In
   this study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS) are used to characterize dads' microstructure. (C)

Abstract = {{Dependability is an important consideration during the design and

   systems, the traditional definition and evaluation methods from the
   systems' and components' point of view meet challenges. In this paper,
   we veer from the angle of view and study the dependability and their
   attributes from the service-oriented perspective. A stochastic model
   using the semi-Markov process is put forward, and the quantitative
   analysis of the dependability attributes is carried out. By extending
   and transforming this model, the mean time to dependability attributes
   failure is calculated. Based on the analysis and calculations, some
   theorems are proposed and proved, to show the inter-relationships and
   comparisons of the different dependability attributes. Furthermore, we
   model the service composition and conduct workflow analysis to show how
   this model could deal with complex services. In addition, LANL service
   systems are analyzed as a case study to show how the proposed model and
   calculation methods could apply to real systems, and sensitivity
   analysis is also performed to identify the bottlenecks and find

Abstract = {{In pipe spool assemblies used in construction, pre-fabrication errors
   inevitably occur due to the complexity of the tasks involved in the pipe
   spool fabrication process, the inaccuracy of the tools employed for
   performing these tasks, human error, and inadequate inspection and
   monitoring,during the process. Permanent deflections may also occur
   during shipment and transportation. After delivery at construction
   sites, defective spools must be detected and further consideration given
   to the erection of the spools to tolerance levels specified; otherwise,
   the repair and realignment associated with rework can cause schedule
   delays and consequent substantial costs increases. This paper presents
   an automated approach for monitoring and assessing fabricated pipe
   spools using automated scan-to-BIM registration. Defects are detected
   through a neighborhood-based Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach for
   the registration process. While this technique can be broadly employed,
   this paper focuses on industrial construction facilities with particular
   emphasis on pipe spool assemblies. Experiments show that the proposed
   approach can be employed for the automatic and continual monitoring of
   such assemblies throughout fabrication, assembly and erection to enable
   timely detection and characterization of deviations. The main
   contribution of the work presented in this paper is an automated 3D
   inspection framework and algorithms for construction assemblies in
   general and pipe spools in particular. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{AZ31B Mg alloy and 201 austenitic stainless steel were lap joined by a
   laser welding-brazing (LWB) process using a Mg-Al-Zn based welding wire.
   The influence of the process heat input on microstructure and mechanical
   properties of the dissimilar joint was investigated. Metallurgical
   bonding of immiscible Mg and Fe couple was achieved by the formation of
   continuous ultrathin reaction products at the fusion zone-steel
   interface, with a thickness varied from 0.5 to 3 mu m, growing slowly
   with the increase of the heat input. The interfacial reaction products
   were identified as Al19Mn4 and Fe(Al) from the fusion zone to the steel,
   respectively. The tensile shear test indicated that joints produced at
   5.4 kJ/cm heat input exhibited the highest mechanical resistance
   reaching 2472 N fracture load, representing a 75.4\% joint efficiency
   relative to the Mg base metal. The failure occurred in the heat-affected
   zone (HAZ) of the Mg base metal, indicating a strong bond at the fusion
   zone-steel interface. The thermodynamic stability of the reaction
   products formed at the interface during the laser welding-brazing
   process was also evaluated in the temperature range of 400 degrees to
   1100 degrees C using FactSage thermochemical software. The results were
   found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The results
   contributed to a better understanding of microstructural evolution at
   different temperatures and compositions during the laser welding-brazing
   of Mg alloys to stainless steel sheet.}},

Abstract = {{Before smartphone probes can be used to obtain instantaneous vehicle
   speeds and other dynamic characteristics, the accuracy of these
   estimates needs to be established under varying degrees of satellite
   signal interruption commonly found with varying road and traffic
   conditions. This paper presents the results of several vehicle tracking
   tests comparing smartphone speeds to benchmark values obtained for three
   types of routes. Benchmark values were obtained using a high frequency
   calibrated V-Box mounted on the test vehicle with four Android OS
   smartphone units.
   A relationship is established linking error in smartphone instantaneous
   speeds to the corresponding signal Circular Error Probable (CEP) range
   for different road and traffic conditions. This relationship is used to
   provide speed adjustment factors for the smartphone probe estimates
   subject to varying satellite signal strength. The CEP test is a reported
   GPS unit indicator of precision based on a known ground control
   benchmark.
   Smartphone speeds (adjusted and unadjusted) are compared to aggregate
   speed profiles from a stationary radar detector placed at a given
   location along SS106 in southern Italy. The smartphone devices were
   found to replicate closely the observed speed profiles obtained from the
   fixed detector station. Simple t-tests suggest that the means of the
   smartphone speeds for the unadjusted case differed significantly from
   the means obtained from the radar detector, when the smartphone
   estimates were adjusted for uncertainty (CEP range related), however,
   the difference in mean speeds between the smartphone probes and the
   radar detector profile was not found to be statistically significant.

Abstract = {{A variety of sensor technologies, such as loop detectors, traffic
   cameras, and radar have been developed for real-time traffic monitoring
   at intersections most of which are limited to providing link traffic
   information with few being capable of detecting turning movements.
   Accurate real-time information on turning movement counts at signalized
   intersections is a critical requirement for applications such as
   adaptive traffic signal control. Several attempts have been made in the
   past to develop algorithms for inferring turning movements at
   intersections from entry and exit counts; however, the estimation
   quality of these algorithms varies considerably. This paper introduces a
   method to improve accuracy and robustness of turning movement estimation
   at signalized intersections. The new algorithm makes use of signal phase
   status to minimize the underlying estimation ambiguity. A case study was
   conducted based on turning movement data obtained from a four-leg
   signalized intersection to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method and compare it with two other existing well-known estimation
   methods. The results show that the algorithm is accurate, robust and
   fairly straightforward for real world implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency is an important performance measure of wireless
   network protocols, particularly for battery-powered mobile devices such
   as smartphones. This paper presents a new energy efficient medium access
   control (MAC) scheme for fully connected wireless ad hoc networks. The
   proposed scheme reduces energy consumption by putting radio interfaces
   in the sleep state periodically and by reducing transmission collisions,
   which results in high throughput and low packet transmission delay. The
   proposed MAC scheme can also address energy saving in realtime traffics,
   which require very low packet transmission delay. An analytical model is
   established to evaluate the performance of the proposed MAC scheme.
   Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
   has significantly lower power consumption, achieves substantially higher
   throughput, and has lower packet transmission delay in comparison with
   existing power saving MAC protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Entropy generation in adiabatic flow of highly concentrated
   non-Newtonian emulsions in smooth tubes of five different diameters
   (7.15-26.54 mm) was investigated experimentally. The emulsions were of
   oil-in-water type with dispersed-phase concentration (phi) ranging from
   59.61-72.21\% vol. The emulsions exhibited shear-thinning behavior in
   that the viscosity decreased with the increase in shear rate. The
   shear-stress (tau) versus shear rate ((gamma) over dot) data of
   emulsions could be described well by the power-law model: tau = K(gamma)
   over dot(n). The flow behavior index n was less than 1 and it decreased
   sharply with the increase in phi whereas the consistency index K
   increased rapidly with the increase in phi. For a given emulsion and
   tube diameter, the entropy generation rate per unit tube length
   increased linearly with the increase in the generalized Reynolds number
   (Re\_n) on a log-log scale. For emulsions with phi <= 65.15 \% vol., the
   entropy generation rate decreased with the increase in tube diameter. A
   reverse trend in diameter-dependence was observed for the emulsion with
   phi of 72.21\% vol. New models are developed for the prediction of
   entropy generation rate in flow of power-law emulsions in smooth tubes.
   The experimental data shows good agreement with the proposed models.}},

Title = {{Dual phase Li4Ti5O12-TiO2 nanowire arrays as integrated anodes for
   high-rate lithium-ion batteries}},

Abstract = {{Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) is well known as a zero strain material
   inherently, which provides excellent long cycle stability as a negative
   electrode for lithium ion batteries. However, the low specific capacity
   (175 mA h g(-1)) limits it to power batteries although the low
   electrical conductivity is another intrinsic issue need to be solved. In
   this work, we developed a facile hydrothermal and ionexchange route to
   synthesize the self-supported dual-phase Li4Ti5O12-TiO2 nanowire arrays
   to further improve its capacity as well as rate capability. The ratio of
   Li4Ti5O12 to TiO2 in the dual phase Li4Ti5O12-TiO2 nanowire is around
   2:1. The introduction of TiO2 into Li4Ti5O12 increases the specific
   capacity. More importantly, by interface design, it creates a dual-phase
   nanostructure with high grain boundary density that facilitates both
   electron and Li ion transport. Compared with phase-pure nanowire
   Li4Ti5O12 and TiO2 nanaowire arrays, the dual-phase nanowire electrode
   yielded superior rate capability (135.5 at 5 C, 129.4 at 10 C, 120.2 at
   20 C and 115.5 mA h g(-1) at 30 C). In-situ transmission electron
   microscope clearly shows the near zero deformation of the dual phase
   structure, which explains its excellent cycle stability. (C) 2014

   on complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs). A CSRR sensor can be
   patterned on the ground plane of a microstrip line and fabricated using
   printed circuit board technology. Compared to available microwave
   techniques for sub-millimeter crack detection, the methods presented
   here show distinct advantages, such as high spatial resolution, high
   sensitivity and design simplicity. The response of the CSRR as a sensor
   for crack detection is studied and analysed numerically. Experimental

Title = {{Multiaxial behaviour of wrought magnesium alloys - A review and

Journal = {{THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{97-108}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Different wrought magnesium alloys from AM, AZ, and ZK family in the
   form of extrusion, rolled sheet and rolled plate have been selected for
   this study. Monotonic and cyclic behaviours are presented and compared.
   In particular, multi axial behaviours under proportional and
   non-proportional loadings are discussed. Despite the differences between
   the investigated alloys, it has been found that these alloys exhibit
   similar monotonic and cyclic characteristics. The similarity is
   attributed to the limited slip system in HCP magnesium, and the dominant
   role of deformation twinning in causing yield and hardening asymmetry.
   With strain energy density merit as a suitable fatigue parameter, it is
   therefore hypothesized that a simple two-parameter energy-based fatigue
   model is capable of correlating fatigue life of wrought magnesium alloys
   irrespective of material process, loading conditions and loading
   orientations. The hypothesis is then tested over a large number of
   fatigue results (354 tests). It is shown that fatigue lives predicted
   using the energy-life model are in good agreement with experimental
   results. Such simple model may prove to be useful in the early design
   stages lightweight components out of magnesium alloys. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a two-phase cooperative transmission and relay
   scheme between a primary network and a secondary network to address
   spectrum underutilization and spectrum inefficiency. By placing
   orthogonally dual-polarized antennas (ODPAs) and enabling polarization
   signal processing functionalities at secondary users (SUs), the
   cochannel interference caused by multiple independent transmissions from
   primary and secondary networks can be mitigated. A framework design,
   including system description, signaling plan, and key enabling
   techniques, is studied to perform Polarization Enabled Active
   CoopEration (PEACE) between primary users (PUs) and SUs. In the
   presented PEACE framework, polarization zero forcing and oblique
   projection polarization filtering are utilized to address interference
   from SUs to the primary network and to separate SUs signals,
   respectively. We provide theoretical analysis to maximize the sum
   achievable channel capacity under certain transmission rates and power
   constraints to evaluate PEACE performance. To solve the original
   nonconvex optimization problem, it is effectively approximated to a
   convex problem, which can be tackled quite efficiently. Closed-form
   solutions to optimal power allocation of SUs are, respectively, obtained
   by a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm. Extensive
   numerical results are given to illustrate the performance and to examine
   the features of the PEACE framework and the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A new microfluidic method of particle separation was proposed and
   studied theoretically in this paper. This method is based on the induced
   charge electro-osmotic flow (ICEOF) and polarizability of dielectric
   particles. In this method, a pair of metal plates is embedded on the
   side channel walls to create a region of circulating flows under applied
   electric field. When a dielectric particle enters this region, the
   vortices produced by ICEOF around the particle will interact with the
   circulating flows produced by the metal plates. Such hydrodynamic
   interaction influences the particle's trajectory, and may result in the
   particle being trapped in the flow circulating zone or passing through
   this flow circulating zone. Because the hydrodynamic interaction is
   sensitive to the applied electric field, and the polarizability and the
   size of the particles, separation of different particles can be realized
   by controlling these parameters. Comparing with electrophoresis and
   dielectrophoresis methods, this strategy presented in this paper is
   simple and sensitive.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{660-667}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Falling film drain water heat recovery (DWHR) systems are single pass,
   vented heat exchangers. The heat from the drain water is transferred
   through the DWHR system to the incoming cold mains water, recovering
   otherwise wasted energy. This article discusses the theory behind DWHR
   systems, and examines how drain-side wetting affects performance. It
   also describes the apparatus built by the Solar Thermal Research
   Laboratory (STRL), at the University of Waterloo, for testing the
   effectiveness of DWHR systems.
   The results show that as the flow rate increases, the effectiveness of
   the DWHR pipe decreases. The data also indicates that there is a
   Critical Flow Rate (CFR) below which the performance of a DWHR pipe
   cannot be extrapolated. The inability to extrapolate is due to the
   incoming drain water not repeatedly wetting the same amount of area on
   the pipe's interior wall. This CFR is dependent on the diameter and
   interior surface characteristics of the pipe. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Grafting of maleic anhydride (MA) onto deproteinized natural rubber
   (DPNR) was carried out using a differential microemulsion polymerization
   technique. To improve the grafting efficiency (G.E) and reduce the gel
   content in the grafts, deproteinizing the NR latex was conducted before
   the grafting reaction and styrene (ST) comonomer was used to increase
   the G.E. The effects of initiator and monomer concentration, reaction
   temperature, reaction time, monomer addition rate, and ST/MA ratio on
   G.E and gel content were investigated. Kinetics of grafting reaction in
   either the presence or absence of ST was investigated. The results
   showed that introduction of copolymerizing styrene could significantly
   improve both the G.E and the grafting content. The G.E increased with
   increasing ST/MA ratio. The optimal grafting condition was initiator and
   MA concentrations of 7 wt\% and 9 wt\% of dried rubber content, ST/MA
   mole ratio of 4:1, and MA addition rate of 0.6 ml/min at 60 degrees C
   for 4 h. The addition of styrene to the grafting process enhances the
   graft copolymerization rate of MA grafting onto DPNR. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a planning model and an active network management
   (ANM) scheme for increasing small-scale renewable distributed generation
   (DG) capacity in distribution networks. The capacity of each DG unit is
   assumed to include two components: 1) unconditional and 2) conditional.
   Unconditional DG capacity is calculated using an appropriate economic
   model that ensures adequate profit for DG investors. For all online
   distribution system conditions, a DG unit whose capacity is less than or
   equal to the unconditional DG capacity is granted permission to inject
   power into the system without curtailment. The first phase of this work
   involved the development of a proposed planning model that maximizes the
   number of DG units installed based on the calculated unconditional
   capacity. Any capacity higher than the unconditional DG capacity is
   considered conditional capacity. The second phase of this work is
   focused on an ANM scheme for minimizing the curtailment of conditional
   DG capacity using a novel scalable optimization model. The simulation
   results show that the proposed planning model with the ANM scheme
   significantly increases the photovoltaic (PV) DG capacity that can be
   installed. The simulation results indicate that online operation of the
   proposed ANM scheme would provide a favorable outcome and enhanced
   performance.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{1193-1203}},

Abstract = {{Wind farms (WFs) are increasingly integrated with high-voltage (HV)
   grids, for which distance relaying is normally the protection of choice.
   This paper reveals some serious defects of distance protection for the
   lines connected to induction generator (IG)-based WFs during balanced
   faults. It is shown that for the squirrel cage IG (SCIG) WFs, distance
   protection becomes insecure, while for the doubly fed IG (DFIG) WFs, the
   relay performance is utterly unreliable, due to operating scenarios that
   are unique to such WFs, and are unfamiliar to the existing relaying
   practices. The detected failures can easily result in unnecessary WF
   tripping, thus jeopardizing the objectives pursued by the new grid codes
   that oblige WFs to remain connected to the grid during disturbances.
   Moreover, a novel modified permissive overreach transfer trip (POTT)
   scheme along with a fault current classification technique is proposed
   to address these problems for both types of IG-based WFs, and the
   accurate nondelayed protection of a distance relay over the entire line
   length is restored. A comprehensive performance evaluation confirms the
   findings of this paper and validates the efficacy of the proposed
   solution for all operating conditions. Results are particularly
   promising for the DFIG-based WFs with nonzero crowbar resistance, which
   is the most likely situation confronted by distance relays.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns arising from fossil-fuelbased generation have
   propelled the integration of less-polluting energy sources in the
   generation portfolio and simultaneously have motivated increased energy
   conservation programs. In today's deregulated electricity market, most
   participants {[}e.g., GENCOs and local distribution companies (LDCs)]
   focus on maximizing their profits, and thus they need to be incentivized
   to invest in renewable generation and energy conservation, which are
   otherwise not profitable ventures. Therefore, this paper proposes a
   novel holistic generation expansion plan (GEP) model that enables the
   central planning authority (CPA) to design optimal incentive rates for
   renewable integration and energy conservation targets, considering the
   investor interests and constraints. The model also determines the
   siting, sizing, timing, and technology required to adequately supply the
   projected demand over the planning horizon. The model is applied to the
   generation planning of Ontario, Canada, based on realistic data, to
   determine appropriate incentives for investors in renewable generation
   and energy conservation by LDCs. The obtained optimal incentives are
   shown to be similar to the ones currently in place in Ontario, with a
   slightly shorter payback period for investors. The effect of
   uncertainties associated with solar and wind energy availability on the
   GEP model is also examined using Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a promising addition to our future
   intelligent transportation systems, which supports various safety and
   infotainment applications. The high node mobility and frequent topology
   changes in VANETs impose new challenges in maintaining a long-lasting
   connection between network nodes. As a result, the lifetime of
   communication links is a crucial issue in VANET development and
   operation. This paper presents a probabilistic analysis of the
   communication link in VANETs for three vehicle density ranges. First, we
   present the stationary distribution of the communication link length
   using mesoscopic mobility models. Second, we propose a stochastic
   microscopic mobility model that captures time variations of intervehicle
   distances (distance headways). A discrete time finite-state Markov chain
   with state dependent transition probabilities is proposed to model the
   distance headway. Third, the proposed stochastic microscopic model and
   first passage time analysis are used to derive the probability
   distribution of the communication link lifetime. Numerical results are
   presented to evaluate the proposed model, which demonstrate a close
   agreement between analytical and simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The photothermal properties of vertically etched gallium arsenide
   nanowire arrays are examined using Raman spectroscopy. The nanowires are
   arranged in square lattices with a constant pitch of 400 nm and
   diameters ranging from 50 to 155 nm. The arrays were illuminated using a
   532 nm laser with an incident energy density of 10 W/mm(2). Nanowire
   temperatures were highly dependent on the nanowire diameter and were
   determined by measuring the spectral red-shift for both TO and LO
   phonons. The highest temperatures were observed for 95 nm diameter
   nanowires, whose top facets and sidewalls heated up to 600 and 440 K,
   respectively, and decreased significantly for the smaller or larger
   diameters studied. The diameter-dependent heating is explained by
   reasonant coupling of the incident laser light into optical modes off
   the nanowires, resulting in increased absorption. Photothermal activity
   in a given nanowire diameter can be optimized by proper wavelength
   selection, as confirmed using computer simulations. This demonstrates
   that the photothermal properties of GaAs nanowires can be enhanced and
   tuned by using a photonic lattice structure and that smaller nanowire
   diameters are not necessarily better to achieve efficient photothermal
   conversion. The diameter and wavelength dependence of the optical
   coupling could allow for localized temperature gradients by creating
   arrays which consist of different diameters.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note proposes local exponential observers for systems on
   linear Lie groups. We study two classes of systems. In the first class,
   the full state of the system evolves on a linear Lie group and is
   available for measurement. In the second class, only part of the
   system's state evolves on a linear Lie group and this portion of the
   state is available for measurement. In each case, we propose two
   different observer designs. We show that, depending on the observer
   chosen, local exponential stability of one of the two observation error
   dynamics, left- or right-invariant error dynamics, is obtained. For the
   first class of systems these results are developed by showing that the
   estimation error dynamics are differentially equivalent to a stable
   linear differential equation on a vector space. For the second class of
   system, the estimation error dynamics are almost linear. We illustrate
   these observer designs on an attitude estimation problem.}},

Abstract = {{The thin flexible, lightweight nature of organic semiconductor devices
   makes them a prime candidate for medical imaging applications such as
   rugged X-ray imagers for use in hospitals (i.e., immune to minor drops
   or shocks) or even curved X-ray imagers for specialized imaging
   modalities of the future (e.g., compression free breast imaging).
   However, the performance of these organic sensors is not yet comparable
   with current technology (amorphous silicon) in particular owing to high
   dark currents. Here we show that the use of an insulator material, such
   as polystyrene, can dramatically improve the dark current performance of
   the organic photoconductor without compromising the device speed.
   Consequently, we are able to operate the sensor under high bias to
   achieve significant improvements in the critical parameters for image
   sensors such as photo-to-dark current ratio, sensitivity, dynamic range,
   and transient speed. Our work has the potential to expedite the adoption
   of organic semiconductor technology for a variety of digital imaging
   applications especially in the field of low-cost, portable biomedical
   equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilters have gained in popularity for drinking water treatment for
   reasons that include reducing disinfectant demand, disinfection
   by-product formation, and regrowth in distribution systems. Adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) detection is being used more frequently as an easy
   and rapid method to quantify viable biomass in biofilters; however,
   there is little information on the relationship of ATP levels to
   biofiltration parameters and performance. In this study, a comprehensive
   comparison of published ATP data found that concentrations at the top of
   active, acclimated biofilters typically were in the range of 10(2) to
   10(3) ng ATP/cm(3) media. The effect of various biofilter parameters
   (source water characteristics and quality, pretreatment, hydraulic
   loading rate, temperature, and sampling depth) on ATP levels is
   discussed and evaluated using published ATP data. The authors also
   assess the relationship between ATP and biofilter performance in terms
   of carbon removal and identify a need for further research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental study conducted to
   investigate the effectiveness of different types of fabricreinforced
   cementitious matrix (FRCM) composite systems to strengthen shear
   critical reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Seven shear-critical RC beams
   were tested. The test variables included the strengthening material
   (glass FRCM or carbon FRCM) and the strengthening scheme (side bonded or
   u-wrapped). The test results revealed that FRCM strengthening is
   effective in enhancing the load-carrying capacity of shear-critical RC
   beams. The increase in load-carrying capacity of the FRCM-strengthened
   beams ranged between 19 and 105\%. Both strengthening schemes (side
   bonded and u-wrapped) exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that the
   excellent bond of the FRCM to concrete may not require u-wrapped
   applications for anchorage. The experimental results were also compared
   with theoretical predictions according to fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   design guidelines in North America with some modifications. The American

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Although the use of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing
   bars is gaining acceptance as an alternative to conventional steel
   reinforcement in concrete structures, little empirical data exist on the
   long-term fatigue performance of GFRP bars in concrete. Abrasion at the
   bar-concrete interface is known to have an adverse effect on bonds and
   on the overall member response under cyclic loading, although this
   effect was not adequately quantified until now. This paper presents the
   results of an experimental study comparing the fatigue performance of
   GFRP bars in air with the behavior of similar bars embedded in concrete.
   The experimental findings showed that the GFRP bars tested in air
   survived fatigue lives that were approximately a full order of magnitude
   longer than similar bars in concrete beams. The results were used to
   calibrate a statistical fatigue life model and a residual stiffness
   model for GFRP bars in reinforced concrete flexural members. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Peptide-based nanoparticles have emerged as promising drug delivery

   nanoparticles has not been elucidated. Here, the in vitro
   biocompatibility and toxicity and in vivo immunocompatibility and
   bioactivity of the self/coassembling peptide AC8 in its nanoparticle
   form are evaluated. AC8 showed minimal hemolytic activity (5\%) and did
   not cause aggregation of red blood cells. The in vitro assay revealed
   that AC8 did not activate the complement system via the classical or
   alternative pathway but did activate the lectin pathway to a small
   extent. However, AC8 showed no C3a and C5a anaphylotoxin activation
   suggesting that complement activation did not proceed to the later,
   inflammatory, stages. The in vivo immune response assay showed that
   administration of AC8 to BALB/c mice had no effect on the weight of
   immune organs or body weight of mice at doses less than 0.1 mg/kg. This
   peptide also did not have any effect on the expression of CD3+ T-cells

   proliferation of B-cells. These results suggest that AC8 can be a

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aimed to validate the mathematical Zernike pupil size
   scaling from bigger pupils to smaller pupils, and vice versa, by
   comparing the estimates of the Zernike coefficients with corresponding
   clinical measurements obtained at different pupil sizes.
   Methods The i.Profiler Plus (Carl Zeiss Vision, Inc, USA) was used to
   obtain measures of wavefront aberrations for two pupil sizes (3 mm and
   the maximum natural pupil size) from the right eyes of 28 visually
   normal subjects (mean {[}SD] age, 57 {[}7] years) whose maximum pupil
   size was greater than or equal to 5 mm without pharmacological dilation.
   Zernike coefficients were estimated for a 3-mm pupil size scaling down
   from the measured data of the maximum natural pupil size and, similarly,
   for the maximum pupil size scaling up from the measured data of the 3-mm
   pupil.
   Results The differences between the estimated and measured values were
   not significantly different (repeated-measures analysis of variance; p >
   0.05) over the range of pupil sizes examined, irrespective of whether
   the estimates were made by scaling up from a small pupil or scaling down
   from a large pupil. However, the difference between the measured and
   estimated coefficients was more variable and less systematic when
   scaling to a larger pupil size when compared with scaling to a smaller
   pupil size.
   Conclusions Estimation of ocular wavefront aberration coefficients
   either scaling down from large to smaller pupils or scaling up from
   smaller to large pupils provides estimates that are not significantly
   different from clinically measured values. However, when scaling up to a
   larger pupil size, the estimates are more variable. These findings have
   implications for pupil scaling on an individual basis, such as in cases
   of refractive surgery or when using pupil scaling to examine a clinical
   cohort.}},

Abstract = {{Kapton membranes have received much attention in the fabrication of
   space inflatable antenna technology in the recent years. While prized
   for their light designs, their delicate nature makes them susceptible to
   various kinds of disturbances in space environments that result in
   structural vibrations or wrinkle formation. In this regard, macro-fiber
   composite actuators have been commonly used for vibration control of
   these membrane structures. However, wrinkle control remains one of the
   major challenges in their designs. Some of the research in the previous
   literature has attempted to quantify the wrinkle behavior of these
   membranes when subject to boundary forces. Yet, in all the previous
   study, the effects of macro-fiber composite patches, a major compartment
   of these structures, on their wrinkle formation have been ignored. The
   presented article studies the effects of these patches on localization
   of wrinkles and their patterns in Kapton membranes. The numerical
   results are validated experimentally using photogrammetry techniques.
   Two membrane configurations are studied: one considers rectangular
   membranes with clamped-sliding boundary conditions and the other
   pertains to square membranes with symmetric corner loadings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a two-user Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC)
   under peak power constraints at the transmitters. It is shown that
   generating the code-books of both users according to discrete
   distributions with a finite number of mass points achieves the largest
   weighted sum-rate in the network. This verifies that any point on the
   boundary of the capacity region of a two-user MAC under peak power
   constraints at both transmitters is achieved by discrete distributions
   with a finite number of mass points. Although the capacity-achieving
   distributions are not necessarily unique, it is verified that only
   discrete distributions with a finite number of mass points can achieve a
   point on the boundary of the capacity region. It is shown that there
   exist an infinite number of sum-rate-optimal points on the boundary of
   the capacity region. In contrast to the Gaussian MAC with average power
   constraints, we verify that time division (TD) cannot achieve any of the
   sum-rate-optimal points in the Gaussian MAC with peak power constraints.
   Using the so-called I-MMSE identity of Guo et al., the largest
   achievable sum-rate by orthogonal code division (OCD) is characterized
   where it is shown that Walsh-Hadamard spreading codes of length 2 are
   optimal. In the symmetric case where the peak power constraints at both
   transmitters are identical, we verify that OCD can achieve a sum-rate
   that is strictly larger than the highest sum-rate achieved by TD.
   Finally, it is demonstrated that there are values for the maximum peak
   power at the transmitters such that OCD can not achieve any of the
   sum-rate-optimal points on the boundary of the capacity region.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach based on the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR)
   methodology is proposed to address the problem of multistakeholder
   system portfolio decision analysis encountered in architecting a system
   of systems (SoS) with desired capabilities. More specifically, a
   flexible four-process framework for capability-based SoS architecting
   containing interactive portfolio decision analysis to promote
   multistakeholder design negotiations on system portfolio selections is
   presented. By taking full advantage of the inherent realistic and
   flexible design of the GMCR paradigm, an interactive portfolio decision
   analysis approach is designed to facilitate the systematic modeling and
   analysis of system portfolio decisions at the SoS level in order to
   achieve potential compromises among all key stakeholders having
   disparate preferences and interacting according to different conflict
   behavior patterns. This approach permits the prediction of possible
   mutually agreeable system portfolios for SoS architecture development.
   Last, the feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using an
   illustrative example.}},

Title = {{Multi-shell diffusion signal recovery from sparse measurements}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1143-1156}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{For accurate estimation of the ensemble average diffusion propagator
   (EAP), traditional multi-shell diffusion imaging (MSDI) approaches
   require acquisition of diffusion signals for a range of b-values.
   However, this makes the acquisition time too long for several types of
   patients, making it difficult to use in a clinical setting. In this
   work, we propose a new method for the reconstruction of diffusion
   signals in the entire q-space from highly undersampled sets of MSDI
   data, thus reducing the scan time significantly. In particular, to
   sparsely represent the diffusion signal over multiple q-shells, we
   propose a novel extension to the framework of spherical ridgelets by
   accurately modeling the monotonically decreasing radial component of the
   diffusion signal. Further, we enforce the reconstructed signal to have
   smooth spatial regularity in the brain, by minimizing the total
   variation (TV) norm. We combine these requirements into a novel cost
   function and derive an optimal solution using the Alternating Directions
   Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We use a physical phantom data
   set with known fiber crossing angle of 45 degrees to determine the
   optimal number of measurements (gradient directions and b-values) needed
   for accurate signal recovery. We compare our technique with a
   state-of-the-art sparse reconstruction method (i.e., the SHORE method of
   Cheng et al. (2010)) in terms of angular error in estimating the
   crossing angle, incorrect number of peaks detected, normalized mean
   squared error in signal recovery as well as error in estimating the
   return-to-origin probability (RTOP). Finally, we also demonstrate the
   behavior of the proposed technique on human in vivo data sets. Based on
   these experiments, we conclude that using the proposed algorithm, at
   least 60 measurements (spread over three b-value shells) are needed for
   proper recovery of MSDI data in the entire q-space. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study presents the work on process-mixture design of an experiment
   for wheat straw polypropylene. Fibre length and aspect ratio are two
   process variables that have significant impact on the mechanical
   properties of the composite material. Wheat straw was powdered to
   produce fibres, and those were fractionated into different fibre
   fractions to create grades with distinct fibre length and aspect ratio.
   These grades of fibres were used to evaluate the performance of those
   fractions as grades of straw fibre with respect to the performance in
   the final thermoplastic composites. The composite samples were made from
   each fibre grade at two different fibre loadings: 30 wt.\% and 50 wt.
   \%. One of the important findings of this work is the pattern of fibre
   size reduction during the compounding processes. These patterns can be
   used to correlate and optimize the utilization of different fibre sizes
   of straw fibre for different applications in thermoplastic composites.
   For example, fibres with initial width of about 360 mu m are the best
   fibres when a balance between modulus and impact properties is needed.}},

Abstract = {{A graph-theoretic formulation to perform sensitivity analysis on

   systems are presented along with a brief description of the software
   platform that has been used to implement the algorithm. A 3D pendulum
   and a double-wishbone suspension system are analyzed to demonstrate the
   application of the algorithm. The results are validated by using a

Title = {{Integrated traffic conflict model for estimating crash modification
   factors}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Crash modification factors (CMFs) for road safety treatments are usually
   obtained through observational models based on reported crashes.
   Observational Bayesian before-and-after methods have been applied to
   obtain more precise estimates of CMFs by accounting for the
   regression-to-the-mean bias inherent in naive methods. However,
   sufficient crash data reported over an extended period of time are
   needed to provide reliable estimates of treatment effects, a requirement
   that can be a challenge for certain types of treatment. In addition,
   these studies require that sites analyzed actually receive the treatment
   to which the CMF pertains. Another key issue with observational
   approaches is that they are not causal in nature, and as such, cannot
   provide a sound ``behavioral{''} rationale for the treatment effect.
   Surrogate safety measures based on high risk vehicle interactions and
   traffic conflicts have been proposed to address this issue by providing
   a more ``causal perspective{''} on lack of safety for different road and
   traffic conditions. The traffic conflict approach has been criticized,
   however, for lacking a formal link to observed and verified crashes, a
   difficulty that this paper attempts to resolve by presenting and
   investigating an alternative approach for estimating CMFs using
   simulated conflicts that are linked formally to observed crashes. The
   integrated CMF estimates are compared to estimates from an empirical
   Bayes (EB) crash-based before-and-after analysis for the same sample of
   treatment sites. The treatment considered involves changing left turn
   signal priority at Toronto signalized intersections from permissive to
   protected-permissive. The results are promising in that the proposed
   integrated method yields CMFs that closely match those obtained from the
   crash-based EB before-and-after analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{264-273}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of oxygen-containing functional groups on reduced graphite
   oxide (rGO) surface and zinc oxide (ZnO) has been investigated; and
   critical functionalities of rGO for enhancing H2S adsorption were
   studied. The abundant oxygen functional groups attached on the surface
   of rGO promoted the dispersion of nano-sized ZnO; then a higher surface
   area on the adsorbents was achieved. In addition, they prevented the
   aggregation of ZnO particles during regeneration at 600 degrees C.
   Beside those physical property changes, the presence of rGO modified the
   chemical properties of ZnO, as confirmed by XPS analysis. Due to those
   oxygen functional groups, the amount of zinc ions (Zn2+) are placed at
   the oxygen vacant sites, not only in the Zn-O lattice on ZnO/rGO
   composite. It was determined that the amount of oxygen ions in the Zn-O
   lattice decreased; and loosely bonded oxygen ions near the Zn-O lattice
   and on the surface were generated. Therefore, it was found that the
   presence of rGO plays a critical role to provide appropriate conditions
   for H2S adsorption, which was confirmed through the H2S adsorption
   breakthrough and regeneration tests. The ZnO/rGO composite showed about
   fivefold that of pure ZnO. The capacity after 1st regeneration for
   ZnO/rGO decreased by about 57\% but then was maintained constant over 8
   recycles while that on ZnO decreased dramatically to reach nearly zero
   capacity after 5 cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of operating conditions on the glycosylation pattern of
   humanized camelid monoclonal antibody, EG2-hFc produced by Chinese
   hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been evaluated by a combination of
   experiments and modeling. Cells were cultivated under different levels
   of glucose and glutamine concentrations with the goal of investigating
   the effect of nutrient depletion levels and ammonia build up on the cell
   growth and the glycoprofiles of the monoclonal antibody (Mab). The
   effect of average pH reduction on glycosylation level during the entire
   culture time or during a specific time span was also investigated. The
   relative abundance of glycan structures was quantified by hydrophilic
   interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and the galactosylation index
   (GI) and the sialylation index (SI) were determined. Lower initial
   concentrations of glutamine resulted in lower glucose consumption and
   lower cell yield but increased GI and SI levels when compared to
   cultures started with higher initial glutamine levels. Similarly,
   reducing the average pH of culture resulted in lower growth but higher
   SI and GI levels. These findings indicate that there is a tradeoff
   between cell growth, resulting Mab productivity and the achievement of
   desirable higher glycosylation levels. A dynamic model, based on a
   metabolic flux analysis (MFA), is proposed to describe the metabolism of
   nutrients, cell growth and Mab productivity. Finally, existing software
   (GLYCOVIS) that describes the glycosylation pathways was used to
   illustrate the impact of extracellular species on the glycoprofiles. (C)

Abstract = {{A major challenge in palaeohydrology is the extraction of continuous
   palaeoflood information from geophysical records. A high-resolution
   sediment core off the Minjiang estuary area in the Taiwan Strait, SE
   China, records the sedimentation history from approximately 1660 to the
   present. The alkane ratio C-31/C-17, a classic organic geochemical
   indicator of terrestrial/aquatic matter, peaks in the layers dating as
   1876-1878 and 1968-1970, suggesting the large terrestrial input to the
   Minjiang estuary area by huge flood transporting during the each peak
   interval. Historical archives are consistent with this interpretations
   and record catastrophic floods in the Minjiang River during both
   intervals. Furthermore between 1876-1878 there were floods in southern
   China and droughts in northern China, as well as throughout Asia,
   Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The 1876-1878 catastrophic flood of
   the Minjiang River may therefore has been the local response to global
   climate anomalies during that time interval.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between a peptide-based drug delivery system and two
   serum proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG),
   is investigated using fluorescence quenching and calorimetric
   techniques. An ionic-complementary self/co-assembling peptide, EAR8-II,
   is employed to encapsulate the hydrophobic anticancer drug pirarubicin
   (THP) and stabilize it in protein environments. Self/co-assembling
   properties of the peptide-drug complex (EAR8-II-THP) are shown to be
   different while interacting with serum proteins compared with the
   properties of the isolated complex. The results from thermodynamic
   studies suggest that the drug delivery system has a strong binding
   affinity (K-SV 1689 M-1), exothermic and enthalpy-driven interaction,
   with BSA and a relatively weak affinity with IgG (K-SV 295.2 M-1). In
   the presence of salt ions, the enthalpy and binding affinity remain
   unchanged, implying other interactions such as hydrogen bonding and Van
   der Waals interactions are present that are not affected by reduced
   polarity. This work forms the basis for further studies of EAR8-II-THP
   complexes in the presence of important proteins and for further
   evaluation of the complexes' immune response and anticancer activity.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented of fabricating gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanowire
   arrays of controlled diameter and period by reactive ion etching of a
   GaAs substrate containing an indium gallium arsenide (InGaP) etch stop
   layer, allowing the precise nanowire length to be controlled. The
   substrate is subsequently removed by selective etching, using the same
   InGaP etch stop layer, to create a substrate-free GaAs nanowire array.
   The optical absorptance of the nanowire array was then directly measured
   without absorption from a substrate. We directly observe absorptance
   spectra that can be tuned by the nanowire diameter, as explained with
   rigorous coupled wave analysis. These results illustrate strong optical
   absorption suitable for nanowire-based solar cells and multi-spectral
   absorption for wavelength discriminating photodetectors. The
   solar-weighted absorptance above the bandgap of GaAs was 94\% for a
   nanowire surface coverage of only 15\%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In 2003, the Lost Creek wildfire severely burned 21,000 hectares of
   forest on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Seven
   headwater catchments with varying levels of disturbance (burned,
   post-fire salvage logged, and unburned) were instrumented as part of the
   Southern Rockies Watershed Project to measure streamflow, stream
   temperature, and meteorological conditions. From 2004 to 2010 mean
   annual stream temperature (T-s) was elevated 0.8-2.1 degrees C in the
   burned and post-fire salvage logged streams compared to the unburned
   streams. Mean daily maximum T-s was 1.0-3.0 degrees C warmer and mean
   daily minimum T-s was 0.9-2.8 degrees C warmer in the burned and
   post-fire salvage logged streams compared to the unburned catchments.
   The effects of wildfire on the thermal regime of the burned catchments
   were persistent and trend analysis showed no apparent recovery during
   the study period. Temporal patterns of T-s were strongly associated with
   seasonal variability of surface and groundwater interactions and air
   temperature. Advective heat fluxes between groundwater and surface water
   were likely the dominant controls on T-s, though the strength of these
   advective controls varied among catchments highlighting the importance
   of simultaneous catchment-scale and process-focused research to better
   elucidate the physical drivers influencing T-s response to disturbance.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{634-644}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets to shear strengthen
   reinforced concrete (RC) beams has been studied and proven repeatedly.
   However, numerous strengthening configurations and materials can be
   combined to maximize the increase in strength and repair. This study
   investigates the effectiveness of using commercially manufactured carbon
   FRP (CFRP), glass FRP (GFRP) and fiber reinforced cementitious matrix
   (FRCM) sheets to increase the shear capacity of RC shear critical beams.
   Nine RC shear deficient slender beams were tested. The test variables
   included the use of three different FRPs (CFRP, GFRP, and FRCM), and the
   presence and type of FRP anchors (CFRP or GFRP). The experimental
   results revealed that applying FRP sheets increased the overall shear
   capacity, full depth u-wrapped FRP sheets perform better over companion
   partial depth u-wrapped FRP sheets, the use of FRP anchors further
   improved the shear capacity and ductility of failure, FRP strengthening
   could change the mode of failure from a shear to flexural failure and
   FRP debonding was delayed with the presence of FRP anchors. A comparison
   of the experimental load capacities with predicted values indicates that
   they correlate well with predictions using the current Canadian design
   codes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   epoxy bilayer as a robust superhydrophobic surface coating}},
Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{230-237}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A robust superhydrophobic bilayer coating is developed containing
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-functionalized silica particles on top and
   an epoxy bonding layer at the base. It is fabricated with a facile
   dip-coating process that embeds micron-scale PDMS-functionalized silica
   particles with nano-scale roughness into an epoxy layer spin-coated onto
   a substrate. The dip-coating process uses multiple cycles to generate a
   repeatable and consistent coating onto a glass substrate. The resulting
   bilayer coating is able to be applied to multiple surfaces where the
   conventional epoxy coating is used. The concentration of silica
   particles was systematically varied, showing minimal influence on
   hydrophobicity and mechanical properties. The robustness of the coating
   is characterized by observing the wear properties and integrity of the
   rough surface as it is scratched with a stainless steel probe, while
   adhesive tape was applied repeatedly to the surface to observe any
   modification to the hydrophobicity. Additionally, a different substrate
   material, a transparent flexible polymer, has been successfully coated.
   This work demonstrates a facile dip-coating process using commercially
   available silica micro/nanoparticles to generate a robust
   superhydrophobic coating with the potential for a larger scale
   application to improve on the performance of conventional epoxy
   coatings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of membrane fouling on the removal of enteric virus
   surrogates MS2 and phi X174 bacteriophage by an ultrafiltration membrane
   was assessed under simulated full-scale drinking water treatment
   operating conditions. Filtration experiments of up to 8 days using
   either river or lake water ascertained how the membrane fouling layer
   affected virus removal. Organic carbon fractionation techniques
   identified potential foulants, including biopolymers, in the feed water
   and in the permeate. Hydraulically irreversible fouling could greatly
   improve the removal of both viruses at moderate and severe fouling
   conditions by up to 2.5 logs. Hydraulically reversible fouling increased
   virus removal only slightly, and increased removal of >0.5 log for both
   phage were only obtained under severe fouling conditions. The increase
   in virus removal due to irreversible and reversible fouling differed
   between the two water sources. As the degree of fouling increased,
   differences between the removal of the two phage decreased. Maintenance
   cleaning partially removed membrane foulants, however virus removal
   following maintenance cleaning was lower than that of the fouled
   membrane, it remained higher than that of the clean membrane. (C) 2014

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{273}},
Pages = {{374-392}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainty analysis has not been well studied at the molecular scale,
   despite extensive knowledge of uncertainty in macroscale systems. The
   ability to predict the effect of uncertainty allows for robust control
   of small scale systems such as nanoreactors, surface reactions, and gene
   toggle switches. However, it is difficult to model uncertainty in such
   chemical systems as they are stochastic in nature, and require a large
   computational cost. To address this issue, a new model of uncertainty
   propagation in stochastic chemical systems, based on the Chemical Master
   Equation, is proposed in the present study. The uncertain solution is
   approximated by a composite state comprised of the averaged effect of
   samples from the uncertain parameter distributions. This model is then
   used to study the effect of uncertainty on an isomerization system and a
   two gene regulation network called a repressilator. The results of this
   model show that uncertainty in stochastic systems is dependent on both
   the uncertain distribution, and the system under investigation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A new architecture for a membraneless and single-chambered microbial
   fuel cell (MFC) which has a unique bipolar plate-electrode assembly
   (BEA) design was demonstrated. The maximum power of MFC units connected
   in series (denoted as a stacked MFC) was up to 22.8 +/- 0.13 mW/m(2) for
   0.946 +/- 0.003 V working voltage, which is 2.5 times higher than the
   averaged maximum power density of the non-stacked MFC units. The power
   density in the stacked MFC using BEA was comparable to the stacked MFC
   using electric wire. These results demonstrate that BEAs having
   air-exposed cathodes can potentially be used in the stacking of
   membraneless single-chambered MFCs. In addition, we confirmed that the
   current in the stacked mode flowed faster than the non-stacked mode due
   to voltage increase by series connection, and the poorest of the stacked
   units quickly faced current depletion at higher external resistance than
   the non-stacked mode, leading to voltage reversal. These results imply
   that stacked MFC units require a relatively large current capacity in
   order to prevent high voltage reversal at high current region. To
   increase total current capacity and prevent voltage reversal of stacked
   MFC units, we suggested series/parallel-integrated MFC module system for
   scaling-up. This new concept could likely allow the application of MFC
   technology to be extended to various wastewater treatment processes or
   plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-supported platinum nanowires (PtNW/C) are successfully
   synthesized by a simple and inexpensive template-free methodology and
   demonstrated as novel, suitable cathode electrode materials for proton
   exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications. The synthesis
   conditions, such as the amount of reducing agent and reaction time, were
   investigated to investigate the effect on the nanostructures and
   activities of the PtNW/C catalysts. High-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) results show that the formic acid facilitated
   reduction is capable of producing uniformly distributed 1-dimensional
   PtNW with an average cross-sectional diameter of 4.0 +/- 0.2 nm and
   length of 20-40 nm. Investigation of the electrocatalytic activity by
   half-cell electrochemical testing reveals that PtNVVIC catalyst
   demonstrates significant oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity,
   superior to that of commercially available Pt/C. Using a loading of 0.4
   mgpt cm(-2) PtNVV/C as the cathode catalyst, a maximum power density of
   748.8 mW cm(-2) in a 50 cm(2) single cell of commercial Pt/C. In
   addition, accelerated degradation testing (ADT) showed that the PtNW/C
   catalyst exhibits better durability than commercial Pt/C, rendering
   PtNW/C as a promising replacement to conventional Pt/C as cathode
   electrocatalysts for PEMFCs applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Abstract = {{Steady flow of a disconnected gas phase (bubbles) is realized in porous
   media during carbonated water injection (CWI) under conditions that
   promote continuous exsolution of the dissolved gas. Using microfluidic
   pore networks etched on glass as well as a miniature core-flooding setup
   integrated with micro computed tomography (CT) imaging apparatus, we
   demonstrate capillary interactions of the flowing gas bubbles with a
   previously trapped oil phase (three-phase ganglion dynamics), which lead
   to mobilization of oil ganglia and remarkably high oil recovery. When
   three-phase ganglion dynamics are induced by carbonated water injection
   in low-permeability Berea sandstone core samples containing waterflood
   residual oil, more than 34\% and 40\% of the original oil in place
   additional recoveries are achieved in macro-and micro-scale flow tests,
   respectively, while a significant amount of CO2 is permanently
   sequestered in the pore space as capillary-trapped and dissolved gas. It
   is observed that when oil globules come into contact with CO2, they form
   thick spreading layers between brine and gas and are carried by moving
   gas clusters. The oil layers stay stable until the gas clusters leave
   the medium. Individual oil and gas blobs captured during micro-CT
   imaging are statistically analyzed to further examine underlying
   pore-level displacement physics of the process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The catalytic performance of nickel catalysts supported on La2O3,
   alpha-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, ZrO2, and YSZ for supercritical water
   reforming of glycerol was investigated. Experiments were conducted in a
   tubular reactor made of Inconel-625 with the temperature range of 723
   -848 K under a pressure of 25 MPa. Carbon formation causing operation
   failure was observed for alpha-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3 and ZrO2 at
   temperatures higher than 748, 798 and 823 K, respectively. Ni/La2O3
   exhibited the highest H-2 yield where almost complete conversion was
   obtained at 798 K. Moderate space velocities (WHSV = 6.45 h(-1)) and
   glycerol feed concentration (5wt.\%) favor high hydrogen selectivity and
   yield. Methanation is favored at a low WHSV or high glycerol feed
   concentration, resulting in a lower H-2 yield. Increasing Ni loading on
   the Ni/La2O3 catalyst strongly promoted the reforming, water-gas shift,
   and methanation reactions, which contributed significantly to the

Abstract = {{Using first principles density functional theory calculations, we
   systematically studied oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) on N-doped
   graphene (N-Gr) with and without a Cu metallic support (N-Gr/Cu(111)

   show that oxygen molecules are dissociated into two oxygen atoms on the
   N-Gr/Cu(111) surface, which alters the well-known associative ORR
   mechanisms on pure graphene and N-Gr. Our results, however, indicate
   that the mechanistic shift does not directly lead to enhancement of ORR
   activity once water molecules solvate the N-Gr/Cu(111) surface via
   substantially stabilized intermediates such as O, OH, and OOH. Our
   results suggest that transition metal supports can be a promising way to
   control the ORR mechanism on doped graphene and that the evaluation of
   ORR activity requires understandings of not only the electronic
   structures of doped graphene but also the chemical interactions between
   the intermediates and solvating water molecules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   adhesion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{98}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Geckos, which are capable of walking on walls and hanging from ceilings
   with the help of micro-/nano-scale hierarchical fibrils (setae) on their
   toe pads, have become the main prototype in the design and fabrication
   of fibrillar dry adhesives. As the unique fibrillar feature of the toe
   pads of geckos allows them to develop an intimate contact with the
   substrate the animal is walking on or clinging to, it is expected that
   the toe setae exchange significant numbers of electric charges with the
   contacted substrate via the contact electrification (CE) phenomenon.
   Even so, the possibility of the occurrence of CE and the contribution of
   the resulting electrostatic interactions to the dry adhesion of geckos
   have been overlooked for several decades. In this study, by measuring
   the magnitude of the electric charges, together with the adhesion
   forces, that gecko foot pads develop in contact with different
   materials, we have clarified for the first time that CE does contribute
   effectively to gecko adhesion. More importantly, we have demonstrated
   that it is the CE-driven electrostatic interactions which dictate the
   strength of gecko adhesion, and not the van der Waals or capillary
   forces which are conventionally considered as the main source of gecko
   adhesion.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty analysis and robust optimization of multiscale process
   systems with application to epitaxial thin film growth}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{590-600}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Multiscale modeling of materials growth involves inherently coupled
   processes that span over a wide range of time and length scales. As a
   common practice, a multiscale model is adopted to simulate the thin film
   deposition process that augments Partial Differential Equations (PDEs),
   describing the macroscale phenomena, with a high-order lattice-based
   kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulator, which aims to capture thin film
   microstructure. Although such a model is a fair representation of the
   system, the evolution of thin film encompasses processes that are
   subject to model parameter uncertainty that can significantly affect the
   control and optimization objectives of this process, e.g. film's
   roughness and thickness. Thus, to provide a robust and more realistic
   strategy, it is crucial to perform an uncertainty analysis for this
   process. This work explores a systematic framework to analyze model
   parameter uncertainty for robust control and optimization of multiscale
   models. Such an analysis is extremely challenging due to (i) the lack of
   a closed formulation between the process optimization objective (i.e.
   film thickness) and the model parameters and (ii) the computational
   costs incurred to model the finescale events, typically performed using
   KMC simulation. To tackle these challenges, Power Series Expansion (PSE)
   is employed to analyze model uncertainty propagation. The PSE-based
   method for uncertainty analysis is more computationally efficient in
   comparison to the traditional Monte Carlo approach. The distributional
   uncertainty in rates of microscopic events is characterized by series
   expansions of the uncertain parameters. The fitted distributions to the
   rate of events at a given confidence level are employed to estimate
   upper and lower bounds on the desired outputs (e.g. film roughness). The
   computational efficiency of the approach is achieved by employing
   multiple reduced-order lattices in the KMC simulator. The potential
   application of the proposed method is illustrated through an
   optimization problem that aims to specify the robust optimal substrate
   temperature profile that maximizes the endpoint thin film thickness in
   the presence of uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the Presumed Mapping Function (PMF) approach in the
   context of the Stationary Laminar Flamelet Modelling (SLFM) of a
   reacting Double Scalar Mixing Layer (DSML). Starting from a prescribed
   Gaussian reference field, the PMF approach provides a presumed
   Probability Density Function (PDF) for the mixture fraction that is
   subsequently employed to close the Conditional Scalar Dissipation Rate
   (CSDR) upon doubly-integrating the homogeneous PDF transport equation.
   The PMF approach is unique in its ability to yield PDF and CSDR
   distributions that capture the effect of multiple fuel injections of
   different composition. This distinct feature overcomes the shortcomings
   of the classical SLFM closures (the -distribution for the PDF and the
   counterflow solution for the CSDR). The current study analyses the
   impact of the binary (two-stream) and trinary (three-stream) PMF
   approaches on the structure of laminar flamelets in a DSML formed by the
   mixing of a fuel stream and an oxidiser stream separated by a pilot. The
   conditions of a partially-premixed methane/air piloted jet flame are
   considered. A parametric assessment is performed by varying the local
   mixing statistics and the findings are compared to those of the
   classical SLFM approach. Further, the influence of the PMF approach on
   flamelet extinction and transport by means of differential diffusion is
   thoroughly investigated. It is shown that the trinary PMF approach
   captures the influence of the pilot stream as it is capable of yielding
   bimodal CSDR and trimodal PDF distributions. It is further demonstrated
   that, when the influence of the pilot is significant, flamelets
   generated using the trinary CSDR closure extinguish at higher strain
   levels compared to flamelets generated using the binary and counterflow
   closures. Lastly, it is shown that the trinary PMF approach can be

Abstract = {{We propose a novel algorithm to detect visual saliency from video
   signals by combining both spatial and temporal information and
   statistical uncertainty measures. The main novelty of the proposed
   method is twofold. First, separate spatial and temporal saliency maps
   are generated, where the computation of temporal saliency incorporates a
   recent psychological study of human visual speed perception. Second, the
   spatial and temporal saliency maps are merged into one using a
   spatiotemporally adaptive entropy-based uncertainty weighting approach.
   The spatial uncertainty weighing incorporates the characteristics of
   proximity and continuity of spatial saliency, while the temporal
   uncertainty weighting takes into account the variations of background
   motion and local contrast. Experimental results show that the proposed
   spatiotemporal uncertainty weighting algorithm significantly outperforms
   state-of-the-art video saliency detection models.}},

Abstract = {{Sterility of cell culture media is an important concern in
   biotherapeutic processing. In large scale biotherapeutic production, a
   unit contamination of cell culture media can have costly effects.
   Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is a sterilization method effective against
   bacteria and viruses while being non-thermal and non-adulterating in its
   mechanism of action. This makes UV irradiation attractive for use in
   sterilization of cell culture media. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of UV irradiation of cell culture media in terms of
   chemical composition and the ability to grow cell cultures in the
   treated media. The results showed that UV irradiation of commercial cell
   culture media at relevant disinfection doses impacted the chemical
   composition of the media with respect to several carboxylic acids, and
   to a minimal extent, amino acids. The cumulative effect of these
   changes, however, did not negatively influence the ability to culture
   Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, as evaluated by cell viability, growth
   rate, and protein titer measurements in simple batch growth compared
   with the same cells cultured in control media exposed to visible light.

Abstract = {{In this study, a new method, entitled as the multi-modality guided
   variational (MGV) method, is proposed, in which the data from a passive
   microwave sensor is used jointly with the data from the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate the sea ice
   surface temperature (IST). The method augments existing sea IST values
   from the MODIS IST map, while filling in areas in the MODIS image that
   may be sparsely sampled due to the cloud cover, or due to increased
   spacing between the pixels at the swath edges. The former issue is
   particularly problematic in the marginal ice zone, where the atmospheric
   conditions often lead to persistent cloud cover. The sea IST is of
   interest because it can be used to estimate the sea ice thickness, an
   important parameter for shipping, climate change, and weather
   forecasting applications. The impact of the MGV method is checked
   through a comparison between the sea ice thickness calculated using the
   swath surface temperature and that calculated using the surface
   temperature from MGV. Using the operational ice charts as a guideline,
   it is found that the sea ice thickness values calculated using the MGV
   surface temperature are realistic, and there is a 16\% increase in the
   number of sea ice thickness data points available when the MGV method is
   used as compared to when the swath data are used.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{7082-7099}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A novel selection metric called Convex Hull Contribution (CHC) is
   introduced for solving multiobjective (MO) optimization problems with
   Pareto fronts that can be accurately approximated by a convex curve. The
   hydrologic model calibration literature shows that many biobjective
   calibration problems with a proper setup result in such Pareto fronts.
   The CHC selection approach identifies a subset of archived nondominated
   solutions whose map in the objective space forms convex approximation of
   the Pareto front. The optimization algorithm can sample solely from
   these solutions to more accurately approximate the convex shape of the
   Pareto front. It is empirically demonstrated that CHC improves the
   performance of Pareto Archived Dynamically Dimensioned Search (PA-DDS)
   when solving MO problems with convex Pareto fronts. This conclusion is
   based on the results of several benchmark mathematical problems and
   several hydrologic model calibration problems with two or three
   objective functions. The impact of CHC on PA-DDS performance is most
   evident when the computational budget is somewhat limited. It is also
   demonstrated that 1,000 solution evaluations (limited budget in this
   study) is sufficient for PA-DDS with CHC-based selection to achieve very
   high quality calibration results relative to the results achieved after
   10,000 solution evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of branched and crosslinked polystyrene (PS) samples,

   Results are compared with crosslinked PS samples synthesized through
   regular free radical polymerization (FRP). Characterization results of
   PS samples (before the gelation point) using size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC) and of crosslinked PS samples with
   thermo-mechanical analysis are discussed. Both techniques are used in an
   attempt to quantify the homogeneity of the polymer network.
   Characterization via thermo-mechanical analysis shows that no
   significant differences are detected between networks synthesized
   through NMRP and FRP. In fact, replicated results indicate that networks
   synthesized via NMRP might in fact be as heterogeneous as networks
   synthesized through FRP; this is not as expected!}},

   each model drug and a drug selective electrode system was used to
   measure the drug concentration in the filtrate and release medium.
   Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) was used to elucidate the types
   of interactions between model drugs and CNC and its derivatives. The
   complexation between model drugs and CNC derivatives was confirmed by

Abstract = {{Stochastic decoding provides ultra-low-complexity hardware for
   high-throughput parallel low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders.
   Asynchronous stochastic decoding was proposed to demonstrate the
   possibility of low power dissipation and high throughput in stochastic
   decoders, but decoding might stop before convergence due to
   ``lock-up{''}, causing error floors that also occur in synchronous
   stochastic decoding. In this paper, we introduce a wire-delay dependent
   (WDD) scheduling algorithm for asynchronous stochastic decoding in order
   to reduce the error floors. Instead of assigning the same delay to all
   computation nodes in the previous work, different computation delay is
   assigned to each computation node depending on its wire length. The
   variation of update timing increases switching activities to decrease
   the possibility of the ``lock-up{''}, lowering the error floors. In
   addition, the WDD scheduling algorithm is simplified for the hardware
   implementation in order to eliminate time-averaging and multiplication
   functions used in the original WDD scheduling algorithm. BER performance
   using a regular (1024, 512) (3.6) LDPC code is simulated based on our
   timing model that has computation and wire delay estimated under ASPLA
   90nm CMOS technology. It is demonstrated that the proposed asynchronous
   decoder achieves a 6.4-9.8x smaller latency than that of the synchronous
   decoder with a 0.25-0.3 dB coding gain.}},

Abstract = {{Replacing high cost platinum (Pt) catalysts with alternative
   non-precious materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly
   desirable to reduce the cost of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell
   (PEMFC) systems. Transition metal-nitrogen-carbon complexes (M-N-C)
   prepared by high temperature heat treatment techniques are the most
   promising class of non-precious materials with respect to ORR activity
   and stability. In this work, one-dimensional nanofibers are prepared by
   electrospinning an iron-polyaniline/polyacrylonitrile (Fe-PANI-PAN)
   metal-polymer blend, followed by subsequent heat treatment. This
   represents the first time a blend of polymers (PANI-PAN) has been used
   to prepare M-N-C nanofiber catalysts via electrospinning. The addition
   of 10 wt. \% PANI to the electrospinning mixture provides 100 and 70 mV
   improvements to the ORR onset potential and half-wave potential,
   respectively, rendering the most active non-precious ORR nanofiber
   catalysts prepared by electrospinning to date. The high activity is
   attributed to the porous structure of the nanofibers, combined with
   increased nitrogen contents provided by the PANI incorporation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Energy saving is an important issue in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs).
   Recent studies show that network coding can help reduce the energy
   consumption in MANETs by using less transmissions. However, apart from
   transmission cost, there are other sources of energy consumption, e. g.,
   data encryption/decryption. In this paper, we study how to leverage
   network coding to reduce the energy consumed by data encryption in
   MANETs. It is interesting that network coding has a nice property of
   intrinsic security, based on which encryption can be done quite
   efficiently. To this end, we propose P-Coding, a lightweight encryption
   scheme to provide confidentiality for network-coded MANETs in an
   energy-efficient way. The basic idea of P-Coding is to let the source
   randomly permute the symbols of each packet (which is prefixed with its
   coding vector), before performing network coding operations. Without
   knowing the permutation, eavesdroppers cannot locate coding vectors for
   correct decoding, and thus cannot obtain any meaningful information. We
   demonstrate that due to its lightweight nature, P-Coding incurs minimal
   energy consumption compared to other encryption schemes.}},

   cost, only the relay node requires full-duplex wireless equipment in our
   design. We derive the achievable transmission rate for the proposed FDCC
   scheme under both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
   modes. Further, as the transmission scheduling of users plays a critical
   role in determining the achievable transmission rate in FDCC, we
   formulate the max-min rate scheduling problem as a nonconvex mixed
   integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. By applying linearization
   and convex approximation techniques, we propose an optimal algorithm
   based on a branch-and-bound framework to solve the problem efficiently.
   Extensive simulation results show that FDCC can significantly improve
   the transmission rate as compared with direct transmission and
   half-duplex cooperative communication (HDCC).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel fault current management (FCM) technique for
   radial distribution systems with embedded inverter-based distributed
   generators (IB-DGs). At the point of connection to a power system, many
   distributed generators (DGs) require power electronic (PE) interfaces,
   which are normally idle during faults. The proposed FCM method employs
   these PE interfaces for control of the fault current. For this purpose,
   operation of IB-DGs is modified to FCM mode at the moment of fault and
   new current references are applied. Of the two controllable parameters
   of the IB-DG output current-current magnitude and current phase
   angle-the current phase angle is chosen as the means of controlling the
   fault current magnitude. The reference current phase angle is calculated
   based on the relation between the fault current elements and their phase
   angles. As a result of this novel operation, IB-DGs with larger capacity
   can be connected at different locations of the system without affecting
   the fault current magnitude. Also, implementing this technique in smart
   grids is economically proven, since the asset of power system which have
   been designed for normal operation are employed to manage the fault
   current magnitude. Moreover, possibilities of synchronization problems
   are reduced by keeping IB-DGs connected to the system at all the time.
   The evaluation of the proposed FCM technique using the standard IEEE
   33-bus distribution system demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   proposed method for managing the fault current magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{At high penetrations, uncontrolled electric vehicle (EV) charging has
   the potential to cause line and transformer congestion in the
   distribution network. Instead of upgrading components to higher
   nameplate ratings, we investigate the use of real-time control to limit
   EV load to the available capacity in the network. Inspired by rate
   control algorithms in computer networks such as TCP, we design a
   measurement-based, real-time, distributed, stable, efficient, and fair
   charging algorithm using the dual-decomposition approach. We show
   through extensive numerical simulations and power flow analysis on a
   test distribution network that this algorithm operates successfully in
   both static and dynamic settings, despite changes in home loads and the
   number of connected EVs. We find that our algorithm rapidly converges
   from large disturbances to a stable operating point. We show that in a
   test setting, for an acceptable level of overload, only 70 EVs could be
   fully charged without control, whereas up to around 700 EVs can be fully
   charged using our control algorithm. This compares well with the maximum
   supportable population of approximately 900 EVs. Our work also provides
   engineering guidelines for choosing the control parameters and setpoints
   in a distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{There are many technical aspects and challenges in distributed
   generation (DG) that have not been properly understood and addressed so
   far. Distribution systems cannot be considered as balanced three-phase
   systems, because these are inherently unbalanced in steady-state
   operation. A full characterization of the unbalanced system with respect
   to system stability allows a better understanding of the dynamic
   behavior of such systems. This paper presents a comprehensive
   investigation of the effects of system unbalance on the stability of the
   distribution systems with synchronous generator (SG) and doubly-fed
   induction generator (DFIG) based DG units at different loading levels.
   Detailed steady-state and dynamic analyses of the system are performed.
   Based on classical voltage, small-perturbation and transient stability
   studies, it is demonstrated that system unbalance can significantly
   affect the distribution system dynamic performance, in ways that have
   not been discussed in the technical literature so far. A simple and
   effective control strategy based on an Unbalanced Voltage Stabilizer
   (UVS) is also proposed to improve the system control and the stability
   of unbalanced distribution systems with SG and DFIG. Eigenvalue analyses
   and time-domain simulations (TDS) demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed UVS for unbalance conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution
   in the use of distribution systems and the emergence of smart-grid
   concepts. Smart grids are intended primarily as a means of facilitating
   the integration of renewable energy sources and of achieving greater
   system reliability and efficiency. Energy storage systems offer a number
   of benefits that can help utilities move toward those goals. One of
   those benefits is the capacity to improve system reliability through
   successful islanding operation. This paper proposes a methodology for
   the cost-effective improvement of system reliability through the
   allocation of distributed storage units in distribution systems. The
   costs of energy storage installation are optimized with respect to
   reliability value expressed as customers' willingness to pay in order to
   avoid power interruptions. The primary goal of this research was thus to
   determine the optimal combination of storage units to be installed and
   the loads to be shed so that all possible contingencies can be
   effectively addressed. A probabilistic approach is therefore adopted
   that includes consideration of the stochastic nature of system

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of membrane processes and feasibility of hybrid
   processes combining membrane permeation and conventional amine
   absorption processes were investigated for post-combustion CO2 capture.
   The traditional MEA process uses a substantial amount of thermal energy
   at the stripper reboiler when CO2 concentration increases. Questions are
   sometimes raised if the membranes can compete with amine absorption for
   post-combustion CO2 capture. Although both processes have their own
   advantages, can a hybrid process for post-combustion CO2 capture be
   yielded combining membranes and amine absorption with cost/performance
   advantages? Several single stage and multi-stage membrane process
   configurations were simulated for a target capture requirement aiming at
   possible application in enhanced oil recovery. It was shown that
   membrane processes offer the lowest energy penalty for post-combustion
   CO2 capture and are likely to expand as more and more CO2 selective
   membranes are developed. A comparison of energy perspective for the CO2
   capture processes studied was drawn, and it was shown that the energy
   requirements of the hybrid processes are less than conventional MEA
   processes. The total energy penalty of the hybrid processes decreases as
   more share of CO2 is removed by the membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We introduce a new 3-D flexible microelectrode array for high
   performance electrographic neural signal recording and stimulation. The
   microelectrode architecture maximizes the number of channels on each
   shank and minimizes its footprint. The electrode was implemented on
   flexible polyimide substrate using microfabrication and thin-film
   processing. The electrode has a planar layout and comprises multiple
   shanks. Each shank is three mm in length and carries six gold pads
   representing the neuro-interfacing channels. The channels are used in
   recording important precursors with potential clinical relevance and
   consequent electrical stimulation to perturb the clinical condition. The
   polyimide structure satisfied the mechanical characteristics required
   for the proper electrode implantation and operation. Pad postprocessing
   technique was developed to improve the electrode electrical performance.
   The planar electrodes were used for creating 3-D ``Waterloo Array{''}
   microelectrode with controlled gaps using custom designed stackers.
   Electrode characterization and benchmarking against commercial
   equivalents demonstrated the superiority of the Flex electrodes. The
   Flex and commercial electrodes were associated with low-power
   implantable responsive neuro-stimulation system. The electrodes
   performance in recording and stimulation application was quantified
   through in vitro and in vivo acute and chronic experiments on human
   brain slices and freely-moving rodents. The Flex electrodes exhibited
   remarkable drop in the electric impedance (100 times at 100 Hz),
   improved electrode-electrolyte interface noise (dropped by four times)
   and higher signal-to-noise ratio (3.3 times).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two new hardware designs of the Welch-Gong (WG)-128
   cipher, one for the multiple output WG (MOWG) version, and the other for
   the single output version WG based on type-II optimal normal basis
   representation. The proposed MOWG design uses signal reuse techniques to
   reduce hardware cost in the MOWG transformation, whereas it increases
   the speed by eliminating the inverters from the critical path. This is
   accomplished through reconstructing the key and initial vector loading
   algorithm and the feedback polynomial of the linear feedback shift
   register. The proposed WG design uses properties of the trace function
   to optimize the hardware cost in the WG transformation. The
   application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate
   array implementations of the proposed designs show that their areas and
   power consumptions outperform the existing implementations of the WG

Abstract = {{Bacterial cell lysis is demonstrated using polymeric microfluidic
   biochips operating via a hybrid mechanical shearing/contact killing
   mechanism. These biochips are fabricated from a cross-linked poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (X-PMMA) substrate by well-controlled, high-throughput
   laser micromachining. The unreacted double bonds at the surface of
   X-PMMA provide covalent bonding for the formation of a porous polymeric
   monolith (PPM), thus contributing to the mechanical stability of the
   biochip and eliminating the need for surface treatment. The lysis
   efficiency of these biochips was tested for gram-positive (Enterococcus
   saccharolyticus and Bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative bacteria
   (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens) and confirmed by off-chip
   PCR without further purification. The influence of the flow rate when
   pumping the bacterial suspension through the PPM, and of the
   hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance on the cell lysis efficiency was
   investigated at a cell concentration of 10(5) CFU/mL. It was shown that
   the contribution of contact killing to cell lysis was more important
   than that of mechanical shearing in the PPM. The biochip showed better
   lysis efficiency than the off-chip chemical, mechanical, and thermal
   lysis techniques used in this work. The biochip also acts as a filter
   that isolates cell debris and allows PCR-amplifiable DNA to pass
   through. The system performs more efficient lysis for gram-negative than
   for gram-positive bacteria. The biochip does not require
   chemical/enzymatic reagents, power consumption, or complicated design
   and fabrication processes, which makes it an attractive on-chip lysis
   device that can be used in sample preparation for genetics and
   point-of-care diagnostics. The biochips were reused for 20 lysis cycles
   without any evidence of physical damage to the PPM, significant
   performance degradation, or DNA carryover when they were back-flushed
   between cycles. The biochips efficiently lysed both gram-positive and
   gram-negative bacteria in about 35 min per lysis and PPM regeneration
   cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The development of an efficient and productive cell-culture process
   requires a deep understanding of intracellular mechanisms and
   extracellular conditions for optimal product synthesis. Mathematical
   modeling provides an effective strategy to predict, control, and
   optimize cell performance under a range of culture conditions. In this
   study, a mathematical model is proposed for the investigation of cell
   damage of a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture secreting recombinant
   anti-RhD monoclonal antibody (mAb). Irreversible cell damage was found
   to be correlated with a reduction in pH. This irreversible damage to
   cellular function is described mathematically by a Tessier-based model,
   in which the actively growing fraction of cells is dependent on an
   intracellular metabolic product acting as a growth inhibitor. To further
   verify the model, an offline model-based optimization of mAb production
   in the cell culture was carried out, with the goal of minimizing cell
   damage and thereby enhancing productivity through intermittent
   refreshment of the culture medium. An experimental implementation of
   this model-based strategy resulted in a doubling of the yield as
   compared to the batch operation and the resulting biomass and
   productivity profiles agreed with the model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental feature of multicellular organisms is their ability to
   self-repair wounds through the movement of epithelial cells into the
   damaged area. This collective cellular movement is commonly attributed
   to a combination of cell crawling and `purse-string' contraction of a
   supracellular actomyosin ring. Here we show by direct experimental
   measurement that these two mechanisms are insufficient to explain force
   patterns observed during wound closure. At early stages of the process,
   leading actin protrusions generate traction forces that point away from
   the wound, showing that wound closure is initially driven by cell
   crawling. At later stages, we observed unanticipated patterns of
   traction forces pointing towards the wound. Such patterns have strong
   force components that are both radial and tangential to the wound. We
   show that these force components arise from tensions transmitted by a
   heterogeneous actomyosin ring to the underlying substrate through focal
   adhesions. The structural and mechanical organization reported here
   provides cells with a mechanism to close the wound by cooperatively
   compressing the underlying substrate.}},

Abstract = {{This study employs a novel approach to the prediction of CANDU {[}Canada
   deuterium uranium (reactor)] fuel reliability. Probability distributions
   are fitted to actual fuel manufacturing data sets provided by Cameco
   Fuel Manufacturing. They are used to form input for two
   industry-standard fuel performance codes: ELESTRES for the steady-state
   case and ELOCA for the transient case-a hypothesized 80\% reactor outlet
   header break loss-of-coolant accident. Using a Monte Carlo technique for
   input generation, 10(5) independent trials are conducted, and
   probability distributions are fitted to key model output quantities.
   Comparing model output against recognized industrial acceptance
   criteria, no fuel failures are predicted for either case. Output
   distributions are well removed from failure limit values, implying that
   margin exists in current fuel manufacturing and design. To validate the
   results and attempt to reduce the simulation burden of the methodology,
   two dimensional reduction methods are assessed. Using just 36 trials,
   both methods are able to produce output distributions that agree
   strongly with those obtained via the brute-force Monte Carlo method,
   often to a relative discrepancy of <0.3\% when predicting the first
   statistical moment and to a relative discrepancy of <5\% when predicting
   the second statistical moment. In terms of global sensitivity, pellet
   density proves to have the greatest impact on fuel performance, with an
   average sensitivity index of 48.93\% on key output quantities. Pellet
   grain size and dish depth are also significant contributors, at 31.53\%
   and 13.46\%, respectively. A traditional ``limit of operating
   envelope{''} case is also evaluated. This case produces output values
   that exceed the maximum values observed during the 105 Monte Carlo
   trials for all output quantities of interest. In many cases the
   difference between the predictions of the statistical methods and the
   limit method is very prominent, and the highly conservative nature of
   the deterministic approach is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{An approach for the optimal design of chemical processes in the presence
   of uncertainty was presented. The key idea in this work is to
   approximate the process constraint functions and model outputs using
   Power Series Expansions (PSE)based functions. The PSE functions are used
   to efficiently identify the variability in the process constraint
   functions and model outputs due to multiple realizations in the
   uncertain parameters using Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods. A
   ranking-based approach is adopted here where the user can assign
   priorities or probabilities of satisfaction for the different process
   constraints and model outputs considered in the analysis. The
   methodology was tested on a reactor-heat exchanger system and the
   Tennessee Eastman process. The results show that the present method is
   computationally attractive since the optimal process design is
   accomplished in shorter computational times when compared to the use of
   the MC method applied to the full plant model. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Basically, there are two main techniques to control the vehicle yaw

   the basis of active steering control (ASC). The second one being the
   direct yaw moment control (DYC), which is based on either the
   differential braking or the torque vectoring. An innovative idea for the
   direct yaw moment control is introduced by using an active controller
   system to supervise the lateral dynamics of vehicle and perform as an
   active yaw moment control system, denoted as the stabilizer pendulum
   system (SPS). This idea has further been developed, analyzed, and
   implemented in a standalone direct yaw moment control system, as well
   as, in an integrated vehicle dynamic control system with a differential
   braking yaw moment controller. The effectiveness of SPS has been
   evaluated by model simulation, which illustrates its superior

Abstract = {{This at is intended for investigating the effects of
   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and volume fraction of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) On the flow and heat transfer in two lateral directions over a
   stretching sheet. For this purpose, three types of base fluids
   specifically water, ethylene glycol and engine oil with single and
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes are used in the analysis. The convective
   boundary condition in the presence of CNTs is presented first time and
   not been explored so far. The transformed nonlinear differential
   equations are solved by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method with a shooting
   technique. The dimensionless velocity and shear stress are obtained in
   both directions. The dimensionless heat transfer is determined on the
   surface. Three different models of thermal conductivity are comparable
   for both CNTs and it is found that the Xue {[}1] model gives the best
   approach to guess the superb thermal conductivity in comparison with the
   Maxwell {[}2] and Hamilton and Crosser {[}3] models. And finally,
   another finding suggests the engine oil provides the highest skin
   friction and heat transfer rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights

Abstract = {{Small molecule,organic solar cells (OSCs) are systematically studied for
   their photo-stability in an inert N-2 environment. In this work, 28-day
   dark, light-stress and heat-stress experiments are conducted on OSCs
   with strongly varied mixing ratios. Comparisons are made between the
   emerging, high performance Schottky device structure and the more widely
   studied (standard) BHJ structure. In both structures, light stress
   experiments result in a 10-15\% loss in power conversion efficiency.
   Simultaneous heat-stress experiments demonstrate that these variations
   are not related to thermally induced changes. Photo-induced losses in
   open circuit voltages are observed for both device structures and are
   attributed to organic-electrode degradation. However, variations in the
   other photovoltaic parameters are more strongly dependent on the active
   layer composition and associated device structure. Schottky OSCs are
   shown to be slightly more resilient to variations in short circuit
   current compared to standard BHJ OSCs, but they suffer from losses in
   fill factor. Microsecond transient photocurrent and external quantum
   efficiency measurements are employed to show that these fill factor
   losses are due to increased recombination, associated with increased
   trap density by the exciton-induced degradation of the C-60 acceptor.
   This effect may be problematic for all Schottky OSCs due to their use of
   mixed layers with very high C-60 content. The choice of device
   architecture is thus shown to alter degradation mechanisms, and so it
   can have implications on the overall OSC photo-stability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In amplify-and-forward (AF)-based cooperative spectrum sensing system,
   the bit-error-rate (BER) performance and detection probability will
   decrease because of the existence of channel estimation error. In this
   paper, the influence of channel estimation error on system performance
   is firstly deduced, and then, linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE)
   channel estimation algorithm with filtering delay time-domain windowing
   (LMMSE-filtering-DTW) technique and modified singular value
   decomposition-based LMMSE algorithm are proposed to improve the channel
   estimation performance for code division multiple access system and
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system in AF cooperative
   scenario, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of
   the two proposed channel estimation algorithms in cooperative spectrum
   sensing, and when E-b/N-0 is bigger than 20 dB, given the required false
   alarm probability smaller than 15\%, the difference of detection
   probability between the channel obtained using the proposed channel
   estimation algorithms and the ideal channel is less than 2.5\%,
   respectively. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A relative pose and target model estimation framework using calibrated
   multicamera clusters is presented. It is able to accurately track
   up-to-date relative motion, including scale, between the camera cluster
   and the (free-moving) completely unknown target object or environment
   using only image measurements from a set of perspective cameras. The
   cameras within the cluster may be arranged in any configuration, even
   such that there is no spatial overlap in their fields-of-view. An
   analysis of the set of degenerate motions for a cluster composed of
   three cameras is performed. It is shown that including the third camera
   eliminates many of the previously known ambiguities for two-camera
   clusters. The estimator performance and the degeneracy analysis
   conclusions are confirmed in experiment with ground truth data collected
   from an optical motion capture system for the proposed three-camera
   cluster against other camera configurations suggested in the literature.

Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},

Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{113-118}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper revisits the problem of range measurement based localization
   of a signal source or a sensor. The major geometric difficulty of the
   problem comes from the non-convex structure of optimization tasks
   associated with range measurements, noting that the set of source
   locations corresponding to a certain distance measurement by a fixed
   point sensor is non-convex both in two and three dimensions. Differently
   from various recent approaches to this localization problem, all
   starting with a non-convex geometric minimization problem and attempting
   to devise methods to compensate the non-convexity effects, we suggest a
   geometric strategy to compose a convex minimization problem first, that
   is equivalent to the initial non-convex problem, at least in noise-free
   measurement cases. Once the convex equivalent problem is formed, a wide
   variety of convex minimization algorithms can be applied. The paper also
   suggests a gradient based localization algorithm utilizing the
   introduced convex cost function for localization. Furthermore, the
   effects of measurement noises are briefly discussed. The design,
   analysis, and discussions are supported by a set of numerical
   simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Simultaneous ash and sulfur removal from bitumen: Experiments and neural
   network modeling}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{79-85}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Flotation and leaching methods were used to remove ash and sulfur from
   bitumen by sulfuric acid. The bitumen samples had sulfur content of
   9.6\% (6.74\% in the pyrite sulfur form) and 30\% ash. All the
   experiments were done under aeration rate of 4 L/min using pine oil and
   gasoline as frother and collector agents, respectively. The factors
   studied were including the amounts of collector and frother agents, pH,
   solid weight percentage in the pulp, stirrer speed, and particle size.
   The bitumen samples with dimensions less than 0.5 mm were crushed. The
   flotation experiments were performed in a 3-L Denver laboratory
   flotation cell to ease the ash and sulfur removal. The optimum condition
   for plant operation were; foaming (50 gr/t), collector (1 kg/t),
   impeller speed of 1200 rpm, pH = 7, pulp containing 5\% of solid,
   particle size of 100 mesh, and flotation time of 3 min. In these
   circumstances, 52.9\% of pyrite sulfur (e.g.; 36.45\% of total sulfur)
   and 43\% of ash were removed. With the approach of leaching using
   sulfuric acid, the organic and pyrite sulfur removal were 7\% and 13\%,
   respectively. Combination of these two methods (in optimal conditions),
   removed up to 47\% of the total sulfur and 61\% of ash through bitumen
   sample. In the next step of study Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was
   employed to model the ash and sulfur removals data obtained by flotation
   method. A network consisting of two layers of six and nine neurons in
   the hidden layer were considered. Meanwhile learning algorithm
   Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) was used. In neural network models ``Tansig{''}
   and ``Purelin{''}, transfer functions for hidden and output layers were
   applied, respectively. Very low error in the network estimation
   confirmed validity of the obtained networks for further analysis and
   optimization. Moreover, process optimization were carried out by using
   ANN to predict the best operating conditions, which resulted in the
   maximum percentage of ash and pyrite sulfur removal from bitumen. The
   maximum percentage of ash was estimated by ANN to be 42.39\% under the
   following operational conditions; foaming amount of 50.5gr/t, the
   collector amount of 1.12 kg/t, impeller speed of 1200 rpm, pH = 7.5,
   pulp equal to 5\% of solid, particle size of 110 mesh, and flotation
   time of 3 min. The maximum percentage of pyrite sulfur removal was
   estimated by ANN to be 52.15\% under the following operational
   conditions; foaming amount of 50gr/t, the collector amount of 1.4 kg/t,
   impeller speed of 1200 rpm, pH = 7, pulp equal to 5\% of solid, particle
   size of 100 mesh, and flotation time of 3 min. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Context: Variability modeling, and in particular feature modeling, is a
   central element of model-driven software product line architectures.
   Such architectures often emerge from legacy code, but, creating feature
   models from large, legacy systems is a long and arduous task. We
   describe three synthesis scenarios that can benefit from the algorithms
   in this paper.
   Objective: This paper addresses the problem of automatic synthesis of
   feature models from propositional constraints. We show that the decision
   version of the problem is NP-hard. We designed two efficient algorithms
   for synthesis of feature models from CNF and DNF formulas respectively.
   Method: We performed an experimental evaluation of the algorithms
   against a binary decision diagram (BDD)-based approach and a formal
   concept analysis (FCA)-based approach using models derived from
   realistic models.
   Results: Our evaluation shows a 10 to 1,000-fold performance improvement
   for our algorithms over the BDD-based approach. The performance of the
   DNF-based algorithm was similar to the FCA-based approach, with
   advantages for both techniques. We identified input properties that
   affect the runtimes of the CNF- and DNF-based algorithms.
   Conclusions: Our algorithms are the first known techniques that are
   efficient enough to be used on dependencies extracted from real systems,
   opening new possibilities of creating reverse engineering and model
   management tools for variability models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Mapping ice and open water in ocean bodies is important for numerous
   purposes, including environmental analysis and ship navigation. The
   Canadian Ice Service (CIS) has stipulated a need for an automated
   ice-water discrimination algorithm using dual polarization images
   produced by RADARSAT-2. Automated methods can provide mappings in larger
   volumes, with more consistency, and in finer resolutions, which are
   otherwise impractical to generate. We have developed such an automated
   ice-water discrimination system called MAp-Guided Ice Classification.
   First, the HV (horizontal transmit polarization, vertical receive
   polarization) scene is classified using the ``glocal{''} method, i.e., a
   hierarchical region-based classification method based on the published
   iterative region growing using semantics (IRGS) algorithm. Second, a
   pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) using a nonlinear radial basis
   function kernel classification is performed exploiting synthetic
   aperture radar gray-level co-occurrence texture and backscatter
   features. Finally, the IRGS and SVM classification results are combined
   using the IRGS approach but with a modified energy function to
   accommodate the SVM pixel-based information. The combined classifier was
   tested on 20 ground truthed dual polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes of the
   Beaufort Sea containing a variety of ice types and water patterns across
   melt, summer, and freeze-up periods. The average leave-one-out
   classification accuracy with respect to these ground truths is 96.42\%,
   with a minimum of 89.95\% for one scene. The MAGIC system is now under
   consideration by the CIS for operational use.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate understanding of the characteristics of battery heat
   generation is essential to the development and success of thermal
   management systems for electric vehicles. In this study, a calorimeter
   capable of measuring the heat generation rates of a prismatic battery is
   developed and verified by using a controllable electric heater. The heat
   generation rates of a prismatic Al23 LiFePO4 battery is measured for
   discharge rates ranging from 0.25C to 3C and operating temperature
   ranging from -10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. At low rates of discharge
   the heat generation is not significant, even becoming endothermic at the
   battery operating temperatures of 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Heat of
   mixing is observed to be a non-negligible component of total heat
   generation at discharge rates as low as 0.25C for all tested battery
   operating temperatures. A double plateau in battery discharge curve is
   observed for operating temperatures of 30 C and 40 C. The developed
   experimental facility can be used for the characterization of heat
   generation for any prismatic battery, regardless of chemistries.(c) 2014

   study}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{311}},
Pages = {{435-442}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{To understand the effects of carbon atoms on the Ni catalyzed methane
   cracking reactions, methane dissociation on clean,
   surface-carbon-covered, and subsurface-carbon-accumulated Ni(1 1 1)
   surfaces were investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The
   results show that the existence of surface and subsurface C atoms
   destabilized the adsorption of the surface hydrocarbon species when
   compared to the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The projected density state
   (PDOS) analysis shows that the deposition of C atoms on and into the Ni
   surface modified the electronic structure of the Ni surface, and thus
   reduced the catalytic activity of the bonded Ni atoms. Moreover, it was
   found that the presence carbon atoms increase the CHx (x = 4-1) species
   activation barriers especially on the surface carbon covered (1/4 ML)
   Ni(1 1 1) surface, where CHx (x = 4-1) species encounter highest energy
   barrier for dissociation due to the electronic deactivation induced by
   C-Ni bonding and the strong repulsive carbon -CHx, interaction. The
   calculations also show that CHx dissociation barriers are not affected
   by its neighboring C atom at low surface carbon coverage (1/9 ML). This
   work can be used to estimate more realistic kinetic parameters for this
   system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An accelerated carbonation experiment was carried out under artificial

   distributions of the Ca(OH)(2) and CaCO3 by chemical analysis methods as

   value in corresponding zone of carbonated concrete. The cross section of
   carbonation concrete shows complete carbonation zone, semi-carbonation
   zone with variable pH value, semi-carbonation zone with constant pH
   value, and non-carbonation zone. In the light of formation sequence of
   semi-carbonated zone and completely carbonated zone, the development
   process of concrete carbonization is divided into three stages: (1) from
   the beginning of carbonation to the point when pH on concrete surface
   starts to decrease; (2) from the point when pH on concrete surface
   starts to decrease to the point when the alkaline component is depleted;
   (3) from the point when the alkaline component is depleted to any time.

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},

Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is used to examine the surface of an
   incompressible polymer melt of freely jointed chains, each consisting of
   N discrete monomers connected by bonds of an arbitrary potential. As a
   result of entropic considerations, the end monomers tend to accumulate
   in a narrow region next to the surface (on the monomer scale), which
   causes a slight depletion of ends further into the melt (on the
   molecular scale). Due to the reduced configurational entropy available
   to polymers in the vicinity of a surface, we find an entropic
   contribution to the surface tension that increases with the degree of
   polymerization, N. While many quantities are dependent on the precise
   bond potential connecting the monomers, the excess of ends at the
   surface in the limit of infinite N, the functional form of the
   long-range depletion of ends, and the N dependence of the surface
   tension turn out to be universal.}},

   electrical doping of electron transporting materials. We demonstrate
   that tandem OLEDs using LiNH2 and Cs2CO3 as n-type dopants,
   respectively, give a comparable electroluminescence efficiency and,
   moreover, the device with LiNH2 has far longer operational lifetime. The
   results therefore highlight the significance of selecting suitable
   n-type dopant in intermediate connectors to fabricate high-stability
   tandem OLEDs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The growing field of silicon solar cells requires a substantial
   reduction in the cost of semiconductor grade silicon, which has been
   mainly produced by the rod-based Siemens method. Because silicon can
   react with almost all of the elements and form a number of alloys at
   high temperatures, it is highly desired to obtain high purity
   crystalline silicon at relatively low temperatures through low cost
   process. Here we report a fast, complete and inexpensive reduction
   method for converting sodium hexafluorosilicate into silicon at a
   relatively low reaction temperature (similar to 200 degrees C). This
   temperature could be further decreased to less than 180 degrees C in
   combination with an electrochemical approach. The residue sodium
   fluoride is dissolved away by pure water and hydrochloric acid solution
   in later purifying processes below 15 degrees C. High purity silicon in
   particle form can be obtained. The relative simplicity of this method
   might lead to a low cost process in producing high purity silicon.}},

Title = {{A hierarchical framework of dynamic relay selection for mobile users and

Abstract = {{Although extensive research has been carried out on the issue of how to
   optimally select relays in wireless relay networks, relay selection for
   mobile users is still a challenging problem because of the requirement
   that the dynamic selection should adapt to user mobility. Moreover,
   because the selected relays consume their energy on relaying data for
   the users, it is required that the users have to pay for this relay
   service. The price of selecting relays will affect the users' decisions.
   Assuming that different relays can belong to different service
   providers, we consider the situation that the service providers can
   strategically set the prices of their relays to maximize their profits.
   In this paper, we jointly study the dynamic relay selection for mobile
   users and profit maximization for service providers. Also, we design a
   Stackelberg-game hierarchical framework to obtain the solution. At the
   lower level, we investigate the relay selection problem for the mobile
   users under given prices of selecting the relays. It is formulated as a
   Markov decision process problem with the objective to minimize the
   mobile user's long-term average cost (which consists of the payment to
   the relay service and the cost due to packet loss), and solved by
   applying the linear programming technique. At the upper level, we study
   the game of setting relay prices for the service providers, with the
   knowledge that the mobile users will make relay selections based on
   their given prices. Nash equilibrium is obtained as the solution. Our
   results can help to provide a guidance for service providers to compete
   for providing relay services. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{Dimensioning the packet loss burstiness over wireless channels: a novel
   metric, its analysis and application}},

Abstract = {{The packet loss burstiness over wireless channels is commonly
   acknowledged as a key impacting factor on the performance of networking
   protocols. An accurate evaluation of the packet loss burstiness, which
   reveals the characteristics and performance of the wireless channels, is
   crucial to the design of wireless systems and the quality-of-service
   provisioning to end users. In this paper, a simple yet accurate
   analytical framework is developed to dimension the packet loss
   burstiness over generic wireless channels. In specific, we first propose
   a novel and effective metric to characterize the packet loss burstiness,
   which is shown to be more compact, effective, and accurate than the
   metrics proposed in existing literature for the same purpose. With this
   metric, we then develop an analytical framework and derive the
   closed-form solutions of the packet loss performance, including the
   packet loss rate and the loss-burst/loss-gap length distributions.
   Lastly, as an example to show how the derived results can be applied to
   the design of wireless systems, we apply the analytical results to
   devise an adaptive packetization scheme. The proposed packetization
   scheme adaptively adjusts the packet length of transmissions based on
   the prediction of the packet loss rate and loss-burst/loss-gap lengths
   of the wireless channel. Via extensive simulations, we show that with
   the proposed packetization scheme, the channel throughput can be
   enhanced by more than 10\% than the traditional scheme. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A well-controlled chemical synthetic protocol was developed to prepare a
   novel conductive, polypyrrole (PPy)/cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) system
   that is simple, cost-effective and scalable. Carboxylic acid groups were
   grafted onto CNC via a TEMPO-mediated oxidation providing strong
   hydrogen bonding to enhance adsorption of pyrrole monomers (Py). In-situ
   chemical polymerization of Py was further performed on a single high
   aspect ratio CNC. The nanotemplating of CNC controlled the deposition
   and growth of the polymer layer, which enhanced the electrochemical
   properties of PPy. Improved processibility of PPy was achieved due to
   the high mechanical strength and good dispersibility of CNC. By varying
   the ratio of Py to surface hydroxyl groups of CNCs (Py/OH)
   systematically, an optimal composition of Py/OH of 16:1 was observed.
   The mechanism of the electrochemical performance change associated with
   Py/OH molar feeding ratio was also studied in detail using different
   spectrometry and SEM methods. PPy/CNC hybrid nanostructures possessed an
   attractive specific capacitance of 248 F g(-1), suitable for
   supercapacitor applications and exceeding the performance of comparable
   systems based on carbon nanotubes and graphenes. Compared with other
   cellulose-polypyrrole systems whose end-products are typically entangled
   fiber mat, aerogel or cake-form, our CNC nanorods can be readily
   dispersed and added as fillers into different matrices. The PPy/CNC
   hybrid nanostructure is extremely light, conductive, cheap, renewable,
   environmentally friendly, and our solution-phase chemical synthesis is
   simple to implement and easy to scale up. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study tested municipal sewage effluents generated at the pilot
   scale using conventional activated sludge (CAS), nitrifying activated
   sludge (CAS-N) and biological nutrient removal (BNR) in terms of the
   removal of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) and final effluent quality as
   indicated by yeast estrogenicity screening (YES), short termzebrafish
   reproduction and fathead minnowlife-cycle tests. Under coldweather
   conditions (extended SRTs), the BNR configuration reduced the
   concentrations of the largest number of TrOCs while under warm weather
   conditions (reduced SRTs) the CAS-N was most effective. By comparison,
   YES test results indicated statistically lower responses in the BNR
   effluent in the warm weather tests and no difference between the
   effluents of CAS-N and BNR in the cold weather tests. Short term tests
   with adult zebrafish revealed no impact of the BNR and CAS-N effluents
   on egg production. By contrast egg production and gene expression in the
   CAS-exposed zebrafish were substantially less than that of control
   exposures and were similar to that of exposures to ammonia at similar
   concentrations as the CAS exposures. In fathead minnow life-cycle tests,
   exposures to CAS effluent (70-50\% v/v) resulted in considerable
   mortality, reduced growth and reduced egg production that was likely due
   to the elevated ammonia concentrations. The CAS-N effluent (100\% v/v)
   also resulted in some mortality and reduced growth and egg production in
   the fathead minnows. By contrast, the BNR effluent (100\% v/v) had no
   effect on mortality, growth or egg production. The results suggest that
   enhancements to wastewater treatment plants that are associated with
   improved nitrogen removal can result in enhanced removal of TrOCs and
   can reduce the harmful effects of the effluents on aquatic biota. (C)

Abstract = {{A cost-effective chemical, N,N'-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine
   (salen), is used as a ligand to form a carbon-supported Co-salen complex
   (Co-salen/C) by a simple solid-sate reaction. The Co-salen/C is then
   pyrolyzed at 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C to form
   carbon-supported Co-N-S/C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR). XRD, EDX, TEM, and XPS are used to characterize the catalysts'
   composition, crystalline nature, morphology, and possible surface groups
   induced by heat-treatment. Investigation of the catalytic activity and
   the ORR mechanisms using rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk
   electrode techniques demonstrates that all of these Co-N-S/C catalysts
   are highly active for the ORR in an O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution,
   but the catalyst heat treated at 700 degrees C gives the best ORR
   activity. The overall electron transfer number for the catalyzed ORR was
   determined to be 3.6-3.9, with 3.7-19.9\% H2O2 production over the
   potential range of -0.05 to -0.60 V, suggesting that the ORR catalyzed
   by Co-N-S/C catalysts is dominated by a 4-electron transfer pathway from
   O-2 to H2O. In addition, these catalysts exhibit superior methanol
   tolerance to commercial 40\% Pt/C catalyst, thus the Co-N-S/C catalysts
   are promising for use as electrocatalysts in alkaline polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this Letter, we study the mechanical and optical response of a
   thermoplastic polyurethane blended with 0.5 wt.\% of bis( benzoxazolyl)
   stilbene dye. The mechanochromic behavior of the material is
   characterized in a uniaxial stress-relaxation test by simultaneously
   acquiring the applied force, mechanical deformation, and fluorescence
   emission. To offer insight into the stress-strain response of the
   polymer-dye blend, we adapt a classical nonlinear constitutive behavior
   for elastomeric materials that accounts for stress-induced softening. We
   correlate the fluorescent response with the mechanical strain to
   demonstrate the possibility of accurate strain sensing for a broad range
   of deformations during both loading and unloading. (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{The genioglossus is a major upper airway dilator muscle thought to be
   important in obstructive sleep apnea pathogenesis. Aging is a risk
   factor for obstructive sleep apnea although the mechanisms are unclear
   and the effects of aging on motor unit remodeled in the genioglossus
   remains unknown. To assess possible changes associated with aging we
   compared quantitative parameters related to motor unit potential
   morphology derived from EMG signals in a sample of older (n = 11; >55
   years) versus younger (n = 29; <55 years) adults. All data were recorded
   during quiet breathing with the subjects awake. Diagnostic sleep studies
   (Apnea Hypopnea Index) confirmed the presence or absence of obstructive
   sleep apnea. Genioglossus EMG signals were analyzed offline by automated
   software (DQEMG), which estimated a MUP template from each extracted
   motor unit potential train (MUPT) for both the selective concentric
   needle and concentric needle macro (CNMACRO) recorded EMG signals. 2074
   MUPTs from 40 subjects (mean +/- 95\% CI; older AHI 19.6 +/- 9.9
   events/hr versus younger AHI 30.1 +/- 6.1 events/hr) were extracted.
   MUPs detected in older adults were 32\% longer in duration (14.7 +/- 0.5
   ms versus 11.1 +/- 0.2 ms; P = 0.05), with similar amplitudes (395.2 +/-
   25.1 mu V versus 394.6 +/- 13.7 mu V). Amplitudes of CNMACRO MUPs
   detected in older adults were larger by 22\% (62.7 +/- 6.5 mu V versus
   51.3 +/- 3.0 mu V; P<0.05), with areas 24\% larger (160.6 +/- 18.6 mu
   V.ms versus 130.0 +/- 7.4 mu V.ms; P<0.05) than those detected in
   younger adults. These results confirm that remodeled motor units are
   present in the genioglossus muscle of individuals above 55 years, which
   may have implications for OSA pathogenesis and aging related upper
   airway collapsibility.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis of a mathematical model of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S)
   battery was performed by investigating the response of the model to
   variation of the exchange current densities, diffusion coefficients, and

   used to explain the some aspects of the behavior of the system which may
   be seen in experiments. In particular, among all the exchange current
   densities, the exchange current density of the elemental sulfur
   reduction has the most significant effect on the discharge capacity of
   the cell. The variation of the diffusion coefficients was also analyzed,
   providing information on the non-uniformity of precipitants in the cell
   after discharge. An optimum cathode thickness was presented to gain the
   highest capacity of the cell. Finally, the simulation of charging was
   studied, showing that the model needs a large solubility product of
   di-lithium sulfide to be able to simulate the charge process of a cell.

Abstract = {{One of the most important factors affecting pavement performance is
   climate, including frost action and precipitation. The performance of
   pavements in frost-affected regions depends to a large degree on the
   depth of frost penetration. In this paper, a simple predictive tool is
   developed to calculate a new correction coefficient depending upon the
   thermal ratio and fusion parameter. The new correction coefficient can
   be used in follow-up calculations to estimate the depth of frost
   penetration for both uniform and layered soils in frost-affected regions
   to evaluate the performance of pavement. The results of the proposed
   method are found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in the
   literature with average absolute deviation being less than 0.8\%. The
   predictive tool is simple, straightforward and can be readily

Abstract = {{The effect of salt on the dissociation behavior of a
   Pluronic-polyacrylic acid penta-block copolymer (P85PAA65) was examined.
   The average Gibbs energy corresponding to the energy for extracting a
   proton from P85PAA65 copolymer chains decreased with increasing NaCl
   concentration, suggesting that the addition of salt favors the
   dissociation process. A fluorescence study showed a two-step
   dissociation in which the formation of polymer complexes composed of a
   hydrophobic core surrounded by a hydrophilic shell was observed at pH
   3.7, where the hydrodynamic radius (R-h) of the micellar structure
   increased from 145.6 to 302 nm due to coulombic repulsion of slightly
   charged PAA segments. As a consequence, the pyrene's first and the third
   vibronic peaks (I-1/I-3) ratio increased from 1.408 to 1.580, indicating
   a less hydrophobic or loose-coiled conformation compared to at a higher
   pH. At a pH of 7.22, the dissociation of the P85PAA65 copolymer was
   complete, yielding a dissociated polymer chain with apparent
   hydrodynamic radius (R-h(aPP)) of about 3.2 nm. A reduction of the
   critical micelle temperature (CMT) attributed to the hydrogen bonding
   between Pluronic and PAA segments was observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   underlying mechanisms behind observing materials phosphorescence using
   this technique are studied. The results show that using a low

   large energy differences between triplet states of target and host

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop the machinery of real interference alignment.
   This machinery is extremely powerful in achieving the sum degrees of
   freedom (DoF) of single antenna systems. The scheme of real interference
   alignment is based on designing single-layer and multilayer
   constellations used for modulating information messages at the
   transmitters. We show that constellations can be aligned in a similar
   fashion as that of vectors in multiple antenna systems and space can be
   broken up into fractional dimensions. The performance analysis of the
   signaling scheme makes use of a recent result in the field of
   Diophantine approximation, which states that the convergence part of the
   Khintchine-Groshev theorem holds for points on nondegenerate manifolds.
   Using real interference alignment, we obtain the sum DoF of two model
   channels, namely the Gaussian interference channel (IC) and the X
   channel. It is proved that the sum DoF of the K-user IC is (K/2) for
   almost all channel parameters. We also prove that the sum DoF of the
   X-channel with K transmitters and M receivers is (K M / K + M - 1) for
   almost all channel parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by communication through a network employing linear network
   coding, capacities of linear operator channels (LOCs) with arbitrarily
   distributed transfer matrices over finite fields are studied. Both the
   Shannon capacity C and the subspace coding capacity C-SS are analyzed.
   By establishing and comparing lower bounds on C and upper bounds on
   C-SS, various necessary conditions and sufficient conditions such that C
   = C-SS are obtained. A new class of LOCs such that C = C-SS is
   identified, which includes LOCs with uniform-given-rank transfer
   matrices as special cases. It is also demonstrated that C-SS is strictly
   less than C for a broad class of LOCs. In general, an optimal subspace
   coding scheme is difficult to find because it requires to solve the
   maximization of a nonconcave function. However, for an LOC with a unique
   subspace degradation, C-SS can be obtained by solving a convex
   optimization problem over rank distribution. Classes of LOCs with a
   unique subspace degradation are characterized. Since LOCs with
   uniform-given-rank transfer matrices have unique subspace degradations,
   some existing results on LOCs with uniform-given-rank transfer matrices
   are explained from a more general way.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-process networks figure in many engineering applications.
   Parameterized discrete event systems provide a convenient means of
   modeling such networks when the number of subprocesses is arbitrary,
   unknown or time-varying. Unfortunately, some key properties of these
   networks, such as nonblocking and deadlock-freedom, are undecidable.
   Moreover, mathematical tools supporting analysis of these networks are
   limited. This paper introduces a novel mathematical notion, weak
   invariant simulation, which is adapted to the analysis of synchronous
   products of discrete event systems. Furthermore, it proposes an
   efficient method to check whether a finite-state generator weakly
   invariantly simulates another finite-state generator with respect to a
   specific subalphabet. This new simulation relation is used to define a
   tractable subclass of parameterized ring networks of isomorphic
   subprocesses in which deadlock-freedom is decidable. Within this
   framework, a procedure is given to determine the reachable deadlocked
   states of the network. The effectiveness of the procedure is
   demonstrated by the deadlock analysis of a version of the dining
   philosophers problem.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to link maintenance and replacement decisions is presented
   in this paper. This approach proposes a methodical decision-making
   system to determine the optimal time to replace equipment. It
   essentially investigates the cost-effectiveness of replacing the
   equipment both before and after the lifetime is extended by maintenance.
   To properly investigate the effect of maintenance, maintenance
   activities should first be scheduled effectively. Therefore, this
   approach introduces a maintenance strategy based on reliability-centered
   maintenance (RCM) concept and genetic algorithm (GA) to optimally
   schedule maintenance activities. Two replacement studies are conducted:
   with and without the effect of maintenance. A comparison between
   replacement studies is discussed in the proposed approach. The proposed
   approach is applied to one of the most critical pieces of equipment in
   power systems: power transformer.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of New Control Structures for Regulating the Great Lakes
   System: Multiscenario, Multireservoir Optimization Approach}},

Abstract = {{Water levels in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system located in
   northeastern North America are critically important to the Canadian and
   U. S. economies. Water managers are concerned that this system, which is
   currently managed by control structures at the outlets of Lakes Superior
   and Ontario, is not able to cope with the highly uncertain impacts of
   climate change. In particular, the frequency of extreme water levels
   throughout the system might be substantially increased. This study
   provides an exploratory conceptual analysis to determine the extent that
   new control structures at the outlet of Lake Huron or Erie (or both) and
   corresponding excavation along the St. Clair or Niagara River (or both)
   might mitigate the risks posed by future extreme water supply scenarios.
   Multilake parametric rule curves were developed to regulate systems
   enabled with these new control structures as a whole. Multiple
   stochastic water supply sequences were adopted that represented
   different future extreme climate scenarios. A multiscenario,
   multireservoir (multilake), biobjective simulation-optimization
   methodology was developed to optimize the rule curve parameters in such
   a way that the risk of experiencing extreme water levels is robustly
   minimized and fairly distributed across the system. The biobjective
   setting was designed to embed the secondary objective function so that
   the cost of the new control structures and excavation generates
   trade-offs between the costs and the associated achievable risk
   reductions. The recently developed Pareto Archived Dynamically
   Dimensioned Search (PA-DDS) multiobjective optimization algorithm was
   enabled with the efficiency-increasing ``deterministic model
   preemption{''} strategy and utilized to solve the optimization problem.
   Results demonstrate that although systemwide regulation with the new
   control structures could substantially reduce the risk (i.e., by 86\%
   compared to the current or base level of regulation), it could not
   eliminate such events entirely and would cause adverse effects on the
   lower St. Lawrence River. Numerical results also suggest that
   implementing a single new control point at the outlet of Lake Huron
   would not be effective despite its high cost; however, a single new
   control point at the outlet of Lake Erie would be very effective, with
   considerably less associated cost. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{When classical particle filter (PF) techniques are used for dynamic
   system state estimation, they have some limitations: for example, when
   the weights of simulated samples are not sufficiently large, these
   classical PFs may suffer from sample impoverishment. In addition, the
   degraded diversity in sampling particles will limit the estimation
   accuracy, since the particles cannot capture the entire probability
   density function (pdf) effectively. To tackle these problems, a mutated
   PF (MPF) technique is proposed in this paper to approximate the
   posterior pdf of system states. In the MPF, a novel mutation approach is
   proposed to search extended areas of the prior pdf using mutated
   particles to make more comprehensive exploration of the posterior pdf.
   In addition, a particle selection scheme is suggested in the MPF to
   detect and process low-weight particles so as to explore the
   high-likelihood area of the posterior pdf more thoroughly. The
   effectiveness of the developed MPF technique is verified by simulation
   tests using a benchmark test model. It is implemented for predicting
   remaining useful life of batteries. Test results show that the developed
   MPF can capture a system's dynamics effectively and track system
   characteristics accurately.}},

Abstract = {{A camera-independent method of avoiding image saturation using modified
   sinusoidal fringe-pattern projection to reduce surface measurement error
   and thus accommodate variable illuminance in phase-shifting
   surface-shape measurement is presented. The maximum input gray level
   (MIGL) in the projected patterns is reduced to an optimal tradeoff
   point, below which the intensity modulation, contrast, and
   signal-to-noise ratio would diminish the advantage of further MIGL
   reduction. Measurement simulations using 31 MIGL values, from 105 to 255
   in increments of 5, demonstrated reductions in root-mean-square errors
   for ambient illuminance of 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 lx, from
   0.38, 0.56, 0.86, 1.21, 85, and 373 mm, respectively, at 255 MIGL, to
   0.31 to 0.32 mm at the optimum MIGL. The advantage of the method was
   confirmed in real measurements of a flat plate and human masks. The
   ability to perform camera-independent measurements under variable
   lighting conditions and surface reflectivity may lead to more practical
   measurements in uncontrolled environments. (C) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{Smart grid has recently emerged as the next generation of power grid due
   to its distinguished features, such as distributed energy control,
   robust to load fluctuations, and close user-grid interactions. As a
   vital component of smart grid, demand response can maintain
   supply-demand balance and reduce users' electricity bills. Furthermore,
   it is also critical to preserve user privacy and cyber security in smart
   grid. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving demand
   response (EPPDR) scheme which employs a homomorphic encryption to
   achieve privacy-preserving demand aggregation and efficient response. In
   addition, an adaptive key evolution technique is further investigated to
   ensure the users' session keys to be forward secure. Security analysis
   indicates that EPPDR can achieve privacy-preservation of electricity
   demand, forward secrecy of users' session keys, and evolution of users'
   private keys. In comparison with an existing scheme which also achieves
   forward secrecy, EPPDR has better efficiency in terms of computation and
   communication overheads and can adaptively control the key evolution to
   balance the trade-off between the communication efficiency and security
   level.}},

Abstract = {{We propose lightweight protocol for securing communication and
   preserving users' anonymity and location privacy in hybrid ad hoc
   networks. Symmetric-key-cryptography operations and payment system are
   used to secure route discovery and data transmission. To reduce the
   overhead, the payment can be secured without submitting or processing
   payment proofs (receipts). To preserve users' anonymity with low
   overhead, we develop efficient pseudonym generation and trapdoor
   techniques that do not use the resource-consuming asymmetric-key
   cryptography. Pseudonyms do not require large storage area or frequently
   contacting a central unit for refilling. Our trapdoor technique uses
   only lightweight hashing operations. This is important because trapdoors
   may be processed by a large number of nodes. Developing low-overhead
   secure and privacy-preserving protocol is a real challenge due to the
   inherent contradictions: 1) securing the protocol requires each node to
   use one authenticated identity, but a permanent identity should not be
   used for privacy preservation; and 2) the low overhead requirement
   contradicts with the large overhead usually needed for preserving
   privacy and securing the communication. Our analysis and simulation
   results demonstrate that our protocol can preserve privacy and secure
   the communication with low overhead.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless data access applications, reduction of both the access
   latency and the wireless traffic volume is essential. In this paper, we
   propose a fast wireless data access scheme (FW-DAS) for wireless data
   access applications in which data objects are frequently updated and
   fast access to data objects is indispensable. In FW-DAS, different
   operation modes are defined depending on the data object popularity, and
   only popular data objects are proactively pushed to the access
   point/base station to minimize the access latency while mitigating the
   traffic load over the wireless link. An analytical model for the access
   latency is developed and an operation mode selection algorithm is
   introduced to reduce the access latency. Extensive simulation results
   show the effects of access-to-update ratio, data popularity, cache size,
   data object size, and wireless bandwidth. Analytical and simulation
   results demonstrate that FW-DAS can reduce the access latency with
   reasonable traffic load compared with poll-each-read (PER)/callback (CB)
   and their combinations.}},

   transmission, over the call duration, in a heterogeneous wireless access
   medium. Through statistical video quality guarantee, the MT can
   determine a target video quality lower bound that can be supported for a
   target call duration. The target video quality lower bound captures the
   MT available energy at the beginning of the call, the time varying
   bandwidth availability and channel conditions at different radio
   interfaces, the target call duration, and the video packet
   characteristics in terms of distortion impact, delay deadlines, and
   video packet encoding statistics. The MT then adapts its energy
   consumption to support at least the target video quality lower bound
   during the call. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance
   of the proposed framework over two benchmarks and some performance
   trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances of green energy technologies, clean and sustainable
   energy sources have been considered as alternative energy sources for
   powering cellular networks. However, it is very challenging to exploit
   the charged energy to satisfy the QoS demands of wireless multimedia
   services due to the dynamics in the energy charging and discharging
   processes. In this article, we study how to efficiently utilize the
   green energy supply to fulfill the QoS requirements of multimedia
   services in a cellular network. Specifically, we study network
   deployment and power allocation of small cell BSs in a two-tier cellular
   network in support of high-rate multimedia services. Our objective is to
   maximize the transmission efficiency while ensuring energy
   sustainability in green cellular networks powered by green energy
   sources. For network deployment, we aim to deploy the minimum number of
   small cell BSs to meet the high throughput demands of multimedia
   services and statistically guarantee energy sustainability of wireless
   networks. In addition, a power allocation scheme with cooperative
   communication is presented to maximize throughput. It is shown that the
   network sustainability and throughput of green cellular networks can be
   significantly improved by using the proposed BS placement and power
   allocation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, indoor localization has been a topic of interest
   for both the academic and industrial communities. The need for location
   estimation, fueled mainly by inaccuracies of GPS indoors, has been
   addressed by specifically designed systems achieving a high localization
   accuracy but with a high deployment cost. Lately, dedicated systems are
   being replaced by smart-phones through intelligent use of the built-in
   sensors. For instance, an accelerometer that can detect user activity
   can be combined with a wireless radio that captures wireless signal
   strength information to locate a user. With the advent of such
   technology, a myriad of systems have been proposed in the literature
   presenting an indefinite picture to a reader as to which systems
   actually work and which do not given practical considerations. This
   article takes up the goal of surveying state-of-the-art smartphone based
   indoor localization systems with critical analysis on their properties
   such as accuracies across various sensor designs, energy consumption and
   computational cost, user satisfaction and so on, thereby providing a
   status quo of such systems.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 595 real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS)
   water surface elevations (WSE) were measured using georectified and
   nongeorectified survey systems along a 21-km-long river reach to
   evaluate vertical coordinate accuracy of a nongeorectified RTK-GPS
   acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) system. A georectified survey
   of a series of quality control benchmarks produced a vertical
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.033 m, which was considered globally
   accurate for river survey purposes. The WSE measured simultaneously at
   the same locations comparing the nongeorectified to the georectified
   system resulted in a RMSE = 0.741 m. Evaluation of intersetup precision
   of the nongeorectified WSE confirmed relative accuracy to each
   initialized arbitrary vertical datum but were found not to be globally
   accurate. Only 7\% of the nongeorectified base station setups resulted
   in RMSE less than the combined manufacturer's tolerances when compared
   to the georectified system at the same spatial locations. When vertical
   datum corrections were applied to the nongeorectified system from the
   globally accurate RTK-DGPS system, 80\% of the base station setups
   demonstrated RMSE within the combined manufacturer's tolerances. Datum
   corrections varied greatly, ranging from -2.43 to +1.80 m. This study
   demonstrates that when using nongeorectified RTK-GPS ADCP systems for
   purposes other than discharge measurement, such as in the extraction of
   bathymetry data for use in hydraulic assessments and models, great care
   must be exercised when verifying WSEs (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate uplink resource allocation for wireless
   local area network and cellular network interworking to provide
   multi-homing voice and data services. The problem is formulated based on
   the physical layer and medium access control layer technologies of the
   two networks to ensure that the resource allocation decisions are
   feasible and can be executed at the lower layers. Furthermore, to
   efficiently utilize users' equipment (UEs) battery power, the power
   distribution among multiple network interfaces of the UEs is included in
   the problem formulation. The optimal resource allocation problem is a
   multiple time-scaleMarkov decision process (MMDP) as the two networks
   operate at different time-scales and due to voice and data service
   requirements. We derive decision policies for the upper and the lower
   levels of the MMDP by decomposing each resource allocation problem over
   multiple time slots to a set of resource allocation problems for
   individual time slots and solving the resource allocation problems
   corresponding to individual time slots using convex optimization
   techniques. To reduce the time complexity, we further propose a
   heuristic resource allocation algorithm by deriving the decision
   policies based on a single system state. The system state consists of
   average square channel gains for dual variable calculation and
   instantaneous channel gains for resource allocation based on the
   calculated dual variables. Simulation results demonstrate the achievable
   throughput and service quality improvements by employing these two
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy was investigated as a

   viable and dead cells, recombinant protein, glucose, and ammonia
   concentrations for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells during cultivation.
   For the purpose of calibrating the fluorescence-based empirical model,
   cells were grown in batch mode with different initial glucose and
   glutamine concentrations. Spectrofluorometer settings were optimized to
   ensure reproducibility and accuracy of the acquired spectra. With the
   purpose of gaining qualitative insight into the evolution of the
   spectra, the trajectories of individual fluorophore peaks were studied
   during the cultivation process. Spectral changes related to biomass and
   secreted proteins were investigated by comparing the spectra at various
   stages during the downstream processing. A partial least square
   regression (PLSR) was used to formulate empirical models that related
   the input data set, i.e., the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix,
   to the actual state of the system including viable cell and dead cells

Abstract = {{Entropy production in pipeline adiabatic flow of water-in-oil emulsions
   is investigated experimentally in three different diameter pipes. The
   dispersed-phase (water droplets) concentration of emulsion is varied
   from 0 to 41\% vol. The entropy production rates in emulsion flow are
   compared with the values expected in single-phase flow of Newtonian
   fluids with the same properties (viscosity and density). While in the
   laminar regime the entropy production rates in emulsion flow can be
   described adequately by the single-phase Newtonian equations, a
   significant deviation from single-phase flow behavior is observed in the
   turbulent regime. In the turbulent regime, the entropy production rates
   in emulsion flow are found to be substantially smaller than those
   expected on the basis of single-phase equations. For example, the
   entropy production rate in water-in-oil emulsion flow at a
   dispersed-phase volume fraction of 0.41 is only 38.4\% of that observed
   in flow of a single-phase Newtonian fluid with the same viscosity and
   density, when comparison is made at a Reynolds number of 4000. Thus
   emulsion flow in pipelines is more efficient thermodynamically than
   single-phase Newtonian flow.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal issues have become critical roadblocks for achieving highly
   reliable three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs). The presence
   of process variations further exacerbates these problems. In this
   article, we propose techniques for the efficient evaluation and
   mitigation of the impact of leakage power variations on the temperature
   profile of 3D Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). Experimental results
   demonstrate that, due to the impact of process variations, a 4-tier 3D
   implementation can be more than 40 degrees C hotter and 23\% leakier
   than its 2D counterpart. To determine the maximum temperature of each
   fabricated 3D IC, we propose an accurate learning-based model for peak
   temperature prediction. Based on the learning model, we then propose two
   post-fabrication techniques to increase the thermal yield of 3D CMPs:
   (1) tier restacking and (2) thermally-aware die matching. Experimental
   results show that: (1) the proposed prediction model achieves more than
   98\% accuracy, and (2) the proposed thermally-aware, post-fabrication
   optimization techniques significantly improve the thermal yield from

Abstract = {{In this work, a structured verified nonlinear mathematical model for a
   single continuous fermenter of bioethanol production using Zymomonas
   mobiliz is developed to investigate the effect of the feed substrate
   concentration, which is taken as the main bifurcation parameter for
   performing a bifurcation analysis. The chaotic, oscillatory, and
   steady-state behaviors of the fermentation system are investigated. It
   is found that the system is dominated by oscillatory behavior in the
   medium gravity (MG) region (80.76 < C-so < 213.6), while it is dominated
   by stable steady state outside this range; however, at high C-so and low
   dilution rate, the chaotic behavior dominates the system. It is found
   that the fermentation system accomplishes the maximum averages of
   substrate conversion and bioethanol yield in the range of 80.76 < C-so <
   97 g/L. These results are in agreement with the experimental results in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Failure dependent protection (FDP) is known to achieve optimal capacity
   efficiency among all types of protection, at the expense of longer
   recovery time and more complicated signaling overhead. This particularly
   hinders the usage of FDP in all-optical mesh networks. As a remedy, this
   paper investigates a new restoration framework that enables all-optical
   fault management and device configuration via state-of-the-art failure
   localization techniques, such as the FDP restoration process. It can be
   implemented without relying on any control plane signaling. With the
   proposed restoration framework, a novel spare capacity allocation
   problem is defined and is further analyzed on circulant topologies for
   any single link failure, aiming to gain a solid understanding of the
   problem. By allowing reuse of monitoring resources for restoration
   capacity, we are particularly interested in the monitoring resource
   hidden property, where less or even no monitoring resources are consumed
   as more working traffic is in place. To deal with general topologies, we
   introduce a novel heuristic approach to the proposed spare capacity
   allocation problem, which comprises a generic FDP survivable routing
   scheme followed by a novel monitoring resource allocation method.
   Extensive simulation is conducted to examine the proposed scheme and
   verify the proposed restoration framework.}},

Abstract = {{A new video standard called High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) has been
   recently finalized. In comparison with the H. 264/AVC video coding
   standard, HEVC further improves the video coding rate distortion (RD)
   performance, but at the price of significant increase in its encoding
   complexity, especially in its motion estimation (ME) due to large block
   sizes and complicated block partition. To reduce the ME complexity in
   HEVC while maintaining its RD performance, in this paper we first
   formulate ME at the integer pixel level as a statistical inference
   problem and then propose a confidence interval-based ME (CIME) method.
   The proposed CIME method can be applied either on top of the existing
   fast search implemented in HEVC or on its own to replace the existing
   fast search implemented in HEVC. Experiments show that for the low-delay
   main test configuration of HEVC: 1) when applied on top of the existing
   fast search in HEVC, the proposed CIME method further reduces, on
   average, the integer-level ME time by 70\% with only 1.0\% increase in
   bit rate while maintaining the same reconstruction quality in PSNR and
   2) when applied on its own to replace the existing fast search
   implemented in HEVC, the proposed CIME method achieves performance
   comparable with that of the fast search in HEVC reference software and
   better than that of the dynamic system fast algorithm proposed recently
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the possibility of energy harvesting from
   fluid flow through a turbine hosting ionic polymer metal composites
   (IPMCs). Specifically, IPMC harvesters are embedded in the blades of a
   small-scale vertical axis water turbine to convert flow kinetics into
   electrical power via low-frequency flow-induced IPMC deformations. An
   in-house fabricated Savonius-Darrieus hybrid active turbine with three
   IPMCs is tested in a laboratory water tunnel to estimate the energy
   harvesting capabilities of the device as a function of the shunting
   electrical load. The turbine is shown to harvest a few nanowatt from a
   mean flow of 0.43 m s(-1) for shunting resistances in the range 100-1000
   Omega. To establish a first understanding of the energy harvesting
   device, we propose a quasi-static hydroelastic model for the bending of
   the IPMCs and we utilize a black-box model to study their
   electromechanical response.}},

Abstract = {{A weak polyelectrolyte, poly{[}2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]
   (PDMAEMA), was grafted onto the surface of cellulose nanocrystals via
   free radical polymerization. The resultant suspension of
   PDMAEMA-grafted-cellulose nanocrystals (PDMAEMA-g-CNC) possessed
   pH-responsive properties. The grafting was confirmed by FTIR,
   potentiometric titration, elementary analysis, and thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA); the surface and interfacial properties of the modified
   particles were characterized by surface tensiometer. Compared to
   pristine cellulose nanocrystals, modified CNC significantly reduced the
   surface and interfacial tensions. Stable heptane-in-water and
   toluene-in-water emulsions were prepared with PDMAEMA-g-CNC. Various
   factors, such as polarity of solvents, concentration of particles,
   electrolytes, and pH, on the properties of the emulsions were
   investigated. Using Nile Red as a florescence probe, the stability of
   the emulsions as a function of pH and temperature was elucidated. It was
   deduced that PDMAEMA chains promoted the stability of emulsion droplets
   and their chain conformation varied with pH and temperature to trigger
   the emulsification and demulsification of oil droplets. Interestingly,
   for heptane system, the macroscopic colors varied depending on the pH
   condition, while the color of the toluene system remained the same.
   Reversible emulsion systems that responded to pH were observed and a
   thermoresponsive Pickering emulsion system was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{For an engaging human-machine interaction, machines need to be equipped
   with affective communication abilities. Such abilities enable
   interactive machines to recognize the affective expressions of their
   users, and respond appropriately through different modalities including
   movement. This paper focuses on bodily expressions of affect, and
   presents a new computational model for affective movement recognition,
   robust to kinematic, interpersonal, and stochastic variations in
   affective movements. The proposed approach derives a stochastic model of
   the affective movement dynamics using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The
   resulting HMMs are then used to derive a Fisher score representation of
   the movements, which is subsequently used to optimize affective movement
   recognition using support vector machine classification. In addition,
   this paper presents an approach to obtain a minimal discriminative
   representation of the movements using supervised principal component
   analysis (SPCA) that is based on Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion
   in the Fisher score space. The dimensions of the resulting SPCA subspace
   consist of intrinsic movement features salient to affective movement
   recognition. These salient features enable a low-dimensional encoding of
   observed movements during a human-machine interaction, which can be used
   to recognize and analyze human affect that is displayed through
   movement. The efficacy of the proposed approach in recognizing affective
   movements and identifying a minimal discriminative movement

Abstract = {{The development of unique, reliable, and scalable synthesis strategies
   for producing heteroatom-doped nanostructured carbon materials with
   improved activity toward the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) occurring in metal-air batteries and fuel cells presents an
   intriguing technological challenge in the field of catalysis. Herein, we
   prepare unique graphene-carbon nanotube composites (GC) doped
   sequentially with both nitrogen and sulfur (GC-NLS) and subject them to
   extensive physicochemical characterization and electrochemical
   evaluation toward the ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. GC-NLS provides
   ORR onset potential increases of SO and 70 mV in comparison to those of
   dual-doped individual graphene and carbon nanotubes, respectively. This
   highlights the significant synergistic effects that arise because of the
   nanocomposite arrangement, consisting of highly graphitized carbon
   nanotubes assembled on the surface of graphene sheets. The addition of
   sulfur as a co-dopant is also highly beneficial, providing an 80 mV
   increase in the ORR onset potential in comparison to that of GC
   nanocomposites doped with only nitrogen. Excellent electrochemical
   stability of GC-NLS is also observed through 5000 electrode potential
   cycles, indicating the promising potential of this new class of
   dual-doped GC nanocomposites as ORR catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on obtaining optimal mechanical properties of

   are useful in designing products where quality of the nanocomposite
   cannot be compromised (while the cost of the PP-OMMT is secondary). The
   properties that were optimized include Young's modulus and oxygen
   permeation. Regression models were obtained and used to predict these
   properties as functions of corresponding compositions of the composites.
   Further, optimization procedures were simulated using these models along
   with other constraints and objective functions. All simulations were
   programmed using MATLAB version 7.10.0 (R2010a).}},

Volume = {{225}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In micromechanics of quasi-static deformation of granular materials,
   relationships are investigated between the macro-scale,
   continuum-mechanical characteristics, and the micro-scale
   characteristics at the particle and interparticle contact level. An
   important micromechanical quantity is the fabric tensor that reflects
   the distribution of contact orientations. It also contains information
   on the coordination number, i.e. the average number of contacts per
   particle. Here, the focus is on characteristics of the critical state in
   the two-dimensional case. Critical state soil mechanics is reviewed from
   the micromechanical viewpoint. Two-dimensional discrete element method
   (DEM) simulations have been performed with discs from a fairly narrow
   particle-size distribution. Various values for the interparticle
   friction coefficient and for the confining pressure have been considered
   to investigate the effect of these quantities on critical state
   characteristics (shear strength, packing fraction, coordination number
   and fabric anisotropy). Results from these DEM simulations show that a
   limiting fabric state exists at the critical state, which is geometrical
   in origin. The contact network tessellates the assembly into loops that
   are formed by contacts. For each loop, a symmetrical loop tensor is
   defined, based on its contact normals. This loop tensor reflects the
   shape of the loop. An orientation is associated with each loop, based on
   its loop tensor. At the critical state, the frequencies with which loops
   with different number of sides occur depend on the coordination number.
   At the critical state, these loops have, on average, the following
   universal characteristics, i.e. independent of the coordination number:
   (1) loops with the same number of sides and orientation have identical
   anisotropy of the loop tensor, (2) the anisotropy of the loop tensor
   depends linearly on the number of sides of the loop, (3) the
   distribution of loop orientations is identical, (4) Lewis's law for the
   loop areas, which is a linear relation between the number of sides of
   loops and their area, is satisfied (not exclusively at the critical
   state) and (5) the areas of the loops do not depend on their
   orientation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces clockless stochastic decoding for high-throughput
   low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders. Stochastic computation
   provides ultra-low-complexity hardware using simple logic gates.
   Clockless decoding eliminates global clocking, which eases the
   worst-case timing restrictions of synchronous stochastic decoders. The
   lack of synchronization might use outdated bits to update outputs in
   computation nodes; however, it does not significantly affect output
   probabilities. A timing model of clockless-computation behaviours under
   a 90 nm CMOS technology is used to simulate the BER performance of the
   proposed decoding scheme. Based on our models, the proposed decoding
   scheme significantly reduces error floors due to the ``lock-up{''}
   problem and achieves superior BER performance compared with conventional
   synchronous stochastic decoders. The timing model includes metastability
   to verify the affect on BER performance.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{215-226}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The annealing behavior of a laminated AA3xxx-AA6xxx alloy system is
   investigated at temperatures and conditions which represent fine
   particle presence or dissolution in the AA6xxx (i.e. core) layer, as
   well as 60 or 80\% cold reduction levels. The through-thickness
   microstructural characteristics of the cold rolled and annealed
   laminates are analyzed using various methods. It is found that the
   average grain size of the AA3xxx (i.e. clad) layer is generally finer
   than that of the core layer and the grains are more equiaxed in that
   layer for all conditions studied. The annealed microstructure of the
   core layer is also more strongly affected by the change in the annealing
   conditions. The dependencies of the average grain size and grain size
   aspect ratio on the annealing conditions are dictated by the presence,
   size, distribution and thermal stability of particles. A higher level of
   cold reduction results in reversing the trend of change in the grain
   size aspect ratios of both layers with annealing temperature in the
   range of 380 to 420 degrees C (1 h), while it yields characteristics
   similar to that obtained by 60\% reduction when annealing is conducted
   for 30 s at 540 degrees C. These results are explained through the
   microstructural evolution parameters that are affected by cold rolling
   and annealing conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An energy harvesting system designed in this paper is of electromagnetic
   linear-motion inertial type that is capable of converting kinetic energy
   into useful electrical energy. The harvester consists of moving
   magnet-iron poles enclosed by cylindrical coils and an iron stator, and
   two stationary magnets are placed at both end sides acting as spring.
   The developed energy harvester is to be used for outdoor power equipment
   such as lawnmower and snow blower. Preliminary vibrational analysis is
   conducted on the lawnmower and snow blower to determine its working
   frequency and the optimal point of vibration. It was determined that the
   lawnmower resonated at a frequency of 15 Hz while the snow blower
   resonated at 21 Hz. Two methods are used to tune the energy harvesting
   system. The first is changing the stationary magnet thickness while
   keeping the magnet air gap constant and second is changing the air gap
   while keeping the stationary magnet thickness constant. We found that it
   is optimal to change the air gap rather than the magnet thickness to
   change the natural frequency of the device. The energy harvesting system
   is tuned to work on a lawnmower where the natural frequency is 15 Hz.
   Natural frequency of 15 Hz is obtained when the magnet thickness is
   9.525 mm and a gap of 70.75 mm, where the maximum power dissipated is 29
   mW.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, formulation, and performance
   optimization of a new hybrid electromagnetic damper in response to the
   demand for a tunable, regenerative and fail-safe damping device for
   various applications. Damping in a multitude of engineering applications
   has a variable threshold requirement based on system excitation. Since
   system excitation is also variable; dampers are such that an adequate
   amount of damping is provided, opposed to an optimal amount as a
   function of excitation. In this research it was shown that, by
   implementing a hybrid damper design based on a bias component provided
   through a hydraulic medium and a variable component provided by
   electromagnetics, an optimal damping quantity can be obtained for a
   given excitation. The produced damping force and electrical power were
   formulated based on the structure's geometry and input displacement. The
   presented design was optimized for a scooter scaled application and it
   was shown that the damping and regenerative characteristics can be
   adjusted for different requirements. Furthermore, it was illustrated
   that this design has the potential to be scaled for other applications
   as well.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a cost-efficient nanopatterning
   technology because of its promising advantages of high throughput and
   high resolution. However, accurate multilevel overlay capability of NIL
   required for integrated circuit manufacturing remains a challenge due to
   the high cost of achieving mechanical alignment precision. Although
   self-aligned imprint lithography was developed to avoid the need of
   alignment for the vertical layered structures, it has limited usage in
   the manufacture of the coplanar structures, such as integrated plasmonic
   devices. In this paper, we develop a new process of planar
   self-alignment imprint lithography (P-SAIL) to fabricate the metallic
   and dielectric structures on the same plane. P-SAIL transfers the
   multilevel imprint processes to a single-imprint process which offers
   higher efficiency and less cost than existing manufacturing methods.
   Such concept is demonstrated in an example of fabricating planar
   plasmonic structures consisting of different materials.}},

   nm and length up to 2.2 mu m. A diameter to pitch ratio of similar to
   68\% was achieved. We also measured the reflectance from the nanowire
   arrays and show experimentally diameter-dependent strong absorption
   peaks resulting from resonant optical mode excitations within these
   nanowires. The reflectance curves match very well with simulations. The

Abstract = {{Large-scale production of strontium hexaferrite (SrFe12O19) particles

   amount on the formation, morphology and magnetic properties of SrFe12O19
   particles were investigated. The resultant particles were characterized
   by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
   X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and vibrating sample
   magnetometer. Single-phase SrFe12O19 particles, with particle sizes of
   0.8-1.2 mu m, were obtained from the precursor (with a Fe3+/Sr2+ molar
   ratio of 10) being calcined at 950 degrees C for 2 h using the mass
   ratio (NaCl to precursor) of 0.3. The saturation magnetization, remanent
   magnetization and coercivity were about 62 emu/g, 37 emu/g, and 4310 Oe,
   respectively. A comparison of the products obtained at different
   preparation-scales was also done. The results showed that it was easier
   to control the particle morphology using molten salt synthesis and more
   economical on a large-scale production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study compares formal Bayesian inference to the informal

   uncertainty-based calibration of rainfall-runoff models in a
   multi-criteria context. Bayesian inference is accomplished through
   Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling based on an auto-regressive
   multi-criteria likelihood formulation. Non-converged MCMC sampling is
   also considered as an alternative method. These methods are compared
   along multiple comparative measures calculated over the calibration and
   validation periods of two case studies. Results demonstrate that there
   can be considerable differences in hydrograph prediction intervals
   generated by formal and informal strategies for uncertainty-based
   multi-criteria calibration. Also, the formal approach generates
   definitely preferable validation period results compared to GLUE (i.e.,
   tighter prediction intervals that show higher reliability) considering
   identical computational budgets. Moreover, non-converged MCMC (based on
   the standard Gelman-Rubin metric) performance is reasonably consistent
   with those given by a formal and fully-converged Bayesian approach even
   though fully-converged results requires significantly larger number of
   samples (model evaluations) for the two case studies. Therefore,
   research to define alternative and more practical convergence criteria
   for MCMC applications to computationally intensive hydrologic models may
   be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The contract negotiation that led to the 1969 agreement between
   Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec, is systemically analyzed within
   the framework of Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. The Great Canadian
   Hydroelectric Power Conflict has been ongoing since 1963 and shows no
   signs of ending. In this dispute, the Province of Quebec has the right
   to buy almost all of the power generated from the Upper Churchill Falls,
   which is located in the Labrador territory in Newfoundland and Labrador,
   at a very low price. Originally, the contract was signed by Churchill
   Falls Labrador Corporation to secure finances for the Upper Churchill
   Falls development. The unpopularity of the contract led to several
   unsuccessful attempts by the Newfoundland and Labrador Government to
   escape its provisions. Newfoundland and Labrador is currently
   negotiating to develop the Lower Churchill Project and seeking to avoid
   the mistakes of the first contract. Furthermore, the automatic renewal
   clause of the original contract is expected to cause another round of
   conflict in 2016. The analysis shows that, given the circumstances in
   which the agreement was signed, the outcome was almost inevitable. A
   third party intervener rule could have remediated the damage caused by
   the conflict. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{85-96}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The segmentation of objects has been an area of interest in numerous
   fields. The use of texture has been explored to improve convergence in
   the presence of cluttered backgrounds or objects with distinct textures,
   where intensity variations are insufficient. Additionally, saliency and
   feature maps have been applied for contour initialization. However,
   taking advantage of texture to improve initialization and convergence
   has not been extensively explored. To address this, we propose a hybrid
   structural and texture distinctiveness vector field convolution (STVFC)
   approach, where both the structural characteristics and the concept of
   texture distinctiveness are incorporated into a multi-functional vector
   field convolution (VFC) model. In this novel approach, texture
   distinctiveness is used to enable automatic initialization and is
   incorporated with intensity variation to improve and accelerate
   convergence towards the object boundary. Experiments using three
   datasets, containing natural images and Brodatz textures, demonstrated
   that STVFC achieved better or comparable segmentation accuracy. (C) 2014

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{A new method based on the wavenumber space integration algorithm is
   proposed in order to obtain mode count and modal density of circular
   cylindrical shells. Instead of the simplified equation of motion, the
   exact equation is applied in mode count calculations. Modal plots are
   changed significantly in the k-space when using the exact equation. Mode
   repetition in cylindrical shells is represented by additional mode count
   curves in the k-space. On the other hand, a novel technique is presented
   in order to implement boundary condition effects in mode count and modal
   density calculations. Integrating these two significant corrections, a
   modified wavenumber space integration (MWSI) method is developed. Mode
   count and modal densities of three shells with different geometrical and
   acoustical properties are obtained using the MWSI method and
   conventional WSI. Results are verified using the exact mode count
   calculations. Moreover, effects of geometrical properties are studied on
   mode count plots in the k-space. Modal densities are obtained for
   cylindrical shells of different lengths, radii, and thicknesses.
   Finally, modal densities of cylindrical shells are compared to flat
   plates of the same size and boundary condition. Interesting results are
   obtained which will contribute in calculation of acoustic radiation
   efficiency and sound transmission in cylindrical shells.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical species tomography based on line-of-sight attenuation
   (LOSA-CST) is an emerging diagnostic for mapping the concentration of a
   gaseous species. Since laser absorption measurements alone are
   insufficient to specify a unique species concentration distribution,
   reconstructioii algorithms must incorporate additional information that
   promotes presumed physical attributes of the distribution. This paper
   pioneers the application of the level set method to LOSA-CST. The
   species concentration distribution is initially represented by a signed
   distance function, which is progressively deformed by forces that scale
   with the difference between the measured and simulated absorption data,
   as well as deviation from spatial smoothness. The final distribution
   explains the LOSA data and is also qualitatively consistent with mixed
   advection/diffusion transport physics. The algorithm is demonstrated by
   solving a simulated laser tomography experiment on a turbulent methane
   plume. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aluminum particles were successfully sprayed on wrought magnesium AZ31B
   extrusion using the cold spray technology. Cold spray high impact
   velocity of particles colliding with the substrate induced beneficial
   compressive residual stresses. Magnitude of the residual stress at the
   surface and its distribution through the thickness were measured using
   X-ray diffraction. With particle spraying velocity of 400 m/s, the
   residual stress was measured to be -25 MPa at the surface. The process
   of collision and development of residual stress was then modeled using
   LS-DYNA software to study the effect of the cold spray process
   parameters on the residual stress profile. Various models were employed
   to simulate the impact of the single and multiple particles. An
   asymmetric material model that considers the strain rate effect was
   employed to model AZ31B different behavior in tension and compression.
   Results of simulations for impact of multiple particles were compared
   with the results of XRD measurements on the substrate surface and
   through the depth of the substrate. After the validation of the models,
   a parametric study was performed on the impact of a single particle to
   find the optimum cold spray particle velocity, size, shape, incident
   angle, and friction parameters. Parameters leading to the optimum
   residual stress profile are introduced herein. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present study applies different time-series models for forecasting
   daily and monthly snow water equivalent (SWE) data in Ontario, Canada,
   during 1987-2011. For daily time series, which showed a significant
   negative trend, four categories of the autoregressive moving-average
   (ARMA) and ARMA model with exogenous variables (ARMAX) were applied. The
   North Atlantic Oscillation, Southern Oscillation Index and Pacific/North
   American Pattern, as large-scale atmospheric anomalies, as well as
   temperature time series are considered as exogenous variables for ARMAX
   models. According to the multicriteria performance evaluation, a
   time-trend ARMAX model demonstrated the best performance for modelling
   and forecasting daily SWE. Two models, seasonal autoregressive
   integrated moving average (SARIMA) and SARIMA with exogenous variables
   (SARIMAX), were also fitted to the monthly SWE time series. The results
   revealed that the SARIMAX model showed a better performance than the
   SARIMA model according to multicriteria evaluation. The three
   nonparametric tests, Wilcoxon, Levene and Kolmogorov-Smirnov for
   forecasting evaluation demonstrated that the selected time-series models
   had enough reliability for short-term SWE forecasting in Ontario. The
   results of this study also demonstrate the importance of incorporating
   both trend and appropriate exogenous variables for SWE time-series
   modelling and forecasting. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Cluster-based wireless sensor network (WSN) can significantly reduce the
   energy consumption by data aggregation and has been widely used in WSN
   applications. However, due to the intrinsic many-to-one traffic pattern
   in WSN, the network lifetime is generally deteriorated by the unbalanced
   energy consumption in a cluster-based WSN. Therefore, energy efficiency
   and network lifetime improvement are two crucial and challenging issues
   in cluster-based WSNs. In this paper, we propose a Non-Uniform Node
   Distribution (NUND) scheme to improve the energy efficiency and network
   lifetime in cluster-based WSNs. Specifically, we first propose an
   analytic model to analyze the energy consumption and the network
   lifetime of the cluster-based WSNs. Based on the analysis results, we
   propose a node distribution algorithm to maximize the network lifetime
   with a fixed number of sensor nodes in cluster-based WSNs. Extensive
   simulations demonstrate that the theoretical analysis results determined
   by the proposed analytic model are consistent with the simulation
   results, and the NUND can significantly improve the energy efficiency
   and network lifetime.}},

Title = {{The effect of milling energy input during mechano-chemical activation

Abstract = {{A manganese borohydride, Mn(BH4)(2), co-existing with a nanocrystalline
   LiCl salt, which is a reaction ``dead-weight{''} byproduct, was
   successfully synthesized by the mechano-chemical activation synthesis
   (MCAS) during ball milling the (nLiBH(4) + MnCl2) mixtures having the
   molar ratios n = 2 and 3, using the total milling energy input, Q(TR),
   from 36.4 to 364 kJ/g. The crystallite (grain) size of the synthesized
   nanocrystalline Mn(BH4)(2) hydride attains 21 +/- 5.0 nm for the energy
   input Q(TR) = 36.4 kJ/g and then it is further reduced to 18 +/- 1.0 nm
   for Q(TR) = 145.6 kJ/g and finally to 14 +/- 0.5 nm for Q(TR) = 364
   kJ/g. The crystallite (grain) size of LiCl is very close to 30 nm
   regardless of the milling energy input, Q(TR). During continuous heating
   in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), Mn(BH4)(2) decomposes in
   endothermic reaction releasing H-2 and forming amorphous Mn and B in the
   process. The synthesized nanocrystalline Mn(BH4)(2) hydride, co-existing
   with a nanocrystalline LiCl salt, is capable of desorbing up to similar
   to 4.5 wt.\% at 100 degrees C. The values of the apparent activation
   energy for dehydrogenation obtained in the present work are very low.
   The apparent activation energy for the n = 3 nanocomposite decreases
   monotonically from similar to 70 to similar to 59 kJ/mol with increasing
   milling energy input whereas the apparent activation energy for the n =
   2 nanocomposite decreases from about 65 kJ/mol for Q(TR) = 36.4 kJ/g to
   about 53 kJ/mol for Q(TR) = 145.6 kJ/g and then again increases to
   similar to 59 kJ/mol for the Q(TR) = 364 kJ/g. These changes closely
   follow the variations in the average powder particle size obtained with
   the varying milling energy input. For the milling energy input Q(TR) =
   36.4 and 145.6 kJ/g the average powder particle size decreases to 14.9
   +/- 6.6 and 7.5 +/- 2.6 mu m, respectively, and subsequently increases
   reaching the average size of 16.1 +/- 6.3 mu m for the milling energy
   input Q(TR) = 364 kJ/g. On the other hand, the apparent activation
   energy for dehydrogenation doesn't depend on the average crystallite
   (grain) size. The amorphous Mn and B elements are also formed after
   isothermal dehydrogenation. The synthesized Mn(BH4)(2) hydride is very
   stable and doesn't excessively release H-2 during a long-term storage at
   room temperature for over 120 days under a slight overpressure of argon.

Abstract = {{Sulfur-doped graphene (SG) is prepared by a thermal shock/quench anneal
   process and investigated as a unique Pt nanoparticle support (Pt/SG) for
   the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Particularly, SG is found to induce
   highly favorable catalyst-support interactions, resulting in excellent
   half-cell based ORR activity of 139 mA mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9 V vs RHE,
   significant improvements over commercial Pt/C (121 mA mg(Pt)(-1)) and
   Pt-graphene (Pt/G, 101 mA mg(Pt)(-1)). Pt/SG also demonstrates
   unprecedented stability, maintaining 87\% of its electrochemically
   active surface area following accelerated degradation testing.
   Furthermore, a majority of ORR activity is maintained, providing 108 mA
   mg(Pt)(-1), a remarkable 171\% improvement over Pt/C (39.8 mA
   mg(Pt)(-1)) and an 89\% improvement over Pt/G (57.0 mA mg(Pt)(-1)).
   Computational simulations highlight that the interactions between Pt and
   graphene are enhanced significantly by sulfur doping, leading to a
   tethering effect that can explain the outstanding electrochemical
   stability. Furthermore, sulfur dopants result in a downshift of the
   platinum d-band center, explaining the excellent ORR activity and
   rendering SG as a new and highly promising class of catalyst supports
   for electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells.}},

   two strippers (each 10.4 m in diameter with 16 m of height); the plant
   has been designed to achieve 87\% CO2 recovery at 95\% CO2 purity. A
   dynamic mechanistic model of a commercial-scale CO2 capture plant with a
   control scheme was developed in gPROMS and evaluated under several
   scenarios. The analysis revealed that this plant is able to reject
   various disturbances and switch between different operating points

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of gas-assisted
   gravity drainage (GAGD) performance while taking into account the
   effects of asphaltene deposition. The experiments were conducted at high
   pressures and high temperature (15-37 MPa and 102 degrees C) using
   carbonate cores and real reservoir fluids in the absence of water
   saturation. An 85\% methane-enriched hydrocarbon gas mixture was
   employed as an injection fluid in the laboratory runs. The final
   recovery factor for a fairly tall core was 52\% of the original oil at
   immiscible conditions during hydrocarbon gas injection when the
   operating pressure and the amount of injected gas were 28.3 MPa and 1.2
   pore volume, respectively. In all of the experiments, the total amount
   of asphaltene deposition was less than 2 wt \% of the original oil and
   no considerable reduction in permeability was found. A numerical
   two-phase (gas-oil) simulator coupled with a deposition model was also
   developed to evaluate the importance of different parameters
   contributing to the final recovery. There was a good agreement between
   the modeling and experimental results, showing an average error
   percentage lower than 5\%. This study can aid the prediction of the
   performance of gas injection processes experiencing asphaltene
   deposition and also aid in proper design of gravity drainage-assisted
   enhanced oil recovery methods.}},

Abstract = {{Disposable rocking bioreactors (RBs) are widely employed for cultivation
   of recombinant mammalian and insect cell lines, although the perception
   of inadequate mass transfer has prevented their application to
   bioprocesses based on microbial platforms. In this study,
   one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) RBs were assessed and
   compared with the conventional stirred tank reactor (STR) for
   recombinant therapeutic protein production in Escherichia coll. The
   comparison involved: (1) physical characterization of oxygen mass
   transfer efficiency and mixing intensity, (2) growth characteristics in
   batch cultivation, and (3) culture performance for the production of
   recombinant protein. Our results show that oxygen mass transfer was
   comparable between the 1D RB and STR at low working volume (WV),
   declining linearly with increasing WV, and was highest in the 2D RB for
   all tested WVs with the maximum mass transfer coefficient (kLa) at 3 L
   WV. Well mixing behavior was observed in all three systems for water and
   aqueous carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions. Batch growth
   characteristics were similar in all bioreactor systems, although
   metabolite accumulation was significant in the I D RB. Culture
   performance for the production of recombinant GST-hCD83ext (glutathione
   S-transferase-hCD83ext fusion protein) was similar in terms of soluble
   protein yield and inclusion body formation for all bioreactor systems.

Abstract = {{In this study, we report on a novel potential-responsive hybrid film
   system for heavy metal removal, which was composed of a layered
   a-zirconium phosphate (alpha-ZrP) nanosheet and a conducting polyaniline
   (PANI)-intercalated chain that functioned as a proton pumping element.
   The proposed system features a quick responsive uptake/release rate that
   was about 10 times the adsorption/desorption rate with an open circuit.
   The potential-responsive film system exhibited a high electroactivity
   because of an acidic micro-environment for the nitrogen atoms in the
   PANI chains due to protons available on the electronegative alpha-ZrP
   nanosheets and their ion exchangeability. The uniform and dense hybrid
   film was formed on platinum electrodes using a one-step electrosynthesis
   based on unipolar pulse electrodeposition (UPED). By simply switching
   the operating potential applied to the electrode, heavy metal uptake
   onto the film from aqueous solutions and metal release for film
   regeneration were accomplished. This film system is shown to be a
   promising alternative to conventional techniques for heavy metal capture
   from wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) is shown to
   significantly depend on the roughness of the indium tin oxide (ITO)
   anode. By using rougher ITO, light trapped in the ITO/organic
   wave-guided mode can be efficiently extracted, and a light outcoupling
   enhancement as high as 40\% is achieved. Moreover, contrary to
   expectations, the lifetime of OLEDs is not affected by ITO roughness.
   Finally, an OLED employing rough ITO anode that exhibits a current
   efficiency of 56 cd/A at the remarkably high brightness of 10(5) cd/m(2)
   is obtained. This represents the highest current efficiency at such high
   brightness to date for an OLED utilizing an ITO anode, without any
   external light outcoupling techniques. The results demonstrate the
   significant efficiency benefits of using ITO with higher roughness in
   OLEDs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoresis is an integral part of many molecular diagnostics
   protocols and an inexpensive implementation would greatly facilitate
   point-of-care (POC) applications. However, the high instrumentation cost
   presents a substantial barrier, much of it associated with fluorescence
   detection. The cost of such systems could be substantially reduced by
   placing the fluidic channel and photodiode directly above the detector
   in order to collect a larger portion of the fluorescent light. In
   future, this could be achieved through the integration and monolithic
   fabrication of photoresist microchannels on complementary metal-oxide
   semiconductor microelectronics (CMOS). However, the development of such
   a device is expensive due to high non-recurring engineering costs. To
   facilitate that development, we present a system that utilises an
   optical relay to integrate low-cost polymeric microfluidics with a CMOS
   chip that provides a photodiode, analog-digital conversion and a
   standard serial communication interface. This system embodies an
   intermediate level of microelectronic integration, and significantly
   decreases development costs. With a limit of detection of 13 +/- 0.4 nM
   of fluorescently end-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), it is suitable
   for diagnostic applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydride nanocomposites in the (LiNH2 + nMgH(2)) system have been
   synthesized by ball milling with varying input of milling energy
   injected into powder particles, Q(TR) (kJ/g). The grain (crystallite)
   size of LiNH2 and MgH2 decreases rapidly with increasing Q(TR) up to
   approximately 150-200 kJ/g and subsequently more or less saturates at
   the value of 10-20 nm. For the injected energy Q(TR) approximate to
   250-350 kJ/g the specific surface area (SSA) increases from the initial
   2.4 m(2)/g for powder mixtures before milling to 30-37 m(2)/g for
   nanocomposites after milling. After injecting Q(TR) approximate to 550
   kJ/g there is a further increase of SSA to 52 m(2)/g which is over
   20-fold increase of SSA from its initial value. That clearly indicates
   that a profound reduction of particle size has occurred. The hydride
   phases formed during ball milling with relatively low Q(TR) are
   identified as a-Mg(NH2)(2) (amorphous magnesium imide) and LiH. The ball
   milled (LiNH2 + nMgH(2)) nanocomposite system with n = 0.5-0.9 can
   effectively desorb about 4-5 wt.\% H-2 with a reasonable rate at the
   temperature range close to similar to 200 degrees C. Within a low
   temperature range up to 250 degrees C, regardless of the molar ratio n
   and the injected energy Q(TR) the thermal desorption of the (LiNH2 +
   nMgH(2)) nanocomposites occurs without any release of ammonia, NH3. For
   all molar ratios, n, the hydride nanocomposites are fully reversible at
   175 degrees C under a relatively mild pressure of 50 bar H-2. The
   quantity of H-2 desorbed decreases with increasing molar ratio n, due to
   increasing fraction of inactive, retained MgH2. However, at 125 degrees
   C the dehydrogenation rate is very sluggish and the quantity of released
   H-2 is minimal. At the temperature range lower than similar to 250
   degrees C dehydrogenation of ball milled nanocomposites occurs through
   formation of the Li2Mg(NH)(2) hydride phase. The value of the measured
   dehydrogenation enthalpy change of 46.7 kJ/molH(2) is relatively low and
   apparently, it is not responsible for sluggish dehydrogenation at 125
   degrees C. The measurements of thermal conductivity for non-milled
   powders and ball milled nanocomposites show a dramatic reduction of
   thermal conductivity after ball milling. It seems that this could be a
   principal factor responsible for such a low dehydrogenation rate at low
   temperatures. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) works constitute a large
   portion of construction costs and thus need to be appropriately tracked.
   Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is
   however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and
   contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual
   inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects.
   Within a Scan-versus-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional
   laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the
   opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment
   of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to
   decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking
   structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work
   sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity.
   A Scan-versus-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements
   over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and
   challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a
   university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed
   system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed
   using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments
   made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison
   to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where
   off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results
   nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system
   (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-versus-BIM and
   Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance
   over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control
   (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent
   built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility
   owners and managers. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to use the CALPUFF modeling system, an
   effective and reliable atmospheric modeling tool, to predict the
   concentrations of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)
   released, due to the combustion of biogas in the combined heat and power
   (CHP) engines, from the Kawartha renewable energy generation facility at
   its proposed location in Ontario, Canada. In this study, HCHO and NOx
   were selected as the indicator and point source pollutants since they
   were the most significant products of biogas combustion emitted during
   the facility's normal operations (production of electricity and heat).
   The Lambert Conformal Conic projection coordinate system was implemented
   for the operation of the CALPUFF model. The proposed modeling scheme was
   coupled with both surface meteorological data (from 00:00 to 23:00) on
   an hourly basis and 12-h interval-based upper air meteorological data
   (from 00:00 to 12:00) to simulate the emission of these pollutants for
   the four seasonal Eastern Time meteorological conditions of winter
   (January 11-13, 2013), spring (April 14-16, 2013), summer (July 10-12,
   2013), and autumn (November 16-18, 2013). The results from the CALPUFF
   dispersion model clearly demonstrated that the maximum 1-h average
   concentrations of both HCHO and NOx, emitted from the combustion of
   biogas (composed of 60\% CH4 and 40\% CO2) in five CHP engines
   (operation load = 100\%, maximum electricity generation capacity =
   9.8MW), were found to be within the limits defined by Ontario Regulation

Abstract = {{Coordinated charging can provide efficient charging plans for electric
   vehicles (EVs) to improve the overall energy utilization while
   preventing an electric power system from overloading. However, designing
   an efficient coordinated charging strategy to route mobile EVs to
   fast-charging stations for globally optimal energy utilization is very
   challenging. In this paper, we investigate a special smart grid with
   enhanced communication capabilities, i.e., a VANET-enhanced smart grid.
   It exploits vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to support real-time
   communications among road-side units (RSUs) and highly mobile EVs for
   collecting real-time vehicle mobility information or dispatching
   charging decisions. Then, we propose a mobility-aware coordinated
   charging strategy for EVs, which not only improves the overall energy
   utilization while avoiding power system overloading, but also addresses
   the range anxieties of individual EVs by reducing the average travel
   cost. Specifically, the mobility-incurred travel cost for an EV is
   considered in two aspects: 1) the travel distance from the current
   position of the EV to a charging station; and 2) the transmission delay
   for receiving a charging decision via VANETs. The optimalmobility-aware
   coordinated EV charging problem is formulated as a time-coupled
   mixed-integer linear programming problem. By solving this problem based
   on Lagrange duality and branch-and-bound-based outer approximation
   techniques, an efficient charging strategy is obtained. To evaluate the
   performance of the proposed strategy, a realistic suburban scenario is
   developed in VISSIM to track vehicle mobility through the generated
   simulation traces, based on which the travel cost of each EV can be
   accurately calculated. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed strategy considerably outperforms the traditional EV charging
   strategy without VANETs on the metrics of the overall energy
   utilization, the average EV travel cost, and the number of successfully
   charged EVs.}},

Abstract = {{The Battle of the Water Networks II (BWN-II) is the latest of a series
   of competitions related to the design and operation of water
   distribution systems (WDSs) undertaken within the Water Distribution
   Systems Analysis (WDSA) Symposium series. The BWN-II problem
   specification involved a broadly defined design and operation problem
   for an existing network that has to be upgraded for increased future
   demands, and the addition of a new development area. The design
   decisions involved addition of new and parallel pipes, storage,
   operational controls for pumps and valves, and sizing of backup power
   supply. Design criteria involved hydraulic, water quality, reliability,
   and environmental performance measures. Fourteen teams participated in
   the Battle and presented their results at the 14th Water Distribution
   Systems Analysis conference in Adelaide, Australia, September 2012. This
   paper summarizes the approaches used by the participants and the results
   they obtained. Given the complexity of the BWN-II problem and the
   innovative methods required to deal with the multiobjective, high
   dimensional and computationally demanding nature of the problem, this
   paper represents a snap-shot of state of the art methods for the design
   and operation of water distribution systems. A general finding of this
   paper is that there is benefit in using a combination of heuristic
   engineering experience and sophisticated optimization algorithms when
   tackling complex real-world water distribution system design problems.

Abstract = {{The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of a general two-hop
   asynchronous cooperative network is examined for orthogonal and
   nonorthogonal selection decode-and-forward relaying protocols. The
   transmitter nodes send pulse amplitude modulation signals, in which
   information symbols are linearly modulated by a shaping waveform to be
   sent to the destination. We consider two different cases of band-limited
   and time-limited shaping waveforms. In each case, the DMT performance of
   the asynchronous and synchronous networks is compared. It is proved that
   in the band-limited system scenario, the asynchronism does not incur any
   performance loss, and the same DMT as that of the corresponding
   synchronous network is obtained for both protocols. In the
   time-limited-system scenario, the bandwidth is expanded for high values
   of signal-to-noise ratio. In this scenario, it is observed that only
   asynchronous signaling is able to exploit the extra degrees of freedom
   of the channel. The asynchronous network in this scenario provides
   better DMT performances for both protocols throughout the range of the
   multiplexing gain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on multicell coordinated beamforming in the presence
   of channel state information (CSI) errors, where base stations (BSs)
   collaboratively mitigate their intercell interference (ICI). Assuming
   that the CSI errors are hyperspherically bounded, we consider an
   optimization problem that minimizes the overall transmission power of
   BSs subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)
   constraints at each mobile station (MS). We solve this problem in a
   distributed manner with a limited information exchange among BSs. Using
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the S-Lemma, we first reformulate our
   optimization problem into a numerically tractable one. Since the SINR
   constraints are coupled, we introduce an algorithm by which each BS can
   obtain a local version of its coupling variables via a small data
   exchange with other BSs. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm that
   employs the projected gradient method to coordinate ICI across multiple
   BSs. Finally, we extend the application of the proposed algorithm to
   solve the problem of robust and distributed per-user SINR maximization
   under per-BS power constraints. Simulation results confirm the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of power efficiency and
   convergence in the presence of CSI uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed generation (DG) integration necessitates upgrading some
   distribution system overcurrent relays to directional ones to offer
   selective protection. The directional feature is conventionally achieved
   by phase angle comparison between phasors of the fault current and a
   polarizing quantity, normally a voltage signal. Doubly fed induction
   generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines constitute an appreciable portion
   of today's DG power. This paper unveils that conventional directional
   elements malfunction during three-phase short-circuits when a
   distribution system incorporates DFIG-based wind DG. The maloperation is
   due to the exclusive fault behavior of DFIGs, which affects the existing
   relaying practices. The paper also proposes a fault current
   classification technique that replaces the conventional directional
   element during problematic conditions and provides accurate fault
   direction quickly based on waveshape properties of the current. An
   extensive performance evaluation using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation of the
   IEEE 34 bus system corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed
   method. Results are exceptionally encouraging in the case of resistive
   crowbar circuits for DFIGs, which is the typical scenario in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) is desirable
   nowadays to achieve higher reliability and efficiency for smart grids.
   Controlling ESS operation usually depends on electricity market prices
   so as to charge when the price is low and discharge when the price is
   high. On the other hand, the market-clearing price itself is determined
   based on the net demand, i.e., including energy storage output, at every
   hour. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a mathematical model to
   determine the optimal ESS operation as well as the market-clearing
   prices. The problem is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multistage centralized control scheme for
   droop-controlled islanded microgrids (IMGs) with high penetration of
   plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The proposed control scheme optimally
   coordinates the distributed generation (DG) units' droop
   characteristics, the shedding of microgrid power demand (during
   inadequate generation periods), and the PEVs charging/discharging
   decisions to support the IMG operation for a large time frame. This
   coordination allows the PEVs to play a pivotal role in the successful
   and optimized operation of the IMG systems. To this end, a novel
   multistage droop-based optimal power flow algorithm is proposed in order
   to: 1) minimize the load shedding; 2) satisfy the PEVs customers'
   requirements; and 3) minimize the microgrid cost of operation. The
   proposed algorithm takes into consideration: 1) the special features and
   operational philosophy of droop-controlled IMG systems; 2) the
   variability associated with the output power of renewable DG units; and
   3) the random behavior of PEV charging. Several case studies have been
   carried out to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
   control scheme. The simulation studies show that the proposed control
   scheme can enhance the operation of IMG systems and facilitate a
   successful implementation of the IMG concept in the presence of high PEV
   penetration.}},

   RF sweeps (50-300 MHz) were digitally sampled at 25 MSPS; amplitude,
   phase, and optical property extractions were within 5\% of network

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to extend recent work of Dayyan et al. {[}24]
   in the case of radiative plate. We also introduced another parameter
   namely Darcy number which characterizes the porous medium. The governing
   equations (for boundary layer flow and heat transfer over permeable
   plate in Darcy porous medium) are transformed into a system of nonlinear
   ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations
   available in the literature. Approximate analytical solutions for the
   dimensionless velocity, temperature, friction factor and heat transfer
   rates are obtained using homotopy analysis method (HAM). Convergence of
   the HAM solution is discussed in detail. The effects of important
   controlling parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature,
   friction factor and heat transfer rates are analyzed graphically. It is
   shown that the friction factor increases with Darcy number, whereas the
   heat transfer rate decreases with the radiation-conduction parameter and
   increases with Darcy number. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{The energy exchange between a vortex ring and an annular ionic polymer
   metal composite (IPMC) plate is explored during impact. The vortex ring
   axis of symmetry is aligned with the geometric center of the annulus,
   and the ring radius is slightly larger than the hole in the structure.
   Experimental results show that as the vortex ring approaches the IPMC,
   the plate initially deflects towards the approaching ring. Upon impact,
   the plate is pushed away from the impacting vortex ring, while a
   secondary vortex ring is formed at the edge of the hole, which
   subsequently propagates away from the IPMC. The mechanical strain of the
   plate during the impact results in a current through the IPMC, which is
   measured in order to estimate the energy harvesting capacity of this
   configuration. This preliminary study suggests that approximate to
   0.001\% of the initial vortex ring energy can be transduced into
   electrical energy. An analytical model is developed to assess the energy
   harvesting capacity as a function of the vortex ring circulation. The
   model is in good agreement with experimental results, and shows a direct
   proportionality between the vortex ring circulation and the energy
   generated by the IPMC.}},

Abstract = {{A niobium-based superconducting dc-contact RF microelectromechanical
   systems switch is introduced and is thoroughly analyzed. The switch is
   amenable to integration with superconducting microelectronics
   technology. A comparison of the switch's RF performance at room and
   cryogenic temperatures indicates a significant improvement in the
   insertion loss of the switch when niobium is superconducting. The
   mechanical characteristic of the switch at extremely low temperature (4
   K) is also investigated. The switch exhibits an increase of 18\% on the
   actuation voltage as the temperature changes from 293 K (room
   temperature) to 4 K. A niobium superconducting tunable resonator is
   designed and tested, employing the proposed switch as the tuning element
   in the form of a switched capacitor bank monolithically integrated with
   the resonator. The measured results at 4 K clearly indicate the discrete
   resonance frequency states of the resonator. A three-pole tunable
   bandstop filter is designed with a center frequency of 1.2 GHz and

Abstract = {{Photonic structures capable of luminescence down-shifting (LDS) have
   strong application potential in several areas of optoelectronics. Such
   structures can be formed by overcoating quantum dots (QDs) with
   integrable, transparent layers. In this paper, silica was grown on
   CdSe/ZnS QDs to form QD/silica nanocrystals (NCs) in a microemulsion
   synthesis process. The synthesized structures were structurally and
   optically characterized to understand the growth mechanism, luminescence
   properties, and the influence of process parameters on excitonic decay
   and lifetime. Process conditions were established to have single QDs at
   the centers of the silica particles. The effects of temperature,
   excitation duration, size of QDs, and type of ligands on decay dynamics
   were established. Temperature-and time-resolved excitonic decay study of
   QD/silica NCs suggested carrier-trapping at the QD/silica interface and
   the exciton-phonon coupling to be the two main nonradiative processes
   limiting the luminescence efficiency. The synthesized NCs displayed
   intense photoluminescence (PL) with slight decrease in lifetime. The PL
   efficiency of the NCs improved for longer illumination. The NC
   structures that safely embed QDs in transparent medium are good
   candidates for LDS applications in photovoltaic, imaging, and detection

   multi-path routing, scheduling, rates, transmit powers, and selection of
   cooperative nodes. This framework is generic in that it is not
   restricted to any particular cooperative combining technique or type of
   network architecture. To take continuous power control into account, we
   introduce a non-trivial power allocation subproblem while keeping the
   main cross-layer framework as a linear program. We solve the problem
   optimally to obtain the max-min throughput for the case when cooperation
   is based on the distributed Alamouti code and networks have a mesh-like
   topology. We derive a number of practical engineering insights based on
   our numerical optimal results obtained for small-to-medium-sized random
   networks. In particular, we establish that the use of cooperative
   relaying in a small-to-medium-sized random mesh network often does not
   yield significant performance gains in throughput and connectivity even
   when multi-rate and continuous power control capabilities are available
   at the nodes.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic approach to design a nonlinear controller using minimax
   linear quadratic Gaussian regulator (LQG) control is proposed for a
   class of multi-input multi-output nonlinear uncertain systems. In this
   approach, a robust feedback linearization method and a notion of
   uncertain diffeomorphism are used to obtain an uncertain linearized
   model for the corresponding uncertain nonlinear system. A robust minimax
   LQG controller is then proposed for reference command tracking and
   stabilization of the nonlinear system in the presence of uncertain
   parameters. The uncertainties are assumed to satisfy a certain integral
   quadratic constraint condition. In this method, conventional feedback
   linearization is used to cancel nominal nonlinear terms and the
   uncertain nonlinear terms are linearized in a robust way. To demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a minimax LQG-based robust
   controller is designed for a nonlinear uncertain model of an
   air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicle (AHFV) with flexibility and
   input coupling. Here, the problem of constructing a guaranteed cost
   controller which minimizes a guaranteed cost bound has been considered
   and the tracking of velocity and altitude is achieved under inertial and
   aerodynamic uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Flows from river basins in northwestern Canada have been rising in the
   last two decades as a result of climate warming. In the
   wetland-dominated basins that characterise the southern margin of
   permafrost, permafrost thaw and disappearance, and resulting land-cover
   change, is occurring at an unprecedented rate. The impact of this thaw
   on runoff generation in headwater basins is poorly understood.
   Permafrost thaw has the potential to fundamentally alter the cycling and
   storage of moisture inputs in this region by altering the type and
   relative proportions of the major land-cover types, such as peat
   plateaus, channel fens and flat bogs. This paper examines streamflow
   changes in the four Water Survey of Canada gauged river basins (152-2050
   km(2)) in the lower Liard River valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, a
   region where permafrost thaw has produced widespread loss of forest and
   concomitant expansion of permafrost-free wetlands. Annual runoff in the
   lower Liard Valley increased by between 112 and 160 mm over the period
   of 1996-2012. The Mann-Kendall non-parametric statistical test and the
   Kendall-Theil robust line were used to ascertain changes in streamflow.
   Historical aerial photographs from 1977 and high-resolution satellite
   imagery (WorldView 2) from 2010 were used to measure the rate and
   pattern of permafrost thaw in a representative 6 km(2) area of Scotty
   Creek. Permafrost thaw-induced land-cover change is both increasing the
   adjacency between runoff producing and transmitting land cover types and
   transforming certain land covers that store water into ones that produce
   runoff. This land-cover change was found to be the single most important
   factor (37-61 mm) contributing to the observed increase in river
   discharge. Other contributing factors include increases in plateau
   runoff contributing areas (20-32 mm), increases in annual effective
   precipitation depth (18-30 mm), contribution of water from the melt of
   ice within permafrost (9 mm) and increases in baseflow (0.9-6.8 mm).
   Although runoff has significantly (p < 0.05) increased in all four
   basins, the largest increases are in basins with a relatively high cover
   of flat bogs. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A regional, or pooled, approach to frequency analysis is explored in the

   long record lengths, to explore the merits of a pooled approach to the
   estimation of extreme rainfall quantiles. The width of the 95\%
   confidence interval for quantile estimates is used as the primary basis
   to evaluate the relative merits of pooled and single site estimates of
   rainfall quantiles. Recommendations are formulated for applying the
   regional approach to frequency analysis, and these recommendations are
   used in the application of the regional approach to 40 sites with IDF
   data in southern Ontario, Canada. The results demonstrate that the

Abstract = {{Cooperative transmission (CT) and orthogonal frequency division multiple
   (OFDM) are promising technologies for extending coverage and increasing
   throughput in broadband wireless access (BWA) networks. Therefore, we
   propose a novel BWA network architecture, that can set up inter-cell
   collaboration using physical layer cooperative transmissions among
   distributed wired access networks with a powerful coordination
   capability at the central office. However, conventional base station
   (BS) assignment and resource allocation schemes cannot be used directly
   because a user can be serviced by more than one BS with cooperative
   transmission technology. This study proposes a novel framework of BS
   assignment and resource allocation in a cooperative OFDM network. We
   provide three approaches of resource allocation for minimizing bandwidth
   usage, minimizing transmission power consumption, and balancing resource
   costs respectively. An optimized resource allocation scheme can be
   implemented by flexibly choosing one of these approaches based on
   network load. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed
   mathematical formulations and linearization approach of our scheme. The
   performance benefit of CT technology on the bandwidth saving is
   demonstrated by comparing the new BS assignment and resource allocation
   scheme with conventional non-cooperative transmission.}},

   shape made of yttria-stabilized zirconia tubes. The fibre optic sensor
   is epoxied to one end inside the tube to be protected from high external
   temperatures and also harsh environments. Highly-oriented pyrolytic
   graphite tube with an exceptional anisotropic thermal conductivity with
   higher conductivity in transverse than radial direction is positioned
   around the fibre to protect it from high temperatures. Air cooling
   system is also provided from the other end to dissipate the transferred
   heat from inside the tube. The shift in the Bragg wavelength is
   influenced by the thermal expansion of the package and internal
   temperature variations, which translates into thermal expansion of the
   fibre. The modelling and experimental results revealed that the Bragg
   wavelength shift increases to 1.4 pm degrees C-1 at higher temperatures
   with linear behaviour at temperatures above 600 degrees C. The finite
   element modelling and the experimental results are also in good
   proximity indicating the similar trend for the shift in the Bragg
   wavelength.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous chlorination kinetics of the lipid regulator gemfibrozil and the
   formation of reaction products were investigated in deionized water over
   the pH range 3 to 9, and in two wastewater matrices. Chlorine oxidation
   of gemfibrozil was found to be highly dependent on pH. No statistically
   significant degradation of gemfibrozil was observed at pH values greater
   than 7. Gemfibrozil oxidation between pH 4 and 7 was best represented by
   first order kinetics. At pH 3, formation of three reaction products was
   observed. 4'-ClGem was the only reaction product formed from pH 4-7 and
   was modeled with zero order kinetics. Chlorine oxidation of gemfibrozil
   in two wastewater matrices followed second order kinetics. 4'-ClGem was
   only formed in wastewater with pH below 7. Deionized water rate kinetic
   models were applied to two wastewater effluents with gemfibrozil
   concentrations reported in literature in order to calculate potential
   mass loading rates of 4'ClGem to the receiving water.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen
   production from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor
   (UAnPBR). Two mesophilic UAPBRs (UAnPBR1 and 2) were tested at organic
   loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 gCOD L (1) d (1). To
   overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the UAnPBR2
   to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. The design
   modifications in UAnPBR2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98
   to 2.0 mol-H-2 mol (1)-glucose at an OLR of 25.7 gCOD L (1) d (1).
   Although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 L H-2 L (1)
   d (1) was achieved in the UAnPBR2 at an OLR of 51.4 gCOD L (1) d (1),
   the hydrogen yield dropped by 50\% to around 1 mol-H-2 mol (1)-glucose.
   The microbiological analysis (PCR/DGGE) showed that the biohydrogen
   production was due to the presence of the hydrogen and volatile acid
   producers such as Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum,
   Megasphaera elsdenii and Propionispira arboris. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel algorithm for calculating distribution load flow
   (DLF) for smart grid is presented. The algorithm can provide a DLF
   solution in a specific area of interest in the distribution system
   without the necessity of including all of the distribution system
   laterals in the DLF problem. The system laterals excluded from the DLF
   solution are replaced by equivalent loads using a proposed lumping
   technique. The proposed DLF zooming method thus reduces the size of the
   DLF problem and hence minimizes the effect of system size on the DLF
   solution time. The construction of the DLF problem is based on a novel
   automated recursive process, which enables fast accommodation of changes
   in the network topology of smart grid. The simulation results validate
   the accuracy of the proposed DLF zooming algorithm and provide a
   favorable evaluation of its performance for smart grid operation.}},

   an innovative two-stage optimization unit that ensures effective

Abstract = {{This paper presents the mathematical formulation of the microgrid's
   energy management problem and its implementation in a centralized Energy
   Management System (EMS) for isolated microgrids. Using the model
   predictive control technique, the optimal operation of the microgrid is
   determined using an extended horizon of evaluation and recourse, which
   allows a proper dispatch of the energy storage units. The energy
   management problem is decomposed into Unit Commitment (UC) and Optimal
   Power Flow (OPF) problems in order to avoid a mixed-integer non-linear
   formulation. The microgrid is modeled as a three-phase unbalanced system
   with presence of both dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed
   generation. The proposed EMS is tested in an isolated microgrid based on
   a CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark system. Results justify the need for
   detailed three-phase models of the microgrid in order to properly
   account for voltage limits and procure reactive power support.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-islanding protection methods, proposed in the literature, are
   distributed generation (DG) type dependent or in other words work
   efficiently for a specific DG type (synchronous or inverter based). In
   this paper, we investigate the possibility of developing an efficient
   universal islanding detection method that can be applied to both
   inverter and synchronous-based DG. The proposed method relies on
   extracting a group of features, from measured data simulated for both
   types of DGs, from which the best features are selected for islanding
   detection. A random forest (RF) classification technique is used to
   detect islanding and non-islanding situations with an objective of
   minimizing the non-detection zone as well as avoiding nuisance DG
   tripping during non-islanding conditions. Islanding and non- islanding
   cases were generated for the IEEE 34- bus system and used to train and
   test the proposed technique. In the paper, - fold cross-validation was
   used in order to test the accuracy of the proposed algorithm for
   detecting islanding. The results show that the proposed methodology has
   zero non-detection zone, high accuracy, and fast response when applied
   to both types of DGs independently of the size of the island. Among the
   various classification approaches investigated, the RF technique proved
   to be the most efficient approach for the proposed islanding detection
   method.}},

Abstract = {{A four-compartment anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) incorporated with
   membrane-less biocatalyzed electrolysis system (BES) was tested for the
   treatment of azo dye (alizarin yellow R, AYR) wastewater (AYR, 200 mg
   L-1; glucose, 1000 mg L-1). The ABR-BES was operated without and with
   external power supply to examine AYR reduction process and reductive
   intermediates with different external voltages (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 V) and
   hydraulic retention times (HRT: 8, 6 and 4 h). The decolorization
   efficiency in the ABR-BES (8 h HRT, 0.5 V) was higher than that in
   ABR-BES without electrolysis, i.e. 95.1 +/- 1.5\% versus 86.9 +/- 6.3\%.
   Incorporation of BES with ABR accelerated the consumption of VFAs
   (mainly acetate) and attenuated biogas (methane) production. Higher
   power supply (0.7 V) enhanced AYR decolorization efficiency (96.4 +/-
   1.8\%), VFAs removal, and current density (24.1 A m(-3) TCV). Shorter
   HRT increased volumetric AYR decolorization rates, but decreased AYR
   decolorization efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of cereals products, bread, pasta, muffins, cookies,
   cakes, and bars, enriched with flaxseed, were reviewed to highlight
   suitable processing conditions for the production of high-quality
   flaxseed-enriched products with the desired health attributes. The
   review highlights the contrasting effect of flaxseed enrichment on the
   mechanical and physical properties of cereal products according to
   product type, flaxseed enrichment level, and processing history.
   Flaxseed lipids remain stable for most processing and storage
   conditions, presumably due to the significant antioxidant properties of
   lignans, but information is lacking on the impact of home-handling, such
   as bread toasting, on lipid oxidation. Cereal products enriched with
   flaxseed generally exhibit similar or improved shelf life compared to
   equivalent products with no flaxseed enrichment, suggesting that
   flaxseed may limit starch retrogradation, maintain moisture content, and
   delay microbial growth. Sensory analysis shows lower organoleptic
   properties of most cereal products containing flaxseed, but similar
   consumer acceptance for cereal products without and with flaxseed
   enrichment up to 15\% is reported in the literature. This review
   indicates the need to better understand the impact of flaxseed
   enrichment on product microstructure and to conduct an extensive
   assessment of the health effects of flaxseed-enriched products, since
   very few studies have focused on the quantification of the
   bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and activity of flaxseed bioactive
   compounds for a variety of processing conditions and product
   formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive work analysis (CWA) as an analytical approach for examining
   complex sociotechnical systems has shown success in modelling the work
   of single operators. The CWA approach incorporates social and team
   interactions, but a more explicit analysis of team aspects can reveal
   more information for systems design. In this paper, Team CWA is explored
   to understand teamwork within a birthing unit at a hospital. Team CWA
   models are derived from theories and models of teamwork and leverage the
   existing CWA approaches to analyse team interactions. Team CWA is
   explained and contrasted with prior approaches to CWA. Team CWA does not
   replace CWA, but supplements traditional CWA to more easily reveal team
   information. As a result, Team CWA may be a useful approach to enhance
   CWA in complex environments where effective teamwork is required.
   Practitioner Summary: This paper looks at ways of analysing cognitive
   work in healthcare teams. Team Cognitive Work Analysis, when used to
   supplement traditional Cognitive Work Analysis, revealed more team
   information than traditional Cognitive Work Analysis. Team Cognitive
   Work Analysis should be considered when studying teams.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, yet robust
   multiresolution approach to texture classification-binary rotation
   invariant and noise tolerant (BRINT). The proposed approach is very fast
   to build, very compact while remaining robust to illumination
   variations, rotation changes, and noise. We develop a novel and simple
   strategy to compute a local binary descriptor based on the conventional
   local binary pattern (LBP) approach, preserving the advantageous
   characteristics of uniform LBP. Points are sampled in a circular
   neighborhood, but keeping the number of bins in a single-scale LBP
   histogram constant and small, such that arbitrarily large circular
   neighborhoods can be sampled and compactly encoded over a number of
   scales. There is no necessity to learn a texton dictionary, as in
   methods based on clustering, and no tuning of parameters is required to
   deal with different data sets. Extensive experimental results on
   representative texture databases show that the proposed BRINT not only
   demonstrates superior performance to a number of recent state-of-the-art
   LBP variants under normal conditions, but also performs significantly
   and consistently better in presence of noise due to its high
   distinctiveness and robustness. This noise robustness characteristic of
   the proposed BRINT is evaluated quantitatively with different
   artificially generated types and levels of noise (including Gaussian,
   salt and pepper, and speckle noise) in natural texture images.}},

Abstract = {{A previously developed and validated thermal-fluid mathematical model of
   the twin roll casting (TRC) process for magnesium alloy AZ31 was used to
   quantitatively study the feasibility of producing a clad magnesium strip
   via the TRC process. The clad material was varied to identify the effect
   of material composition on the feasibility of producing a clad strip.
   The clad alloys chosen included pure Zn, pure Al, AA3003, and AA5182
   aluminum alloys. In the analysis, the effect of casting speed and clad
   sheet thickness (100 and 500 mu m) on the thermal history in the
   magnesium strip and clad layer was analyzed. Assessment of the process
   feasibility was determined based on the exit temperature of the clad
   strip at the centerline, temperature of the clad sheet prior to the roll
   bite entry, and fraction solid of both the core (magnesium sheet) and
   clad along the core/clad interface. The results indicated that using
   pure Zn as a clad material is not feasible due to premelting of the clad
   strip prior to introduction into the TRC apparatus. All three aluminum
   alloys studied proved to be feasible in terms of a clad material, and it
   was found that the effect of clad thickness and clad material chemical
   composition on the thermal history (temperature distribution) of the
   clad strip was negligible. It was also predicted using the
   thermodynamics package FactSage (TM) that the intermetallic phase at the
   core/clad interface will be primarily gamma-Mg (Mg17Al12). For AA5182
   clad material, formation of beta-Mg (Al3Mg2) is also possible.}},

   WWTP effluent mixtures and a wide variety of potential mechanisms that
   can alter physiological and reproductive development of aquatic
   organisms make it difficult to assess the linkages and severity of the
   effects associated with trace organic contaminants. This paper describes
   a surface water quality modeling exercise that was performed to
   understand the relevant contaminant fate and transport processes
   necessary to accurately predict the concentrations of trace organic
   compounds present in the aquatic environment. The target compounds
   modeled include a known antiandrogenic personal care product (triclosan)
   and selected pharmaceuticals (venlafaxine, naproxen, and carbamazepine).
   The WASP 7.5 model was adapted and calibrated to reflect approximately
   ten kilometers of reach of the Grand River watershed that is highly
   influenced by a major urban WWTP. Simulation of the fate and transport
   of the target compounds revealed that flow-driven transport processes
   (advection and dispersion) greatly influenced the behavior of the target
   contaminants in the aquatic environment However, fate mechanisms such as
   photolysis and biodegradation can play an important role in the
   attenuation of some compounds. The exception was carbamazepine where it
   was shown to act as a conservative tracer compound for wastewater
   specific contaminants in the water phase. The calibrated water quality
   model can now be employed in a number of future applications. Prediction
   of fate and transport of other trace organic contaminants across the
   watershed and assessment of the performance of WWTP infrastructure
   upgrades in the removal of these compounds are just a few examples. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of providing interruption
   recovery assistance in the form of an interactive visual timeline of
   historical events on a peripheral display in support of team supervision
   in time-critical settings. As interruptions can have detrimental effects
   on task performance, particularly in time-critical work environments,
   there is growing interest in the design of tools to assist people in
   resuming their pre-interruption activity. A user study was conducted to
   evaluate the use of an interactive event timeline that provides
   assistance to human supervisors in time-critical settings. The study was
   conducted in an experimental platform that emulated a team of operators
   and a mission commander performing a time-critical unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) mission. The study results showed that providing
   interruption assistance enabled people to recover from interruptions
   faster and more accurately. These results have implications for
   interface design that could be adopted in similar time-critical
   environments such as air-traffic control, process control, and first
   responders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights

Journal = {{FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{246}},
Pages = {{34-48}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A fuzzy option prioritization technique is developed to efficiently
   model uncertain preferences of DMs in strategic conflicts as fuzzy
   preferences by using the decision makers' (DMs') fuzzy truth values of
   preference statements at feasible states within the framework of the
   Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. The preference statements of a DM
   express desirable combinations of options or courses of action, and are
   listed in order of importance. A fuzzy truth value is a truth degree,
   expressed as a number between 0 and 1, capturing uncertainty in the
   truth of a preference statement at a feasible state. A fuzzy preference
   formula is introduced based on the fuzzy truth values of preference
   statements, and it is established that the output of this formula is a
   fuzzy preference relation. It is shown that fuzzy option prioritization
   can also be used when the truth values of preference statements at
   feasible states are completely based on Boolean logic, thereby
   generating a crisp preference over feasible states that is the same as
   would be found by employing the existing crisp option prioritization,
   making the crisp option prioritization technique a special case of the
   fuzzy option prioritization methodology. To demonstrate how this
   methodology can be employed to represent fuzzy preferences in real-world
   decision problems, fuzzy option prioritization is applied to an actual
   dispute over groundwater contamination that took place in Elmira,
   Ontario, Canada. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   simultaneously bandpass filters those views before the light enters the
   device. In its current state, our instrument is capable of
   simultaneously imaging nine independent spectral bands and three
   different perspective views. The device allows for measurement of
   multispectral properties of different material enabling
   multispectroscopic science as demonstrated by studying the separability

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The theoretical framework for constructing a fully mechanistic multibody
   dynamic model of a vertical piano action is described, and its general
   validity is established. Equations of motion are derived symbolically
   using a graph-theoretic formulation. Model fidelity is increased by
   introducing several novel features: (i) a new contact model for
   representing the compression of the felt-lined interfaces between
   interacting parts, capable of capturing the intermittent loading and
   unloading of these contacts occurring through the key stroke, as well as
   providing smooth transitions between these states; (ii) models for two
   important components that are unique to the vertical action, the bridle
   strap and the butt spring; (iii) a sophisticated key pivot model that
   captures both the rotational motion and the vertical translation of the
   key as it can lift off the balance rail under some conditions; (iv)
   flexible beam models for backcheck wire and hammer shank so as to
   predict observed vibrations in the response accurately; and (v) coupling
   of the mechanism model to a flexible stiff string model for realistic
   hammer impact. For simulation, parameters were obtained by experimental
   testing and measurement of a physical prototype vertical action.
   Techniques are described for the virtual regulation of the model to
   ensure that initial conditions and pseudostatic response accurately
   represent the precise configuration and desired relationships between
   the parts during the key stroke. Two input force profiles were used for
   simulations, a forte pressed (hard) and piano pressed touch (soft),
   typical of those measured at the key surface when activated by a
   pianist. Simulated response to these quite different inputs is
   described, and compared to experimental observations obtained from a
   physical prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The constitutive behavior of a rare-earth magnesium alloy ZEK100 rolled
   sheet is studied at room temperature over a wide range of strain rates.
   This alloy displays a weakened basal texture compared to conventional
   AZ31B sheet which leads to increased ductility; however, a strong
   orientation dependency persists. An interesting feature of the ZEK100
   behavior is twinning at first yield under transverse direction (TD)
   tensile loading that is not seen in AZ31B. The subsequent work hardening
   behavior is shown to be stronger in the TD when compared to the rolling
   and 45 deg directions. One particularly striking feature of this alloy
   is a significant dependency of the strain rate sensitivity on
   orientation. The yield strength under compressive loading in all
   directions and under tensile loading in the TD direction is controlled
   by twinning and is rate insensitive. In contrast, the yield strength
   under rolling direction tensile loading is controlled by non-basal slip
   and is strongly rate sensitive. The cause of the in-plane anisotropy in
   terms of both strength and strain rate sensitivity is attributed to the
   initial crystallographic texture and operative deformation mechanisms as
   confirmed by measurements of deformed texture. Rate-sensitive
   constitutive fits are provided of the tensile stress-strain curves to
   the Zerilli-Armstrong{[}1] hcp material model and of the compressive
   response to a new constitutive equation due to Kurukuri et al.({[}2])

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) detonation structure transformations from
   rectangular and diagonal modes into spinning modes in a narrow square
   tube are investigated by high-resolution simulation. Numerical
   simulations are performed with a Riemann solver of the HLLC-type, new
   cell-based structured adaptive mesh refinement data structure,
   high-order, parallel adaptive mesh refinement reactive flow code. A
   simplified one-step kinetic reaction model is used to reveal the 3-D
   detonation structure. The four different types of initial disturbances
   applied in the ZND profiles lead to the structures of rectangular in
   phase, rectangular out of phase, rectangular partial out of phase and
   diagonal, respectively, during the initial stages of detonation
   propagation. Eventually, all these detonation structures evolve into the
   self-sustained spinning detonations. The asymmetric disturbance leads to
   a stable spinning detonation much faster than the rest. The important
   features in the formation of spinning detonation are revealed using a
   3-D visualization, and a remarkable qualitative agreement with
   experimental and numerical results is obtained with respect to the
   transverse wave dynamics and detonation front structures. The transverse
   wave collisions produce the unburnt gas pockets and the energy to
   sustain the detonation front propagation and distortion. The periodic
   pressure oscillation of front plays a complex role as it shifts the
   reaction zone structure with an accompanying change in the driving
   energy of transition and the detonation parameters which result in the
   more distorted front and the unstable detonation. Eventually, the
   unstable distorted detonation evolves into a spinning detonation.}},

Abstract = {{Higher order differential cryptanalysis is based on a property of higher
   order derivatives of Boolean functions such that derivative of a Boolean
   function reduces its degree at least 1 and continuously taking
   derivatives eventually yields a zero function. A quicker degree
   reduction means a lower data complexity in cryptanalysis, which can be
   determined by fast point at which the derivative reduces the degree at
   least 2.
   In this paper, we show that the set of the fast points of a Boolean
   function constitutes a linear subspace and its dimension plus the degree
   of the function is at most the size of the function. We also show that
   non-zero fast point exists in every n-variable Boolean function of
   degree n - 1, every symmetric Boolean function of degree d where n not
   equivalent to d (mod 2) or every quadratic Boolean function of odd
   number variables, which help us distinguish a few block ciphers and
   propose a new design principle about degree for block cipher. (C) 2014

   strength of magnesium spot-welds was similar to aluminum and less than

   one mode of failure in cross-tension specimens. Fatigue crack initiation
   life was 50\% and 30\% of the total life for tensile-shear and

   models were assessed by predicting fatigue life of magnesium spot-welds.
   Although these models do not account for the asymmetric cyclic hardening

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{33-41}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Due to different deformation mechanisms arising from limited slip
   systems in HCP wrought magnesium alloys, their yield and hardening in
   tension and compression are different. Consequently, the cyclic behavior
   of these alloys is asymmetric showing a non-Masing hysteresis. An
   elastic-plastic method of analysis is proposed in this paper to handle
   the pronounced asymmetry inherited by Mg wrought alloys. Samples
   machined from an extrusion piece of AZ31B were tested on a standard
   rotating bending machine at bending moment amplitudes ranging from 3.3
   to 6.3 N m. Tests were conducted under two conditions: as-extruded and
   stress-relived. As-extruded samples showed a higher fatigue limit due to
   beneficial residual stresses induced by the extrusion process. The
   proposed elastic-plastic model was then applied to obtain the stress
   distribution in the tested specimens. Cyclic hystereses obtained from
   this analysis were used to estimate the elastic and plastic strain
   energy densities per cycle. An energy-life model for AZ31B was then
   employed in conjunction with the calculated hysteresis energies to
   predict fatigue life of AZ31B in rotating bending. The proposed model
   prediction results were in good agreement with the experimental results.

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) has attracted increasing interest due to
   their biocompatibility, rigidity, and potential applications in
   biomedicine and cosmetics. A parameter estimation technique was used to
   calculate the average dimension of CNC with different aspect ratios, and
   their dynamic physical parameters denoted by the translational (D (t))
   and rotational diffusion (I similar to) coefficients. For CNC with L/d
   ratio of 17, the experimental D (t) and I similar to values produced
   calculated length (L) and diameter (d) values that deviated from the
   experimental results by 0.22 and 0.27 \% after 1,000 iterations,
   respectively. The calculated translational and rotational coefficients
   converged to an asymptotic value of 5.048 x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) and 551.9
   s(-1), with the latter requiring a larger number of iterations to
   achieve convergence. Close agreement between experimentally obtained and
   calculated dimensions and dynamics (L, d, D (t), and I similar to) for
   various types of CNCs was observed using this technique. By combining
   the theoretical model formulated by Broersma and the computational
   method utilizing a Nelder-Mead simplex direct search algorithm, reliable
   predictions of the average sizes determined from dynamic light
   scattering of a CNC sample was achieved; yielding an average L = 253.5
   nm and d = 15.7 nm. The proposed approach provides a convenient, simple,
   and robust technique to determine the length and diameter of rod-like
   nanoparticles, such as CNC from light scattering measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Similar and dissimilar welds of dual-phase (DP) and high strength low
   alloy (HSLA) steels were made by fiber laser welding (FLW). The welds
   were characterized with respect to microstructure, micro- and
   nano-hardness, and tensile properties. The fusion zone (FZ) in the DP
   welds consisted of fully martensitic structure; whereas HSLA and
   dissimilar weld FZ microstructure were mixture of martensite and
   bainite. Analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed
   bainite structures containing bainitic ferrite laths with intralath and
   interlath cementite. Precipitation of single variant carbides inside the
   bainitic ferrite laths were confirmed by measuring the interplanar
   spacing. The cooling rate in the FZ, estimated using Rosenthal equation,
   and continuous-cooling-transformation diagrams corroborated the
   microstructure formed. Nanoindentation was used to verify the hardness
   of these individual micro-constituents, since a much lower nano-hardness
   for bainite (4.11 GPa) was observed compared to martensite (6.57 GPa)
   phase. Tensile failure occurred in the tempered area of the heat
   affected zone (HAZ) in the DP steel welded, which was confirmed by
   typical cup-like dimple fracture; likewise failure in the HSLA base
   metal, which occurred in dissimilar and HSLA welds, indicated
   distinctive dimple and shear dimple ductile morphology. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Morphology-controlled graphene nanosheets can be easily synthesized as
   anode material for application in high-capacity lithium-ion batteries. A
   modified version of an improved method for higher degree of oxidation of
   graphite oxide (GO) has been developed and characterized. X-ray
   diffraction analysis shows that GO prepared using this method has a
   higher degree of oxidation than that of using the improved method. The
   interlayer d-spacing increases from 0.87 nm (using the improved method)
   to 0.92 nm (using the modified-improved method). Also, it is confirmed
   by XPS analysis that the O/C ratio in GO increases from 2.51 (improved
   method) to 8.27 (modified-improved method). It is hypothesized that GO,
   which has a higher degree of oxidation, is more reducible to graphene.
   The more reduced graphene has a larger amount of free pi-bonds and fewer
   layers, and it can be easily altered to morphology-controlled graphene.
   Graphene nanosheets prepared using the modified-improved method exhibits
   discharge capacities of 1079 mAh g(-1) (at a constant current of 40 mA
   g(-1)) and 1002 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. The capacity retention of the
   synthesized graphene nanosheets is 1070 mAh g(-1) at a current of 40 mA
   g(-1) after the rate capability test, and their rate capability is 463
   mAh g(-1) at a current of 400 mA g(-1). The morphology-controlled
   graphene nanosheets prepared by the modified-improved method shows
   better discharge performance compared to graphene prepared by the
   improved method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanowire transparent electrodes are a promising alternative to
   transparent conductive oxides. However, their surface roughness presents
   a problem for their integration into devices with thin layers such as
   organic electronic devices. In this paper, hot rollers are used to
   soften plastic substrates with heat and mechanically press the nanowires
   into the substrate surface. By doing so, the root-mean-square surface
   roughness is reduced to 7 nm and the maximum peak-to-valley value is 30
   nm, making the electrodes suitable for typical organic devices. This
   simple process requires no additional materials, which results in a
   higher transparency, and is compatible with roll-to-roll fabrication
   processes. In addition, the adhesion of the nanowires to the substrate
   significantly increases.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to characterize fibers with near-zero dispersionlength
   products is of considerable practical interest. We introduce dispersive
   virtual reference interferometry (DVRI) as a technique for the
   characterization of short length (< 1m) fibers with near-zero
   disperisonlength. DVRI has an accuracy equivalent to standard balanced
   spectral interferometry (on the order of 10-3 ps and 10-5 ps/nm for the
   group delay and dispersion-length measurements respectively) but does
   not require wide spectral bandwidths or multiple spectral scans.
   Following experimental validation, the DVRI technique is used to
   characterize a 23.3-cm erbiumdoped gain fiber (dispersion-length product
   < 0.002 ps/nm), using a tunable laser with a bandwidth of 145nm.
   Furthermore, the dispersion in a 28.6-cm commercial dispersion shifted
   fiber is characterized across the zerodispersion wavelength and the
   zero-disperison-wavelength and slope were determined to be 1566.7 nm and
   8.57 x 10(-5) ps/(nm(2) . m) with a precision of +/- 0.2 nm and +/- 0.06

   Carbon black (CB) selectively dispersed in ABS phase increases the
   concentration of CB in ABS domain, which dramatically increases
   electrical conductivity. Moreover, with raw ABS being massively added
   into the blends, the mechanical properties are significantly improved
   while conductivity is slightly decreased. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{CellFIT: A Cellular Force-Inference Toolkit Using Curvilinear Cell
   Boundaries}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical forces play a key role in a wide range of biological
   processes, from embryogenesis to cancer metastasis, and there is
   considerable interest in the intuitive question, ``Can cellular forces
   be inferred from cell shapes?'' Although several groups have posited
   affirmative answers to this stimulating question, nagging issues
   remained regarding equation structure, solution uniqueness and noise
   sensitivity. Here we show that the mechanical and mathematical factors
   behind these issues can be resolved by using curved cell edges rather
   than straight ones. We present a new package of force-inference
   equations and assessment tools and denote this new package CellFIT, the
   Cellular Force Inference Toolkit. In this approach, cells in an image
   are segmented and equilibrium equations are constructed for each triple
   junction based solely on edge tensions and the limiting angles at which
   edges approach each junction. The resulting system of tension equations
   is generally overdetermined. As a result, solutions can be obtained even
   when a modest number of edges need to be removed from the analysis due
   to short length, poor definition, image clarity or other factors.
   Solving these equations yields a set of relative edge tensions whose
   scaling must be determined from data external to the image. In cases
   where intracellular pressures are also of interest, Laplace equations
   are constructed to relate the edge tensions, curvatures and cellular
   pressure differences. That system is also generally overdetermined and
   its solution yields a set of pressures whose offset requires reference
   to the surrounding medium, an open wound, or information external to the
   image. We show that condition numbers, residual analyses and standard
   errors can provide confidence information about the inferred forces and
   pressures. Application of CellFIT to several live and fixed biological
   tissues reveals considerable force variability within a cell population,
   significant differences between populations and elevated tensions along
   heterotypic boundaries.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Aluminum-based bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles have shown promising
   applications in civil and defense industries. This study addresses the
   thermal stability of aluminum-palladium (Al-Pd) core/shell nanoparticles
   with a varying shell thickness of 5, 6, and 7 , respectively. The
   classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed in order to
   investigate the effects of the shell thickness on the ignition mechanism
   and subsequent energetic processes of these nanoparticles. The
   histograms of temperature change and structural evolution clearly show
   the inhibition role of the Pd shell during ignition. While the
   nanoparticle with a thicker shell is more thermally stable and hence
   requires more excess energy, stored as the potential energy of the
   nanoparticle and provided through numerically heating, to initiate the
   thermite reaction, a higher adiabatic temperature can be produced from
   this nanoparticle, thanks to its greater content of Pd. The two-stage
   thermite reactions are discussed with their activation energy based on
   the energy balance processes during MD heating and production. Analyses
   of the simulation results reveal that the inner pressure of the
   core-shell nanoparticle increases with both temperature and the absorbed
   thermal energy during heating, which may result in a breakup of the Pd
   shell.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of implantable bioelectronics for analytical and curative
   purposes are currently limited by their poor long-term biofiinctionality
   in physiological media and nonspecific interactions with biomolecules.
   In an attempt to prolong in vivo functionality, recent advances in
   surface modifications have demonstrated that zwitterionic coatings can
   rival the performance of conventional poly(ethylene glycol) polymers in
   reducing nonspecific protein fouling. Herein, we report the fabrication
   of a very thin layer of nonfouling zwitterionic cysteine surface capable
   of protecting implantable bioelectronics from nonspecific adsorption of
   plasma proteins. This work is the first of its kind to fabricate,
   through solution chemistry, a cysteine surface exhibiting zwitterionic
   state as high as 88\% and to demonstrate antibiofouling under the
   exposure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum. The fabricated
   surface utilized a minimal amount of gold substrate, approximately 10
   nm, and an extremely thin antifouling layer at 1.14 nm verified by
   ellipsometry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy assessment of the
   nitrogen (N-1s) and carbon (C-1s) spectra conclude that 87.8\% of the
   fabricated cysteine surface is zwitterionic, 2.5\% is positively
   charged, and 9.6\% is noncharged. Antibiofouling performance of the
   cysteine surface is quantitatively determined by bicinchoninic acid
   (BCA) protein assay as well as qualitatively confirmed using scanning
   electron spectroscopy. Cysteine surfaces demonstrated a BSA fouling of
   3.9 +/- 4.84\% mu g/cm(2), which is 93.6\% and 98.5\% lower than
   stainless steel and gold surfaces, respectively. Surface plasmon
   resonance imaging analysis returned similar results and suggest that a
   thinner cysteine coating will enhance performance. Scanning electron
   microscopy confirmed the results of BCA assay and suggested that the
   cysteine surface demonstrated a 69\% reduction to serum fouling. The
   results reported in this paper demonstrate that it is possible to
   achieve a highly zwitterionic surface through solution chemistry on a
   macroscopic level that is capable of improving biocompatibility of
   long-term implantable bioelectronics.}},

   maximum achievable rate possible assuming the scheduling is fixed for
   all messages and known to all nodes prior to transmission. It is shown
   that under constant power constraints, a simple transmission scheme for
   relays is within 0.71 bits of the optimum rate. It is also demonstrated
   that the proposed scheme can attain the optimum rate, when channels
   satisfy a certain property. Furthermore, it is proved that under average
   power constraints, the same scheme can be used to achieve within 3.6

   another construction for FHS sets of length (q-1) N, where q is a prime
   power satisfying gcd(q-1, N) = 1. By these two constructions, we obtain
   infinitely many new optimal FHS sets with respect to the Peng-Fan bound

Abstract = {{Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) obtains the conditional species
   mass fractions by inverting a Fredholm integral equation of the first

   different regularisation methods: zeroth-order temporal Tikhonov
   regulatisation and first-order spatial Tikhonov regularisation. The
   objectives of the current study are: (i) to elucidate the ill-posedness
   of the inverse problem; (ii) to understand the origin of the
   perturbations in the data and quantify their magnitude; (iii) to
   quantify the uncertainty in the solution using different priors; and
   (iv) to determine the regularisation method best suited to this problem.
   A singular value decomposition shows that the current inverse problem is
   ill-posed. Perturbations to the data may be caused by the use of a
   discrete mixture fraction grid for calculating the mixture fraction PDF.
   The magnitude of the perturbations is estimated using a box filter and
   the uncertainty in the solution is determined based on the width of the
   credible intervals. The width of the credible intervals is significantly
   reduced with the inclusion of a smoothing prior and the recovered
   solution is in better agreement with the exact solution. The credible
   intervals for temporal and spatial smoothing are shown to be similar.
   Credible intervals for temporal smoothing depend on the solution from
   the previous time step and a smooth solution is not guaranteed. For
   spatial smoothing, the credible intervals are not dependent upon a
   previous solution and better predict characteristics for higher mixture
   fraction values. These characteristics make spatial smoothing a
   promising alternative method for recovering a solution from the CSE
   inversion process.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications process data in which there exists a ``conservation
   law{''} between related quantities. For example, in traffic monitoring,
   every incoming event, such as a packet's entering a router or a car's
   entering an intersection, should ideally have an immediate outgoing
   counterpart. We propose a new class of constraints-Conservation
   Rules-that express the semantics and characterize the data quality of
   such applications. We give confidence metrics that quantify how strongly
   a conservation rule holds and present approximation algorithms (with
   error guarantees) for the problem of discovering a concise summary of
   subsets of the data that satisfy a given conservation rule. Using real
   data, we demonstrate the utility of conservation rules and we show
   order-of-magnitude performance improvements of our discovery algorithms

Abstract = {{The barrier coverage problem in emerging mobile sensor networks has been
   an interesting research issue due to many related real-life
   applications. Existing solutions are mainly concerned with deciding
   one-time movement for individual sensors to construct as many barriers
   as possible, which may not be suitable when there are no sufficient
   sensors to form a single barrier. In this paper, we aim to achieve
   barrier coverage in the sensor scarcity scenario by dynamic sensor
   patrolling. Specifically, we design a periodic monitoring scheduling
   (PMS) algorithm in which each point along the barrier line is monitored
   periodically by mobile sensors. Based on the insight from PMS, we then
   propose a coordinated sensor patrolling (CSP) algorithm to further
   improve the barrier coverage, where each sensor's current movement
   strategy is derived from the information of intruder arrivals in the
   past. By jointly exploiting sensor mobility and intruder arrival
   information, CSP is able to significantly enhance barrier coverage. We
   prove that the total distance that sensors move during each time slot in
   CSP is the minimum. Considering the decentralized nature of mobile
   sensor networks, we further introduce two distributed versions of CSP:
   S-DCSP and G-DCSP. We study the scenario where sensors are moving on two
   barriers and propose two heuristic algorithms to guide the movement of
   sensors. Finally, we generalize our results to work for different
   intruder arrival models. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithms have desired barrier coverage performances.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage reversal in stacked microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is a significant
   challenge that must be addressed, and the information on its definite
   cause and occurrence process is still obscure. In this work, we first
   demonstrated that different anodic reaction rates caused voltage
   reversal in a stacked MFC. Sluggish reaction rates on the anode in unit1
   of the stacked MFC resulted in a significantly increased anode
   overpotential of up to 0.132V, as compared to negligible anode
   overpotential (0.0247V) in unit2. This work clearly verified the process
   of voltage reversal in the stacked MFC. As the current was gradually
   increased in the stacked MFC, the voltage in the stacked unit1 decreased
   to 0V prior to that of the stacked unit2. Then, when the voltage in
   unit1 became 0V, it was converted from a galvanic cell to an
   electrochemical cell powered by unit2. We found that the stacked unit2
   provided electrical energy for the stacked unit1 as a power supply.
   Finally, the anode potential of the stacked unit1 significantly
   increased over cathode potential as current increased further, which
   caused voltage reversal in unit1. Voltage reversal occurs in stacked
   MFCs as a result of non-spontaneous anode overpotential in a unit MFC
   that has sluggish anode kinetics compared to the other unit MFCs.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a procedure that found a balance between the
   ability of polymer-stabilized nanorods (NRs) to self-assemble and the
   creation of narrow gaps to make reproducibly bright surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering (SERS) nanorod dimers. NRs were end-functionalized with
   polymers, which enabled end-to-end self-assembly of NR chains and
   control over inter-rod separation through polymer molecular weight (MW).
   We found a way to quench the self-assembly, by phospholipid
   encapsulation, reducing the polydispersity of the aggregates while
   rendering them water-soluble. This reduction in polydispersity and
   preferential isolation of short-chain nanorod species is important for
   maximizing SERS enhancement from nanorod chains. We prepared NR
   aggregates that exhibit similar to 5-50 times greater SERS intensity
   than isolated rods (and similar to 750 x greater than bare dye)
   depending on inter-rod separation, when using Oxazine 725 reporter
   molecules. Colloidal stability of NR aggregates and temporal stability
   of the SERS signal in water were observed for 110 days. With enhanced
   SERS intensity, water solubility, and stability, these NR aggregates are
   promising optical probes for future biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic performance limits
   (throughput capacity and average packet delay) of social-proximity
   vehicular networks. The considered network involves vehicles moving and
   communicating on a scalable grid-like street layout following the
   social-proximity model: Each vehicle has a restricted mobility region
   around a specific social spot and transmits via a unicast flow to a
   destination vehicle that is associated with the same social spot.
   Moreover, the spatial distribution of the vehicle decays following a
   power-law distribution from the central social spot toward the border of
   the mobility region. With vehicles communicating using a variant of the
   two-hop relay scheme, the asymptotic bounds of throughput capacity and
   average packet delay are derived in terms of the number of social spots,
   the size of the mobility region, and the decay factor of the power-law
   distribution. By identifying these key impact factors of performance
   mathematically, we find three possible regimes for the performance
   limits. Our results can be applied to predict the network performance of
   real-world scenarios and provide insight on the design and deployment of
   future vehicular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation passive optical network (PON) has been considered in the
   past few years as a cost-effective broadband access technology. With the
   ever-increasing power saving concern, energy efficiency has been an
   important issue in its operations. In this paper, we propose a novel
   sleep-time sizing and scheduling framework for the implementation of
   green bandwidth allocation (GBA) in TDMA-PONs. The proposed framework
   leverages the batch-mode transmission feature of GBA to minimize the
   overhead due to frequent ONU on-off transitions. The optimal sleeping
   time sequence of each ONU is determined in every cycle without violating
   the maximum delay requirement. With multiple ONUs possibly accessing the
   shared media simultaneously, a collision may occur. To address this
   problem, we propose a new sleep-time sizing mechanism, namely
   Sort-And-Shift (SAS), in which the ONUs are sorted according to their
   expected transmission start times, and their sleep times are shifted to
   resolve any possible collision while ensuring maximum energy saving.
   Results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight
   the merits of our solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a vehicular passenger mobility-aware bandwidth

   of both call admission control and bandwidth adjustment functions to
   lower handoff vehicle service dropping probability and efficiently

   scheme with guard bandwidth is employed to protect handoff vehicle
   service. Also, bandwidth is dynamically assigned to each vehicle by
   exploiting vehicular passenger movement pattern that includes getting on
   and off events at a station. We evaluate the V-MBA scheme by developing
   a continuous-time Markov chain model. Simulation results demonstrate
   that the V-MBA scheme can guarantee low new vehicle service blocking

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a delay-tolerant secure long-term health care
   scheme, RCare, for collecting patient's sensitive personal health
   information (PHI). Specifically, to minimize the overall health care
   cost, RCare provides network connectivity to rural areas using
   conventional transportation vehicles (e.g., cars, buses) as relay nodes.
   These vehicles are expected to store, carry, and forward the PHI to the
   health-service-provider located mostly at the city area following an
   opportunistic routing. RCare improves network performance by providing
   incentive to the cooperative vehicles, and encompasses identity based
   cryptography to ensure security and privacy of the PHI during the
   routing period by using short digital signature and pseudo-identity.
   Network fairness and resistance to different possible attacks are also
   ensured by RCare. Extensive security and performance analyses
   demonstrate that RCare is able to achieve desired security requirements
   with effectiveness in terms of high delivery ratio with acceptable

Title = {{An Adaptive Approach to Learn Overcomplete Dictionaries With Efficient
   Numbers of Elements}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Dictionary learning for sparse representation has recently attracted
   attention among the signal processing society in a variety of
   applications such as denoising, classification, and compression. The
   number of elements in a learned dictionary is crucial since it governs
   specificity and optimality of sparse representation. Sparsity level,
   number of dictionary elements, and representation error are three
   correlated factors in which setting each pair of them results in a
   specific value of the third factor. An arbitrary selection of the number
   of dictionary elements affects either the sparsity level or/and the
   representation error. Despite recent advancements in training
   dictionaries, the number of dictionary elements is still heuristically
   set. To avoid the representation's sub-optimality, a systematic approach
   to adapt the elements' number based on input datasets is essential. Some
   existing methods try to address this requirement such as enhanced K-SVD,
   sub-clustering K-SVD, and stage-wise K-SVD. However, it is not specified
   under which sparsity level and representation error criteria their
   learned dictionaries are size-optimized. We propose a new dictionary
   learning approach that automatically learns a dictionary with an
   efficient number of elements that provides both desired representation
   error and desired average sparsity level. In our proposed method, for
   any given representation error and average sparsity level, the number of
   elements in the learned dictionary varies based on content complexity of
   training datasets. The performance of the proposed method is
   demonstrated in image denoising. The proposed method is compared to
   state-of-the-art, and results confirm the superiority of the proposed
   approach.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{109-112}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The morphological control of Co3O4 by polyvinylpyrrolidone during
   precipitation reaction has resulted in the formation of two-dimensional
   nanodisks with surface porosity. As a hi-functional catalyst, CO3O4
   nanodisks are active towards both the oxygen reduction and evolution
   reactions. The electrocatalytic activity is evaluated by preparing air
   electrodes for rechargeable zinc-air batteries utilizing ambient air to
   emphasize practicality. The galvanodynamic charge and discharge
   behaviors are far superior than Co3O4 nanoparticle counterparts
   particularly at high applied current densities. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy reveals that Co3O4 nanodisk electrode results in
   significantly less internal, solid-electrolyte interface, and charge
   transfer resistances which lead to highly efficient electrochemical
   reactions. Superior rechargeability has also been confirmed where
   virtually no voltage drops are observed over 60 pulse cycles. The
   practicality of Co3O4 nanodisks is highlighted by demonstrating
   comparable discharge voltages and greatly outperforming charge voltages
   with excellent electrochemical stability than commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Abstract = {{Smart grid has emerged as the next generation of power grid, due to its
   reliability, flexibility, and efficiency. However, smart grid faces some
   critical security challenges such as the message injection attack and
   the replay attack. If these challenges cannot be properly addressed, an
   adversary can maliciously launch the injected or replayed message
   attacks to degrade the performance of smart grid. To cope with these
   challenging issues, in this paper, we propose an efficient
   authentication scheme that employs the Merkle hash tree technique to
   secure smart gird communication. Specifically, the proposed
   authentication scheme considers the smart meters with
   computation-constrained resources and puts the minimum computation
   overhead on them. Detailed security analysis indicates its security
   strength, namely, resilience to the replay attack, the message injection
   attack, the message analysis attack, and the message modification
   attack. In addition, extensive performance evaluation demonstrates its
   efficiency in terms of computation complexity and communication
   overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) spectroscopic techniques in conjunction
   with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) have been proposed to detect, and to
   classify noninvasively the levels of cell death in response to cancer
   therapy administration in tumor models. Evaluation of xenograft tumor
   responses to cancer treatments were carried out using
   conventional-frequency ultrasound at different times after chemotherapy
   exposure. Ultrasound data were analyzed using spectroscopic techniques
   and multi-parametric QUS spectral maps were generated. MMD was applied
   as a distance criterion, measuring alterations in each tumor in response
   to chemotherapy, and the extent of cell death was classified into
   less/more than 20\% and 40\% categories. Statistically significant
   differences were observed between ``pre-{''} and ``post-treatment{''}
   groups at different times after chemotherapy exposure, suggesting a high
   capability of proposed framework for detecting tumor response
   noninvasively. Promising results were also obtained for categorizing the
   extent of cell death response in each tumor using the proposed
   framework, with gold standard histological quantification of cell death
   as ground truth. The best classification results were obtained using MMD
   when applied on histograms of QUS parametric maps. In this case,
   classification accuracies of 84.7\% and 88.2\% were achieved for
   categorizing extent of tumor cell death into less/more than 20\% and
   40\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel selection algorithm of wavelet-based transformer
   differential current features is proposed. The minimum description
   length with entropy criteria are employed for an initial selection of
   the mother wavelet and the resolution level, respectively; whereas
   stepwise regression is applied for obtaining the most statistically
   significant features. Dimensionality reduction is accordingly achieved,
   with an acceptable accuracy maintained for classification. The validity
   of the proposed algorithm is tested through a neuro-wavelet-based
   classifier of transformer inrush and internal fault differential
   currents. The proposed algorithm highlights the potential of utilizing
   synergism of integrating multiple feature selection techniques as
   opposed to an individual technique, which ensures optimal selection of
   the features.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical isolation of fractured silicon and unstable solid
   electrolyte interphase formed on silicon's surface are two major issues
   preventing commercialization of silicon anodes in next-generation
   lithium ion batteries. In this work, we wrap silicon nanoparticles with
   graphene to maintain the electrical connection, meanwhile, isolating Si
   from the electrolyte to suppress SEI formation on the Si surface. A
   facile freeze-drying method followed by thermal reduction was used to
   synthesize the silicon-graphene (Si-G) composites. We found that the
   Si-NP's can be tightly wrapped by graphene when the composites utilized
   an optimal starting ratio of 1:2 (Si-NP:GO), attributing to
   significantly improved cyclic stability and cycle efficiency. Taking the
   facile fabrication method and the use of commercial Si-NP's into
   account, Si-G composites could be a promising candidate for the anode
   material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This letter presents a new dual band Volterra-based model suitable for
   the linearization of envelope tracking (ET) power amplifiers (PAs)

   compensate for the dynamic nonlinear distortions associated with the PA
   (assuming a constant drain supply voltage) and a polynomial term added
   to mitigate the distortions introduced by a dynamic drain supply
   modulation. The proposed model was successfully applied to linearize a
   10 W and a 45 W dual band ET PA concurrently driven with different
   arrangements of two signals modulated according to wideband code
   division multiple access and long-term evolution standards around 2.0
   and 2.2 GHz, and 2.1 and 2.9 GHz. A measured error vector magnitude of
   1.5\% and an adjacent channel power ratio better than -47 dBc,

Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to cast AA3003/AA4045 clad
   ingots via Fusion (TM) Technology, a novel process developed by Novelis
   Inc. for the production of aluminum clad materials such as brazing
   sheet. Experimental results were used to validate a steady-state
   thermofluids model of the Fusion (TM) Technology co-casting process. The
   numerical model was able to accurately predict the temperature field
   within the AA3003/AA4045 clad ingot as well as the shape of the AA3003
   liquid sump. The model was also used to quantify the temperature,
   fraction solid, and velocity fields in a clad ingot cast with an
   asymmetrical molten metal-feeding system. Feeding of core and clad
   molten metals at opposite corners of the mold was found to reduce the
   risks of hot spots and liquid metal breakthrough from the core sump to
   the clad side of the Fusion (TM) Technology mold. The use of a diffuser
   for the AA3003 core molten metal and of a vertical feeding tube for the
   AA4045 clad produced different flow patterns and liquid sump shapes on
   either side of the mold. The quality of the metallurgical bond at the
   core/clad interface appeared good near the clad inlet and at the ingot
   centerline, but poor near the edges of the ingot. SEM-EDS analysis of
   the chemical composition across the interface showed that a 1 to 20-mu
   m-deep penetration of silicon from the AA4045 clad into the AA3003 core
   had occurred at visually acceptable interfaces, whereas silicon
   diffusion across poor interfaces was very limited. A study of the
   model-predicted fraction solid history at different points along the
   interface indicated that reheating of the AA3003 core is not required to
   form a visually acceptable metallurgical bond. However, a sufficient
   amount of interaction time between the solid AA3003 core shell and the
   silicon-rich AA4045 clad liquid is required to chemically dissolve the
   surface of the core and form a good metallurgical bond. An approximate
   dissolution depth of 750 to 1000 mu m was observed along the visually
   good interface. Partial dissolution of the Mn-rich AA3003 core led to
   the formation of Al(Mn,Fe)Si intermetallic particles in the AA4045 clad
   and an increased manganese concentration near the core/clad interface.

Abstract = {{This study uses the CALPUFF modeling system to examine the impact of a
   region's geophysical and meteorological conditions on the dispersion of
   nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emitted from a new oil refinery proposed by the
   Newfoundland and Labrador Refining Corporation. The proposed
   construction site of the refinery in Placentia Bay in Newfoundland is
   compared to the three Canadian locations of Edmonton, Yarmouth, and
   Whitehorse due to the differences in their geophysical and
   meteorological conditions. NO2 was selected as the modeled contaminant
   for this study due to the many severe ecosystem, health, and societal
   risks associated with its exposure to humans, animals, and the
   environment. Differences on the impact of each studied region's
   geophysical and meteorological conditions led the proposed construction
   site in Newfoundland to be the only advisable construction site for this
   refinery out of the four regions examined. Although Yarmouth is also a
   coastal region, its geophysical and meteorological conditions cause NO2
   to disperse into the land, while in Newfoundland, NO2 is dispersed over
   water. The maximum NO2 concentrations simulated for Edmonton and
   Whitehorse are considerably high and exceed the NO2 limit for at least
   one of the two standards proposed by the Newfoundland and Labrador
   Department of Environment and Conservation and the National Ambient Air
   Quality Standard. Results show that a region's geophysical and
   meteorological conditions have large impacts on the dispersion of
   pollutants and require careful consideration when selecting a refinery
   site.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) prepared from cellulose fibre via sulfuric
   acid hydrolysis was used as an adsorbent for the removal of methylene
   blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The effects of pH, adsorbent dosage,
   temperature, ionic strength, initial dye concentration were studied to
   optimize the conditions for the maximum adsorption of dye. Adsorption
   equilibrium data was fitted to both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm
   models, where the Langmuir model better described the adsorption
   process. The maximum adsorption capacity was 118 mg dye/g CNC at 25 A
   degrees C and pH 9. Calculated thermodynamic parameters, such as free
   energy change (Delta G = -20.8 kJ/mol), enthalpy change (Delta H = -3.45
   kJ/mol), and entropy change (Delta S = 0.58 kJ/mol K) indicates that MB
   adsorption on CNCs is a spontaneous exothermic process. Tunability of
   the adsorption capacity by surface modification of CNCs was shown by
   oxidizing the primary hydroxyl groups on the CNC surface with TEMPO
   reagent and the adsorption capacity was increased from 118 to 769 mg

Abstract = {{Recently, a supervised dictionary learning (SDL) approach based on the
   Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) has been proposed that
   learns the dictionary and the corresponding sparse coefficients in a
   space where the dependency between the data and the corresponding labels
   is maximized. In this paper, two multiview dictionary learning
   techniques are proposed based on this HSIC-based SDL. While one of these
   two techniques learns one dictionary and the corresponding coefficients
   in the space of fused features in all views, the other learns one
   dictionary in each view and subsequently fuses the sparse coefficients
   in the spaces of learned dictionaries. The effectiveness of the proposed
   multiview learning techniques in using the complementary information of
   single views is demonstrated in the application of speech emotion
   recognition (SER). The fully-continuous sub-challenge (FCSC) of the AVEC
   2012 dataset is used in two different views: baseline and spectral
   energy distribution (SED) feature sets. Four dimensional affects, i.e.,
   arousal, expectation, power, and valence are predicted using the
   proposed multiview methods as the continuous response variables. The
   results are compared with the single views, AVEC 2012 baseline system,
   and also other supervised and unsupervised multiview learning approaches
   in the literature. Using correlation coefficient as the performance
   measure in predicting the continuous dimensional affects, it is shown
   that the proposed approach achieves the highest performance among the
   rivals. The relative performance of the two proposed multiview
   techniques and their relationship are also discussed. Particularly, it
   is shown that by providing an additional constraint on the dictionary of
   one of these approaches, it becomes the same as the other.}},

Abstract = {{Ni foam and carbon fiber cloth were tested as three-dimensional (3D)
   current collectors for a sulfur/polypyrrole composite cathode in lithium
   batteries. The cell with the carbon fiber current collector has
   exhibited remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance compared with
   its Ni foam counterpart, delivering a high initial capacity of 1,278 mAh
   g(-1) and maintaining a discharge capacity at 810 mAh g(-1) after 40
   cycles at 0.06 C. Furthermore, the carbon fiber-based cell demonstrated
   a better rate capability and delivered a highly reversible discharge
   capacity of 397 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.5 C, representing an
   increase of 194 mAh g(-1) compared to the Ni foam counterpart. The
   electrochemical property investigations along with scanning electron
   microscope studies have revealed that the carbon fiber current collector
   possesses a three-dimensional network structure, provides an effective
   electron conduction path, and minimizes the loss of electrical contact
   within the deposited cathode material during cycling. These results
   indicate that the carbon fiber cloth can be used as a promising,
   effective, and inexpensive current collector for Li/S batteries.}},

   simulations of the warm forming process are performed using a coupled

   material model combines the Bergstrom hardening rule with Barlat's
   YLD2000 yield function and was implemented in LS-DYNA as a user-defined
   material model. Selected experimental cases were modelled numerically

Title = {{Decentralized Modal Identification of a Pony Truss Pedestrian Bridge
   Using Wireless Sensors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Most of the vibration-based ambient modal identification methods in the
   literature are structured to process vibration data collected from a
   dense array of sensors centrally to yield modal information. For large
   systems, for example bridges, one of the main disadvantages of such a
   centralized architecture is the cost of dense instrumentation,
   predominantly consisting of the sensors themselves, the data acquisition
   system, and the associated cabling. Recent advances in wireless smart
   sensors have addressed the issue of sensor cost to some extent; however,
   most of the algorithms-with the exception of very few-still retain an
   essentially centralized architecture. To harness the full potential of
   decentralized implementation, the authors have developed a new class of
   algorithms exploiting the concepts of sparsity (using wavelet
   transforms) within the framework of blind source separation. The problem
   of identification is cast within the framework of underdetermined blind
   source separation invoking transformations of measurements to the
   wavelet domain resulting in a sparse representation. Although the
   details of these decentralized algorithms have been discussed in other
   articles, in this paper, for the first time, these algorithms are
   studied experimentally on a full-scale structure using wireless sensors.
   In a truly decentralized implementation, only two sensors are roved
   along the length of a pedestrian bridge, and the performance of the
   proposed algorithms is studied in detail. A pedestrian bridge located in
   Montreal, Quebec, Canada, is chosen primarily to highlight the
   methodology used to address modal identification under low-sensor
   density and for pedestrian loading. Issues arising from several modes
   being excited on this bridge and the presence of narrowband pedestrian
   excitations are addressed. The accuracy of modal identification that is
   achieved using the proposed decentralized algorithms is compared with
   the results obtained from their centralized counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family plays an
   important role in cell growth and signaling and alteration of its
   function has been demonstrated in many different kinds of cancer.
   Receptor dimerization is necessary for the HER signal transduction
   pathway and tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, several monoclonal
   antibodies have been developed to directly interfere with ligand-HER
   receptor binding and receptor dimerization. A single chain variable
   fragment (ScFv) is a valuable alternative to an intact antibody. This
   report describes the production and purification of an ScFv specific for
   domain II of the HER2 receptor in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cytoplasm.
   The majority of expressed of anti-her2his-ScFv protein was produced as
   inclusion bodies. A Ni-NTA affinity column was used to purify the
   anti-her2his-ScFv protein. The molecular weight of anti-her2his-ScFv
   protein was estimated to be approximately 27 kDa, as confirmed by
   SDS-PAGE and Western blotting assay. The anti-her2his-ScFv showed near
   95 \% purity and reached a yield of approximately 29 mg/l in flask
   fermentation. The purified anti-her2his-ScFv showed its biological
   activity by binding to HER2 receptor on the surface of BT-474 cells.
   This ScFv may be a potential pharmaceutical candidate for targeting
   tumour cells overexpressing HER2 receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate performance assessment of building systems and subsystems
   (e.g., roof, boiler, windows, etc.) is essential to properly prioritize
   the subsystems that compete for capital renewal funding. Typically, the
   performance assessment of buildings has been based on physical condition
   alone, which is not sufficient for specialized facilities such as
   hospitals. This paper introduces a practical multicriteria performance
   assessment framework for hospitals with four unique features: (1) it
   divides the hospital into three zones with different characteristics and
   importance: clinical, nursing, and support; (2) it assesses the
   performance of hospital subsystems, considering four key performance
   indicators: condition, level of service, sustainability, and risk; (3)

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are able to compensate any undergoing plastic
   deformations and return to their memorized shape. Such a behavior
   persuades industrialists to use them for different engineering
   applications, as smart actuators and sensors. Because of their vast
   applications, it is crucial to engineers to develop effective
   identification tools capable of simulating the behavior of SMAs.
   However, SMA actuators have complex and hysteric behavior that in turn
   obstructs the modeling process. The motivation behind the current study
   emanates in the pursuit of developing efficient prediction tools for
   effective modeling of SMA actuators. Actually, after several experiments
   and software simulations, the authors develop a hybrid intelligent tool
   which takes advantage of the self-organizing Pareto based evolutionary
   algorithm (SOPEA) and simultaneous recurrent neural network (SRNN), as a
   black-box model, to automatically identify the behavior of SMA. SOPEA is
   a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm which is based on the concepts
   of survival of the fittest, non-dominated sorting and information
   recruitment. The information recruitment is guaranteed by applying an
   un-supervised neuro computing technique, i.e. adaptive self organizing
   map (ASOM) with conscience mechanism. ASOM is an un-supervised network
   that assists SOPEA to recognize the non-dominated patterns and produce
   further non-dominated solutions. Together with the structure of SOPEA,
   the authors follow a comprehensive preference-based strategy to exploit
   the desired regions in the Pareto front. This occurs through introducing
   deliberate reference points. The outcome method is applied to the design
   of SRNN for modeling the SMA actuator. It is demonstrated that the
   designed optimization tool can show acceptable performance for the
   present case study within the imposed computational budget. Besides,
   through a rigorous experimental procedure, it is indicated that by
   applying an efficient artificial system, the behavior of SMA can be
   identified without any specific knowledge of the physical conditions and
   governing equations.}},

Abstract = {{A technique has been developed to modify the melt properties of

   effect of processing conditions, such as photoinitiator concentration,
   duration of irradiation, UV lamp intensity, cooling air pressure, and
   photoinitiator type, on rheological properties, molecular weight
   characteristics and branching level. Samples were evaluated through
   linear viscoelastic (LVE) measurements, extensional rheometry, gel
   content, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). Results clearly indicated that PP can be successfully
   modified in order to enhance strain hardening behaviour without

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1129-1148}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an adaptive atomistic- continuum numerical method
   for quasi-static crack growth. The phantom node method is used to model
   the crack in the continuum region and a molecular statics model is used
   near the crack tip. To ensure self-consistency in the bulk, a virtual
   atom cluster is used to model the material of the coarse scale. The
   coupling between the coarse scale and fine scale is realized through
   ghost atoms. The ghost atom positions are interpolated from the coarse
   scale solution and enforced as boundary conditions on the fine scale.
   The fine scale region is adaptively enlarged as the crack propagates and
   the region behind the crack tip is adaptively coarsened. An energy
   criterion is used to detect the crack tip location. The triangular
   lattice in the fine scale region corresponds to the lattice structure of
   the (111) plane of an FCC crystal. The Lennard-Jones potential is used
   to model the atom-atom interactions. The method is implemented in two
   dimensions. The results are compared to pure atomistic simulations; they
   show excellent agreement.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Although the Chandler loop model has been used in various in vitro flow
   studies, there is a lack of guidance on the selection of the appropriate
   sample volume. The questions of how to determine the appropriate sample
   volume and its effect on blood activation have not been fully addressed.
   This study proposes a new criterion for determining sample volume and
   defines a time-averaged wall shear stress equation for this model. In
   vitro experiments were performed to investigate the implications of
   sample volume on blood cell activation in the presence of model stent.
   Experimental results indicated that in the absence of a stent and for
   shear stress up to about 56 dyn/cm(2), platelet activation was
   independent of volume and shear. On the other hand, the formation of
   platelet-leukocyte aggregates was affected by volume as well as the
   presence of a stent. Doubling blood volume for the same stent resulted
   in a twofold decrease in platelet microparticle formation and
   platelet-leukocyte aggregation. These results demonstrate the importance
   of selecting appropriate sample volume for the Chandler loop model,
   since it influences blood activation parameters, especially
   platelet-leukocyte aggregation formation, which can play an important
   role in material-induced thrombosis. These results have significance for
   in vitro screening of materials for biocompatibility.}},

   measurements of adenine molecules adsorbed on these sub-micron

   substrates. The sensitivity is such that these structures are
   potentially useful as single particle SERS substrates for bio-sensing.
   Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation results indicate that

   number. A method is presented to estimate this value, and its effect on
   hydrogen production is evaluated, along with that of temperature and
   residence time. For this purpose, the thermocatalytic decomposition of
   methane is modeled with the inclusion of the number of active sites of
   the catalyst in the kinetics. The results of the model indicate the high
   influence of variations of small residence times in this process, and
   the reduction of this effect at high temperatures. Also, the effect of
   the number of surface sites is shown to be more prominent at low
   residence times and temperatures. (c) 2014 American Institute of

   The relationship between the magnitude of the RPS signal and the applied

   understood by the induced thicker electrical double layer (EDL) around

Journal = {{ORGANIC ELECTRONICS}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{1096-1104}},

Abstract = {{We study the factors governing the dark and photo currents in lateral
   organic photodetectors (OPD). The dark current is found to be strongly
   limited by space charge limited conduction (SCLC) across a highly
   depleted gap and arises mostly from transient capacitive currents due to
   the charge accumulation in the organic layers near the contacts.
   Similarly, the photocurrent is found to be strongly limited by the
   collection of photogenerated carriers at the contacts, which limits the
   sensitivity of lateral OPDs. Furthermore, evidence of the contribution
   of some photons falling outside of the gap area are reported and have to
   be taken into account when one wants to conduct accurate external
   quantum efficiency estimates of lateral OPDs. Finally, it is found that
   the dark current is significantly increased after the device is exposed
   to light, likely to be due to the filling of charge traps by
   photogenerated carriers, while the photocurrent remains unchanged,
   leading to a decrease in the overall sensitivity of the device upon
   repeated exposure to light. The results shed the light on the
   performance limitations in lateral OPDs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{A general structure of the Welch-Gong (WG) stream cipher family is based
   on filtering an m-sequence of degree l over a finite field F-2m where
   the filtering function is a WG transformation from F-2m to F-2. For a
   fixed m and l, the linear span of the filtering sequence can be enhanced
   by increasing the algebraic degree of the WG transformations. This can
   be accomplished by the composition of a WG transformation with a
   monomial permutation, which is called the decimation of a WG
   transformation. In this paper, we first present the new exponent set of
   WG transformations, and show the existence of exponents derived from the
   new exponent set for which a decimated WG transformation achieves the
   maximum algebraic degree. As a result, the linear span of keystreams
   produced by a decimated WG cipher can be maximized and calculated
   theoretically. We then give a description of a decimated WG stream
   cipher which is built upon an LFSR and a decimated WG transformation
   over an extension field. The randomness properties of keystreams
   produced by a decimated WG cipher are derived based on the new exponent
   set. We also discuss the selection criteria for choosing the optimal
   parameters for the WG cipher family in order to achieve the maximum
   level of security. Finally, we present the optimal parameters for the WG
   transformations over F-2m,F- 7 <= m <= 16 based on the proposed
   criteria.}},

Title = {{On the origins of the mitotic shift in proliferating cell layers}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: During plant and animal development, monolayer cell sheets
   display a stereotyped distribution of polygonal cell shapes. In
   interphase cells these shapes range from quadrilaterals to decagons,
   with a robust average of six sides per cell. In contrast, the subset of
   cells in mitosis exhibits a distinct distribution with an average of
   seven sides. It remains unclear whether this `mitotic shift' reflects a
   causal relationship between increased polygonal sidedness and increased
   division likelihood, or alternatively, a passive effect of local
   proliferation on cell shape.
   Methods: We use a combination of probabilistic analysis and mathematical
   modeling to predict the geometry of mitotic polygonal cells in a
   proliferating cell layer. To test these predictions experimentally, we
   use Flp-Out stochastic labeling in the Drosophila wing disc to induce
   single cell clones, and confocal imaging to quantify the polygonal
   topologies of these clones as a function of cellular age. For a more
   generic test in an idealized cell layer, we model epithelial sheet
   proliferation in a finite element framework, which yields a
   computationally robust, emergent prediction of the mitotic cell shape
   distribution.
   Results: Using both mathematical and experimental approaches, we show
   that the mitotic shift derives primarily from passive, non-autonomous
   effects of mitoses in neighboring cells on each cell's geometry over the
   course of the cell cycle. Computationally, we predict that interphase
   cells should passively gain sides over time, such that cells at more
   advanced stages of the cell cycle will tend to have a larger number of
   neighbors than those at earlier stages. Validating this prediction,
   experimental analysis of randomly labeled epithelial cells in the
   Drosophila wing disc demonstrates that labeled cells exhibit an
   age-dependent increase in polygonal sidedness. Reinforcing these data,
   finite element simulations of epithelial sheet proliferation demonstrate
   in a generic framework that passive side-gaining is sufficient to
   generate a mitotic shift.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the
   mitotic shift reflects a time-dependent accumulation of shared cellular
   interfaces over the course of the cell cycle. These results uncover
   fundamental constraints on the relationship between cell shape and cell
   division that should be general in adherent, polarized cell layers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to investigate the free vibration of
   nonlinear material graduations of a nanobeam based on the nonlocal
   Timoshenko theory using finite element method. The non-classical

   which captures the small scale effect. The material properties of the
   functionally graded (FG) nanobeam are assumed to vary nonlinearly in the
   thickness direction. The location of neutral axis is determined and the
   kinematic fit conditions of the nanobeam are proposed according to super
   convergent Timoshenko beam. A numerical solution of the equation of
   motion is obtained through the finite element method (FEM). The
   developed methodology is applied to detect the free vibration response
   of different nano-Timoshenko beams with different boundary conditions,
   material exponents, and nonlocality parameters. The obtained numerical
   results are reflected the significant effect of neutral axis position,
   material distribution profile, and the nonlocality parameter on the

Abstract = {{Musicians sway expressively as they play in ways that seem clearly
   related to the music, but quantifying the relationship has been
   difficult. We suggest that a complex systems framework and its

   identify the motor synergies involved. Synergies are temporary
   assemblies of parts that come together to accomplish specific goals. We
   assume that the goal of the performer is to convey musical structure and
   expression to the audience and to other performers. We provide examples
   of how dynamical systems tools, such as recurrence quantification
   analysis (RQA), can be used to examine performers' movements and relate
   them to the musical structure and to the musician's expressive
   intentions. We show how detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) can be used

   temperature required, relative to other hydrocarbon species. In this
   context, a monolith-supported Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was evaluated for CH4
   combustion under fuel lean and fuel rich mixtures using temperature
   programmed reaction (TPRxn) and step-change temperature and oxygen level
   experiments. The experiments included performance evaluation during both
   ignition (increasing temperature) and extinction (decreasing temperature
   after ignition). Conversion hysteresis was observed, with the
   conversions during extinction higher than those during ignition under
   fuel lean or stoichiometric combustion reaction conditions. Results
   obtained demonstrate that this hysteresis effect can be used to achieve
   high CH4 oxidation conversions at temperatures lower than that required
   for ignition, admittedly first through using high temperatures to obtain
   ignition, then lowering the temperature to take advantage of the
   hysteresis. Results also suggest that changing O-2 levels can lead to
   similar benefits. With the assumption that lean conditions and lower
   exhaust temperatures are associated with improved fuel economy, while
   higher exhaust temperatures and fuel rich conditions lead to higher CH4
   oxidation rates over the catalyst, the findings presented clearly
   demonstrate the potential to achieve both via a cyclic operating
   approach, with the frequency on the order of 10 s of minutes. Data
   obtained when cycling between temperatures above and below the ignition
   point and between excess O-2 and stoichiometric O-2 levels proved this
   hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new nanowire based, junction-less phototransistor, that
   consists of a channel with both wide and narrow regions to ensure
   efficient light absorption and low dark current, respectively. While the
   light is absorbed in the wide region, the narrow region allows for ease
   of band engineering. We also find that a nanowire in the source can
   further boost the optical gain. The proposed device, which can
   potentially detect very low light intensities, does not rely on
   complicated doping profiles, but instead uses suitably designed gates.
   Our calculations show the detection of a photon flux as low as 35 per
   second. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The efficient delivery of nucleic acids as therapeutic agents is a major
   challenge in gene therapy. Peptides have recently emerged as a novel
   carrier for delivery of drugs and genes. C6M1 is a designed amphipathic
   peptide with the ability to form stable complexes with short interfering
   RNA (siRNA). The peptide showed a combination of random coil and helical
   structure in water but mainly adopted a helical conformation in the
   presence of anions or siRNA. Revealed by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and microscopy techniques, the interaction of C6M1 and siRNA in water
   and HEPES led to complexes of similar to 70 and similar to 155 nm in
   size, respectively, but showed aggregates as large as similar to 500 nm
   in PBS. The time-dependent aggregation of the complex in PBS was studied
   by DLS and fluorescence spectroscopy. At molar ratio of 15:1, C6M1 was
   able to completely encapsulate siRNA; however, higher molar ratios were
   required to obtain stable complexes. Naked siRNA was completely degraded
   in 4 h in the solution of 50\% serum; however C6M1 protected siRNA
   against serum RNase over the period of 24 h. Western blotting experiment
   showed similar to 72\% decrease in GAPDH protein level of the cells
   treated with C6M1-siRNA complexes while no significant knockdown was
   observed for the cells treated with naked siRNA.}},

Title = {{Variance decomposition: A tool enabling strategic improvement of the
   precision of analytical recovery and concentration estimates associated
   with microorganism enumeration methods}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{203-214}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Concentrations of particular types of microorganisms are commonly
   measured in various waters, yet the accuracy and precision of reported
   microorganism concentration values are often questioned due to the
   imperfect analytical recovery of quantitative microbiological methods
   and the considerable variation among fully replicated measurements. The
   random error in analytical recovery estimates and unbiased concentration
   estimates may be attributable to several sources, and knowing the
   relative contribution from each source can facilitate strategic design
   of experiments to yield more precise data or provide an acceptable level
   of information with fewer data. Herein, variance decomposition using the
   law of total variance is applied to previously published probabilistic
   models to explore the relative contributions of various sources of
   random error and to develop tools to aid experimental design. This work
   focuses upon enumeration-based methods with imperfect analytical
   recovery (such as enumeration of Cryptosporidium oocysts), but the
   results also yield insights about plating methods and microbial methods
   in general. Using two hypothetical analytical recovery profiles, the
   variance decomposition method is used to explore 1) the design of an
   experiment to quantify variation in analytical recovery (including the
   size and precision of seeding suspensions and the number of samples),
   and 2) the design of an experiment to estimate a single microorganism
   concentration (including sample volume, effects of improving analytical
   recovery, and replication). In one illustrative example, a strategically
   designed analytical recovery experiment with 6 seeded samples would
   provide as much information as an alternative experiment with 15 seeded
   samples. Several examples of diminishing returns are illustrated to show
   that efforts to reduce error in analytical recovery and concentration
   estimates can have negligible effect if they are directed at trivial
   error sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The constitutive response of a commercial magnesium alloy rolled sheet
   (AZ31B-O) is studied based on room temperature tensile and compressive
   tests at strain rates ranging from 10(-3) to 10(3) s(-1) . Because of
   its strong basal texture, this alloy exhibits a significant
   tension-compression asymmetry (strength differential) that is manifest
   further in terms of rather different strain rate sensitivity under
   tensile versus compressive loading. Under tensile loading, this alloy
   exhibits conventional positive strain rate sensitivity. Under
   compressive loading, the flow stress is initially rate insensitive until
   twinning is exhausted after which slip processes are activated, and
   conventional rate sensitivity is recovered. The material exhibits rather
   mild in-plane anisotropy in terms of strength, but strong transverse
   anisotropy (r-value), and a high degree of variation in the measured
   r-values along the different sheet orientations which is indicative of a
   higher degree of anisotropy than that observed based solely upon the
   variation in stresses. This rather complex behaviour is attributed to
   the strong basal texture, and the different deformation mechanisms being
   activated as the orientation and sign of applied loading are varied. A
   new constitutive equation is proposed to model the measured compressive
   behaviour that captures the rate sensitivity of the sigmoidal
   stress-strain response. The measured tensile stress-strain response is
   fit to the Zerilli-Armstrong hcp material model.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater is described by a number of physical and chemical parameters
   that are useful in measurement and analysis of materiel effects. The
   material dissolved in seawater will not only affect its specific
   gravity, but also its optical properties, or rather, the degree to which
   light is refracted as it passes through the sample of water. The
   specific gravity and refractive index of seawater are related directly
   to salinity and temperature. In this work, an attempt has been made to
   develop simple predictive tools to estimate specific gravity and
   refractive index of seawater as a function of salinity and temperature.
   Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in
   the literature with average absolute deviation being less than 0.2\%.The
   predictive tool developed in this study can be of immense practical
   value for engineers to have a quick estimate on the specific gravity and
   refractive index of seawater without opting for any experimental trials.
   In particular, process and water treatment engineers would find the
   proposed method to be user-friendly with transparent calculations

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in fullerene-based Schottky organic solar cells (OSCs)
   are presented, with a focus on the current understanding of device
   physics. Fullerene-based Schottky OSCs attain high open-circuit voltages
   due to the n-type Schottky junction formed between fullerene and an
   adjacent high work function anode. Small concentrations of donor
   material doped into the fullerene matrix serve as efficient exciton
   dissociation and hole transport agents that can substantially bolster
   short-circuit currents and fill factors. As a consequence,
   fullerene-based Schottky OSCs have been demonstrated to provide some of
   the highest-performance vacuum-deposited small molecule OSCs, with power
   conversion efficiencies up to 8.1\%. Fullerene-based Schottky OSCs
   constructed using different donor materials and varying cathode buffer
   layers, as studied by a number of different research groups, are
   presented. To elucidate the differences between Schottky OSCs and more
   traditional bulk-heterojunction OSCs, we discuss the photophysics of
   fullerenes, the role of the donor material, and charge transport in low
   donor concentration active layers. Fullerene-based Schottky OSCs possess
   considerable advantages because they can reach high efficiencies with a
   simple structure using readily available and cost-effective materials.
   The impact and applicability of the Schottky device architecture on the
   field of organic photovoltaics at large are discussed.}},

Title = {{Modeling cell elongation during germ band retraction: cell autonomy
   versus applied anisotropic stress}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{The morphogenetic process of germ band retraction in Drosophila embryos
   involves coordinated movements of two epithelial tissues-germ band and
   amnioserosa. The germ band shortens along its rostral-caudal or
   head-to-tail axis, widens along its perpendicular dorsal-ventral axis,
   and uncurls from an initial `U' shape. The amnioserosa mechanically
   assists this process by pulling on the crook of the U-shaped germ band.
   The amnioserosa may also provide biochemical signals that drive germ
   band cells to change shape in a mechanically autonomous fashion. Here,
   we use a finite-element model to investigate how these two contributions
   reshape the germ band. We do so by modeling the response to
   laser-induced wounds in each of the germ band's spatially distinct
   segments (T1-T3, A1-A9) during the middle of retraction when segments
   T1-A3 form the ventral arm of the `U', A4-A7 form its crook, and A8-A9
   complete the dorsal arm. We explore these responses under a range of
   externally applied stresses and internal anisotropy of cell edge
   tensions-akin to a planar cell polarity that can drive elongation of
   cells in a direction parallel to the minimum edge tension-and identify
   regions of parameter space (edge-tension anisotropy versus stress
   anisotropy) that best match previous experiments for each germ band
   segment. All but three germ band segments are best fit when the applied
   stress anisotropy and the edge-tension anisotropy work against one
   another-i. e., when the isolated effects would elongate cells in
   perpendicular directions. Segments in the crook of the germ band (A4-A7)
   have cells that elongate in the direction of maximum external stress,
   i.e., external stress anisotropy is dominant. In most other segments,
   the dominant factor is internal edge-tension anisotropy. These results
   are consistent with models in which the amnioserosa pulls on the crook
   of the germ band to mechanically assist retraction. In addition, they
   suggest a mechanical cue for edge-tension anisotropy whereby cells do
   not globally orient their internal elongation axis towards the
   amnioserosa, but instead orient this axis perpendicular to the local
   principal stress direction.}},

Title = {{Optimally pruned extreme learning machine with ensemble of
   regularization techniques and negative correlation penalty applied to
   automotive engine coldstart hydrocarbon emission identification}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, the authors test the efficacy and reliability of
   optimally pruned extreme learning machine with ensemble of
   regularization techniques to identify the exhaust gas temperature
   (T-exh) and the engine-out hydrocarbon emission (HCraw) during the
   coldstart operation of automotive engines. These variables have
   significant impact on the cumulative tailpipe emissions (HCcum) during a
   coldstart phenomenon, which is the number one emission-related problem
   for today's spark-ignited (SI) engine vehicles. To do so, the concepts
   of ensemble computing with negative correlation learning (NCL) and
   pruning of neurons are used in tandem to cope with difficulties
   associated with extracting knowledge from collected database. In the
   proposed framework, the regularization strategies are adopted to help us
   increasing the numerical stability of identifier while mitigating the
   redundant complexity of hidden neurons. Moreover, to increase the
   generalization of identifier and also reduce the effects of uncertainty,
   an ensemble of independent OP-ELM with NCL selection criterion called
   OP-ELM-ER-NCL is taken into account. To endorse the valid performance of
   OP-ELM-ER-NCL for modeling the characteristics of engine over the
   coldstart phenomenon, its performance is compared to a set of well-known
   identification systems, i.e. standard extreme learning machine (ELM),
   back-propagation neural network (BPNN), OP-ELM with different types of
   regularization, ensemble of regularized OP-ELM without negative
   correlation (OP-ELM-ER), and an ensemble ELM with a constrained linear
   system of leave-one-out outputs (E-LL), in terms of both accuracy and
   computational complexity. The simulation results indicate that the
   proposed identifier is really capable of capturing the knowledge of
   collected database. It is observed that its resulted accuracy and
   robustness are comparable with those obtained by identification methods
   available in the literature. Besides, using NCL strategy aids the
   ensemble to select the most effective regularization techniques and
   remove the redundant (ineffective) ones, which consequently decreases
   the complexity of final ensemble. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Organic electron beam resists are typically not resistant to the plasma

   Here, the authors present the incorporation of a metal hard mask
   material into negative resist polystyrene by co-evaporation of the

   selectivity to silicon one order higher than pure polystyrene resist.
   Silicon structures of 100 nm width and 3 : 5 mu m height (aspect ratio
   1: 35) were obtained using a non-switching deep silicon etching recipe
   with SF6 and C4F8 gas. Moreover, unlike the common spin coating method,
   evaporated nanocomposite resist can be coated onto irregular and
   non-flat surfaces such as optical fibers and AFM cantilevers. As a proof
   of concept, we fabricated high aspect ratio structures on top of an AFM
   cantilever. Nanofabrication on non-flat surfaces may find applications

Abstract = {{Amino acid pairing peptide-based nanoparticles were recently introduced
   as promising carriers for hydrophobic anticancer drugs. The AC8 peptide,
   n-FEFQFNFK-c, is based on the amino acid pairing (AAP) design with 8
   amino acids and hence the designated name AAP8. The nanoparticles (NPs)
   AAP8 have modified either on the C-terminal or on both terminal, by
   conjugation with diethylene glycol (DEG). Here, the in vitro
   biocompatibilities of the NPs and their modified versions were compared
   and the potential of these NPs as carriers for the hydrophobic
   anticancer drug pirarubicin was determined as well as the peptide-drug
   co-assembly complexes. The toxicity of the NPs, DEGylated NPs, and
   blended mixtures with pirarubicin, was tested against the human
   adenocarcinoma lung cancer cell line, A549. The amino-end DEGylated NP,
   (NP-I), had superior biocompatibility over the non-modified NPs or
   double DEGylated NPs (NP-II). NP-I had very low hemolytic activity (1\%)
   while NP and NP-II had marginal (8\%) and acceptable (5\%) hemolytic
   activity, respectively. All three types of NPs did not activate the
   complement system via the classical and alternative pathways nor did
   they activate the anaphylotoxin C3a. However, NP-II and its drug complex
   effectively activate the complement terminal attack complex. The lectin
   pathway was not activated by NP-I and NP-II, but was to a small extent
   by the non-modified NPs, with no lectin activation when complexed with
   drug. These results indicate NP-I is the most promising peptide for use
   as a drug delivery system, highlighting the importance of proper
   modification in peptides for drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{A critical challenge in biomedical imaging is to optimally balance the
   trade-off among image resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and acquisition
   time. Acquiring a high-resolution image is possible; however, it is
   either expensive or time consuming or both. Resolution is also limited
   by the physical properties of the imaging device, such as the nature and
   size of the input source radiation and the optics of the device.
   Super-resolution (SR), which is an off-line approach for improving the
   resolution of an image, is free of these trade-offs. Several
   methodologies, such as interpolation, frequency domain, regularization,
   and learning-based approaches, have been developed over the past several
   years for SR of natural images. We review some of these methods and
   demonstrate the positive impact expected from SR of retinal images and
   investigate the performance of various SR techniques. We use a fundus
   image as an example for simulations. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{In recent years, the genus Clostridium has risen to the forefront of
   both medical biotechnology and industrial biotechnology owing to its
   potential in applications as diverse as anticancer therapy and
   production of commodity chemicals and biofuels. The prevalence of
   hyper-virulent strains of C. difficile within medical institutions has
   also led to a global epidemic that demands a more thorough understanding
   of clostridial genetics, physiology, and pathogenicity. Unfortunately.
   Clostridium suffers from a lack of sophisticated genetic tools and
   techniques which has hindered the biotechnological exploitation of this
   important bacterial genus. This review provides a comprehensive summary
   of biotechnological progress made in clostridial genetic tool
   development, while also aiming to serve as a technical guide for the
   advancement of underdeveloped clostridial strains, including
   recalcitrant species, novel environmental samples, and non-type strains.
   Relevant strain engineering techniques, from genome sequencing and
   establishment of a gene transfer methodology through to deployment of
   advanced genome editing procedures, are discussed in detail to provide a
   blueprint for future clostridial strain construction endeavors. It is
   expected that a more thorough and rounded-out genetic toolkit available
   for use in the clostridia will bring about the construction of superior
   bioprocessing strains and a more complete understanding of clostridial
   genetics, physiology, and pathogenicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Discovering sequence patterns with variations unveils significant
   functions of a protein family. Existing combinatorial methods of
   discovering patterns with variations are computationally expensive, and
   probabilistic methods require more elaborate probabilistic
   representation of the amino acid associations. To overcome these
   shortcomings, this paper presents a new computationally efficient method
   for representing patterns with variations in a compact representation
   called Aligned Pattern Cluster (AP Cluster). To tackle the runtime, our
   method discovers a shortened list of non-redundant statistically
   significant sequence associations based on our previous work. To address
   the representation of protein functional regions, our pattern alignment
   and clustering step, presented in this paper captures the conservations
   and variations of the aligned patterns. We further refine our solution
   to allow more coverage of sequences via extending the AP Clusters
   containing only statistically significant patterns to Weak and Conserved
   AP Clusters. When applied to the cytochrome c, the ubiquitin, and the
   triosephosphate isomerase protein families, our algorithm identifies the
   binding segments as well as the binding residues. When compared to other
   methods, ours discovers all binding sites in the AP Clusters with
   superior entropy and coverage. The identification of patterns with
   variations help biologists to avoid time-consuming simulations and
   experimentations. (Software available upon request).}},

Abstract = {{Although synthesis of H-infinity controllers via solution of algebraic
   Riccati equations (AREs) has been known for several decades, there is
   not a generally accepted algorithm that is suitable for large-scale
   systems. However, systems of large model order arise in a number of
   situations, for instance in approximation of partial differential
   equation models and power systems. Often the System descriptions are
   sparse when in generalized state-space form but not when converted to
   standard first-order form. An extension of a game-theoretic iterative
   algorithm to solve the H-infinity algebraic Riccati equations for large
   generalized systems is presented. The highlight of this work is to
   preserve the sparse structure of the system description by using the
   generalized form instead of converting it into standard form. The
   proposed method is compared to other methods using several examples. It
   is shown that this method is accurate, even near optimal attenuation
   where the standard method cannot be used. The proposed method also
   performs well for a problem of structural control where other methods
   cannot be used. A method for calculating optimal attenuation that is
   significantly faster than the usual bisection procedure is also
   described. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) facility models are in increasing demand for
   design, maintenance, operations, and construction project management.
   For industrial and research facilities, a key focus is piping, which may
   comprise 50\% of the value of the facility. In this paper, a practical
   and cost-effective approach based on the Hough transform and judicious
   use of domain constraints is presented to automatically find, recognize,
   and reconstruct 3D pipes within laser-scan-acquired point clouds. The
   core algorithm utilizes the Hough transform's efficacy for detecting
   parametric shapes in noisy data by applying it to projections of
   orthogonal slices to grow cylindrical pipe shapes within a 3D
   pointcloud. This supports faster and less-expensive built-facility
   modeling. It is validated using laser-scanner data from construction of
   the Engineering-VI building on the University of Waterloo campus. The
   system works on a typical laptop. Recognition results are within a few
   millimeters to centimeters accuracy in accordance with the chosen
   tessellation of the Hough space. Broad applications to pipe-network
   modeling are possible. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{A semianalytical grid-free series solution method is presented for
   modeling 3-D steady state free boundary groundwater-surface water
   exchange in geometrically complex stratified aquifers. Continuous
   solutions for pressure in the subsurface are determined
   semianalytically, as is the location of the water table surface. Mass
   balance is satisfied exactly over the entire domain except along
   boundaries and interfaces between layers, where errors are shown to be
   acceptable. The solutions are derived and demonstrated on a number of
   test cases and the errors are assessed and discussed. This accurate and
   grid-free scheme can also be a helpful tool for providing insight into
   lake-aquifer and stream-aquifer interactions. Here it is used to assess
   the impact of lake sediment geometry and properties on lake-aquifer
   interactions. Various combinations of lake sediment are considered and
   the appropriateness of the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation for
   simulating lake bottom flux distribution is investigated. In addition,
   the method is applied to a test problem of surface seepage flows from a
   complex topographic surface; this test case demonstrated the method's

Abstract = {{The degradation mechanisms of phosphorescent organic light-emitting
   devices (PhOLEDs) are studied. The results show that PhOLED degradation
   is closely linked to interactions between excitons and positive polarons
   in the host material of the emitter layer (EML), which lead to its
   aggregation near the EML/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. This
   exciton-polaron-induced aggregation (EPIA) is associated with the
   emergence of new emission bands at longer wavelengths in the
   electroluminescence spectra of these materials, which can be detected
   after prolonged device operation. Such EPIA processes are found to occur
   in a variety of wide-bandgap materials commonly used as hosts in PhOLEDs
   and are correlated with device degradation. Quite notably, the extent of
   EPIA appears to correlate with the material's bandgap rather than with
   the glass-transition temperature. The findings uncover a new degradation
   mechanism, caused by polaron-exciton interactions, that appears to be
   behind the lower stability of OLEDs utilizing wide-bandgap materials in
   general. The same degradation mechanism can be expected to be present in
   other organic optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple patterning lithography is the most likely manufacturing process
   for sub-32nm technology nodes. Among different multiple patterning
   methods, self-aligned patterning has attracted much interest due to its
   robustness against overlay errors. However, self-aligned patterning
   compliance is subject to the litho-friendliness of the applied
   decomposition method. This brief establishes self-aligned triple
   patterning (SATP) decomposition requirements and proposes a
   litho-friendly layout decomposition method. First, the major SATP
   litho-friendliness requirements are explained. In-silico experiments on
   SATP process indicate that layout features printed by the structural
   spacers are the most accurate ones. Therefore, we propose an ILP-based
   decomposition which avoids decomposition conflicts and maximizes the use
   of structural spacers simultaneously. Experiments reveal that the
   proposed method improves overlay robustness and line-edge roughness of
   the attempted test cases.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive mathematical model of the hot extrusion process for
   aluminum alloys has been developed and validated. The plasticity module
   was developed using a commercial finite element package, DEFORM-2D, a
   transient Lagrangian model which couples the thermal and deformation
   phenomena. Validation of the model against industrial data indicated
   that it gave excellent predictions of the pressure during extrusion. The
   finite element predictions of the velocity fields were post-processed to
   calculate the thickness of the surface cladding as one billet is fed in
   after another through the die (i.e., the transverse weld). The
   mathematical model was then used to assess the effect a change in feeder
   dimensions would have on the shape, thickness and extent of the
   transverse weld during extrusion. Experimental measurements for
   different combinations of billet materials show that the model is able
   to accurately predict the transverse weld shape as well as the clad
   surface layer to thicknesses of 50 mu m. The transverse weld is
   significantly affected by the feeder geometry shape, but the effects of
   ram speed, billet material and temperature on the transverse weld
   dimensions are negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation of asphaltene is considered as an undesired process during
   oil production via natural depletion and gas injection as it blocks the
   pore space and reduces the oil flow rate. In addition, it lessens the
   efficiency of the gas injection into oil reservoirs. This paper presents
   static and dynamic experiments conducted to investigate the effects of
   temperature, pressure, pressure drop, dilution ratio, and mixture
   compositions on asphaltene precipitation and deposition. Important
   technical aspects of asphaltene precipitation such as equation of state,
   analysis tools, and predictive methods are also discussed. Different
   methodologies to analyze asphaltene precipitation are reviewed, as well.
   Artificial neural networks (ANNs) joined with imperialist competitive
   algorithm (ICA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are employed to
   approximate asphaltene precipitation and deposition with and without CO2
   injection. The connectionist model is built based on experimental data
   covering wide ranges of process and thermodynamic conditions. A good
   match was obtained between the real data and the model predictions.
   Temperature and pressure drop have the highest influence on asphaltene
   deposition during dynamic tests. ICA-ANN attains more reliable outputs
   compared with PSO-ANN, the conventional ANN, and scaling models. In
   addition, high pressure microscopy (RPM) technique leads to more
   accurate results compared with quantitative methods when studying
   asphaltene precipitation. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Comprehensive study on the source of electromagnetic radiation from
   apertures placed in conducting screens and enclosure is presented. Novel
   technique comprising placement of electromagnetic bandgap (EBG)
   structures immediately around the apertures openings is presented to
   suppress the surface currents and consequently to reduce the radiation
   from the apertures. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
   demonstrated through several detailed parametric studies and numerical
   full-wave simulations quantifying the strength of electromagnetic fields
   in near and far regions from the aperture. In fact, using the EBG
   structures, more than 20-dB reduction is achieved in the near- and
   far-field radiation without affecting the aperture size. Finally, a
   detailed experimental case study from real-world environment is
   presented to validate the proposed concept.}},

Abstract = {{The peptide PVGLIG, which is known to be selectively cleaved by the
   tumor-associated enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), was
   conjugated to a-alkene poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) blocks of
   varying sizes via UV-initiated thiol-ene ``click{''} chemistry. The PTMC
   precursor was synthesized by metal-free ring-opening polymerization
   using ally! alcohol as an initiator and an N-heterocyclic carbene as an
   organic catalyst. The unprecedented PVGLIG-b-PTMC hybrids were
   self-assembled in aqueous solution and various submicrometer-sized
   morphologies obtained by a nanoprecipitation process. Characterization
   of particle morphology was carried out by multiangle dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS) evidencing spherical
   nanoparticles with different morphologies and narrow size distributions.
   Microstructure details were also observed on transmission electron
   micrographs and were in good agreement with light scattering
   measurements showing the assembly of core shell, large compound
   micelles, and vesicle morphologies, the particle morphology varying with
   the hydrophilic weight fractions (f) of the hybrids. These
   nanostructures displayed selective degradation in the presence of the
   cancer-associated enzyme MMP-2, as probed by the morphological change
   both by TEM and DLS. All these results demonstrated that PVGLIG-b-PTMC
   hybrids were suitable to target the tumor microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, interest has grown in using photovoltaic (PV) electricity to
   charge plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This paper investigates
   the feasibility of such a charging alternative, from a distribution
   system performance perspective. To achieve this goal, it is first
   necessary to determine the resulting aggregated impacts for both
   technologies when they operate in parallel. Although extensive research
   has explored the individual impacts of PHEVs and PV electricity on
   distribution networks, far too little study has been made of the
   interaction between these two technologies and the resulting aggregated
   impacts when both operate together.
   This paper fills this gap by developing a probabilistic Monte Carlo
   (MC)-based benchmark that can be used to assess the resulting impacts
   when PV arrays are used to charge PHEVs. Finally, the authors compare
   the resulting aggregated impacts with those resulting when PHEV charging
   demands are met solely from the medium voltage network, in order to draw
   conclusions on the feasibility of such a charging alternative. (C) 2014

   extracted using a T-equivalent circuit. A cross section of the Cu-filled

   respectively. C (m) occurred between the charge-holding TSVs, which
   changed from 0.42 pF to 0.26 pF due to a permittivity transition of the
   Cu ion drift. After 1,000 cycles of a thermal shock test, cracks were
   observed between the opening and around the side of the TSV and Si wafer
   due to mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion between the

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An anodic aluminum oxide was formed by self-organized two step
   anodization in 0.3 M oxalic acid at four temperatures: 35, 40, 45 and 50
   degrees C and three voltages: 30, 40 and 50 V. Duration of anodization
   steps was also varied: 30,60 and 120 min. The influence of electrolyte
   temperature and duration of anodization on the nanoporous alumina
   arrangement was studied with three methods: regularity ratio derived
   from fast Fourier transform intensity profile, averaged regularity ratio
   evaluated from radial average of fast Fourier transform and defect maps
   (Delaunay triangulation). It was found that for sufficiently long
   anodization (60 min or longer) the better arrangement of the pores was
   obtained at higher temperatures. Additionally, the better arrangement of
   nanopores was obtained with the longer duration of the anodization step.
   The present results are rationalized by a phenomenological model and
   compared with the literature data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a method to automatically generate a control
   policy for a dynamical system modeled as a Markov Decision Process
   (MDP). The control specification is given as a Linear Temporal Logic
   (LTL) formula over a set of propositions defined on the states of the
   MDP. Motivated by robotic applications requiring persistent tasks, such
   as environmental monitoring and data gathering, we synthesize a control
   policy thatminimizes the expected cost between satisfying instances of a
   particular proposition over all policies that maximize the probability
   of satisfying the given LTL specification. Our approach is based on the
   definition of a novel optimization problem that extends the existing
   average cost per stage problem. We propose a sufficient condition for a
   policy to be optimal, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm that
   synthesizes a policy that is optimal for a set of LTL specifications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a decentralized wireless networks of K separate
   transmitter-receiver pairs. Users treat each other as noise and there is
   no central controller to assign the resources to the users. Each user
   randomly spreads the symbols in its Gaussian codewords by the so-called
   signatures of spreading gain N. Any receiver is aware of the signatures
   of its affiliated transmitter, however, it is unaware of the signatures
   of other users. This makes the interference plus noise at each receiver
   be mixed Gaussian, and hence, there is no closed expression for the
   achievable rates of users. Invoking conditional entropy power inequality
   and a key upper bound on the differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian
   random vector, we develop a lower bound on the achievable rates of
   users. This lower bound has the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling
   as that of the exact achievable rate. It is shown that the sum
   multiplexing gain (SMG) in the network can be made arbitrarily close to
   (K/N) for any finite values of K and N where K <= N. The effect of
   matched filtering is studied in the particular case where the signatures
   are constructed over a binary alphabet. It is established that the SMG
   of the network is larger than (1/2e) regardless of the value of K as
   long as N = 2 and the signatures are generated according to a proper
   nonuniform distribution. This paper is concluded by a section on
   signature design in the finite SNR regime. The main observation is that
   for any two different methods A and B of designing the signatures, if
   method A results in a larger achievable rate per user for sufficiently
   large SNR values, then construction B is likely to yield larger

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel modeling framework for the analysis of
   Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging in unbalanced, residential,
   distribution systems. A Smart Distribution Power Flow (SDPF) framework
   is proposed to determine the controlled or smart charging schedules and
   hence address the shortcomings of uncontrolled charging. The effect of
   peak-demand constraint imposed by the Local Distribution Company (LDC)
   is also studied within the SDPF framework for the smart charging
   scenarios. Uncontrolled versus smart charging schemes are compared for
   various scenarios, from both the customer's and the LDC's perspective.
   Various objective functions, such as energy drawn by the LDC, total
   feeder losses, total cost of energy drawn by LDC and total cost of PEV
   charging are considered. Studies are carried out considering two sample
   systems i.e., the IEEE 13-node test feeder and a real distribution
   feeder. Analyses are also presented considering a probabilistic
   representation of the initial state of charge (SOC) and start time of
   charging for various scenarios to take into account the difference in
   customers' driving patterns. The results show that uncontrolled charging
   of PEVs results in increased peak demand, low node voltage levels, and
   increased feeder current magnitudes. On the other hand, the SDPF
   framework provides very satisfactory operating schedules for the overall
   system including smart PEV charging.}},

Abstract = {{To address China's large population and uneven distribution of water
   storage, the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) aims at
   transferring water from the Yangtze River (Changjiang) Basin to the
   North China Plain. This project is being implemented over three
   different routes, referred to as the Eastern, Central, and Western
   routes, each of which is giving rise to strategic conflicts. In this
   paper, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is used to
   systematically investigate these conflicts and obtain strategic insights
   into them. The Chinese Central Government is involved in each conflict,
   together with local decision makers, making the entire conflict
   hierarchical. The conflict is analyzed both as an overall graph model
   and as three local conflicts, and the resulting equilibria are compared.
   The Central Government's preferences, which can be fully elaborated in
   the single or overall model, account for the differences in equilibria
   between the overall model and the three local models. The Central
   Government, which utilizes different strategies in planning, modifying,
   and building these routes, may be able to control the overall project as
   it wishes, thereby reaching separate agreements with the relevant
   decision makers along each route.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental stress cracking (ESC) of polyethylene (PE) in structural
   applications can result in catastrophic failure without any visible
   warning. Polyethylene with excellent short-term mechanical strength can
   have poor long-term performance because of ESC. Because PE structures
   can have an expected service life of 50years or more, the lack of
   understanding regarding their long-term mechanical performance is a
   major concern. For practical reasons, it is not possible to test PE for
   years before use. Currently, most mechanical tests for PE only run for a
   few hours. Therefore, it is important to understand the connections
   between short-term and long-term mechanical properties. Short-term
   mechanical behavior, such as creep over 8h, is studied in conjunction
   with ESC for six high-density PE resins. In addition, the molecular
   structure influences on creep of PE are extensively investigated.
   Complex creep behavior is explained from the point of combined effects
   of molecular properties. It was found that high-density polyethylene
   (HDPE) resins with large creep strain usually exhibit high environmental
   stress cracking resistance. However, the short-term creep behavior of
   HDPE was affected by molecular weight, molecular weight distribution,
   and short-chain branching content of the material.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on the long-term creep
   behaviour of adhesive anchors under sustained tensile loads in
   combination with different environmental exposures. A total of 72
   pull-out test specimens with post-installed anchors were used. The test
   variables included the type of adhesive anchor, loading conditions

   moisture, and freeze-thaw). Two sustained load levels of 32kN and 48kN
   (40\% and 60\% of the anchor's yield strength) were considered.
   Sustained load tests lasted for a period of at least 90days. The static
   pullout tests showed that specimens with epoxy adhesive exhibited
   stronger bond strength, forcing the anchor to fail by rupture prior to
   bond failure. Under sustained load tests, the total displacements over
   the service life were extrapolated and compared to displacement limits
   at 50years (room temperature) and 10years (moisture and freeze/thaw) in
   accordance with ICC-ES AC308. Specimens with standard set epoxy adhesive
   showed insignificant creep displacement under room conditions and
   satisfied the displacement limits; however, when exposed to moisture
   noticeable higher creep displacements were recorded and total
   displacement failed to meet the limit. Specimens with both fast setting

   interface using the digital resistance map concept}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The growing demand for haptic technologies in recent years has motivated
   novel approaches in developing haptic interfaces and control algorithms.
   Semi-active haptic interfaces, in general, have the advantage of
   addressing safety concerns which adversely affect their active
   counterparts. This paper presents the development of a planar
   semi-active haptic interface using magnetorheological (MR) dampers. The
   ability of MR dampers to produce controllable resistance forces is the
   key reason for their utilization in the proposed haptic interface. The
   proposed planar semi-active haptic interface consists of linear and
   rotary MR dampers. Each of the MR dampers is modeled experimentally
   using the Bouc-Wen model. A haptic rendering algorithm called the
   digital resistance map (DRM) is also developed to control MR dampers.
   DRM is a high-fidelity haptic rendering algorithm, and proved to be
   effective to create comprehensive force feedback for operators.
   MATLAB/Simulink (R) is used for implementing several DRM scenarios for
   generating haptic enabled virtual environments. The experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed haptic interface and
   rendering algorithm.}},

Title = {{A self-sensing approach to the energy-saving operation of
   electromagnetic locking devices}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports an energy-efficient operation of electromagnetic (EM)
   locking devices using the inductive self-sensing technique, i.e.
   employing the existing actuation coil as a sensing medium. EM locking
   devices such as EM locks and locking solenoids have been increasingly
   used as new security devices in industrial and commercial buildings due
   to their fully electronic operation. One of the drawbacks of such EM
   devices is that a significant amount of energy is often wasted through
   their continual use, especially in applications where the maximum
   holding power is seldom needed. The main idea of this paper is to
   operate an EM locking device in such a way that its full power is
   supplied only when needed. More specifically, we propose running the
   existing coil as an inductive sensor using significantly less power
   during normal operation. Any imminent attempt to disengage an EM lock
   can be instantly detected by the self-sensing coil and its full locking
   power can then be engaged to prevent it from unlocking. This paper
   presents a detailed electromagnetic analysis for the self-sensing
   functionality of the existing EM lock. Besides, a stochastic detection
   method called the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) has been
   implemented to improve the energy-saving operation of the EM device.
   Proposed strategies are experimentally verified using a commercial EM
   lock, which demonstrated that more than 75\% of the original power can
   be saved by the proposed method while keeping the same locking
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Data/content dissemination among the mobile devices is the fundamental
   building block for all the applications in wireless mobile collaborative
   computing, known as mobile peer-to-peer. Different parameters such as
   node density, scheduling among neighboring nodes, mobility pattern, and
   node speed have a tremendous impact on data diffusion in a mobile
   peer-to-peer environment. In this paper, we develop analytical models
   for object diffusion time/delay in a wireless mobile network to
   apprehend the complex interrelationship among these different
   parameters. In the analysis, we calculate the probabilities of
   transmitting a single object from one node to multiple nodes using the
   epidemic model of spread of disease. We also incorporate the impact of
   node mobility, radio range, and node density in the networks into the
   analysis. Utilizing these transition probabilities, we estimate the
   expected delay for diffusing an object to the entire network both for
   single object and multiple object scenarios. We then calculate the
   transmission probabilities of multiple objects among the nodes in the
   wireless mobile network considering network dynamics. Through extensive
   simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient for
   data diffusion in the wireless mobile network. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{In typical practice for terpolymerizations so far, binary reactivity
   ratios have been used directly in the instantaneous Alfrey and
   Goldfinger (AG) model, effectively ignoring the presence of the third
   monomer. In addition, the use of the AG model leads to severe estimation
   problems, if one would like to estimate reactivity ratios from
   experimental data. Due to the above reasons, the AG model was recast and
   was subsequently used with terpolymerization data directly to estimate
   ternary reactivity ratios under the error-in-variables-model framework,
   based both on instantaneous (low conversion) and cumulative composition
   data (medium and high conversions). Several examples and counter
   examples highlight such important issues as the choice of the correct
   number of responses, accounting for the appropriate error structure, and
   incorporating the right information content, all with diagnostic checks
   whose target is the eventual reliability of the reactivity ratio
   estimates. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J,

Abstract = {{Water coning in petroleum reservoirs leads to lower well productivity
   and higher operational costs. Adequate knowledge of coning phenomena and
   breakthrough time is essential to overcome this issue. A series of
   experiments using fractured porous media models were conducted to
   investigate the effects of production process and pore structure
   characteristics on water coning. In addition, a hybrid artificial neural
   network (ANN) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was
   applied to predict breakthrough time of water coning as a function of
   production rate and physical model properties. Data from the literature
   combined with experimental data generated in this study were used to
   develop and verify the ANN-PSO model. A good correlation was found
   between the predicted and real data sets having an absolute maximum
   error percentage less than 9\%. The developed ANN-PSO model is able to
   estimate breakthrough time and critical production rate with higher
   accuracy compared to the conventional or back propagation (BP) ANN
   (ANN-BP) and common correlations. The presence of vertical fractures was
   found to accelerate considerably the water coning phenomena during oil
   production. Results of this study using combined data suggest the
   potential application of ANN-PSO in predicting the water breakthrough
   time and critical production rate that are critical in designing and
   evaluating production strategies for naturally fractured reservoirs. (c)

Abstract = {{A new process of an up-flow bio-electrocatalyzed electrolysis reactor
   (UBER) connected with an aerobic bio-contact oxidation reactor (ABOR)
   was developed for treating azo dye wastewater. Alizarin Yellow R (AYR),
   used as a model dye, was efficiently decolorized in UBERs (97.5 +/-
   1.0\%) and further mineralized in the subsequent aerobic bio-contact
   oxidation reactor (ABOR). Decolorization efficiency was improved with
   increasing cathode size in UBERs, but AYR removal rate and current
   density were not increased in proportion to cathode size, mainly due to
   the limitation of anodic reactions. AYR decolorization rate was
   optimized at a cathode size of 90 cm(3) in an UBER where the charge
   transfer resistance R-ct (39.5 Omega) was minimal. We assessed the
   effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT: 6.5 h, 4.5 h, 3.5 h, 2.0 h) on
   the removal of residual by-products (p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and
   5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in the ABOR. The concentrations of PPD and
   5-ASA decreased down to 0.28 +/- 0.01 and 0.27 +/- 0.03 mg L-1,
   respectively, in an optimum HRT 3.5 h. Decolorization efficiency and COD
   removal efficiency was 93.8 +/- 0.7\% and 93.0 +/- 0.5\% in the combined
   process of UBER and ABOR in overall HRT 6 h (HRT 2.5 h in UBER + HRT 3.5
   h in ABOR). The Chroma in ABOR effluent was 80 times. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, two different forms of an original multiaxial fatigue

   applied to uniaxial and multiaxial loading conditions for geometrically
   different bodies. Both the damage parameters are correlated to sets of
   experimental data published in the literature to verify the prediction
   accuracy of the damage parameters. The damage parameter in the form of
   the GSA, when applied to the uniaxial loading, provides very good
   correlations with four sets of experimental mean stress fatigue data for
   Incoloy 901 super alloy, ASTM A723 steel, 7075-T561 aluminum alloy and
   1045 HRC 55 steel. In the case of multiaxial loadings, both the GSE and
   GSA parameters are found to correlate well with fatigue data of 1045
   steel and Inconel 718 tubular specimens under proportional and
   non-proportional loadings. In addition, the damage parameters show
   reasonably acceptable correlations with experimental fatigue data of SAE
   1045 steel notched shafts subjected to proportional and non-proportional

Abstract = {{In this paper, a computational modeling technique of the multiaxial
   stress-strain notch analysis has been developed to compute
   elasto-plastic notch tip stress-strain responses using linear elastic FE
   results of notched components. Application and validation of the
   multiaxial stress-strain notch analysis model were presented by
   comparing computed results of the model to the experimental data of SAE
   1070 steel notched shaft subjected to several non-proportional load
   paths. Based on the comparison between the experimental and computed
   strain histories, the elasto-plastic stress-strain model estimated notch
   strains with reasonable accuracy using linear-elastic FE stress
   histories. The elasto-plastic stress-strain notch analysis model
   provides more efficient and simple analysis method preferable to
   expensive experimental component tests and more complex and time
   consuming incremental non-linear FE analysis. The elasto-plastic
   stress-strain model can thus be employed to perform fatigue life and
   fatigue damage estimates associated with the local material deformation.

Abstract = {{This paper expounds a complexity-reduced Volterra series model for radio
   frequency power amplifier (PA) behavioral modeling and digital
   predistortion (DPD). An analysis was conducted, which took into account
   the memory effect mechanisms of the PA. This led to a closed-form
   expression that relates the memoryless behavior of the PA to the finite
   impulse response feedback filter, which approximates the memory effects'
   behavior. The analysis resulted in a complexity-reduced Volterra series
   model which allows for a substantial reduction in the requirements for
   digital signal processors and the time needed to construct and implement
   the DPD in a real-time environment. The proposed model was validated as
   a behavioral model and a DPD using two different PA architectures,
   employing two different transistor technologies, driven by both 20 MHz
   1001 wideband code division multiple access and long term evolution
   signals. The results obtained demonstrate the excellent modeling and
   linearization capability of the complexity-reduced Volterra series

Abstract = {{A broad range of human diseases are associated with bacterial
   infections, often initiated by specific adhesion of a bacterium to the
   target environment. Despite the significant role of bacterial adhesion
   in human infectious diseases, details and mechanisms of bacterial
   adhesion have remained elusive. Herein, we study the physical
   interactions between Staphylococcus aureus, a type of micro-organism
   relevant to infections associated with medical implants, and
   nanocrystalline (nc) nickel nanostructures with various columnar
   features, including solid core, hollow, x-shaped and c-shaped pillars.
   Scanning electron microscopy results show the tendency of these
   bacterial cells to attach to the nickel nanostructures. Moreover, unique
   single bacterium attachment characteristics were observed on nickel
   nanostructures with dimensions comparable to the size of a single
   bacterium. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques based on nano-mechanical
   measurements (topography, adhesion, modulus) and electric force
   microscopy (EFM) have been used to examine mica surfaces modified with
   the ionic-complementary peptide EFK8 alone and with EFK8-single-walled
   carbon nanotube (SWNT) dispersions in water in order to gain a deeper
   understanding of the interaction between nanotubes and
   ionic-complementary peptides. Through the use of these techniques, it
   has been shown for the first time that peptide fibers can be
   distinguished from SWNTs and peptide-wrapped SWNTs. SPM images reveal
   features consistent with two types of helical structures: EFK8 fibers
   wrapped around each other during self-assembly and EFK8 fibers wrapped
   around SWNTs. In this second structure, EFK8 chains should be oriented
   with their hydrophobic sides oriented toward the SWNTs and their
   hydrophilic sides toward the water, thereby enabling the dispersion of
   the nanotubes in aqueous media. We have also demonstrated the formation
   of hybrid EFK8-SWNT hydrogels that have potentially superior physical
   and mechanical properties over those of other hydrogels and opens up new
   applications for this type of material. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first work reporting the formation of a composite hydrogel
   made of an ionic-complementary peptide and carbon nanotubes. (C) 2014

Title = {{Evaluating Models for Predicting Full-Scale Fire Behaviour of

Journal = {{FIRE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{693-719}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Two models that can be used to predict full-scale heat release rates of
   polyurethane foam slabs were evaluated in this study. Predictions were
   compared with results of furniture calorimeter tests of 10 cm thick
   polyurethane foam specimens which were ignited in the centre or on the
   edge. Furniture calorimeter results indicated that peak heat release
   rates and fire growth rates were higher during centre ignition tests
   than edge ignition tests. For both situations, the growth phase of the
   heat release rate curves measured in the full-scale tests was
   successfully predicted using t (2) design fires; the choice of a
   specific t (2) fire depended on the surface area of the specimen and
   ignition location. A model originally developed during the European
   Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF) project was also
   evaluated using heat release rate data from cone calorimeter tests and
   flame area burning rates measured using infrared video records of the
   furniture calorimeter tests. This model was able to successfully predict
   the initial growth phase of the fires and predictions of peak heat
   release rates were within 17\% of measured values. The model had less
   success in predicting heat release rates later in the growth phase and
   during the decay phase of the fires, and did not appear to capture all
   of the physics of the full-scale tests, in particular foam melting and
   subsequent liquid pool burning. As the model did show promise, future
   work is planned to address these shortcomings and to develop improved
   flame spread models for polyurethane foam.}},

Title = {{An Assessment of Sea-Ice Thickness Along the Labrador Coast From AMSR-E
   and MODIS Data for Operational Data Assimilation}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, sea-ice thickness values are calculated along the
   Labrador coast using data from two sensors representative of those
   available for operational data assimilation. Data from the first sensor,
   the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are used to
   calculate the ice thickness using a heat balance equation. Relationships
   between the MODIS ice thickness and polarization ratio from the Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) are used
   to calculate the thickness of thin ice (less than 0.2 m) from the AMSR-E
   data. This is done for each frequency on the AMSR-E sensor in the range
   of 6.9-36.5 GHz. Through comparison with data from ice charts, it is
   found that the errors are lowest for thickness values calculated from
   low-frequency AMSR-E data. The accuracies of the ice thickness from
   MODIS, AMSR-E, operational ice charts, and two moored upward looking
   sonars are further assessed using the triple collocation method. It is
   found that the error associated with ice thickness from AMSR-E is the
   lowest and the error associated with ice thickness from MODIS is the
   highest. While the MODIS data represent the small-scale variability of
   the sea-ice thickness better than the AMSR-E data, the MODIS data can
   produce spurious values of ice thickness due to unmasked clouds. To use
   ice thickness from MODIS in an automated algorithm, quality control
   would need to be applied to the MODIS data to remove unmasked clouds
   which lead to spurious values of thick ice. The errors calculated for
   the ice thickness from AMSR-E, which are calculated based on a
   relationship calibrated with MODIS ice thickness from a clear-sky day,
   indicate that these data would be useful for operational data
   assimilation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of Dolapix CE64 as dispersant on the
   deposition mechanism and chain formation of TiO2 nanoparticles in the
   different frequencies under non-uniform AC electric field was
   investigated. The optical microscope (OM) images of the deposition
   patterns obtained at the frequency of 1 Hz and 100 Hz in non-aqueous
   media one containing dispersant and the other being dispersant free
   revealed that the addition of charge inducing agents (dispersant) has
   drastically changed deposition mechanism enabling particles to enter the
   gap leaving the electrodes surfaces uncoated. At 10 kHz, it was observed
   that by the introduction of Dolapix CE64 the TiO2 nanoparticles were
   able to form chain-like patterns along the electric field lines bridging
   the interelectrode gap. The obtained pearl chain formation (PCF) was
   employed to fabricate an NO2 gas sensor which showed a good response to

Abstract = {{The wide bandgap, one-dimensional zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) and
   their heterostructures with other materials provide excellent pathways
   for efficient photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting devices. ZnO NWs
   sensitized with quantum dots (QDs) provide high-surface area and tunable
   bandgap absorbers with a directional path for carriers in advanced PV
   devices, while ZnO heterojunctions with other p-type wide bandgap
   materials lead to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with better emission and
   waveguiding properties compared with the homojunction counterparts.
   Synthesis of the structures with the desired morphology is a key to
   device applications. In this work, ZnO NW arrays were synthesized using
   hydrothermal method on ZnO and GaN thin films. Highly crystalline,
   upright, and ordered arrays of ZnO NWs in the 50 to 250-nm diameter
   range and 1 mu m in length were obtained. The morphology and optical
   properties of the NWs were studied. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
   (EDX) analysis revealed nonstoichiometric oxygen content in the grown
   ZnO NWs. Photoluminescence (PL) studies depicted the presence of oxygen
   vacancy and interstitial zinc defects in the grown ZnO NWs, underlining
   the potential for LEDs. Further, hydrophobically ligated CdSe/ZnS QDs
   were successfully incorporated to the NWarrays. PL analysis indicated
   the injection of electrons from photoexcited QDs to the NWs, showing the
   potential for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. (C) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{We report an experimental study of terahertz quantum cascade lasers with

   Carlo simulations using state-of-the-art Al0.15Ga0.85As/GaAs
   three-quantum-well resonant phonon depopulation active region design as
   a reference. The new designs achieved maximum lasing temperatures of

   for the reference structure. These results demonstrate that terahertz
   quantum cascade laser designs with variable barrier heights provide a
   viable alternative to the traditional active region designs with fixed

Abstract = {{A new process to produce high purity phenol crystal from dilute aqueous
   solutions based on pervaporation-crystallization coupling (PVCC) was
   reported. Our approach to modifying the permeate condenser was to
   replace the traditional single condenser for complete condensation and
   collection of permeate with a two-stage condenser where the first stage
   was used for crystallization of phenol while the second stage was to
   condense and collect the remaining permeate. The phenol crystal obtained
   in the crystallizer was found to be of the same purity as that of
   commercial reagent phenol. The pervaporation experiments showed that the
   phenol crystals collected in the crystallizer accounted for about
   79.9-89.2\% of the total amount of phenol permeated through the membrane
   for a feed concentration of 6000-10,000 ppm at an operating temperature
   of 65 C. This is of particular interest from an application point of
   view as high purity phenol crystals were obtained directly from dilute
   aqueous solutions by pervaporation alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution in
   distribution systems and the emergence of ``smart grid{''} concepts. The
   smart grid mainly intends to facilitate integration of renewable energy
   sources and to achieve higher system reliability and efficiency.
   Different distributed generation types found in modern distribution
   systems can be classified into two main categories: intermittent- and
   dispatchable-based distributed generation; the latter has a unique
   capability of enabling successful islanding operation, thus improving
   system reliability. This article proposes a methodology for allocating
   dispatchable distributed generation units in distribution systems to
   economically improve system reliability. Distributed generation
   installation and operation costs are to be optimized against the
   reliability value, expressed as customers' ``willingness to pay{''}
   (WTP) to avoid power interruptions. Therefore, the main goal of this
   research work is to determine the optimal combination between
   distributed generation units to be installed and loads to be shed during
   all possible contingencies. A probabilistic load model is adopted to
   determine the optimal size of allocated distributed generation units.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic-based simultaneous design and control methodology for
   chemical processes under uncertainty is presented. An optimization
   framework is proposed with the aim of achieving a feasible and stable
   optimal process design in the presence of stochastic disturbances while
   using advanced model-based control schemes such as Model Predictive
   Control (MPC). The key idea is to determine the dynamic variability of
   the system that will be accounted for in the process design using a
   stochastic-based worst-case variability index. This index is computed
   from the probability distribution of the worst-case variability of the
   process variables that determine the dynamic feasibility or the dynamic
   performance of the system under random realizations in the disturbances.
   A case study of an actual wastewater treatment industrial plant is
   presented and used to test the proposed methodology and compare its
   performance against the sequential design approach and a simultaneous
   design and control method using conventional PI-based control schemes.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{511}},
Pages = {{567-579}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis is a useful tool to identify key model parameters
   as well as to quantify simulation errors resulting from parameter
   uncertainty. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) has been
   subjected to various sensitivity analyses; however, in most of these
   efforts a local sensitivity analysis method was implemented, the
   nonlinear response was neglected, and the dependency among parameters
   was not examined. In this study we employed a comprehensive global
   sensitivity analysis to quantify the contribution of 70 model input
   parameters (including 35 hydrological parameters and 35 nitrogen cycle
   parameters) on the uncertainty of key RZWQM outputs relevant to
   raspberry row crops in Abbotsford, BC, Canada. Specifically, 9 model
   outputs that capture various vertical-spatial and temporal domains were
   investigated. A rank transformation method was used to account for the
   nonlinear behavior of the model. The variance of the model outputs was
   decomposed into correlated and uncorrelated partial variances to provide
   insight into parameter dependency and interaction. The results showed
   that, in general, the field capacity (soil water content at - 33 kPa) in
   upper 30 cm of the soil horizon had the greatest contribution (>30\%) to
   the estimate of the water flux and evapotranspiration uncertainty. The
   most influential parameters affecting the simulation of soil nitrate
   content, mineralization, denitrification, nitrate leaching and plant
   nitrogen uptake were the transient coefficient of fast to intermediate
   humus pool, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the fast humus pool, the
   organic matter decay rate in fast humus pool, and field capacity. The
   correlated contribution to the model output uncertainty was <10\% for
   the set of parameters investigated. The findings from this effort were
   utilized in two calibration case studies to demonstrate the utility of
   this global sensitivity analysis to reduce the risk of
   over-parameterization, and to identify the vertical location of
   observations that were the most effective to use as RZWQM calibration
   targets when water flux estimates are a key focus. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Due to the lack of feedback, conventional electron beam lithography
   (EBL) is a `blind' open-loop process where the exposed pattern is
   examined only after ex situ resist development, which is too late for
   any improvement. Here, we report that self-developing nitrocellulose
   resist, for which the pattern shows up right after exposure without ex
   situ development, can be used as in situ feedback on the e-beam
   distortion and enlargement. We first exposed identical test pattern in
   nitrocellulose at different locations within the writing field; then, we
   examined in situ at high magnification the exposed patterns and adjusted
   the beam (notably working distance) accordingly. The process was
   repeated until we achieved a relatively uniform shape/size distribution
   of the exposed pattern across the entire writing field. Once the beam
   was optimized using nitrocellulose resist, under the same optimal
   condition, we exposed the common resist PMMA. We achieved approximately
   80-nm resolution across the entire writing field of 1 mmx 1 mm, as
   compared to 210 nm without the beam optimization process.}},

   performance when used in Li-S batteries. It exhibits similar to 85\%
   retention of the initial reversible capacity of 1467 mAh g(-1) over 100
   cycles at a constant current rate of 0.1C and retains 1100 mAh g(-1)
   after 200 cycles. In addition, the composite displays excellent
   Coulombic efficiency and rate capability, delivering up to 828 mAh g(-1)
   reversible capacity at 2C. The improved performance stems from the
   composition and structure of the composite, wherein RGO renders a robust

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new energy optimization model for the Oil Sands
   upgrading operations. The proposed mathematical model determines the
   most suitable configuration of upgraders required for maintaining the
   downstream operations of the Oil Sands industry at minimum cost while
   meeting environmental regulations and product demands. The novelty of
   this work is that the model focuses on the upgrading stage of the oil
   operations and considers the yield of naphtha as key production
   constraint. The proposed optimization model was validated using data
   reported in the literature for the historical Oil Sands operations in
   2003. Likewise, the mathematical model was used to forecast the 2035 Oil
   Sands upgrading operations using information recently reported in the
   literature. Also, the 2035 case study was used to show the effect of
   varying natural gas prices, CO2 emission and naphtha yield production
   constraints on the Oil Sands upgrading operations. The results show that
   the proposed mathematical model is a practical tool to determine the
   energy production costs of the Oil Sands upgrading operations, planning
   and scheduling the number and type of upgrader plants in this industrial
   sector, and identify the key parameters that affect the Oil Sands
   upgrading operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rainwater harvesting, a ``soft path{''} approach toward water
   management, is increasingly recognized as a key strategy toward ensuring
   food security and alleviating problems of water scarcity. Interestingly
   this ``modern{''} approach has been in use for millennia in numerous
   older civilizations. This article uses India as a case study to explore
   the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of agricultural
   rainwater harvesting ponds, and evaluates the viability of these
   centuries-old systems under current climate and population pressures. A
   holistic watershed-scale approach that accounts for trade-offs in water
   availability and socioeconomic wellbeing is recommended for assessing
   the sustainability of these systems.}},

Title = {{Kinetic modelling of the production of methyl oleate by Celite supported
   lipase sol-gels}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{63-70}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This study illustrates the benefits of Celite supported lipase sol-gels
   for the transesterification of triolein to produce methyl oleate. A
   ping-pong bi-bi kinetic model was developed and validated taking into
   account the inhibition effects of methanol and glycerol as well as the
   effect of temperature. Although initial reaction rate models are useful
   for predicting the kinetics in the absence of products, a kinetic model
   beyond the initial conditions that considers glycerol inhibition is
   important. The model developed was consistent with the experimental data
   (R-2 = 0.95) predicting an increase in methyl oleate production with
   increasing methanol concentration up to an optimal range of 1.3 M to 2.0
   M depending on the temperature. In general, increasing the temperature
   increased the initial reaction rate for the immobilized lipase over the
   temperature range of 40-60 degrees C. Based on the kinetic constants,
   the maximum velocity of the reverse reaction is about 25\% slower than
   that of the forward reaction and glycerol inhibition has a more
   significant effect on the reaction kinetics than methanol inhibition.
   The model developed would be useful for understanding the effects of
   methanol and glycerol inhibition as well as temperature on the
   production of methyl oleate using lipase-mediated enzymatic
   transesterification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{The simulation of lithium-ion batteries based on a fundamental
   multi-physicochemical model requires extensive computational resources
   and remains sluggish for real-time or battery pack analysis
   applications. In these applications, simplification of the model is

   accuracy in estimation of one or more performance parameters. In this
   study, the effects of neglecting the lithium-ion diffusive charge
   transfer and the salt concentration gradient in electrolyte on the model
   accuracy are investigated. The results indicate the feasibility of
   simplifying the model for a range of cell designs and discharge rates
   without sacrificing the preciseness of the cell energy and power density
   predictions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
