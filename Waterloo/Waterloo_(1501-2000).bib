Abstract = {{The relationship between the oleophobicity of micro-patterned surfaces
   and the reduction of oil adhesion at low temperatures was explored by
   using siloxane elastomer surfaces as a model system.
   Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces were fabricated with varying
   oleophobicity from oleophilic to superoleophobic by combing the blending
   of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FDTS) into PDMS with the
   construction of bioinspired micropillars. The oil contact angles of
   micropillars were >130 degrees, with the largest contact angle measured
   to be 146 degrees. The micropillared surface showed remarkable
   self-cleaning properties; the contact angle hysteresis was <15 degrees.
   The transparent oil droplets on PDMS surfaces of varied oleophobicity
   were frozen into a white-colored solid at -25 degrees C with the aid of
   a cooling system. Adhesion forces of the frozen oil droplets were
   obtained from the knock-off tests, showing that the adhesion forces
   dropped with the increased oleophobicity. The largest adhesion force was
   observed on the oleophilic flat surface, while the lowest adhesion force
   was on the highest oleophobic micropillared surface. The relative
   effectiveness of chemical and physical modifications on adhesion
   strength reduction was studied in terms of FDTS and micropillars,
   respectively. The results showed that a reduction of adhesion strength
   by 4\% was reached by blending FDTS into flat PDMS, while a much more
   pronounced reduction of frozen oil adhesion strength by 60\% was
   achieved by blending FDTS into PDMS micropillars; these results
   suggested a possible synergic effect of the FDTS chemistry and
   micropillar on the reduction of adhesion strength of frozen oil
   droplets.}},

Abstract = {{Presented in this paper is a simplified seismic design approach for
   mid-rise buildings with vertical combination of framing systems. In
   current design practice, the presence of vertical irregularities on both
   mass and stiffness creates a challenge for the seismic design of such
   buildings. A two-stage analysis procedure prescribed in ASCE 7 suggests
   the interaction between the lower and upper structures in terms of mass
   and stiffness can be ignored if the lateral stiffness of the lower
   structure is considerably more rigid than that of the upper one. In the
   proposed approach the requirement associated with the two-stage analysis
   procedure is abandoned and the effects of the interaction between the
   lower and upper structures in terms of mass and stiffness on the seismic
   load are considered. The seismic design can be obtained based on the
   required relationship between the stiffness of the lower structure and
   that of the upper one determined by the proposed approach. An example is
   presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The
   result obtained from the proposed approach is justified by the
   verification of the dynamic analysis. Also found in this study is that
   in certain cases the two-stage analysis procedure prescribed in ASCE 7
   may lead to non-conservative design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Innovative dialysis membranes are needed for dialysis, which is the

   revealed that the average diameter of the fiber fabricated with 10 wt \%
   polyacrylonitrile was 673 nm and that of polyacrilonitirle-zeolite
   membranes were 277-419 nm. The creatinine adsorption behavior of 500-KOA
   (L), 720-KOA (Farrierite), 840-NHA (ZSM-5), and 940-HOA (Beta) zeolite
   powders were investigated. Among all the zeolites, 940-HOA zeolites
   showed the best performance. The creatinine adsorption capacity of
   940-zeolite powders increased from 2234 mu g/g in 50 mu mol/L creatinine
   solution to 25423 mu g/g in 625 mu mol/L creatinine solution. The speed
   of adsorption was very quick; 0.025 g of 940-zeolite powders can
   eliminate 91\% of 2 mu mol creatinine in 5 min. The zeolites
   incorporated inside the membrane had higher creatinine adsorption

Abstract = {{The present review attempted to emphasize on the microbiological quality
   of the commonly used cosmetics item by the majority of the Bangladeshi
   community. The abundance of contaminating microorganisms has been
   quantitatively discussed and the possible health risk has been focused
   upon usage of these items. Only a very few research efforts have been
   conducted on the cosmetic items in Bangladesh so far. The
   microbiological contamination aspects have been portrayed in this review
   using the information collected from a substantial number of cosmetic
   items which were earlier subjected to extensive microbiological and
   biochemical analyses. The prevalence of bacteria, fungi and the specific
   pathogenic microorganisms has been discussed based on research so far
   locally conducted on the finished items sold in markets, especially
   within the Dhaka metropolis. The laboratory scale experiments revealed
   the presence of enormous number of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi
   within the commonly used cosmetics. Conversely, the anti-bacterial
   activity was noticed in some of the products which might be in favor of
   the user safety. The prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms in the
   cosmetic items certainly raises a substantial public health issue. The
   necessity of the routine microbiological testing of the commonly used
   cosmetic items as well as the legislative measures to mitigate the
   contamination problem is thus of great significance.}},

Title = {{A correction method for systematic error in H-1-NMR time-course data
   validated through stochastic cell culture simulation}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The growing ubiquity of metabolomic techniques has
   facilitated high frequency time-course data collection for an increasing
   number of applications. While the concentration trends of individual
   metabolites can be modeled with common curve fitting techniques, a more
   accurate representation of the data needs to consider effects that act
   on more than one metabolite in a given sample. To this end, we present a
   simple algorithm that uses nonparametric smoothing carried out on all
   observed metabolites at once to identify and correct systematic error
   from dilution effects. In addition, we develop a simulation of
   metabolite concentration time-course trends to supplement available data
   and explore algorithm performance. Although we focus on nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) analysis in the context of cell culture, a number of
   possible extensions are discussed.
   Results: Realistic metabolic data was successfully simulated using a
   4-step process. Starting with a set of metabolite concentration
   time-courses from a metabolomic experiment, each time-course was
   classified as either increasing, decreasing, concave, or approximately
   constant. Trend shapes were simulated from generic functions
   corresponding to each classification. The resulting shapes were then
   scaled to simulated compound concentrations. Finally, the scaled trends
   were perturbed using a combination of random and systematic errors. To
   detect systematic errors, a nonparametric fit was applied to each trend
   and percent deviations calculated at every timepoint. Systematic errors
   could be identified at time-points where the median percent deviation
   exceeded a threshold value, determined by the choice of smoothing model
   and the number of observed trends. Regardless of model, increasing the
   number of observations over a time-course resulted in more accurate
   error estimates, although the improvement was not particularly large
   between 10 and 20 samples per trend. The presented algorithm was able to
   identify systematic errors as small as 2.5 \% under a wide range of
   conditions.
   Conclusion: Both the simulation framework and error correction method
   represent examples of time-course analysis that can be applied to
   further developments in H-1-NMR methodology and the more general
   application of quantitative metabolomics.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal relay settings are determined where coordination constraints are
   modelled considering only either one fault location (near end or
   midpoint) or two fault locations (near and far end) on a feeder. This
   study, first, investigates whether considering one or two fault
   locations is sufficient to guarantee proper coordination for faults at
   all other locations on a feeder. The results show that violations, in
   the coordination constraints, can occur at various points along the
   feeder if the relays are coordinated considering one or two fault
   locations. In addition, considering multiple fault locations while
   determining the optimal relay setting can avoid such problem but on the
   expense of the overall relay tripping time. Thus, a dual-setting
   characteristic for directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) is proposed
   instead of the conventional inverse time-current characteristic. The
   study is conducted on the power transmission system of IEEE 24-bus and
   the power distribution system of IEEE 14-bus. The proposed
   characteristic achieves notable reduction in total DOCRs operating time
   over the conventional characteristic for both test systems while
   achieving proper coordination across a broader range of possible fault

Title = {{Experimental quantum key distribution with source flaws}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) is a standard technique in
   current quantum cryptographic implementations. Unfortunately, existing
   experiments have two important drawbacks: the state preparation is
   assumed to be perfect without errors and the employed security proofs do
   not fully consider the finite-key effects for general attacks. These two
   drawbacks mean that existing experiments are not guaranteed to be proven
   to be secure in practice. Here, we perform an experiment that shows
   secure QKD with imperfect state preparations over long distances and
   achieves rigorous finite-key security bounds for decoy-state QKD against
   coherent attacks in the universally composable framework. We quantify
   the source flaws experimentally and demonstrate a QKD implementation
   that is tolerant to channel loss despite the source flaws. Our
   implementation considers more real-world problems than most previous
   experiments, and our theory can be applied to general discrete-variable
   QKD systems. These features constitute a step towards secure QKD with
   imperfect devices.}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{8469-8478}},

Abstract = {{The performance of gamma-Fe2O3 as sorbent for H2S removal at low
   temperatures (20-80 degrees C) was investigated. First, gamma-Fe2O3/SiO2
   sorbents with a three-dimensionally ordered macropores (3DOM) structure
   were successfully prepared by a colloidal crystal templating method.
   Then, the performance of the gamma-Fe2O3-based material, e.g., reference
   gamma-Fe2O3 and 3DOM gamma-Fe2O3/SiO2 sorbents, for H2S capture was
   compared with that of alpha-Fe2O3 and the commercial sorbent HXT-1
   (amorphous hydrated iron oxide). The results show that gamma-Fe2O3 has
   an enhanced activity compared to that of HXT-1 for H2S capture at
   temperatures over 60 degrees C, whereas alpha-Fe2O3 has little activity.
   Because of the large surface area, high porosity, and nanosized active
   particles, 3DOM gamma-Fe2O3/SiO2 sorbent shows the best performance in
   terms of sulfur capacity and utilization. Moreover, it was found that
   moist conditions favor H2S removal. Furthermore, it was found that the
   conventional regeneration method with air at high temperature was not
   ideal for the composite regeneration because of the transmission of some
   amount of gamma-Fe2O3 to alpha-Fe2O3. However, simultaneous regeneration
   by adding oxygen in the feed stream allowed the breakthrough sulfur
   capacity of FS-8 to increase up to 79.1\%, which was two times the value
   when there was no O-2 in the feed stream.}},

Abstract = {{A new patch-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code is developed. The
   fully threaded tree (FIT) data structure (Khokhlov, 1998) originally
   developed for cell-based AMR is extended to organize the patch-based
   adaptive meshes. We demonstrate the accuracy of the AMR code by
   performing the simulations of the two and three-dimensional Sedov blast
   wave problems. We measure the performance of the code by solving the
   same problems in different grid resolutions on a single CPU, where
   detailed timing analyses provide comparison between the current AMR code
   and a conventional oct-tree-based AMR code (FLASH 4.0.1) (Fryxell et
   al., 2000). For the two-dimensional cases, maximum speed-up ratio of
   58.23 is obtained versus FLASH 4.0.1 with 512(2) effective grid
   resolution. For the three-dimensional cases, maximum speed-up ratios of
   32.16 is achieved over FLASH 4.0.1 with 128(3) effective grid
   resolution. We present the implementation and performance of a
   patch-based AMR algorithm with the immersed boundary method (IBM) on
   Graphic Processing Units (GPU). We also applied several optimizations in
   GPU computation, including the asynchronous memory copy, the concurrent
   execution between CPU and GPU and hybrid MPI/OpenMP/GPU parallelization.
   Performance benchmarks are conducted on the GPU cluster on SHARCNET
   (https://www.sharcnet.ca/) using 1-8 Tesla M2070 GPUs. Maximum speed-up
   factors of 22.3 and 20.5 are demonstrated using one GPU and 8 GPUs with
   2048(3) effective resolution, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{For the multibody simulation of planetary rover operations, a wheel-soil
   contact model is necessary to represent the forces and moments between
   the tire and the soft soil. A novel nonlinear contact modeling approach
   based on the properties of the hypervolume of interpenetration is
   validated in this paper. This normal contact force model is based on the
   Winkler foundation model with nonlinear spring properties. To fully
   define the proposed normal contact force model for this application,
   seven parameters are required. Besides the geometry parameters that can
   be easily measured, three soil parameters representing the hyperelastic
   and plastic properties of the soil have to be identified. Since it is
   very difficult to directly measure the latter set of soil parameters,
   they are identified by comparing computer simulations with experimental
   results of drawbar pull tests performed under different slip conditions
   on the Juno rover of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). A multibody
   dynamics model of the Juno rover including the new wheel/soil
   interaction model was developed and simulated in MAPLESIM. To identify
   the wheel/soil contact model parameters, the cost function of the model
   residuals of the kinematic data is minimized. The volumetric contact
   model is then tested by using the identified contact model parameters in
   a forward dynamics simulation of the rover on an irregular
   three-dimensional terrain and compared against experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Standards and guidelines as defined by various international agencies
   are employed by the researchers to evaluate an acceptable quality of air
   in indoor as well as outdoor environments. The main objective of this
   paper is to establish a comprehensive review of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)
   guidelines and other standard values that are implemented currently. For
   this purpose, the present study summarizes the main standards and
   guidelines related to key indoor air pollutants and levels of thermal
   comfort developed by different agencies around the world. These agencies
   and organizations include the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
   and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the Hong Kong Environmental
   Protection Department (HKEPD), the World Health Organization (WHO), and
   the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia.
   Common indoor air pollutants that are found to frequently affect indoor
   populations are, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
   formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and

Abstract = {{We consider a graph-theoretic property known as r-robustness which plays
   a key role in a class of consensus (or opinion) dynamics where each node
   ignores its most extreme neighbors when updating its state. Previous
   work has shown that if the graph is r-robust for sufficiently large r,
   then such dynamics will lead to consensus even when some nodes behave in
   an adversarial manner. The property of r-robustness also guarantees that
   the network will remain connected even if a certain number of nodes are
   removed from the neighborhood of every node in the network and thus it
   is a stronger indicator of structural robustness than the traditional
   metric of graph connectivity. In this paper, we study this notion of
   robustness in common random graph models for complex networks; we show
   that the properties of robustness and connectivity share the same
   threshold function in Erdos-Renyi graphs, and have the same values in
   1-D geometric graphs and certain preferential attachment networks. This
   provides new in-sights into the structure of such networks, and shows
   that they will be conducive to the types of dynamics described before.
   Although the aforementioned random graphs are inherently robust, we also
   show that it is coNP-complete to determine whether any given graph is
   robust to a specified extent.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, in conjunction with partial least
   squares regression (PLSR), was investigated as a potential technique for
   online quality control and quantitative monitoring of Immunoglobulin G
   (IgG) aggregation that occurs following exposure to conditions that
   emulate those that can occur during protein downstream processing.
   Initially, the impact of three stress factors (temperature, pH, and
   protein concentration) on the degree of aggregation determined using
   size exclusion chromatography data, was investigated by performing a
   central composite designexperiment and applying a fitting response
   surface model. This investigation identified the influence of the
   factors as well as the operating regions with minimum propensity to
   induce protein aggregation. Spectral changes pertinent to the stressed
   samples were also investigated and found to corroborate the high
   sensitivity of the intrinsic fluorescence to conformational changes of
   the proteins under study. Ultimately, partial least squares regression
   was implemented to formulate two fluorescence-based soft sensors for
   quality controlproduct classificationand quantitative
   monitoringconcentration of monomer. The resulting regression models
   exhibited accurate prediction ability and good potential for in situ

   of V2O5 nanorods on highly conductive graphene sheets as anode materials
   with high specific capacitance and excellent rate capability, which is
   mainly attributed to the intimate contact between the nanorods and
   graphene sheets. The asymmetric supercapacitor based on graphene/V2O5
   composites and activated carbon is fabricated and evaluated, where a
   high energy density of approximately 50 Whkg(-1) can be achieved at a

Abstract = {{As a response to the threat of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,
   Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs), namely, Electric Vehicles (EVs),
   Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehides
   (PHEVs) have been invented. The purpose of this study is to analyze the
   impact of socio-economic factors on AFV adoption rates in Ontario
   between the years 2012 to 2050. This paper focuses on analyzing EV, HEV
   and PHEV popularity in Ontario and discusses various socioeconomic
   factors affecting adoption rates. The number of light duty vehicles sold
   in the future is initially forecasted. In the next step, a penetration
   function is developed which consists of two parts; the diffusion rate
   and the socio-economic factors. Three general scenarios are considered
   when deploying the penetration function. Each scenario presents the
   weight assigned to the diffusion rate and the socio-economic factors.
   The socio-economic section is developed by using the historical trend of
   the all-in costs of vehicles over the time period of years 1996-2012.
   Vehicles' all-in costs depend on drivers' age, gender, location, monthly
   insurance, daily driving distance, and traffic, in addition to
   production year, make, model, trim, body and transmission, of vehicles.
   In this study, aggressive, average and mild all-in costs are studied for
   the adoption rates for male and female drivers separately. Overall, our
   results indicate that EV, HEV and PHEV adoption will increase
   substantially in the future, comprising of approximately 30\%-38\%
   (dependent on the considered scenario) of the total conventional
   vehicles sold by 2050. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) rely on intervehicle relay to extend
   the communication range of individual vehicles for message transmissions
   to roadside units (RSUs). With the presence of a large number of quickly
   moving vehicles in the network, the end-to-end transmission performance
   from individual vehicles to RSUs through intervehicle relaying is,
   however, highly unreliable due to the violative intervehicle
   connectivity. As an effort toward this issue, this paper develops an
   efficient message routing scheme that can maximize the message delivery
   throughput from vehicles to RSUs. Specifically, we first develop a
   mathematical framework to analyze the asymptotic throughput scaling of
   VANETs. We demonstrate that in an urban-like layout, the achievable
   uplink throughput per vehicle from vehicle to RSUs scales as Theta(1/log
   n) when the number of RSUs scales as Theta(n/ log n) with n denoting
   vehicle population. B y noting that the network throughput is
   bottlenecked by the unbalanced data traffic generated by hotspots of
   realistic urban areas, which may overload the RSUs nearby, a novel
   packet-forwarding scheme is proposed to approach the optimal network
   throughput by exploiting the mobility diversity of vehicles to balance
   the data traffic across the network. Using extensive simulations based
   on realistic traffic traces, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
   improve the network throughput approaching the asymptotic throughput
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The recent paradigm of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) enables a broad range
   of mobile applications. A critical challenge for the paradigm is to
   incentivize phone users to be workers providing sensing services. While
   some theoretical incentive mechanisms for general-purpose crowdsourcing
   have been proposed, it is still an open issue as to how to incorporate
   the theoretical framework into the practical MCS system. In this paper,
   we propose an incentive mechanism based on a quality-driven auction
   (QDA). The mechanism is specifically for the MCS system, where the
   worker is paid off based on the quality of sensed data instead of
   working time, as adopted in the literature. We theoretically prove that
   the mechanism is truthful, individual rational, platform profitable, and
   social-welfare optimal. Moreover, we incorporate our incentive mechanism
   into a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor localization system to incentivize
   the MCS-based fingerprint collection. We present a probabilistic model
   to evaluate the reliability of the submitted data, which resolves the
   issue that the ground truth for the data reliability is unavailable. We
   realize and deploy an indoor localization system to evaluate our
   proposed incentive mechanism and present extensive experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a framework for vessel surveillance video uploading
   via maritime wideband communication networks. A broadband wireless
   network utilizing a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA)-based media
   access control protocol is employed to establish a shore-side network
   infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism is
   adopted to achieve intermittent network connectivity in maritime
   communications. To provide high-quality videos to the administrative
   authority, a resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the
   throughput priority-based video transmission problem, subject to the
   intermittent network connections and the time indexes such as the
   release time and deadline of each video packet. To reduce computational
   complexity, time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original
   resource allocation problem into a two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling
   problem. Three offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, namely, a
   time-capacity-mapping- based two-phase (TMTP) algorithm for a single
   machine, a TMTP algorithm for two machines, and an interval
   graph-theory-based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. It is
   mathematically proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation
   ratio (i.e., the ratio of the throughput of an optimal schedule to that
   of the IGTJRS algorithm) of 2 and time complexity of O(n(2)).
   Simulations results validate the performance of the proposed algorithms,
   based on real ship route traces obtained from navigation software
   BLM-Shipping.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms controlling the accumulation of dissolved methane in
   anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) treating a synthetic dilute
   wastewater (a glucose medium) were assessed experimentally and
   theoretically. The AnMBR was maintained at a temperature of 24-26
   degrees C as the organic loading rate increased from 0.39 to 1.1 kg
   COD/m(3)-d. The measured concentration of dissolved methane was
   consistently 2.2- to 2.5-fold larger than the concentration of dissolved
   methane at thermodynamic equilibrium with the measured CH4 partial
   pressure, and the fraction of dissolved methane was as high as 76\% of
   the total methane produced. The low gas production rate in the AnMBR
   significantly slowed the mass transport of dissolved methane to the gas
   phase. Although the production rate of total methane increased linearly
   with the COD loading rate, the concentration of dissolved methane only
   slightly increased with an increasing organic loading rate, because the
   mass-transfer rate increased by almost 5-fold as the COD loading
   increased from 0.39 to 1.1 kg COD/m(3)-d. Thus, slow mass transport
   kinetics exacerbated the situation in which dissolved methane accounted
   for a substantial fraction of the total methane generated from the
   AnMBR.}},

Abstract = {{In comparison with H.264/Advanced Video Coding, the newest video coding
   standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), improves video coding
   rate-distortion (RD) performance, but at the price of significant
   increase in its encoding complexity, especially, in intra-mode decision
   due to the adoption of more complex block partitions and more candidate
   intra-prediction modes (IPMs). To reduce the mode decision complexity in
   HEVC intra-frame coding, while maintaining its RD performance, in this
   paper, we first formulate the mode decision problem in intra-frame
   coding as a Bayesian decision problem based on the newly proposed
   transparent composite model (TCM) for discrete cosine transform
   coefficients, and then present an outlier-based fast intra-mode decision
   (OIMD) algorithm. The proposed OIMD algorithm reduces the complexity
   using outliers identified by TCM to make a fast coding unit
   split/nonsplit decision and reduce the number of IPMs to be compared. To
   further take advantage of the outlier information furnished by TCM, we
   also refine entropy coding in HEVC by encoding the outlier information
   first, and then the actual mode decision conditionally given the outlier
   information. The proposed OIMD algorithm can work with and without the
   proposed entropy coding refinement. Experiments show that for the
   all-intra-main test configuration of HEVC: 1) when applied alone, the
   proposed OIMD algorithm reduces, on average, the encoding time (ET) by
   50\% with 0.7\% Bjontegaard distortion (BD)-rate increase and 2) when
   applied in conjunction with the proposed entropy coding refinement, it
   reduces, on average, both the ET by 50\% and BD-rate by 0.15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle attachment at a fluid interface is a process that often
   takes place concurrently with nanoparticle aggregation in the bulk of
   the suspension. Here we investigate systematically the coupling of these
   processes with reference to the adsorption of aqueous suspensions of
   ethyl cellulose (EC) nanoparticles at the air water interface. The
   suspension stability is optimal at neutral pH and in the absence of
   salt, conditions under which the electrostatic repulsion among EC
   nanoparticles is maximized. Nonetheless, hydrophobic attraction
   dominates particle interface inter-actions, resulting in the
   irreversible adsorption of EC nanoparticles at the air water interface.
   The addition of salt weakens the particle particle and particle
   interface repulsive electrostatic forces. This leads to destabilization
   of the suspension at ionic strengths of 0.05 M or greater but does not
   affect nanoparticle adsorption. The energy of adsorption, the surface
   tension interface coverage at steady state, and the particle contact
   angle at the interface all remain unchanged by the addition of These
   findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of colloidal
   systems and inform the utilization of EC nanocolloids, in particular for
   the stabilization of foams and emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a system consisting of N parallel servers, where jobs with
   different resource requirements arrive and are assigned to the servers
   for processing. Each server has a finite resource capacity and therefore
   can serve only a finite number of jobs at a time. We assume that
   different servers have different resource capacities. A job is accepted
   for processing only if the resource requested by the job is available at
   the server to which it is assigned. Otherwise, the job is discarded or
   blocked. We consider randomized schemes to assign jobs to servers with
   the aim of reducing the average blocking probability of jobs in the
   system. In particular, we consider a scheme that assigns an incoming job
   to the server having maximum available vacancy or unused resource among
   d randomly sampled servers. We consider the system in the limit where
   both the number of servers and the arrival rates of jobs are scaled by a
   large factor. This gives rise to a mean field analysis. We show that in
   the limiting system the servers behave independently a property termed
   as propagation of chaos. Stationary tail probabilities of server
   occupancies are obtained from the stationary solution of the mean field
   which is shown to be unique and globally attractive. We further
   characterize the rate of decay of the stationary tail probabilities.
   Numerical results suggest that the proposed scheme significantly reduces
   the average blocking probability of jobs as compared to static schemes
   that probabilistically route jobs to servers independently of their
   states. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce electrically thin dielectric lenses and reflectors that
   focus a plane wave based on the principles of phase compensation and
   constructive wave interference. Phase compensation is achieved by
   arranging thin rectangular slabs having different dielectric
   permittivity according to a permittivity profile obtained through
   analytic design equations. All incident rays parallel to the optical
   axis converge to a focal point with equalized optical paths resulting in
   constructive interference. Plane wave simulations indicate strong
   focusing, even in the presence of impedance mismatch between free space
   and the dielectric layers composing the lens. We demonstrate focusing at
   9.45 GHz using a lens fabricated with commercially available dielectric
   materials. In addition to focusing, the flat lens proposed here
   demonstrates relatively high power gain at the focal point. We also
   present a flat reflector based on the same concept. We believe that the
   proposed dielectric lens and reflector are strong candidates to replace
   heavy metallic dishes and reflectors used in a variety of applications,
   especially satellites. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Three-wheeled vehicles can address many congestion, parking and
   pollution issues associated with urban transportation. Previous studies
   about control of dynamics of three-wheeled vehicles mostly focus on roll
   dynamics control. This study considers simultaneous control of roll and
   yaw dynamics. For this purpose, an integrated system has been developed
   to coordinate active front steering, direct yaw moment control and
   active tilt systems. The challenges in the control system design arise
   in finding a compromise between improving vehicle dynamic behaviour and
   minimizing the actuators' torque requirements. This study first
   introduces the vehicle model and then, using optimal control theory,
   develops an integrated control strategy that works based on the feedback
   signals from the vehicle's state variables and the steering input
   feed-forward. Using a comprehensive nonlinear model, the simulation
   results illustrate considerable improvements in vehicle handling through
   the integrated control system in comparison with the pure active front
   steering, direct yaw moment control or active tilt systems.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We investigate bilayer phosphorene field-effect transistors (FETs) by
   self-consistent atomistic quantum transport simulations. Despite a
   penalty in electrostatic control for multiple layers, 10-nm-channel
   bilayer phosphorene FETs can exhibit excellent device characteristics,
   such as I-on > 3 mA/mu m, large current ratio (> 10(7)), and small
   subthreshold swing (SS) of 66 mV/dec, with a double-gate device
   structure. While the scaling of gate dielectric monotonically enhances
   the overall performance of this device, channel length can only be
   scaled down to similar to 8 nm due to significant short-channel effects.
   We benchmark bilayer phosphorene FETs against bilayer MoS2 and WSe2 FETs
   along with a monolayer phosphorene device, which reveals that bilayer
   phosphorene FETs have favorable switching characteristics over other
   similar 2-D bilayer semiconductor devices, making both monolayer and
   bilayer phosphorene attractive for future switching applications. Our
   simulation results not only provide the performance and scaling limit of
   bilayer phosphorene FETs but also create irreplaceable insights into
   proper device design and parameter optimizations.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The industrial Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum is a
   valued acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) solvent producer that is able
   to utilize a vast array of carbon sources in fermentation. When glucose
   is present in the growth medium, however, C. acetobutylicum, like many
   Gram-positive organisms, exhibits biphasic growth characteristics in
   which glucose is used preferentially over secondary carbon sources, a
   phenomenon known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR). The secondary
   carbon source is only utilized when the supply of glucose is exhausted,
   resulting in inefficient use of complex carbon sources. As biofuel
   production is sought from cheap feedstock, attention has turned to
   lignocellulosic biomass. Growth of C. acetobutylicum on lignocellulose,
   however, can be limited by CCR. Here, we present a method to relieve the
   inhibitory effect of CCR and allow simultaneous utilization of the
   lignocellulosic sugars of glucose and xylose by C. acetobutylicum.
   First, we utilized an in vivo gene reporter assay to demonstrate that an
   identified 14-nucleotide catabolite responsive element (CRE) sequence
   was sufficient to introduce CCR-mediated transcriptional inhibition,
   while subsequent mutation of the CRE sequence relieved the inhibitory
   effect. Next, we demonstrated that C. acetobutylicum harboring a
   CRE-less plasmid-borne xylose and pentose phosphate pathway operon
   afforded a 7.5-fold increase in xylose utilization in the presence of
   glucose as compared to a wild-type CRE plasmid-borne operon, effectively
   overcoming native CCR effects. The methodology presented here should
   translate to other members of Clostridium that exhibit CCR to enable
   simultaneous utilization of a vast array of carbon sources.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Maintaining the serviceability of a large number of buildings is a huge
   challenge that requires a perpetual cycle of inspections and capital
   renewal actions. Inspection, however, is subjective, costly, and
   time-consuming. To substantially reduce inspection effort, this research
   proposes a dynamic inspection-priority system (DIPS) that analyzes
   recent records of reactive-maintenance data, which is often not utilized
   for capital renewal, to establish a condition prediction mechanism for
   most building components without inspection. DIPS also incorporates
   procedures to prioritize and schedule key inspection tasks in addition
   to a tablet application designed to allow all-on-site visual inspection
   by marking on two-dimensional (2D) digital plans. A prototype system of
   DIPS has been developed and tested using the data of 88 schools in
   Canada and proved its usefulness as an efficient approach to improve the
   internal inspection practices of organizations that own a large number
   of buildings. This research contributes to integrating the maintenance
   and capital renewal functions, introducing a simple visual approach to
   inspection, saving inspection time and cost, and ultimately improving
   the economics of the multibillion-dollar business of capital renewal.

Title = {{Behavioral Economic Concepts for Funding Infrastructure Rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral economics is a newly emerging field that examines the impact
   of psychological factors such as attitudes, biases, and behaviors on
   decision makers' choices. Because many decisions in engineering and
   management involve subjective experience-based assessments of situations
   (e.g., bidding and fund-allocation), the psychological factors playing
   an important role in these decisions need to be considered. This paper
   thus introduces common behavioral economic concepts and examines the
   applicability of the most influential behavior loss aversion in the
   asset management domain, particularly infrastructure rehabilitation
   projects. Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer
   avoiding loss more than acquiring gain. Using a pavement case study, a
   detailed life cycle cost analysis model has been developed and extensive

Journal = {{MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},

Abstract = {{Solid tumors with different microvascular densities (MVD) have been
   shown to have different outcomes in clinical studies. Other studies have
   demonstrated the significant correlation between high MVD, elevated
   interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and metastasis in cancers. Elevated
   IFP in solid tumors prevents drug macromolecules reaching most cancerous
   cells. To overcome this barrier, antiangiogenesis drugs can reduce MVD
   within the tumor and lower IFP. A quantitative approach is essential to
   compute how much reduction in MVD is required for a specific tumor to
   reach a desired amount of IFP for drug delivery purposes.
   Here we provide a computational framework to investigate how IFP is
   affected by the tumor size, the MVD, and location of vessels within the
   tumor. A general physiologically relevant tumor type with a heterogenous
   vascular structure surrounded by normal tissue is utilized. Then the
   continuity equation, Darcy's law, and Starling's equation are applied in
   the continuum mechanics model, which can calculate IFP for different
   cases of solid tumors. High MVD causes IFP elevation in solid tumors,
   and IFP distribution correlates with microvascular distribution within
   tumor tissue. However, for tumors with constant MVD but different
   microvascular structures, the average values of IFP were found to be the
   same. Moreover, for a constant MVD and vascular distribution, an
   increase in tumor size leads to increased IFP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) are an emerging class of soft
   active materials that are finding growing application as underwater
   propulsors for miniature biomimetic swimmers. Understanding the
   hydrodynamics generated by an IPMC vibrating under water is central to
   the design of such biomimetic swimmers. In this paper, we propose the
   use of time-resolved particle image velocimetry to detail the fluid
   kinematics and kinetics in the vicinity of an IPMC vibrating along its
   fundamental structural mode. The reconstructed pressure field is
   ultimately used to estimate the thrust produced by the IPMC. The
   vibration frequency is systematically varied to elucidate the role of
   the Reynolds number on the flow physics and the thrust production.
   Experimental results indicate the formation and shedding of vortical
   structures from the IPMC tip during its vibration. Vorticity shedding is
   sustained by the pressure gradients along each side of the IPMC, which
   are most severe in the vicinity of the tip. The mean thrust is found to
   robustly increase with the Reynolds number, closely following a power
   law that has been derived from direct three-dimensional numerical
   simulations. A reduced order distributed model is proposed to describe
   IPMC underwater vibration and estimate thrust production, offering
   insight into the physics of underwater propulsion and aiding in the
   design of IPMC-based propulsors.}},

Title = {{Winter Road Surface Condition Forecasting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study has attempted to address a challenging problem in winter road
   maintenance, namely road surface condition (RSC) forecasting. A novel
   conceptual framework for short-term road surface condition forecasting
   is proposed. This framework is designed to consider all important
   conditional factors, including weather, traffic, and maintenance
   operations. Salt applications are modeled by considering a history
   instead of one single-time interval of salting operations. In this way,
   the variation of snow/ice melting speed caused by both residual salt
   amounts and salt-contaminant mixing state is effectively incorporated in
   the forecasting model, enabling accurate short-term forecasting for
   contaminant layers. This approach practically circumvents a major
   limitation of previous studies, making the postsalting RSC forecasting
   more reliable and accurate. Under this model framework, several advanced
   time series modeling methodologies are introduced into the analysis in
   order to capture the highly complex interactions between RSC measures
   and conditional factors. Those methodologies, especially the univariate
   and multivariate integrated autoregressive moving average (ARIMA)
   methods, are for the first time applied to the winter RSC evolution
   process. The forecasting errors of surface temperature and contaminant
   layer depths are all found to be small. The calibrated models are simple
   in structure, easy to interpret, and mostly consistent with physical
   knowledge. Compared to existing models, the proposed models provide
   extra flexibility for refactory, tuning, and deployment.}},

Abstract = {{Two new physical designs for sensors that can be used for strain
   measurement in large structures, such as bridges, wind turbines, or

   high sensitivity, they are based on simple operating principle of

   amplification. The chevron beams convert small amount of applied strains
   to measurable changes in capacitance of comb fingers. The design of the
   structures enables simple fabrication methods for the realization of the
   sensors. Two designs are proposed with the first design can also be used
   as a sensitive resonant strain sensor. Device performances are validated
   both by analytical solutions and also by finite-element method
   simulations. The obtained nominal capacitance is 25 fF, with
   sensitivities of 13 and 2.7 aF per microstrain (mu epsilon) while
   demonstrating a maximum strain range of +/- 1000 and +/- 1800 mu

Abstract = {{The ease of use and versatility of the Baculovirus Expression Vector
   System (BEVS) has made it one of the most widely used systems for
   recombinant protein production However, co-expression systems currently
   in use mainly make use of the very strong very late p10 and polyhedron
   (polh) promoters to drive expression of foreign genes, which does not
   provide much scope for tailoring expression ratios within the cell. This
   work demonstrates the use of different Autographa californica
   multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) promoters to control the
   timing and expression of two easily traceable fluorescent proteins, the
   enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and a red fluorescent protein
   (DsRed2) in a BEVS co-expression system. Our results show that gene
   expression levels can easily be controlled using this strategy, and also
   that modulating the expression level of one protein can influence the
   level of expression of the other protein within the system, thus
   confirming the concept of genes competing for limited cellular
   resources. Plots of expression ratios of the two model genes over time
   were obtained, and may be used in future work to tightly control timing
   and levels of foreign gene expression in an insect cell co-expression

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{181-186}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Falling film drain water heat recovery (DWHR) systems are heat
   exchangers used to recover heat from the building graywater, mainly from
   showers, to preheat the incoming mains water. These systems are designed
   to be installed vertically, as is required for the formation of a
   uniform falling film. A perfectly vertical installation, however, is not
   always obtainable, and several building designers and DWHR manufacturers
   have shown an interest in estimating the reduction in DWHR performance
   for non-vertical installations.
   The current work aims to address this issue by measuring the change in
   DWHR effectiveness for tilt angles up to 15 degrees off vertical, and by
   producing generalized guidelines regarding how a system performs in a
   non-vertical orientation. In general, it has been shown that the
   performance of DWHR decreases as the installation angle with respect to
   the vertical increases. The results show that for an installation angle
   of 2 degrees, a maximum performance drop of 4\% relative to a vertical
   installation could occur. For installation angles larger than 2 degrees,
   the performance drop becomes large and variable for all pipe diameters.
   Visible observations show that non-uniform film formation is the cause
   of this. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methanol reformer system to produce power using a high temperature

   stoichiometric ratio, the hydrogen utilization, and the rate of power
   production on the reformate gas composition, fuel cell performance,
   input fuel flow rate, and the heat duties of the system components. We
   specifically examined the effects of the reformate gas composition at
   various fuel cell temperatures on the performance of HT-PEMFC. The
   results confirm that the CO molar ratio in the reformate gas increases
   with a low SC ratio and high reformer temperature. However, the effect
   of CO molar ratio on the fuel cell performance decreases at elevated
   fuel cell temperatures. The fuel cell voltage decreases similar to 78\%
   with the variation of the current density from 0.1 A/cm(2) to 1 A/cm2
   for 160 degrees C fuel cell temperature and 0.9\% CO molar ratio in the
   reformate gas while it is similar to 61\% for 180 degrees C fuel cell
   temperature. In addition, at elevated fuel cell temperatures from 160
   degrees C to 180 degrees C, the input fuel flow rate to produce a given
   power generation from the system decreases, while enough heat is still

Abstract = {{We report sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) stabilization of graphene
   nanosheets, with two different sizes as auxiliary fillers inside the
   conventional electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) composite. Using
   this non-covalent modification approach we were able to preserve the
   single-layer structure of graphene layers and prevent their re-stacking
   inside the composite, which resulted in a significant electrical
   conductivity improvement of ECAs at noticeably low filler content.
   Addition of 1.5 wt\% small and large SDS-modified graphene into the
   conventional ECAs with 10 wt\% silver flakes led to low electrical
   resistivity values of 5.5 x 10(3) Omega cm and 35 Omega cm,
   respectively, while at least 40 wt\% of silver flakes was required for
   the conventional ECA to be electrically conductive. A highly conductive
   ECA with very low bulk resistivity of 1.6 x 10(-5) Omega cm was prepared
   by adding 1.5 wt\% of SDS-modified large graphene into the conventional
   ECA with 80 wt\% silver flakes which is less than that of eutectic
   lead-based solders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the deployment and characterization of a
   micro-scale aerosol-jet additive manufacturing technology to print
   graphene interconnects. A highly concentrated graphene ink with
   viscosity of 21 cP and 3.1 mg/ml graphene flakes with the lateral size
   below 200 nm was developed and adopted for this process to make a
   reliable and repeatable graphene deposition on the treated Si/SiO2
   wafers. To this end, the influence of the most significant process
   parameters, including the atomizer power, the atomizer flow rate, and
   the number of the printed layers, on the size and properties of graphene
   interconnects was studied. Results show that the aerosol-jet printing
   process is capable of printing micro-scale graphene interconnects with
   variable widths in the range of 10-90 mu m. These patterns, as the
   finest printed graphene patterns, with resistivity as low as 0.018 Omega
   cm and sheet resistance of 1.64 k Omega/square may ease the development
   of miniaturized printed electronic applications of graphene. (C) 2015

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{281-293}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The long-term (90 days) impact of dosing FeCl3 on bioprocess performance
   and membrane performance in a pilot AnMBR fed with authentic sewage was
   evaluated. The addition of 26 mg/L of FeCl3 enhanced the performance of
   the AnMBR with respect to removal efficiencies of COD and BOD5, but did
   not have a significant influence on the removal efficiencies of TKN and
   TP and the methane yield. The membrane was operated at a constant flux
   of 17 LMH and its performance was significantly improved by dosing
   FeCl3. This was demonstrated by a reduction in the fouling that
   withstood scouring stresses to values lower than 5 kPa and negligible
   reversible fouling for the first 75 days. The superior membrane
   performance was consistent with the shift of particle size distribution
   to the particulate fraction and the reduced colloidal and soluble
   substances in the sludge, especially the soluble protein, carbohydrate,
   Ca and S. CLSM tests showed that the addition of FeCl3 resulted in a
   thicker foulant layer and the deposition of protein and carbohydrate on
   the membrane surface was significantly reduced. Therefore a more porous
   foulant layer was formed and this prevented the development of a
   strongly-attached cake layer and pore blocking. A recovery cleaning
   study indicated FeCl3 dosing enhanced the efficiency of the recovery
   cleaning protocol. The foulants formed with the Fe-dosed sludge had
   greater inorganic content, as 75\% of the foulant resistance was removed
   by citric acid. The superior membrane performance during the operation
   combined with enhanced cleaning efficiency by FeCl3 dosing would
   significantly improve the sustainability of AnMBR in municipal
   wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{348}},
Pages = {{85-91}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The presence of dyes, pharmaceuticals and many other pollutants in
   wastewaters is critical due to severe effects on the human beings and on
   the environment. Here, solutions of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) were tested as adsorbents for the removal of
   methylene blue (MB), a cationic dye, from aqueous media. The reduced
   forms of graphene oxide were obtained after laser irradiation of
   colloidal suspensions of graphene oxide, obtained by the Hummers and
   Offeman's method. We observed that both graphene oxide and its reduced
   forms are excellent adsorbents towards methylene blue. In particular,
   rGO showed a higher adsorption capacity than GO, suggesting that a
   strict control of laser irradiation time permits to obtain rGO with
   different degrees of reduction and therefore the residual oxygenated
   functional groups may influence the adsorption behaviour more or less.
   Characterization of the samples by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed
   that produced rGO sheets via laser irradiation exhibited a discontinuous
   surface where some holes could be detected contributing to an
   enhancement of the rGO surface area that is a higher adsorption
   capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the zone of discontinuous permafrost, the cycling and storage of
   water within and between wetlands is poorly understood. The presence of
   intermittent permafrost bodies tends to impede and re-direct the flow of
   water. In this region, the landscape is characterized by forested peat
   plateaus that are underlain by permafrost and are interspersed by
   permafrost-free wetlands. These include channel fens which convey water
   to the basin outlet through wide, hydraulically rough channels and flat
   bogs which are typically thought to retain moisture inputs as storage.
   Field studies conducted at a peatland-dominated landscape near Fort
   Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada, indicate the presence of
   ephemeral drainage channels that form a cascade of connected bogs that
   ultimately discharges into a channel fen. Consequently, understanding
   bogs as dynamic transmitters of surface and subsurface flows, rather
   than simple storage regions, calls for further examination. Whether bogs
   act as either storage features or flow through features has a direct
   impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Here, two adjacent
   series of bog cascades were gauged over two consecutive years to
   determine spatial and temporal changes in effective runoff contributing
   areas. It was found that runoff varies significantly between two
   adjacent bog cascades with one cascade producing 125mm of runoff over
   the 2-year period, while the other yielded only 25mm. The bog cascades
   are primarily active during the snowmelt season when moisture conditions
   are high; however flows can also be generated in response to large rain
   events. It is proposed that bog cascades operate under an element
   threshold concept' whereby in order for water to be transmitted through
   a bog, the depression storage capacity of that bog must first be
   satisfied. Our work indicates that whether bogs act as storage features
   or flow-through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing
   area in a basin. Neglecting to represent connected bogs as dynamic
   transmission features in the landscape is shown to underestimate water
   available for streamflow by between 5 and 15\%, and these systems are
   therefore a key component of the water balance in discontinuous
   permafrost regions. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Physically based distributed and semi-distributed hydrological models
   have become some of the primary tools for water resources studies and
   management over the past decades owing to increased computational
   capabilities and advances in data measurements. Representation of the
   existing heterogeneity in nature still remains one of the main
   challenges in these models and is accomplished primarily via watershed
   discretization, subdividing watersheds into hydrologically similar land
   parcels. Discretization decisions in distributed modelling studies are
   often ad hoc and determined with little or no quantitative analysis to
   support these decisions. In this work, we present a quantitative
   methodology for assessing alternative watershed discretization schemes
   in terms of their corresponding model performance in ungauged basins.
   The effect of the computational time spent for calibrating each scheme
   (calibration budget) is considered as part of the assessment. Here,
   these schemes differ in how they represent landscape attributes and
   range from a simple lumped scheme to more complex ones by adding spatial
   land cover and then soil information. The methodology is demonstrated
   using the Modelisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie (MESH) model
   as applied to the Nottawasaga River basin in Ontario, Canada. Results
   reveal that model performance in ungauged basins depends upon the
   location of the validation sub-basin (i.e. upstream or downstream) with
   respect to the calibration sub-basins. Also, using a more complex scheme
   did not necessarily lead to improved performance in validation, when
   constrained by calibration budget. Therefore, the calibration budget
   also should be considered as a factor in the assessment process. This
   methodology was also implemented using a shorter sub-period for
   calibration, which leads to substantial computational saving. Results of
   the sub-period test were promising and consistent particularly when
   sufficient budget is spent to calibrate the model. Other strategies
   utilized for reducing the computational burden of the proposed analyses
   are also discussed in this study. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we introduce a deep-structured conditional random field
   (DS-CRF) model for the purpose of state-based object silhouette
   tracking. The proposed DS-CRF model consists of a series of state
   layers, where each state layer spatially characterizes the object
   silhouette at a particular point in time. The interactions between
   adjacent state layers are established by inter-layer connectivity
   dynamically determined based on inter-frame optical flow. By incorporate
   both spatial and temporal context in a dynamic fashion within such a
   deep-structured probabilistic graphical model, the proposed DS-CRF model
   allows us to develop a framework that can accurately and efficiently
   track object silhouettes that can change greatly over time, as well as
   under different situations such as occlusion and multiple targets within
   the scene. Experiment results using video surveillance datasets
   containing different scenarios such as occlusion and multiple targets
   showed that the proposed DS-CRF approach provides strong object
   silhouette tracking performance when compared to baseline methods such
   as mean-shift tracking, as well as state-of-the-art methods such as

Abstract = {{In this study, we added a small amount of polyethylenimine (PEI) into
   several ambipolar and p-type polymer semiconductors and used these
   blends as channel materials in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). It
   is found that PEI can effectively suppress hole transport
   characteristics while maintaining or promoting the electron transport
   performance. Unipolar n-channel OTFTs with electron-only transport
   behavior is achieved for all the polymer semiconductors chosen with 2-10
   wt \% PEI. The electron-rich nitrogen atoms in PEI are thought to fill
   the electron traps, raise the Fermi level and function as trapping sites
   for holes, leading to promotion of electron transport and suppression of
   hole transport. This work demonstrates a convenient general approach to
   transforming ambipolar and p-type polymer semiconductors into unipolar
   n-type polymer semiconductors that are useful for printed logic circuits

Abstract = {{Plates of AA5052 (Al-Mg) alloy in both annealed (solution-treated) and
   wrought (rolled) temper conditions were subjected to friction stir
   processing (FSP) at various w/v pitch ratios from 4 to 28 rev.min/mm.
   The role of stored strain energy on the evolution of restoration
   mechanisms and crystallographic texture components were assessed in
   terms of microstructural features evaluated using electron
   back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) analysis. The results revealed that FSP significantly refined the
   grain structure and changed the crystallographic micro-texture
   components. The grain size of the annealed and wrought alloy was reduced
   from 49.4 and 9.7 mu m initial values to 3.3 and 3.6 mu m, respectively
   when w/v=4. Also, the formation of a \{121\}{[}110] crystallographic
   shear texture with a strong B/(B) over bar component intensity were
   observed. The microstructural changes in the annealed alloy were related
   to the occurrence of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX)
   mechanism, while operation of a static recrystallization (SRX) prior to
   a continuous (CDRX) mode in the wrought one, revealing the effect of
   stored strain energy. Evaluations of the mechanical properties also
   determined enhanced ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and
   indentation Vickers hardness while preserving the yield stress. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An aluminum-magnesium alloy was friction-stir processed in the presence
   of TiO2 nanoparticles which were pre-placed in a groove on the surface
   to produce a composite. Field emission-scanning and transmission
   electron microscopy studies show that solid state chemical reactions
   occur between the Al-Mg matrix and the ceramic particles upon the severe
   plastic deformation process. The microstructure of the aluminum alloy
   consists of a coarse grain structure, large complex (Fe,Mn,Cr)(3)SiAl12
   particles, and small Mg2Si precipitates. After friction stir processing,
   a deformed grain structure containing rod-like Al-Fe-Mn-Si precipitates
   is attained, along with cuboidal (similar to 100 nm) Cr-2 precipitates
   and spherical (similar to 100 and 5 nm) Mg2Si particles. In the presence
   of TiO2 nanoparticles, magnesium oxide (MgO) and titanium aluminide
   (Al3Ti) nanophases are formed. It is shown that these microstructural
   modifications lead to a significant enhancement in the hardness and
   tensile strength of the aluminum alloy. The relationship between the
   microstructural evolution and mechanical properties and the role of hard
   inclusions are presented and discussed. An analysis based on
   strengthening models indicates that the yield strength of the
   nanocomposite is mainly controlled by dislocations and grain boundaries
   rather than the nano-scale inclusions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   on the engineering of the number of graphene layers, using RIE. The
   effects were studied using Raman spectroscopy. This analysis indicated
   that the photo-resist mask is better than the polystyrene mask because
   of its lower post processing effects on the graphene surface during the
   RIE process. A single layer graphene was achieved from a bi-layer
   graphene after 3 s of the RIE process using oxygen plasma, and the
   bi-layer graphene was successfully etched after 6 s of the RIE process.
   The bilayer etching time was significantly smaller than reported values

   polymers presented herein are polyselenophenes containing alpha-ketal
   side-chains. The alpha-ketal side-chains can be converted to electron
   withdrawing alpha-ketone side-chains postpolymerization. Since the
   starting monomer is relatively electron-rich, it can be polymerized
   using chain growth methods. Switching the electron donating ability of
   the side chain postpolymerization is an effective way to synthesize
   electron-deficient conjugated polymers from electron-rich monomers.
   Whereas the alpha-ketal polymer has optoelectronic properties that are
   consistent with other electron-rich (p-type) polymers, the alpha-keto
   polymer features a broad red optical-absorption, narrow HOMO-LUMO gap
   (similar to 1.5 eV), low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels, and ambipolar
   charge transport properties. We support these observations using density
   functional theory calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We have experimentally demonstrated broadband tuneable four-wave mixing
   in AlGaAs nanowires with the widths ranging between 400 and 650 nm and
   lengths from 0 to 2 mm. We performed a detailed experimental study of
   the parameters influencing the FWM performance in these devices
   (experimental conditions and nanowire dimensions). The maximum
   signal-to-idler conversion range was 100 nm, limited by the tuning range
   of the pump source. The maximum conversion efficiency, defined as the
   ratio of the output idler power to the output signal power, was -38 dB.
   In support of our explanation of the experimentally observed trends, we
   present modal analysis and group velocity dispersion numerical analysis.
   This study is what we believe to be a step forward towards realization
   of all-optical signal processing devices. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},

Volume = {{174}},

Abstract = {{Highly efficient, low-cost catalysts, especially with bifunctional
   electrocatalytic capabilities for both the oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are vital for the wide
   commercialization of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. In this study,
   BaMnO3 - a non-rare-earth element based perovskite nanorods have been
   prepared and investigated for the first time, and a thin carbon-coating
   with a thickness of approximately 10 nm has been successfully introduced
   to enhance the electrical conductivity of the bare perovskite.
   Electrochemical tests reveal that bare BaMnO3 nanorods exhibit very good
   catalytic activity. More interestingly, a remarkably enhanced ORR
   activity for the perovskite BaMnO3 nanorods was observed after coating
   with a thin layer of carbon, which dominated with a direct four-electron
   pathway. Meanwhile, the OER process has also been enhanced
   extraordinarily with the carbon-coating, reaching a maximum of 14.8 mA
   cm(-2) at 1.0V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is far superior to both the bare
   BaMnO3 nanorods and commercial Pt/C (20 wt\%) catalysts. Furthermore,
   the stabilities of bare BaMnO3 nanorods for both ORR and OER have also
   been improved dramatically with the help of carbon coating. These
   results shed light on the significant potential application of the
   carbon-coated perovskite BaMnO3 porous nanorods on fuel cells and
   metal-air batteries as an efficient bifunctional catalyst. (C) 2015

Title = {{Structural Design of Cathodes for Li-S Batteries}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{16, SI}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Battery technologies involving Li-S chemistries have been touted as one
   of the most promising next generation systems. The theoretical capacity
   of sulfur is nearly an order of magnitude higher than current Li-ion
   battery insertion cathodes and when coupled with a Li metal anode, Li-S
   batteries promise specific energies nearly five-fold higher. However,
   this assertion only holds if sulfur cathodes could be designed in the
   same manner as cathodes for Li-ion batteries. Here, the recent efforts
   to engineer high capacity, thick, sulfur-based cathodes are explored.
   Various works are compared in terms of capacity, areal mass loading, and
   fraction of conductive additive, which are the critical parameters
   dictating the potential for a device to achieve a specific energy higher
   than current Li-ion batteries (i.e., >200 Wh kg(-1)). While an inferior
   specific energy is projected in the majority of cases, several promising
   strategies have the potential to achieve >500 Wh kg(-1). The challenges
   associated with the limited cycle-life of these systems due to both the
   polysulfide shuttle phenomenon and the rapid degradation of the Li metal
   anode that is experienced at the current densities required to charge
   high specific energy batteries in a reasonable timeframe are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Power to Gas for energy storage is a novel concept that is considered to
   be a viable solution to manage the existing off-peak power grid surplus
   issue. This work proposes the utilization of surplus power in the
   Canadian province of Ontario to produce hydrogen via the water
   electrolysis process to be used for energy storage and distribution to
   enhance the efficiency of the overall energy system. The existing
   natural gas distribution and storage infrastructure is utilized to
   distribute and store the electrolytic hydrogen. Although the system as a
   whole has a number of potential energy recovery pathways, this work
   focuses on the power to gas energy recovery route using two multi-period
   mixed integer linear programming models of potential energy hubs. The
   first model focusses on the case without the use of buffer storage for
   hydrogen, and the second model employs storage. The preliminary results
   show that net power exports to neighboring jurisdictions can be reduced
   by 2.3\% and 6.1\%, respectively, by making use of the exports to
   produce hydrogen. Within this framework the hydrogen concentration in
   the natural gas system is limited to a maximum value of 5 vol. \%. It
   was found that the monetary losses mitigated by reducing the power
   exports were close to \$3.8 million and \$10 million in the respective
   models. In addition to this, the use of hydrogen enriched natural gas in
   place of pure natural gas at the end user results in CO2 emission
   reductions close to 3504 metric tonnes and 9429 metric tonnes. The sized
   power to gas systems in the two cases can also earn potential revenues
   close to \$52,555 and \$141,427 from the emissions based on \$15 per
   tonne of CO2 emission reduced. These positive results encourage the
   development of more rigorous optimization models that can size the
   system based on trade-off benefits between the different energy recovery
   pathways of the power to gas system. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{A lens-free spectral light-field fusion microscopy (LSLFM) system is
   presented for enabling contrast- and resolution-enhanced imaging of
   biological specimens. LSLFM consists of a pulsed multispectral lens-free
   microscope for capturing interferometric light-field encodings at
   various wavelengths, and Bayesian-based fusion to reconstruct a fused
   object light-field from the encodings. By fusing unique object detail
   information captured at different wavelengths, LSLFM can achieve
   improved resolution, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a
   single-channel lens-free microscopy system. A five-channel LSLFM system
   was developed and quantitatively evaluated to validate the design.
   Experimental results demonstrated that the LSLFM system provided SNR
   improvements of 6-12 dB, as well as a six-fold improvement in the
   dispersion index (DI), over that achieved using a single-channel,
   resolution-enhancing lens-free deconvolution microscopy system or its
   multi-wavelength counterpart. Furthermore, the LSLFM system achieved an
   increase in numerical aperture (NA) of similar to 16\% over a
   single-channel resolution-enhancing lens-free deconvolution microscopy
   system at the highest resolution wavelength used in the study. Samples
   of Staurastrum paradoxum, a waterborne algae, and human corneal
   epithelial cells were imaged using the system to illustrate its
   potential for enhanced imaging of biological specimens. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{Flow forming is an old, but still promising, sheet metal forming
   technique to produce thin-walled, high-precision cylindrical
   auto-components (i.e. carriers and clutch housings). In the present
   research, the flow forming process was carried out on some commonly used
   face centered cubic (FCC) metals to assess the effect of processing
   parameters on the mechanical responses of materials during flow forming.
   To this end, flow forming operation with thickness reduction of 70\% was
   performed on 5052 and 6061 aluminum alloys, 70/30 brass, and pure
   copper. Mechanical responses of starting (as received) materials and
   flow formed parts, i.e. tensile strength, yield strength, elongation,
   work hardening rate, and work hardening exponent were discussed for each
   material separately and the results were compared. Also, flow formed
   materials were compared in terms of stacking fault energies and
   twinnability and the effects of these were considered on flow
   formability of materials and their flow behavior in flow forming
   operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the optimal distributed generation sizing and
   siting for voltage profile improvement, power losses, and total harmonic
   distortion (THD) reduction in a distribution network with high
   penetration of non-linear loads. The proposed planning methodology takes
   into consideration the load profile, the frequency spectrum of
   non-linear loads, and the technical constraints such as voltage limits
   at different buses (slack and load buses) of the system, feeder
   capacity, THD limits, and maximum penetration limit of DG units. The
   optimization process is based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method with
   three scenarios of objective function: system power losses, THD, and
   multi-objective function-based power losses and THD. This method is
   executed on the IEEE 31-bus system under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal
   (harmonics) operating conditions including load variations within the
   24-hr period. The simulation results using Matlab environment show the
   robustness of this method in optimal sizing and siting of DG, efficiency
   for improvement of voltage profile, reduction of power losses, and THD.
   A comparison with particle swarm optimization (PSO) method shows that
   the proposed method is better than PSO in reducing the power losses and
   THD in all suggested scenarios.}},

Title = {{Deformation and Interaction of Droplet Pairs in a Microchannel Under ac
   Electric Fields}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{The deformation and interaction of a droplet pair in an electric field
   determine the success of droplet coalescence. Electric intensity and
   initial droplet separation are crucial parameters in this process. In
   this work, a combined theoretical and numerical analysis is performed to
   study the electrohydrodynamics of confined droplet pairs in a
   rectangular microchannel under ac electric fields. We develop a
   theoretical model to predict the relationship between critical electric
   intensity and droplet separation. A geometrical model relating the
   initial droplet separation to the cone angle is also established to
   determine the critical separation for partial coalescence. These models
   are validated by comparisons with existing experimental observations.
   According to the initial separation and electric intensity, five regimes
   of droplet interactions are classified by direct numerical simulations,
   namely noncoalescence, coalescence, partial coalescence, ejection after
   coalescence, and ejection with partial coalescence. According to their
   controlling mechanisms, the five regimes are distinguished by three
   well-defined boundaries. The detailed dynamics of the partial
   coalescence phenomenon is resolved when the droplet separation exceeds
   the critical value. A dynamic liquid bridge between the droplets is
   sustained by the competition between surface tension and electric
   stress. The dynamics of ejected microjets at the exterior ends are also
   addressed to showtheir responses to the oscillating electric field. The
   full understanding of the droplet dynamics under electric fields can be
   used to predict the droplet fusion behaviors and thus to facilitate the
   design of droplet-based microfluidic devices.}},

Title = {{Automated prostate cancer detection via comprehensive multi-parametric
   magnetic resonance imaging texture feature models}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer and the
   second leading cause of cancer death in North America. Auto-detection of
   prostate cancer can play a major role in early detection of prostate
   cancer, which has a significant impact on patient survival rates. While
   multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) has shown promise
   in diagnosis of prostate cancer, the existing auto-detection algorithms
   do not take advantage of abundance of data available in MP-MRI to
   improve detection accuracy. The goal of this research was to design a
   radiomics-based auto-detection method for prostate cancer via utilizing
   MP-MRI data.
   Methods: In this work, we present new MP-MRI texture feature models for
   radiomics-driven detection of prostate cancer. In addition to commonly
   used non-invasive imaging sequences in conventional MP-MRI, namely
   T2-weighted MRI (T2w) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), our proposed
   MP-MRI texture feature models incorporate computed high-b DWI (CHB-DWI)
   and a new diffusion imaging modality called correlated diffusion imaging
   (CDI). Moreover, the proposed texture feature models incorporate
   features from individual b-value images. A comprehensive set of texture
   features was calculated for both the conventional MP-MRI and new MP-MRI
   texture feature models. We performed feature selection analysis for each
   individual modality and then combined best features from each modality
   to construct the optimized texture feature models.
   Results: The performance of the proposed MP-MRI texture feature models
   was evaluated via leave-one-patient-out cross-validation using a support
   vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on 40,975 cancerous and healthy
   tissue samples obtained from real clinical MP-MRI datasets. The proposed
   MP-MRI texture feature models outperformed the conventional model (i.e.,
   T2w+DWI) with regard to cancer detection accuracy.
   Conclusions: Comprehensive texture feature models were developed for
   improved radiomics-driven detection of prostate cancer using MP-MRI.
   Using a comprehensive set of texture features and a feature selection
   method, optimal texture feature models were constructed that improved
   the prostate cancer auto-detection significantly compared to
   conventional MP-MRI texture feature models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optimal torque distribution approach is proposed for
   electric vehicle equipped with four independent wheel motors to improve
   vehicle handling and stability performance. A novel objective function
   is formulated which works in a multifunctional way by considering the
   interference among different performance indices: forces and moment
   errors at the centre of gravity of the vehicle, actuator control efforts
   and tyre workload usage. To adapt different driving conditions, a
   weighting factors tuning scheme is designed to adjust the relative
   weight of each performance in the objective function. The effectiveness
   of the proposed optimal torque distribution is evaluated by simulations
   with CarSim and Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results under different
   driving scenarios indicate that the proposed control strategy can
   effectively improve the vehicle handling and stability even in slippery
   road conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control is a promising approach to exploit the

   strategy for a Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid powertrain (PHEV) using
   explicit model predictive control (eMPC) based on a new control-oriented
   model to improve the real-time implementation performance. By
   implementing the controller to a PHEV model through model and

Abstract = {{Economical and environmentally friendly geocast (EEFG) uses traffic
   signals to communicate with approaching vehicles. The communication can
   be signal-to-vehicle (TLS2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V). Based on the
   information sent, the vehicle receiving the message adapts its speed to
   a recommended speed (S-R), which helps the vehicle reduce fuel
   consumption and emissions. Our previous paper entitled ``Optimization of
   Fuel Cost and Emissions Using V2V Communications{''} develops a model to
   determine the optimum S-R. It also proposes heuristic expressions to
   compute the optimum or near-optimum S-R. This paper validates by
   simulation the applicability of EEFG in real-life scenarios based on
   actual measurements of traffic data. It shows the impact of using EEFG
   in a modeled real-world network in the city of Waterloo, ON, Canada,
   considering four case studies: 1) a suburban environment at the peak
   hour; 2) a suburban environment at the least busy hour; 3) an urban
   environment at the peak hour; and 4) an urban environment at the least
   busy hour. The results show that EEFG saves fuel and CO2 emissions in
   all four cases, where Case 3 has the most saving (up to 8\%). In TLS2V,
   the optimization and heuristic expressions give the same S-R results.

Abstract = {{With the flourishing of multi-functional wearable devices and the
   widespread use of smartphones, MHN becomes a promising paradigm of
   ubiquitous healthcare to continuously monitor our health conditions,
   remotely diagnose phenomena, and share health information in real time.
   However, MHNs raise critical security and privacy issues, since highly
   sensitive health information is collected, and users have diverse
   security and privacy requirements about such information. In this
   article, we investigate security and privacy protection in MHNs from the
   perspective of QoP, which offers users adjustable security protections
   at fine-grained levels. Specifically, we first introduce the
   architecture of MHN, and point out the security and privacy challenges
   from the perspective of QoP. We then present some countermeasures for
   security and privacy protection in MHNs, including privacy-preserving
   health data aggregation, secure health data processing, and misbehavior
   detection. Finally, we discuss some open problems and pose future
   research directions in MHNs.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of metallic precursors to flames evinces interest because
   of their potential ability to catalyze methane and ethanol combustion by
   means of supplemental gas-phase and surface reactions. A counterflow
   flame burner is used to spatially characterize and analyze the emissions
   from iron-pentacarbonyl-borne ethanol and methane combustion. Samples of
   the flue gases are obtained from these laminar and planar flames and are
   quantified using gas chromatography (GC) and Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy, while solid particles are examined through X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). Measurements from ethanol and methane flames are
   compared and analyzed, to investigate the role of metal particles
   derived from iron pentacarbonyl. Experimental data demonstrate, in both
   flames, a significant influence of the additive on combustion emissions,
   such as NO and soot precursors. The addition of iron pentacarbonyl is
   found to be more effective in restricting soot precursors in methane
   flames compared to ethanol flames. An enhanced production of
   acetaldehyde in the ethanol flame is observed under catalytic

Abstract = {{Encryptions are used in almost all standards to ensure the
   confidentiality of the data. Encryptions can be and indeed are
   implemented in the different layers of a network protocol stack.
   Conventional encryption performs the bitwise XOR operation between one
   message bit and one key stream bit to generate one ciphertext bit. Huo
   et al. have recently proposed to provide confidentialities on the user
   data by performing the phase encryption on the time domain OFDM samples
   in LTE system. Phase encryption is performed on the modulated symbols,
   different from the bit level of XOR encryption, i.e., stream cipher
   encryption. In this paper, we extend their study. We first generalize
   the phase encryption to general communication systems independent of the
   underlying modulation scheme. Then, we formulate the mathematical models
   for XOR and phase encryptions. Based on our model, we compare these two
   encryption methods in terms of their security and encryption efficiency.
   We also show phase encryption can resist traffic analysis attack when
   implemented in the physical layer. Finally, we conduct simulations to
   compare the performance of these two methods in terms of their decoding
   symbol error rate.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with devising two different fuzzy inference systems to
   predict the hardness of copper/carbon nanotube nanocomposite. These
   composites are outstanding candidates for thermal management
   applications in electronic packaging due to the high conductivity of
   copper. Knowing the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes, it
   seems that copper-based composites reinforced with small amount of
   carbon nanotubes, resulted in improved mechanical properties. Hence,
   carbon nanotube reinforced copper matrix nanocomposites are fabricated
   by hot-press sintering of high energy ball milled copper/carbon nanotube
   powders. Different milling factors are investigated. Finally the Vickers
   hardness of sintered nanocomposites is reported. To simulate a
   predictive framework for current case study, two different machine
   learning algorithms are engaged. The first learning algorithm is the
   classic least square optimization method, which provides the
   requirements for fast adaption of the consequent parts of fuzzy
   inference system. The second method learning algorithm uses the
   rudiments of neural computing through layering the fuzzy inference
   system and using back-propagation optimization algorithm. Based on the
   experiments, the authors realize that the adopted fuzzy systems can
   effectively extract the knowledge required for predicting the hardness
   of copper/carbon nanotube nanocomposite.}},

Abstract = {{Highly configurable systems allow users to tailor software to specific
   needs. Valid combinations of configuration options are often restricted
   by intricate constraints. Describing options and constraints in a
   variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations.
   To automate creating and verifying such models, we need to identify the
   origin of such constraints. We propose a static analysis approach, based
   on two rules, to extract configuration constraints from code. We apply
   it on four highly configurable systems to evaluate the accuracy of our
   approach and to determine which constraints are recoverable from the
   code. We find that our approach is highly accurate (93\% and 77\%
   respectively) and that we can recover 28\% of existing constraints. We
   complement our approach with a qualitative study to identify constraint
   sources, triangulating results from our automatic extraction, manual
   inspections, and interviews with 27 developers. We find that, apart from
   low-level implementation dependencies, configuration constraints enforce
   correct runtime behavior, improve users' configuration experience, and
   prevent corner cases. While the majority of constraints is extractable
   from code, our results indicate that creating a complete model requires
   further substantial domain knowledge and testing. Our results aim at
   supporting researchers and practitioners working on variability model
   engineering, evolution, and verification techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study user cooperation to enhance the physical layer
   security. Specifically, the source cooperates with friendly intermediate
   nodes to transmit message securely in the presence of multiple
   eavesdroppers. We propose a cooperative framework, whereby the source
   selects multiple partners and stimulates them by granting an amount of
   reward. First, multiple cooperative relays and jammers are selected by
   the source using greedy or cross-entropy based approaches. Then, the
   source and the partners negotiate for the payment and transmission
   power, which is modeled as a two-layer game. At the top layer, a
   buyer-seller game is utilized, where the source buys the service
   provided by the partners. At the bottom layer, all the partners share
   the reward by determining their transmission powers in a distributed
   way, which is formulated as a non-cooperative power selection game. By
   analyzing the game, the partners can determine the transmission powers
   for cooperation, while the source can select the best payment. To
   further improve the utility of the source, a set of reward allocation
   coefficients are introduced and optimized using particle swarm
   optimization approach. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate
   the performance of the proposed schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a simple and green approach to fabricate cellulose
   nanocrystal@polyrhodanine (CNC@PR) core sheath nanoparticles.
   Polymerization of rhodanine on the surface of negatively charged CNC was
   achieved using ferric chloride as the initiator and oxidant. The coating
   conditions were optimized by varying the ratio of CNC and monomer as
   well as the concentration of oxidant. Antimicrobial tests were performed
   using Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Bacillus subtilis (Gram
   positive) as model bacteria and the minimum inhibitory concentrations
   were determined by plate colony counting methods. Rod-like CNC@PR
   nanoparticles exhibited promising antimicrobial properties, comparable
   to spherical nanocomposite particles. This may be attributed to the
   lower percolation threshold for rod-like nanoparticles resulting from
   the higher aspect ratio. By taking advantage of the nanosize effects,
   the core sheath material can be a potential candidate for antimicrobial
   applications, such as food-packaging, antimicrobial additives and
   antimicrobial surfaces or coatings.}},

Abstract = {{Two-parameter continuation and bifurcation analysis strategies were
   applied to deal with the oscillatory phenomena of a Zymomonas mobilis
   ethanol fermentation system. A structured verified non-linear
   mathematical model considering the physiological limitations of
   microorganisms for a single continuous fermenter for ethanol production
   using Z. mobilis was built to identify the Hopf bifurcation (HB) points,
   which indicate the oscillatory behavior, using the inlet substrate
   concentration and the dilution rate as bifurcation parameters. The path
   of the HB points can be determined with different controlling operating
   parameters. It was found that with the addition of a small amount of
   cells or ethanol to the feed stream or by increasing the dilution rate,
   the oscillations could be eliminated and steady-state behavior was
   attained. Using a two-parameter continuation strategy, the Z. mobilis
   fermentation system could operate at steady state without oscillatory
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Fast Soft Decision Quantization With Adaptive Preselection and Dynamic

Abstract = {{Soft decision quantization (SDQ) is an efficient tool for video coding
   to achieve coefficient-level rate-distortion optimized quantization
   (RDOQ) with a 6\%-8\% bit rate saving. However, the software and
   hardware implementations of SDQ suffer from either high complexity or
   low throughput capacity due to complex Viterbi trellis search and
   sequential processing in context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding. In
   this paper, a fast SDQ algorithm is proposed to decrease the number of
   trellis stages to decrease the complexity and to break the data
   dependency in optimal SDQ. First, preselection is performed according to
   hard decision quantization results by intelligent coding cost estimation
   and comparison, during which some coefficients are judged to be safely
   excluded from trellis search, resulting in considerable complexity
   reduction. Second, a dynamic trellis graph with flexible structure is
   constructed according to the unsafe nonzero coefficients to accelerate
   the remaining partial Viterbi search. Third, a dynamic threshold
   selection model is proposed for adaptive thresholding to increase the
   probability of right preselection under a constraint on a predefined
   maximal probability of wrong preselection. The experimental results show
   that compared with optimal SDQ, the proposed algorithm can at least
   reduce the computation complexity by 50\%-80\%, memory accesses by
   75\%-82\%, and the sequential processing latency in hardware
   implementation by 87.25\%, with less than 0.4\% Bjontegaard bit rate
   increment when a maximum of three unsafe coefficients are kept for
   trellis search in one block. This paper is suitable for high-throughput
   hardware and computation-sensitive software implementations for SDQ and
   RDOQ for H.264/Advanced Video Coding and High Efficiency Video Coding
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of full-scale ozone-biofiltration was investigated over 14
   months to determine the potential effects of seasonally related changes
   in water temperature and quality on the removal of natural organic
   matter fractions. The biofilters removed on average 12\% of dissolved
   organic carbon, 31\% of biopolymers, 6\% of humic substances, 10\% of
   humic building blocks, 31\% of low-molecular-weight (LMW) acids/LMW
   humics, 14\% of LMW neutrals, and 52\% of assimilable organic carbon.
   The biofilters exhibited an increase in removal of dissolved organic
   carbon, biopolymers, LMW acids/LMW humics, and assimilable organic
   carbon as temperature increased from 3 to 28 degrees C, even though
   filter contact time was somewhat shorter at higher temperatures.
   Although phosphorus concentrations were reduced by coagulation
   pretreatment, the biofilters effectively removed the LMW compounds
   generated from ozonation. Filter biomass levels were not related to
   temperature, empty bed contact time, time during the filter cycle, or
   removal of natural organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Power consumption remains a hot issue in all areas of computing ranging
   from embedded systems that rely on batteries to large scale data centers
   where reducing the power consumption of computing devices directly
   affects not only the management cost, but also contributes to a greener
   computing environment. The power-aware real-time scheduling problem has
   recently been addressed for a compositional framework with periodic task
   model under the assumption that a processor can continuously vary its
   operating frequency and voltage. However, in practice, this technique is
   only suboptimal and still produce the waste of computational resources.
   This paper introduces new frequency scaling schemes that statically
   determine optimal processor speeds at system, component, and task levels
   with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of the
   entire framework. Since real-world processors support only a finite set
   of operating frequencies, our algorithms also consider only discrete
   speed levels and guarantee still that each task meets its deadline. We
   implemented and evaluated the performance of a prototype framework that
   incorporates our algorithms on top of the RT-Xen hypervisor in order to
   provide power-aware compositional real-time scheduling framework to
   virtual machines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an optimized nonparametric learning approach for obtaining
   the data-guided sampling distribution is proposed, where a probability
   density function (pdf) is learned in a nonparametric manner based on
   past measurements from similar types of signals. This learned sampling
   distribution is then used to better optimize the sampling process based
   on the underlying signal characteristics. A realization of this
   stochastic learning approach for compressive sensing of imaging data is
   introduced via a stochastic Monte Carlo optimization strategy to learn a
   nonparametric sampling distribution based on visual saliency.
   Experiments were performed using different types of signals such as
   fluorescence microscopy images and laser range measurements. Results
   show that the proposed optimized sampling method which is based on
   nonparametric stochastic learning outperforms significantly the
   previously proposed approach. The proposed method is achieves higher
   reconstruction signal to noise ratios at the same compression rates
   across all tested types of signals. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{Dual phase (DP) steels are designed to consist of hard martensite
   dispersed in a relatively soft ferrite matrix, which offers a favorable
   combination of high strength with good deformability. Fiber laser
   welding (FLW) is becoming increasingly important for joining advanced

   the microstructure of a DP steel, DP980, welded by FLW technique was
   carefully analyzed. Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulation coupled with
   analytical transmission electron microscopy revealed that the FLW
   process produced significant microstructural changes in a narrow
   heat-affected zone (HAZ) and fusion zone (FZ), which can result in
   dramatic changes in mechanical properties. This is reflected in the
   micro-hardness profile obtained across the welded material. The salient
   phase transitions induced by the FLW, including the formation of new
   martensite grains in the upper-critical HAZ and FZ, are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{The fault ride-through (FRT) requirement of modern grid codes results in
   interactions between full-scale converter-interfaced renewable energy
   power plants (CIREPPs) and the protection systems of high-voltage
   transmission grids, which normally involve distance elements either as
   the primary or the backup relay. Such interactions are influenced by the
   CIREPPs' exclusive fault behavior, and have been left largely unnoticed
   in relaying literature. Part I of this paper develops a CIREPP model
   suitable for relaying studies, and highlights the CIREPP properties by
   which the protection system is endangered the most. Then, the operating
   scenarios leading to the malfunction of a distance relay that is located
   at a CIREPP substation and protects the adjacent line are unveiled.
   These scenarios include in-zone short circuits missed by the relay and
   incorrect tripping for out-of-zone faults, which would, in turn,
   neutralize FRT schemes implemented inside CIREPPs. The findings of this
   study also hold true for the ac lines emanating from voltage-sourced
   converter-based HVDC connections.}},

Abstract = {{Having unveiled the problems associated with distance protection of
   lines connected to full-scale converter-interfaced renewable energy
   power plants (CIREPPs) due to remote and intermediate infeed in Part I
   of this paper, Part II describes why the countermeasures currently
   deployed by commercial relays to tackle these problems in a conventional
   power system fail in the presence of a CIREPP. Then, a new formula to
   calculate impedance is devised for the phase element of the relay to
   prevent maloperation in the event of line-to-line to ground faults. In
   addition, a communication-assisted method with minimal bandwidth
   requirement is proposed for balanced and line-to-line faults. The issues
   that should be taken into consideration for single-line-to-ground faults
   are also discussed. The solutions presented in this paper are simple and
   independent of the host system grid code, and can be applied to
   industrial memory-polarized distance relays. A comprehensive performance
   evaluation is presented to verify the reliable operation of the proposed
   methods.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the role of spatial and temporal averaging of
   recharge upon the calibration of trichloroethylene (TCE) contaminant
   transport parameters for a transient, three-dimensional, variably
   saturated, physically based, field-scale groundwater flow system in Toms
   River, New Jersey. Coarse vertical discretizations of unsaturated
   groundwater systems are prone to numerical difficulties requiring, in
   some cases, the linearization of the van Genuchten or Brooks Corey
   equations. A flux-based method for calculating relative permeability was
   developed and shown to improve numerical stability. To reduce the
   computational burden of calibration, the simulation time of the
   transport models was reduced by 95\% by decoupling the transport model
   from the flow model. Multi-start PEST was used to calibrate four models
   with recharge specified as: constant, spatially varying, temporally
   varying, and both spatially and temporally varying. For the transient
   flow model with spatially and temporally varying recharge, the estimated
   transverse dispersivity coefficients were estimated to be significantly
   less than those calculated from simulations with spatial and/or temporal
   averaging of recharge. The calibrated TCE retardation value of 1.58 is
   within 5\% of the laboratory determined value of 1.65. Furthermore, the
   calibrated TCE retardation values are not as sensitive to the spatial
   and/or temporal averaging of recharge as compared to transverse
   dispersivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The operation of microgrids in islanded mode brings numerous benefits to
   both customers and utilities. Because of the special characteristics of
   islanded microgrid (IMG) operation, robust control schemes are required
   to provide reliable service and help achieve customer-driven objectives.
   To that end, several previous works emphasized the importance of
   implementing a supervisory microgrid central controller (MGCC), while
   others showed that from the technical perspectives there is no real need
   for the implementation of such costly controllers. Evaluating the
   benefits of implementing a MGCC is thus a key point that microgrid
   designers need to appropriately analyze. To this end, this paper
   proposes a probabilistic analytical approach for evaluating the
   fuel-saving benefit that a supervisory MGCC can bring to the operation
   of IMG systems taking into consideration the intermittent nature of
   renewable energy resources and the loads variability as well as the
   special features and operational philosophy of droop controlled IMG

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns and oil price volatility have created increased
   interest in smart grid green energy technologies such as photovoltaic
   (PV) arrays and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, these
   technologies have been found to have a significant impact on
   distribution networks in terms of secondary distribution transformer
   overloading and increased reverse power flow. Energy storage systems
   (ESSs) are thought to be an effective tool for mitigating these negative
   effects. The primary challenge in implementing ESS technology lies in
   the difficulty of determining the appropriate sizes and operating
   schedules for these units, given the uncertainties inherent in PV array
   production and PHEV demand. This paper presents a probabilistic sizing
   and scheduling methodology for ESSs to facilitate the integration of
   PHEVs and PV arrays in distribution networks, taking into account
   different sources of uncertainty present in the system. The technical
   and economic feasibility of the proposed design methodology has been
   validated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a variety of scenarios.

Abstract = {{The Gaussian K-user interference and M x K X channels are investigated
   with no instantaneous channel state information at transmitters (CSIT).
   First, it is assumed that the CSI is fed back to all nodes after a
   finite delay (delayed CSIT), and furthermore, the transmitters operate
   in full-duplex mode, i.e, they can transmit and receive simultaneously.
   Achievable results on the degrees of freedom (DoFs) of these channels
   under the above assumption are obtained. It is observed that, in
   contrast with no CSIT and full CSIT models, when CSIT is delayed, the
   achievable DoFs for both channels with the full-duplex transmitter
   cooperation are greater than the available achievable results on their
   DoF without transmitter cooperation. Then, K-user interference and K x K
   X channels are considered with output feedback, wherein the channel
   output of each receiver is causally fed back to its corresponding
   transmitter. Our achievable results with output feedback demonstrate
   strict DoF improvements over those with the full-duplex delayed CSIT
   when K > 5 in the K-user interference channel and K > 2 in the K x K X
   channel. Next, the combination of delayed CSIT and output feedback,
   known as Shannon feedback, is studied and strictly higher DoFs compared
   with the output feedback model are achieved in the K-user interference
   channel when K = 5 or K > 6, and in the K x K X channel when K > 2.}},

Abstract = {{In spline toolpath interpolation, a crucial point is solving the mapping
   between the spline parameter (u) and actual arc length (s) accurately,
   so that the toolpath is traveled without undesirable fluctuations or
   discontinuities in the feedrate profile. To achieve this, various
   techniques have been proposed in literature, including Taylor series
   interpolation, iterative numerical methods, and approximating the
   mapping between u and s with a feed correction polynomial. This paper
   presents a new way to parameterize the seventh order feed correction
   polynomial, which was introduced by Erkorkmaz and Altintas (2005,
   ``Quintic Spline Interpolation With Minimal Feed Fluctuation,{''} ASME
   J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 127(2), pp. 339-349). The proposed technique has a
   closed-form solution that can be efficiently implemented in real-time,
   rather than having to construct and solve a linear equation system with
   14 unknowns for each spline segment. In this paper, the new solution is
   derived step by step, and simulation case studies are presented which
   demonstrate that the new method accurately parameterizes the feed
   correction polynomial in approximately 43\% less computational time,
   compared to applying the former solution of Erkorkmaz and Altintas
   (2005, ``Quintic Spline Interpolation With Minimal Feed Fluctuation,{''}
   ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 127(2), pp. 339-349). This is because matrix
   multiplication operations and a dedicated linear equation solver, which
   are cumber-some to implement inside a real-time computer numerical
   controller (CNC), are avoided in the new solution.}},

Abstract = {{To date, most genetic engineering approaches coupling the type II
   Streptococcus pyogenes clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
   repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to lambda Red recombineering have involved
   minor single nucleotide mutations. Here we show that procedures for
   carrying out more complex chromosomal gene replacements in Escherichia
   coli can be substantially enhanced through implementation of CRISPR/Cas9
   genome editing. We developed a three-plasmid approach that allows not
   only highly efficient recombination of short single-stranded
   oligonucleotides but also replacement of multigene chromosomal stretches
   of DNA with large PCR products. By systematically challenging the
   proposed system with respect to the magnitude of chromosomal deletion
   and size of DNA insertion, we demonstrated DNA deletions of up to 19.4
   kb, encompassing 19 nonessential chromosomal genes, and insertion of up
   to 3 kb of heterologous DNA with recombination efficiencies permitting
   mutant detection by colony PCR screening. Since CRISPR/Cas9-coupled

Abstract = {{The Water Footprint (WF) is a popular and useful indicator for
   evaluating regional water use situations. The Structural Decomposition
   Analysis (SDA) method is able to break down the changes in water usage
   according to its determinants. There is a lack of the framework for
   comprehensively understanding a regional water situation for long period
   of time. The challenge lies in the facts of the incomplete WF
   evaluations and the static and non-uniqueness issues of SDA. In this
   paper, a path-based SDA (PB-SDA) model is proposed to address the SDA
   issues, which is further utilized to decompose the changes of the WF in
   Beijing. By employing an input-output-based WF analysis method, the
   sectoral WFs of Beijing are computed using the 1987-2007 data, in which
   the exported Virtual Water (VW) is evaluated in particular. Results show
   that during 1987-1997, Beijing's exported VW decreased significantly due
   to the export restructuring, which helped to reduce local water
   pressure. The internal WF continuously decreased during 1987-2007, and
   the external WF increased during 1997-2007, both of which indicated that
   Beijing had become increasingly dependent on external water. The
   decomposition results indicate that the technological effect is the
   dominant contributor with 48 \% of the total contribution contributing
   to the WF decrease. The structural effect, which is related to the final
   demand restructuring, contributed 6 \% of the contribution to the WF
   decreases during 1997-2007, as well as to the increases of WF during
   1987-1997. The other components that contributed to the WF increases
   were the consumption level (35 \%) and population (10 \%) effects,
   caused by the increasing living standards and an expanding population
   during this period. This work also shows that the PB-SDA model has an
   advanced dynamic property, as well as the uniqueness and rationality of
   decomposition results. The methodology serves as a decision-making
   support, and it is universally adaptable in other regions. The findings
   in our study case are able to provide better understanding about the
   water situation, as well as the references to better manage water
   resources in other regions.}},

Abstract = {{Joining of ZEK100 Mg alloy and Zn coated DP600 steel sheets is studied
   using refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW). The RFSSW process
   involves a tool with independently moving sleeve and pin components,

   Welds could be achieved, which exceeded 4.7 kN shear strength, using the
   following process parameters: 1800 rev min 21 tool speed, 3.0 s welding
   time and 1.5 mm of penetration into the upper ZEK100 sheet.
   Scanningelectron (SEM) andtransmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) are used
   to characterise the Mg/steel interface. It is revealed that a continuous
   layer of FeAl2 particles accommodate bonding of the sheets, which
   appears to have originated from the galvanised coating on the DP600.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{71-80}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Addressing deficiencies and defects that occur during construction
   projects, particularly in piping fabrication, is costly and time
   consuming. The current quality management process associated with piping
   fabrication has a number of limitations, resulting primarily from human
   error and lack of consistency. This research therefore introduces an
   automated process for construction quality management that employs
   automated technologies for detecting defects, to contribute to the
   existing body of knowledge. The system relies on piping construction
   data collected with the use of photogrammetry and laser scanning, which
   are then used as a means of comparing the work actually performed to
   that designed. The developed three-station quality management model has
   the potential to decrease the overall cost of a project by reducing the
   fabrication rework required as well as by avoiding costly and
   time-consuming site assembly realignments, which are often caused by
   defects in the fabrication and delivery processes. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{A model based on the works of Buongiorno, which includes the effects of
   Brownian motion and thermophoresis, is used to develop the governing
   equations for convection in nanofluids. The analysis includes examples
   with water and ethylene glycol as the base fluids and nanoparticles of
   Cu and Al2O3. An assumption of zero nanoparticle flux is used at the
   surface of the plate to make the model more physically realistic. The
   model accounts for the effects of both Brownian motion and
   thermophoresis in the mass boundary condition. Using suitable
   transformations, the governing partial differential equations are
   converted into ordinary differential equations which are solved
   numerically. The dimensionless velocity, temperature, and concentration
   gradients are used in the second law analysis to determine heat and mass
   transfer rates. It is shown that the dimensionless entropy generation

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural evolution during non-isothermal annealing of a
   precipitation hardenable Al alloy is investigated experimentally, and
   simulated by developing a new Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique. An
   annealing process that spans over a temperature range to promote the
   formation of a fine distribution of precipitates, is applied to a
   solution-treated Al-Mg-Si alloy. Experimental analysis of the deformed
   sample and samples non-isothermally annealed to intermediate
   temperatures reveals that early-stage precipitates inhibit dynamic
   recovery during deformation, as well as static recovery during the
   initial stages of annealing. Inhibition of recovery prior to the
   initiation of recrystallization leads to a high driving force for
   recrystallization and formation of randomly distributed recrystallized
   nuclei. Interactions of recovery, recrystallization and precipitations
   are integrated in the Monte Carlo algorithm and microstructural states
   during non-isothermal annealing are simulated. The MC technique is
   specifically designed for the systems in which precipitates inhibit
   dynamic recovery during the pre-annealing deformation stage. The good
   agreement achieved through comparison of MC simulation and experimental
   results supports the validity of the modeling technique developed. (C)

Abstract = {{Polybutadiene (PB)-SiO2 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via
   differential microemulsion polymerization. The core-shell structured
   PB-SiO2 nanoparticles were designed to achieve a monodispersion with
   reduced nanosilica aggregation. A high monomer conversion (81.5\%),
   grafting efficiency (78.5\%) and small particle size (27 nm) with narrow
   size distribution was obtained under optimum reaction conditions when
   using an extremely low surfactant concentration, 5 wt\% based on
   monomer. The PB-SiO2 latex could be hydrogenated by diimide reduction in
   the presence of hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide to provide hydrogenated
   polybutadiene (HPB)-SiO2. A high hydrogenation degree of 98.6\% was
   achieved at a ratio of hydrazine to hydrogen peroxide of 0.75:1, and
   showed a maximum degradation temperature of 469.6 degrees C resulting in
   excellent thermal stability. A new nanocomposite of PB-SiO2 and HPB-SiO2
   could be used as a novel nanofiller in natural rubber. Especially,
   NR/HPB-SiO2 composites had improved mechanical and thermal properties,
   and exhibited good resistance toward ozone exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Automated assembly discrepancy feedback using 3D imaging and forward
   kinematics}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{36-46}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Assembly of steel structures, modules, and pipe spools requires cycles
   of fitting and alignment in fabrication facilities and on construction
   sites. To minimize this work, good discrepancy feedback for automated
   refitting and realignment is required. A framework for such feedback is
   presented here that overcomes current limitations. It commences with a
   constrained registration step to overcome the incapabilities of the
   current discrepancy analysis approaches. By borrowing concepts from
   robotic kinematics and 3D image alignment theories, forward kinematics
   models are generated link by link, and thus provide the means for a
   local discrepancy analysis for quantifying the deviations autonomously.
   Experiments show that the proposed approach is suitably accurate and
   sufficiently fast to be employed for real-time feedback in order to
   systematically and automatically develop the realignment plans required
   for refitting and realigning assemblies, which is the key contribution
   of the work presented in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{202-214}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The optimal path planning problem is considered for rovers. Tip-over
   risk is accurately modelled using direction dependence. In the previous
   direction-independent model, the value function was approximated using
   the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The risk was not accurately modelled.
   Solar energy is considered here for the first time. Minimizing path
   length, obstacle avoidance and soil risk are also considered. For a
   direction-dependent model, the value function in the optimal path
   planning problem can be approximated accurately using the Ordered Upwind
   Method (OUM)-but not FMK The value function is used to synthesize the
   optimal control, which is shown to have no local minima. A novel
   algorithmic improvement, OUM-BD over the OUM to include a bi-directional
   search is presented. The OUM-BD is slightly slower than the FMM, but can
   accurately solve a larger class of problems. The OUM-BD is faster than
   the existing OUM, an optimal hi-directional RRT path planner
   (Bi-RRT{*}), and a genetic algorithm (GA) path planner in terms of time,
   and outperforms both the GA and Bi-RRT{*} planner in cost in tested
   examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The effect of two different anode-embedding orientations, lengthwise-and
   widthwise-embedded anodes was explored, on the performance of sediment
   microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) using a chessboard anode. The maximum
   current densities and power densities in SMFCs having
   lengthwise-embedded anodes (S-LA1-S-LA10) varied from 38.2 mA/m(2) to
   121 mA/m(2) and from 5.5 mW/m(2) to 20 mW/m(2). In comparison, the
   maximum current densities and maximum power densities in SMFCs having
   anodes widthwise-embedded between 0 cm to 8 cm (S-WA2-S-WA5) increased
   from 82 mA/m(2) to 140 mA/m(2) and from 14.7 mW/m(2) to 31.1 mW/m(2) as
   the anode depth became deeper. Although there was a difference in the
   performance among S-WA5-S-WA10, it was considered negligible. Hence, it
   is concluded that it is important to embed anodes widthwise at the
   specific anode depths, in order to improve of SMFC performance.
   Chessboard anode used in this work could be a good option for the
   determination of optimal anode depths. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   square tubes}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{64-87}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Axial crushing of square tubes is widely studied for their energy
   absorption characteristics that are similar to automotive structural
   components. In this paper, the effects of the elastic-plastic behaviour
   of lightweight alloys on the steady state crush force, peak crush force,
   energy absorption and crush efficiency response of the axial crushing of
   square tubes are studied. Axial crush simulations are performed on
   square crush tubes where the yield stress and strain, ultimate tensile
   strength, hardening rate, and failure strain of the material are varied.
   New definitions and analytical equations for crush efficiency and energy
   absorption are developed and calibrated with the axial crush simulations
   to develop a framework for optimal material selection for axial crush.
   This work shows that the yield stress increases the energy absorption,
   peak crush force and steady state crush force, while tending to decrease
   the crush efficiency. After sufficient increase in the hardening
   capabilities, positive gains are obtained in the crush efficiency when
   increasing the yield stress. The ultimate tensile strength, hardening
   rate and the yield stress of the material have a strong effect on
   improved energy absorption. Lightweight alloys with a low yield stress
   that have significant work hardening capabilities outperform materials
   with a high yield stress and very little work hardening in terms of
   energy absorption when a constraint is imposed on the peak crushing
   force. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Composite polyamide nanofiltration membranes comprising of an inner
   sublayer of polyethylenimine (PEI)/trimesoyl chloride (TMC) crosslinks
   and an outer sublayer of piperazine (PIP)/TMC crosslinks were fabricated
   via layer-by-layer sequential interfacial polymerization, and the
   chlorine resistance of the membranes was shown to be improved by the
   outer sublayer. The effects of chlorine exposure on the nanofiltration
   performance of the positively charged polyamide membrane were
   investigated at different chlorination conditions (pH, chlorine
   concentration, exposure duration). In general, membrane chlorination
   resulted in an increase in membrane permeability, whereas the solute
   rejection could increase or decrease, depending on the charge properties
   of the solutes. Controlled chlorine exposure at low concentrations could
   enhance the wafer flux of the membrane without significant reductions in
   solute rejections for MgCl2 and MgSO4 (and, to a lesser extent, NaCI);
   the membrane retention of Na2SO4 was actually enhanced by the chlorine
   treatment. At a given chlorine concentration, the effect of membrane
   chlorination was intensified at both alkaline or acidic pHs as compared
   to membrane chlorination at pH 7. It was also shown that the customarily
   used chlorination intensify (ppm h), which is a composite parameter
   based on the product of chlorine concentration and chlorination time,
   was not adequate for use as a standalone parameter to characterize the
   chlorination conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent carbon nanomaterials, especially zero-dimensional (oD)
   carbon nanodots (CDs), are widely used in broad biological and
   optoelectronic applications. CDs have unique characteristics such as
   strong fluorescence, biocompatibility, sun-light response, and
   capability of mass-production. Beyond the previous green CD obtained
   from harmful natural substances, we report a new type of fluid-based
   fluorescent CD paints (C-paints) derived from polyethylene glycol (PEG;
   via simple ultrasound irradiation at room temperatures) and produced in
   quantum yields of up to similar to 14\%. Additionally, C-paints possess
   a strong, UV- and visible-light-responsive photoluminescent (PL)
   property. Most especially, C-paints, by incorporation into a
   photocatalytic system, show additional roles in the emission of
   fluorescent light for activation of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and the
   resultant detoxification of most organic dyes, thus further enabling
   embarkation in advanced water purification.}},

   periodicity of the array. A comparative study of power harvesting
   efficiency through numerical analysis and laboratory measurement was
   presented where an array of G-CSRRs is compared to an array of

   power conversion efficiency of 92\%, which represents a significant

Abstract = {{Poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers have found promising applications

   PAMAM dendrimer-grafted cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-PAMAM) were prepared
   via a simple carbodiimide-mediated amidation process and they displayed
   pH-responsive and fluorescent characteristics as confirmed by zeta
   potential, transmittance, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and
   fluorescence spectroscopy. Stable aqueous dispersions of CNC-PAMAM were
   obtained at pH <= 4 and pH >= 10, driven by electrostatic repulsion from
   positive charge and negative charge respectively. However, large
   aggregates were formed at pH values from 5 to 9 due to electrostatic
   attraction. In addition, strong blue fluorescent emission was observed,
   and the fluorescent behaviour of CNC-PAMAM was influenced by the
   formation of aggregates. The pH-responsive and fluorescent properties of
   CNC-PAMAM may be suitable for their applications in pH-responsive
   nanodevices, fluorescent-based pH sensors, optical markers, and
   nanoreactors for the encapsulation of inorganic nanoparticles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Small interfering RNA (siRNA) shows great therapeutic potential due to
   its ability to regulate gene expression in a highly selective manner.
   However, its application has been limited by ineffective cellular uptake
   of siRNAs. To achieve successful gene-silencing efficiency, a safe and
   effective delivery vector is generally required. In this study, we
   designed a series of amphipathic peptides that comprised a variant of a
   nuclear localization sequence, 0-6 histidine residues and an optional
   stearic acid group. Among these candidates, STR-HK exhibited good
   characteristics as a safe and efficient siRNA delivery vector,
   facilitating efficient siRNA delivery to mammalian cells without causing
   cytotoxicity. Moreover, the intratumoral injection of STR-HK/siRNA
   complexes achieved high anti-tumor activity through the downregulation
   of the Bcl-2 protein in mice, with an inhibition rate of 62.8\%. Our
   data demonstrate that STR-HK is a highly promising siRNA delivery vector
   for therapeutic applications. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Catalyst supports are known to play important role in governing overall
   catalyst activity and durability. Here, a new type of SnO2-TiO2 solid
   solution (TixSn1-xO2) support was prepared via a solvothermal method
   with substitution of Ti4+ by Sn4+ in the TiO2 lattice. Furthermore, the
   TixSn1-xO2 was combined with conventional carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) to
   prepare a hybrid support (TixSn1-xO2-C) for depositing Pt nanoparticles.
   The ratios of Sn vs. Ti in the solid-solution and TixSn1-xO2 vs. XC-72
   were systematically optimized in terms of their performance as supports
   for methanol oxidation. Compared to Pt/TiO2-C and commercial Pt/C
   catalysts, the best performing Pt/Ti0.9Sn0.1O2-C catalyst exhibited the
   highest activity, evidenced by methanol oxidation and CO stripping
   experiments. The well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles (2 -3 nm) are mostly
   deposited on the boundaries of Ti0.9Sn0.1O2 and carbon blacks. Formation
   of the special triple junction structure can play an important role in
   improving Pt utilization with increased electrochemical active surface
   areas (ESA) of Pt. In addition, the enhanced activity for Pt supported
   on Ti0.9Sn0.1O2-C is due to high content of OH group on Ti0.9Sn0.1O2
   along with the strengthened metal-supports interactions. Both promote
   the oxidation of poisoning CO absorbed on Pt active sites. (C) 2015

Title = {{Genome Regions Associated with Functional Performance of Soybean Stem
   Fibers in Polypropylene Thermoplastic Composites}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Plant fibers can be used to produce composite materials for automobile
   parts, thus reducing plastic used in their manufacture, overall vehicle
   weight and fuel consumption when they replace mineral fillers and glass
   fibers. Soybean stem residues are, potentially, significant sources of
   inexpensive, renewable and biodegradable natural fibers, but are not
   curretly used for biocomposite production due to the functional
   properties of their fibers in composites being unknown. The current
   study was initiated to investigate the effects of plant genotype on the
   performance characteristics of soybean stem fibers when incorporated
   into a polypropylene (PP) matrix using a selective phenotyping approach.
   Fibers from 50 lines of a recombinant inbred line population (169 RILs)
   grown in different environments were incorporated into PP at 20\%
   (wt/wt) by extrusion. Test samples were injection molded and
   characterized for their mechanical properties. The performance of stem
   fibers in the composites was significantly affected by genotype and
   environment. Fibers from different genotypes had significantly different
   chemical compositions, thus composites prepared with these fibers
   displayed different physical properties. This study demonstrates that
   thermoplastic composites with soybean stem-derived fibers have
   mechanical properties that are equivalent or better than wheat straw
   fiber composites currently being used for manufacturing interior
   automotive parts. The addition of soybean stem residues improved
   flexural, tensile and impact properties of the composites. Furthermore,
   by linkage and in silico mapping we identified genomic regions to which
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) for compositional and functional
   properties of soybean stem fibers in thermoplastic composites, as well
   as genes for cell wall synthesis, were co-localized. These results may
   lead to the development of high value uses for soybean stem residue.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we develop an enzyme-free electrochemical sensor for hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) and hydrazine (N2H4) by preparing three-dimensional
   nanoporous gold (NPG) supported on three dimensional Ni foam. The NPG@Ni
   foam hybrid electrode was prepared via electrodeposition of an AuSn
   alloy film on a Ni foam substrate, followed by a chemical dealloying
   process to leach the Sn component. The morphology and structure of the
   as-prepared NPG@Ni foam hybrid were characterized using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive
   X-ray spectrum (EDS). The as-prepared hybrid electrodes showed high
   sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of both H2O2 and N2H4. The
   non-enzymatic sensor exhibits a linear response for H2O2 and N2H4 in the
   range of 20-9740 and 0.2-110.1 mu M, with a sensitivity of 2.88 and
   10.687 mA mM(-1)cm(-2), and a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 10 mM and 33
   nM, respectively. The excellent sensitivity and selectivity make the
   NPG@Ni foam electrodes very attractive for electrochemical sensing
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Column tests were conducted to investigate media roughness impacts on
   particle deposition in absence of an energy barrier (i.e., high ionic
   strength). Media/collector surface roughness consistently influenced
   colloid deposition in a nonlinear, nonmonotonic manner such that a
   critical roughness size associated with minimum particle deposition
   could be identified; this was confirmed using a convection-diffusion
   model. The results demonstrate that media surface roughness size alone
   is inadequate for predicting media roughness impacts on particle
   deposition; rather, the relative size relationship between the particles
   and media/collectors must also be considered. A model that
   quantitatively considers media surface roughness was developed that
   described experimental outcomes well and consistently with classic
   colloid filtration theory (CET) for smooth surfaces.
   Dimensionless-scaling factors f(roughness) and f(PCIF) were introduced
   and used to develop a model describing particle deposition, rate (k(d))
   and colloid attachment efficiency (alpha). The model includes fitting
   parameters that reflect the impact of critical system characteristics
   such as ionic strength, loading rate, hydrophobicity. Excellent
   agreement was found not only between the modeled outcomes for colloid
   attachment efficiency (alpha) and experimental results from the column
   tests, but also with experimental outcomes reported elsewhere. The model
   developed herein provides a framework for describing media surface
   roughness impacts on colloid deposition.}},

Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique called nested m-trail method in
   all-optical mesh networks for failure localization of any shared risk
   link group (SRLG) with up to d undirected links. The proposed method
   decomposes the network topology into virtual cycles and trails, in which
   sets of m-trails that traverse through a common monitoring node (MN) can
   be obtained. The nested m-trails are used in the monitoring burst
   (m-burst) framework, in which the MN can localize any SRLG failure by
   inspecting the optical bursts traversing through it. An integer linear
   program (ILP) and a heuristic are proposed for the network
   decomposition, which are further verified by numerical experiments. We
   show that the proposed method significantly reduces the required fault
   localization latency compared to the existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this investigation, the authors intend to find out whether
   chaos-embedded heuristic walks with nature-based controllers are capable
   of increasing the performance of the standard random walks of
   evolutionary algorithms. Indeed, the research motivation emanates in the
   pursuit of addressing an increasing interest in using chaos sequences
   for modifying the exploitation capability of evolutionary optimisers.
   Here, the authors propose a nature-based controller to dynamically
   balance the exploration/exploitation capability of the evolutionary
   optimiser. To test the validity of the proposed method, a number of
   well-known Gaussian distribution-based evolutionary operators are
   considered, and their random parameters are changed with discrete-time
   chaotic sequences. Besides, to obtain authentic and reliable results
   regarding the accuracy and robustness of the rival techniques, the
   authors went through the existing literature and extracted 23 scalable,
   multimodal, constraint and unconstraint numerical benchmark problems and
   one engineering problem, i.e. optimal control of shape memory alloy
   actuators. The convergence rate and computational time of the resulting
   self-controlled chaos-based evolutionary approaches are analysed to find
   out whether they are capable of stabilising the chromosomes within a
   logical time. The results of the numerical experiments indicate that the
   self-controlled chaos-enhanced heuristic walks significantly increase
   the global searching capability of the evolutionary optimisers and have
   an aptitude to show a robust performance.}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a cost benefit analysis of residential building regulations
   on reducing the exposure to outdoor PM2.5 in Toronto. By combining a
   combined mass balanced model, a time-weighted activity exposure model,
   epidemiological based concentration-response, and monetary valuation
   method, various morbidity and mortality outcomes were estimated for
   different residential building scenarios. It was found that retrofitting
   residential buildings to comply with minimum building code regulations
   can save US\$2.3 billion/year in health care. Citywide adoption of R2000
   standard from current housing corresponds to US\$3.8 billion/year. Use
   of mechanical HVAC systems, improved filtration (with recirculation) and
   tighter building envelope (lower infiltration rate) were noted as the
   key factors that influence PM2.5 exposure reductions and health impacts.
   Estimated costs of retrofitting existing homes to adopt these
   regulations were about 2.3-2.9 times of the health savings. Citywide use
   of filters with better efficiency is anticipated to lead to annual
   health savings significantly exceeding the capital and running costs.

Abstract = {{Toward a carbon neutral renewable energy conversion and storage device,
   we present a novel bio-inspired microbial supercapacitor, utilizing
   unique pseudocapacitance formed by exoelectrogen, a specific species of
   bacteria named Geobacter spp. grown on single-layer graphene film and 3D
   graphene-scaffold electrodes. Charging and discharging the microbial
   supercapacitor were performed by regulating the respiration of the
   exoelectrogen. Substantially high maximum current and power densities,
   531.2 A/m(2) (1,060,000 A/m(3)) and 197.5 W/m2 (395,000 W/m(3)),
   respectively, are marked. The microbial supercapacitor demonstrates high
   cycle stability of over 1 million. A specific capacitance of 17.85 +/-
   0.91 mF/cm(2) is demonstrated, which is 4.4 fold to 2 orders of
   magnitude higher than previously reported supercapacitors having
   graphene-based electrodes, suggesting a promising alternative energy
   storage device. Furthermore, the microbial supercapacitor was used to
   deduce quantitative kinetic parameters of extracellular electron
   transfer (EET) by fitting discharging curves of the supercapacitor,
   which is critical to fully understand the EET of Geobacter spp. and
   determining the rate-limiting mechanism. At the initial-stage biofilm,
   the acetate turnover is the slowest among individual EET steps, whereas
   for fully-grown stage biofilm, kinetics of both acetate turnover and
   electron transfer from inside exoelectrogen to extracellular redox
   cofactors are rate-limiting. Our results also suggest cytochrome c may
   not be the main electron storage units of a microbial supercapacitor,
   regardless of initial- or fully-grown stage biofilms. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   3.8 and 1 min, respectively), and a long cycling stability as well. Both
   experiment and density functional theory calculation proves that the
   superior performance is mainly attributed to the unique nanoporous

Title = {{The Noninflammatory Phenotype of Neutrophils From the Closed-Eye

Volume = {{56}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE. In the closed-eye environment (during sleep), there is an
   influx of neutrophils into the tear film, and the phenotype of these
   cells has yet to be characterized. This study was conducted to
   investigate the response of tear-film neutrophils to inflammatory
   stimuli.
   METHODS. Immediately upon awakening, cells from healthy participants (n
   = 12) were collected using a gentle eye-wash with PBS. Tear-film
   neutrophils were counted and cell viability was determined. Neutrophils
   were also isolated from blood by density-gradient centrifugation.
   Tear-film and blood-isolated neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol
   myristate acetate (PMA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or
   N-Formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP). Changes in the
   expression of macrophage-1 antigen, intercellular adhesion molecule-1
   (ICAM-1), CD66b (a degranulation membrane marker), C3aR (complement C3a
   receptor), CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) as well as reactive oxygen
   species (using dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate) were characterized
   by flow cytometry.
   RESULTS. Hundreds of thousands of leukocytes were collected upon
   awakening. Tear-film neutrophils were alive as shown by trypan blue and
   propidium iodide (PI) exclusion. While tear-film neutrophils were able
   to mount an oxidative response, stimulation with LPS, PMA, or fMLP did
   not induce receptor upregulation. This lack of response to stimulus with
   tear-film neutrophils was significantly different from that of
   blood-isolated neutrophils. Incubation in the presence of tear film
   proteins did not affect the tear-film neutrophil response to stimuli.
   CONCLUSIONS. Our results indicate that while tear-film neutrophils are
   alive, they do not respond to inflammatory stimuli in the same manner as
   blood-isolated neutrophils. This refractory phenotype may be due to
   exposure to anti-inflammatory factors present in the tear film.}},

   microflows via a single permanent magnet}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Trapping and preconcentrating particles and cells for enhanced detection
   and analysis are often essential in many chemical and biological
   applications. Existing methods for diamagnetic particle trapping require
   the placement of one or multiple pairs of magnets nearby the particle
   flowing channel. The strong attractive or repulsive force between the
   magnets makes it difficult to align and place them close enough to the
   channel, which not only complicates the device fabrication but also
   restricts the particle trapping performance. This work demonstrates for
   the first time the use of a single permanent magnet to simultaneously
   trap diamagnetic and magnetic particles in ferrofluid flows through a
   T-shaped microchannel. The two types of particles are preconcentrated to
   distinct locations of the T-junction due to the induced negative and
   positive magnetophoretic motions, respectively. Moreover, they can be
   sequentially released from their respective trapping spots by simply
   increasing the ferrofluid flow rate. In addition, a three-dimensional
   numerical model is developed, which predicts with a reasonable agreement
   the trajectories of diamagnetic and magnetic particles as well as the
   buildup of ferrofluid nanoparticles. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The electroluminescence (EL) degradation mechanisms of organic
   light-emitting devices (OLEDs) are studied utilizing phosphorescent and
   fluorescent materials as emitter guests. The results show that these
   emitter guests, despite being used in low concentrations in OLEDs,
   aggregate as a result of electrical stress, giving rise to the emergence
   of new longer-wavelength bands in their EL spectra after prolonged
   device operation. Such electrical-driving-induced aggregation occurs
   more significantly in guest materials with wider bandgap (E-g) and
   flatter molecular structures. Further investigations reveal that the
   aggregation process is mainly induced by interactions between excitons
   and positive polarons that reside on the guests. The findings uncover a
   previously unknown degradation mechanism that appears to be responsible
   for the generally much lower EL stability of blue devices relative to
   their green and red counterparts, especially in case of phosphorescent
   emitters.}},

   cognitive model using Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) was
   built to model the learning process of lateral control skills. The
   modeling results were compared with the human results. The drivers with
   more experience had better lateral control performance. The model
   produced similar results as the human results and modeled the progress
   of learning. The model provided a computational explanation for the
   mechanisms of lateral control skill learning. Implication and future

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate the macroscopic thermal
   behaviour of 2 m diameter Jet A fires in crosswinds of 3-10 m/s. This
   scenario simulated an outdoor transportation accident with the fire
   representing a burning pool of aviation fuel. To date, the limited
   number of experiments that have been conducted to examine wind effects
   on fire behaviour have generally been performed at small scale, which
   does not fully simulate the physics of large fires, or in outdoor
   facilities, with poorly controlled wind conditions. This paper presents
   the first systematic characterization of the thermal environment in a
   large, turbulent, pool fire under controlled wind conditions. Three
   parameters describing flame geometry - flame tilt, flame length and
   flame drag - were measured using temperature contour plots and video
   images. The temperature-based method of estimating flame geometry
   provided considerable improvement over visually based methods,
   particularly when significant smoke blockage of the luminous flame
   envelope occurred. At low wind speeds, significant plume curvature was
   observed, hindering description of flame tilt by a single angle. As the
   wind speed increased up to 10 m/s, extremely high levels of flame tilt,
   flame drag and flame length occurred. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has incorporated
   femtocell (FC) technology in the Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A)
   standard to enhance the quality of service of indoor mobile users and
   extend the coverage area of existing macrocells (MCs). In such two-tier
   LTE-A MC/FC systems, cotier and cross-tier interference exists in
   cochannel deployment, exerting adverse effects on system performance. In
   this paper, we study the single-carrier frequency-division
   multiple-access (SC-FDMA)-based LTE-A FC uplink. We propose the use of
   transport-layer data admission control (AC) in femto user equipment
   (FUE) and interference-aware resource allocation (RA) in each base
   station (BS) to manage the intercell interference (ICI). We first
   formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP)
   that aims at maximizing the time-average throughput of the entire FC
   tier subject to the queue stability constraint for each FUE. Then, we
   propose a joint AC and RA (JACRA) algorithm to obtain the optimal AC and
   RA policies. In light of the NP-hardness of the RA subproblem, we
   further propose an iterative heuristic with polynomial time complexity.
   Simulation studies show that the proposed JACRA algorithm is throughput
   optimal, outperforming alternative proportional fair (PF) and round
   robin (RR) scheduling schemes. Moreover, the proposed heuristic achieves
   near-optimal throughput with substantial improvement in computational
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{During the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made to
   explore new generations of interconnecting materials and printed lines
   to replace the traditionally used toxic lead-based solders in electronic
   packaging industries. Accordingly, development of electrically
   conductive adhesives (ECAs) with high electrical conductivity has become
   an interesting and urgent research venue in this field. Recently, the
   incorporation of nanosized conductive fillers inside the conventional
   formulation of ECAs has drawn considerable attention as an attempt to
   increase their electrical conductivity. In this article, we review
   different types of nanofillers that have been utilized inside the
   conventional ECAs to improve the electrical conductivity of ECAs. We
   focus on the synergetic effects of silver flakes and the nanofillers on
   electron transportation through the electrical network; the mechanisms
   of electrical conductivity enhancement are discussed. Special attention
   is given to the surface properties of the nanofillers and their
   corresponding influences on the filler-filler interaction, which has
   direct effect on the final electrical performance of the hybrid ECAs.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite oxides (ABO(3)) have recently attracted attention since
   tailoring their chemical compositions has resulted in remarkable
   activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which governs
   rechargeability of recently spotlighted metal-air batteries and
   regenerative fuel cells. For further development of highly OER active
   perovskite oxides, however, the exact mechanism the OER must be well
   understood. Herein, we introduce investigation of the OER mechanism of
   perovskite oxides by ab initio analysis based on well-defined model
   systems of LaMnO3 (LMO), LaCoO3 (LCO), and La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO). In
   addition, we have systematically conducted electrochemical experiments
   from which we have observed an increasing trend in the OER activity in
   the order of LSCO > LCO > LMO based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV)
   results obtained in the alkaline medium. To validate the experimental
   results, free-energy diagrams have been constructed for oxygen
   intermediates on the surface of the defined models to find the limiting
   step by changing the B site atom (e.g., Mn and Co) and the partial
   displacement of Sr atoms in La site. The oxygen adsorption energy of
   perovskite oxides is found to increase with decreasing number of outer
   electrons as well as upshifting of the position of the d(z)(2) orbital
   toward the Fermi level of B site element. This work demonstrates that
   highly active OER perovskite oxides can be obtained by modifying the
   chemical composition to finely tune the oxygen adsorption energy on the
   catalysts surface, confirmed by synergetic approaches of using both
   experimental and ab initio computational studies.}},

   characteristics in service restoration plans for distribution systems}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{192-200}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Due to the serious consequences of system outages on customers and
   utilities, restoration of the power supply to the healthy out-of-service
   loads is of profound importance. After faults have been located and
   isolated, restoration plans are applied in order to maximize the
   re-energized loads with minimum number of switching operations. The
   consequences of service interruption depend on the number of affected
   customers, customer load type and size, time of occurrence, frequency of
   outages, and the outage duration period. In this work, all these factors
   have been considered in the restoration process. The constraints
   involved include voltage limits, line current limits, and radial
   topology. In addition, an improved encoding which codes the control
   variables depending on different restoration circumstances is presented.
   It greatly reduces the number of control variables, filters out a large
   number of infeasible solutions and improves the algorithm efficiency.

Abstract = {{Silver nanocubes enriched with \{100\} facets have been extensively used
   for surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Herein, we report a new
   water-phase synthesis method for well-defined Ag nanocubes with tunable
   sizes via a two-step procedure at room temperature. First, irregularly
   shaped Ag nanoparticles (INPs) were prepared by reducing silver ammonia
   solution using ethylal. Second, the agglomerated INPs were selectively
   etched with HNO3 and Cl- to yield \{100\} facet-rich mesoporous Ag
   nanocubes. The mechanism of Ag-nanocube formation and growth was
   investigated in detail by elucidating the involved chemical reactions
   and physical changes at each step during the synthesis. The addition of
   Cl- anions was responsible for facilitating Ag nanoparticle growth by
   removing surface-adsorbed Ag+ species, thereby eliminating
   inter-particle repulsive forces. This agglomeration was found crucial
   for the subsequent selective oxidation of Ag nanoparticles because the
   protective agent used, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), was the most
   effective one for adsorption on the surfaces of Ag nanoparticles of size
   greater than approximately 50 nm. Importantly, mesopores were found
   inside the Ag nanocubes; this can be attributed to the unavoidable
   imperfect packing during the agglomeration of INPs. The newly prepared
   Ag nanocubes were further used to enhance the Raman signal of rhodamine
   6G, which is capable of reducing the detection limitation to 10(-16)
   mol.L-1.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an extensive field study on the

   conducted in a real-world environment, covering four alternative

   compared to regular rock salt in terms of snow melting
   performance-bare-pavement regain time. The study confirmed the relative
   advantage of these alternatives over the regular salt, but also showed
   that their performance varied largely depending on some external
   conditions. Performance models were calibrated and then used for
   developing application rate adjustment factors that can be applied by
   maintenance operations for determining the optimal application rates for
   specific weather events and pavement conditions. The applicability of
   the results is limited to parking lots and sidewalks without the traffic
   effects, and as such cannot be easily applied to winter roadways

   dislocations, parallel to {[}1210] with a Burgers vector of a/3{[}(2)
   over bar 110] and gliding in the basal plane in the {[}10 (1) over bar0]
   direction are investigated. The reaction of the mixed dislocation and
   vacancy loops in prism planes ((1) over bar 100) or (1010) and with
   Burgers vector a/3{[}(1) over bar2 (1) over bar0] leads to the creation
   of two jogs in the vacancy loop. These loops present a significant
   barrier to the motion of the mixed dislocation gliding in the basal
   plane. The reaction of the mixed dislocation and a vacancy loop in the
   (10 (1) over bar0) prism plane with Burgers vector a/3{[}(2) over bar
   110] leads to the cleaving of the vacancy loop and the absorption of
   part of the vacancy loop into the gliding dislocation. This loop
   presents a relatively weaker barrier to the motion of the mixed
   dislocation gliding in the basal plane. Strain rate is observed to have
   a large impact on the shear stress-displacement behavior of the
   reactions, but not on the reaction mechanisms. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Title = {{SACRM: Social Aware Crowdsourcing with Reputation Management in mobile

Abstract = {{Mobile sensing has become a promising paradigm for mobile users to
   obtain information by task crowdsourcing. However, due to the social
   preferences of mobile users, the quality of sensing reports may be
   impacted by the underlying social attributes and selfishness of
   individuals. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the social impacts and
   trustworthiness of mobile users when selecting task participants in
   mobile sensing. In this paper, we propose a Social Aware Crowdsourcing
   with Reputation Management (SACRM) scheme to select the well-suited
   participants and allocate the task rewards in mobile sensing.
   Specifically, we consider the social attributes, task delay and
   reputation in crowdsourcing and propose a participant selection scheme
   to choose the well-suited participants for the sensing task under a
   fixed task budget. A report assessment and rewarding scheme is also
   introduced to measure the quality of the sensing reports and allocate
   the task rewards based the assessed report quality. In addition, we
   develop a reputation management scheme to evaluate the trustworthiness
   and cost performance ratio of mobile users for participant selection.
   Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that SACRM
   can efficiently improve the crowdsourcing utility and effectively
   stimulate the participants to improve the quality of their sensing
   reports. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The need for precise temperature control at small scales has provided a
   formidable challenge to the lab-on-chip community. It requires, at once,
   good thermal conductivity for high speed operation, good thermal
   isolation for low power consumption and the ability to have small
   (mm-scale) thermally independent regions on the same substrate. Most
   importantly, and, in addition to these conflicting requirements, there
   is a need to accurately measure the temperature of the active region
   without the need for device-to-device calibrations. We have developed
   and tested a design that enables thermal control of lab-on-chip devices
   atop silicon substrates in a way that could be integrated with the
   standard methods of mass-manufacture used in the electronics industry
   (i.e. CMOS). This is a significant step towards a single-chip
   lab-on-chip solution, one in which the microfluidics, high voltage
   electronics, optoelectronics, instrumentation electronics, and the
   world-chip interface are all integrated on a single substrate with
   multiple, independent, thermally-controlled regions based on active
   heating and passive cooling.}},

Title = {{A new adaptive hybrid electromagnetic damper: modelling, optimization,
   and experiment}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a new electromagnetic hybrid
   damper which provides regenerative adaptive damping force for various
   applications. Recently, the introduction of electromagnetic technologies
   to the damping systems has provided researchers with new opportunities
   for the realization of adaptive semi-active damping systems with the
   added benefit of energy recovery. In this research, a hybrid
   electromagnetic damper is proposed. The hybrid damper is configured to
   operate with viscous and electromagnetic subsystems. The viscous medium
   provides a bias and fail-safe damping force while the electromagnetic
   component adds adaptability and the capacity for regeneration to the
   hybrid design. The electromagnetic component is modeled and analyzed
   using analytical (lumped equivalent magnetic circuit) and
   electromagnetic finite element method (FEM) (COMSOL (R) software
   package) approaches. By implementing both modeling approaches, an
   optimization for the geometric aspects of the electromagnetic subsystem
   is obtained. Based on the proposed electromagnetic hybrid damping
   concept and the preliminary optimization solution, a prototype is
   designed and fabricated. A good agreement is observed between the
   experimental and FEM results for the magnetic field distribution and
   electromagnetic damping forces. These results validate the accuracy of
   the modeling approach and the preliminary optimization solution. An
   analytical model is also presented for viscous damping force, and is
   compared with experimental results The results show that the damper is
   able to produce damping coefficients of 1300 and 0-238 N s m(-1) through
   the viscous and electromagnetic components, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel framework for planning and investment
   studies pertaining to the implementation of system-wide conservation
   voltage reduction (CVR). In the CVR paradigm, optimal voltage profiles

   at such voltages is known to be capital intensive, which is not
   desirable by investors. Hence, the proposed model determines the system
   savings and the appropriate price incentives to offer industries such
   that a minimum acceptable rate of return is accrued. In this model, the
   industrial facilities are represented by a combination of constant
   impedance, constant current, and constant power loads. A detailed case
   study for Ontario, Canada, is carried out considering that industrial
   loads are investing in voltage optimization to reduce their energy
   costs. The optimal incentives that need to be offered by the system
   planner, over a long-term horizon, and across various zones of Ontario,

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen increased interest in green technologies such as
   photovoltaic (PV) electricity and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles

   system becomes a bilayer system composed of the traditional ac layer
   that serves existing system loads, plus an embedded dc layer that
   interfaces with PV arrays and PHEVs. A bidirectional converter
   interconnects the two layers and controls the power flows between them.
   This paper presents the key design and operational aspects of the
   proposed architecture, with consideration of different uncertainties
   inherent in the system. To this end, a probabilistic benchmark has been
   developed for modeling these uncertainties and for use with the sizing

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the development of a new measurement device
   for the realistic assessment of braking capability of landing airplanes
   for winter runways. The conventional and current practice of runway
   condition monitoring has been focused on identifying the maximum
   tire-pavement frictional drag (mu value) and often neglected the
   characteristics of actual aircraft braking systems as well as the
   comprehensive effects coming from various factors such as deformable
   contaminants on the winter runway. The braking availability tester (BAT)
   proposed in this paper is designed to take a different approach for the
   realistic assessment of braking availability of landing airplanes. The
   main idea of the BAT is to mimic the braking operation of actual
   aircrafts as closely as possible by incorporating the same brake
   mechanism and antiskid braking system (ABS) used in existing aircrafts.
   In doing so, the BAT also incorporates a suite of sensors for monitoring
   the status of braking operation in real time. This paper details the
   design concepts and operation principles of the BAT. Preliminary test
   results are also presented to verify the main functionality of the BAT.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a synchronization scheme based on an improved
   auxiliary particle filter (IAPF) for chaotic Colpitts circuit and
   conduct an experimental study on the synchronization performance with
   application to secure communications. Specifically, with the
   synchronization scheme, when the chaotic signals generated by an analog
   Colpitts circuit are transmitted through a nonideal channel, the
   distorted signals are processed digitally by the novelly designed IAPF
   at the receiver, in order to obtain the synchronized signals of the
   transmitter circuit. Experimental results indicate that synchronization
   can be achieved over both the additive white Gaussian noise channel and
   the multipath fading channel with low signal-to-noise ratio, even if
   there exist severe circuit parameter mismatches between the transmitter
   and the receiver. Furthermore, a chaos-masking secure communication
   system is constructed and verified over both the additive white Gaussian
   noise channel and the multipath fading channel, and the bit error rate
   is evaluated versus different signal-to-noise ratios and symbol periods.
   It is shown that the achievable bit error rate can reach the order of
   magnitude of 10(-4) without error correction coding techniques. In
   addition, security analysis demonstrates that the proposed chaotic
   secure communication system is resistant to the brute-force attack.

Abstract = {{A surrogate-based optimization methodology was proposed for identifying
   and determining the optimal location and configuration of an air quality
   monitoring network (AQMN) in an industrial area for different pollutants
   such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and carbon monoxide
   (CO). Within the framework of the described methodology, an optimal AQMN
   design was proposed to assess the violation and pattern scores for each
   pollutant. For this purpose, a criterion for assessing the allocation of
   monitoring stations was developed by applying a utility function that
   could describe the spatial coverage of the network and its ability to
   detect violations of standards for multiple pollutants. An air
   dispersion model based on the multiple cell approach was used to create
   monthly spatial distributions for the concentrations of the pollutants
   emitted from different sources. The data was used to develop the
   surrogate models. The proposed methodology was applied to a network of
   existing refinery stacks, and the locations of monitoring stations and
   their area coverage percentage were obtained. Results clearly indicated
   that the proposed methodology was successful in designing AQMNs and
   could be used for as many stations as required.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow fiber membrane permeators have gained widespread acceptance for a
   variety of applications, including gas separation. This study presents
   our efforts to develop an appropriate methodology and mathematical
   modelling for the analysis of the transport properties and separation
   performance in hollow fiber membrane permeators with asymmetric
   structure. A relatively simplified model, developed based on ideal
   conditions, provides the opportunity for having a quick and overall
   prediction of the separation performance; while a comprehensive model
   developed by incorporation of non-ideal conditions enables a more
   accurate prediction of the membrane performance. The real gas behaviour,
   temperature, pressure, and concentration dependence of gas viscosity, as
   well as pressure changes on both sides of hollow fibers, concentration
   polarization, temperature change due to permeation, and temperature
   dependence of permeance are considered non-ideal parameters in
   development of the model. The integrated models with associated
   parameters in the form of differential equations are coded in MATLAB and
   solved as initial value problem using appropriate numerical methods. The
   validity of the developed models is examined, indicating close agreement
   between predictions and the experimental data provided in literature.
   The proposed methodology and developed models provide valuable
   opportunities for researchers in designing appropriate hollow fiber
   membrane permeators and processes for practical gas separation

Abstract = {{We investigated the electrical conduction in indium tin oxide/polyimide

   result not achievable in devices without the PI layer. Furthermore,
   time-of-flight (TOF) measurements at low electric fields (similar to 10

Abstract = {{A new decentralized approach for solving the economic dispatch problem
   is presented in this paper. The proposed approach consists of either two
   or three stages. In the first stage, a flooding-based consensus
   algorithm is proposed in order to achieve consensus among the agents
   with respect to the units and system data. In the second stage, a
   suitable algorithm is used for solving the economic dispatch problem in
   parallel. For cases in which a nondeterministic method is used in the
   second stage, a third stage is applied to achieve consensus about the
   final solution of the problem, with a flooding-based consensus algorithm
   for sharing the information required during this stage. The proposed
   approach is highly effective for solving the non-convex formulation of
   the economic dispatch problem and for incorporating transmission losses
   accurately in a fully decentralized manner. Three case studies that were
   examined for validation purposes are described. The results obtained
   demonstrate that the proposed approach aggregates many of the advantages
   of both centralized and fully decentralized mechanisms for solving the

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Mounting environmental concerns associated with the use of
   petroleum-based chemical manufacturing practices has generated
   significant interest in the development of biological alternatives for
   the production of propionate. However, biological platforms for
   propionate production have been limited to strict anaerobes, such as
   Propionibacteria and select Clostridia. In this work, we demonstrated
   high-level heterologous production of propionate under microaerobic
   conditions in engineered Escherichia coli. Activation of the native
   Sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) operon not only transformed E. coli to be
   propionogenic (i.e., propionate-producing) but also introduced an
   intracellular ``flux competition{''} between the traditional
   C2-fermentative pathway and the novel C3-fermentative pathway.
   Dissimilation of the major carbon source of glycerol was identified to
   critically affect such ``flux competition{''} and, therefore, propionate
   synthesis. As a result, the propionogenic E. coli was further engineered
   by inactivation or overexpression of various genes involved in the
   glycerol dissimilation pathways and their individual genetic effects on
   propionate production were investigated. Generally, knocking out genes
   involved in glycerol dissimilation (except glpA) can minimize levels of
   solventogenesis and shift more dissimilated carbon flux toward the
   C3-fermentative pathway. For optimal propionate production with high
   C3:C2-fermentative product ratios, glycerol dissimilation should be
   channeled through the respiratory pathway and, upon suppressed
   solventogenesis with minimal production of highly reduced alcohols, the
   alternative NADH-consuming route associated with propionate synthesis
   can be critical for more flexible redox balancing. With the
   implementation of various biochemical and genetic strategies, high
   propionate titers of more than 11 g/L with high yields up to 0.4
   g-propionate/g-glycerol (accounting for similar to 50 \% of dissimilated
   glycerol) were achieved, demonstrating the potential for industrial
   application. To our knowledge, this represents the most effective
   engineered microbial system for propionate production with titers and
   yields comparable to those achieved by anaerobic batch cultivation of
   various native propionate-producing strains of Propionibacteria.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel undercoupled RF resonant sensor platform
   that enables gaseous phase chemical detection for passive
   sensor-embedded RF devices and RFIDs. The resonant sensor is implemented
   with an interdigital chemi-capacitor and a transmission-line inductor,
   thus only requiring a simple two-layer fabrication process. Its superior
   sensitivity at RF frequencies arises from the benefits of response
   amplification near resonance, as well as the shorter wavelength at
   radio-frequencies. Furthermore, the interdigital capacitor allows
   polymeric sensing materials to be directly deposited atop, thereby
   improving fabrication repeatability. The sensor prototypes are loaded
   with three different polymeric sensing materials - OV225, OV275, and
   SC201(SXFA) - aiming to detect certain pre-perspiratory transdermal
   biomarkers including gaseous phase ethanol, methanol, and benzene. Their
   respective responses are recorded in terms of three distinctive RF
   parameters - resonant frequency shift (Delta f(0)), response amplitude
   change (Delta S-11), and response delay change (Delta GD(11)) - from
   which the sensitivities of these sensors are determined, and their
   selectivities with respect to the sample gas analytes are subsequently
   characterized. Finally, evaluation of the response signatures of the
   polymeric sensing materials to each gas analyte enables future
   development of sensor array systems that can distinguish desired
   analytes from unwanted interferents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The WG stream ciphers are based on the WG (Welch-Gong) transformation
   and possess proved randomness properties. In this paper we propose nine
   new hardware designs for the two classes of WG(29,11) and WG-16. For
   each class, we design and implement three versions of standard,
   pipelined and serial. For the first time, we use the polynomial basis
   (PB) representation to design and implement the WG(29,11) and WG-16. We
   consider traditional PB multiplier for the WG(29,11), and, the
   traditional and Karatsuba multipliers for the WG-16. For efficient field
   operations, we propose an irreducible trinomial for the WG(29,11). For
   the WG-16, a new formulation of its permutation which requires only 8
   multipliers is introduced. In these designs, the multipliers in the
   transforms are further reduced by utilizing a novel computation for the
   trace of the multiplication of two field elements. We have implemented
   the proposed designs in ASIC using CMOS 65 nm technology. The results
   show that the proposed standard WG(29,11) consumes less area and
   slightly enhances the normalized throughput, compared to the existing
   counterparts. For the WG-16, throughput of the proposed pipelined
   instance outperforms the previous designs. Moreover, the speed of the
   proposed WG-16 designs meet the peak bit rates for the 4 G
   specifications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a decentralized wireless network of asynchronous
   transmitter-receiver pairs with burst transmissions. Each receiver
   learns about the number of active users, channel coefficients, and
   mutual delays based on locally available measurements. The estimates for
   the mutual delays are not perfect, however, they are reliable enough to
   guarantee successful decoding. Two signalling schemes are addressed,
   namely, randomized masking (RM) and reduced cycle transmission (RCT).
   Under RM, the n symbols of a codeword are generated according to a
   Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution with activity factor 0 < theta <= 1.
   This is in contrast to RCT where each codeword consists of left
   perpendicular theta nright perpendicular Gaussian symbols followed by
   n-left prependicularnright perpendicular zeros. Assuming the
   transmitters are unaware of the number of users, channel coefficients,
   and mutual delays, the probability of outage under RM is considerably
   lower compared with RCT if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
   sufficiently large. A generalized RCT scheme is also examined where the
   n-left perpendicular theta nright perpendicular zero symbols are not
   necessarily located at the end of a codeword. In the asymptote of large
   SNR, the outage probability becomes vanishingly small under RM, however,
   it is bounded away from zero for generalized RCT regardless of the value
   of SNR.}},

Title = {{An elasto-plastic constitutive model for evolving asymmetric/anisotropic
   hardening behavior of AZ31B and ZEK100 magnesium alloy sheets
   considering monotonic and reverse loading paths}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Deformation twinning and texture evolution in hexagonal close-packed
   (HCP) metals lead to evolving flow stress asymmetry/anisotropy and
   evolving plastic anisotropy. These phenomena cause a significant change
   in the shape of the yield surface with accumulated plastic deformation
   which cannot be modeled accurately with traditional hardening laws. In
   this paper, an anisotropic continuum-based plasticity model is proposed
   to capture the large strain cyclic hardening behavior of magnesium
   alloys. Key in the current formulation is the incorporation of
   distortional hardening to model the evolving asymmetric/anisotropic
   hardening response of magnesium alloys for both monotonic and reverse
   loading paths. The hardening behavior is classified into three
   deformation modes: Monotonic Loading {[}ML], Reverse Compression {[}RC],
   and Reverse Tension {[}RT]. The deformation modes correspond to the
   different loading regimes of the cyclic hardening curve. Specifically,
   the ML mode corresponds to the initial in-plane tension and the initial
   in-plane compression from the annealed state, the RC mode corresponds to
   the in-plane compression following previous tension and the RT mode
   corresponds to the in-plane tension following previous compression.
   Three separate hardening laws are used to define the hardening response
   within each deformation mode. Moreover, a multi-yield surface modeling
   approach is used where a CPB06 type anisotropic yield surface is
   assigned to each deformation mode. The evolution of the anisotropy
   coefficients involved in the expression of the yield function, is
   considered to model distortional hardening within each deformation mode.
   The evolving anisotropy parameters are found by minimizing the
   difference between the model predictions and the experiments, together
   with the interpolation technique proposed by Plunkett et al. (2006). The
   proposed model is calibrated using monotonic and reverse loading
   experimental data for AZ31B and ZEK100 magnesium alloys. A strain rate
   independent elasto-plastic formulation is used to implement the proposed
   constitutive model as a user material subroutine (UMAT) in the
   commercial finite element software LS-DYNA (R). The predictions of the
   model are compared against the experimental monotonic and cyclic (CTC
   and TCT) flow stresses and r-values of AZ31B and ZEK100 sheets along
   different test directions. An excellent agreement is found between the
   simulated and experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Elevated temperature has significant effect on the mechanical response
   of metals and alloys. Industrial processes often use high temperature
   forming to fabricate components of complex shape from alloys such as
   aluminum or magnesium that have low room temperature formability.
   Accurate forming models to integrate warm forming in computer aided
   engineering (CAE) in production environment has been hampered by a lack
   of constitutive relations at elevated temperatures, forcing one to rely
   on experimental data for such integration. In this paper, a new thermo
   elasto-viscoplastic (TEV) constitutive relation is developed to model
   the behavior of face-centred cubic (FCC) polycrystals, especially
   aluminum alloys, at elevated temperatures. The model takes into account
   the temperature dependence of the single crystal elastic coefficients,
   single slip hardening parameters, thermal softening, rate sensitivity,
   and the total deformation. The TEV framework has been implemented into
   the commercial finite element code LS-DYNA to study the effects of
   temperature on metal forming. Uniaxial tension simulations at six
   different temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 260 degrees C have
   been performed and calibrated with published experimental results.
   Equations for the variation of single-slip hardening parameters with
   temperature have been developed for the AA5754 aluminum alloy. Shear
   test simulations at different temperatures have been used to validate
   the model. The proposed framework for the single slip parameters for
   uniaxial tension accurately predicts the shear stress-shear strain data
   without the need for any further fitting parameter. Temperature
   dependence of texture evolution, single slip hardening and hardening
   rates, thermal softening, and slip activity in AA5754 sheet alloy during
   temperatures corresponding to warm forming temperatures are
   investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel dual tank solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP) system configuration
   for domestic hot water heating was developed. Due to the multiple modes
   of operation arising from the configuration, it was necessary to develop
   a custom control strategy to minimize electricity consumption. The
   controller evaluates which modes of operation are possible given the
   current conditions and selects the best mode from those available.
   The system modes of operation were validated experimentally,using a test
   apparatus built at the University of Waterloo. Annual simulations of
   system performance for a single-family residential home indicate that
   the dual tank SAHP system developed provides significant energy savings
   in comparison to a traditional solar domestic hot water system. Using a
   benchmark comparison of a standard electric domestic hot water system
   and a solar domestic hot water system, the dual tank SAHP increased
   energy savings from 60\% to 69\% for 7.5 m(2) solar collector area.
   Applying the system to a larger load offers the potential for
   significant energy and cost savings, which would improve economic
   justifiability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{81-82}},
Pages = {{47-65}},

Abstract = {{Sink location privacy is one of the major issues in Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSNs) where adversaries may locate the sink by observing the
   destination of packets, directing and scaling of data flow, which leads
   to exposure of the sink-location privacy. In this paper, we propose a
   Ring Based Routing (RBR) scheme to address the issue of sink-location
   privacy in WSNs. The RBR scheme is composed of multiple routing rings
   and routing lines where the nodal data is not directly sent to the sink
   but to the nearest routing ring. In our scheme, data is routed through
   each node in the ring and then sent to other routing rings via routing
   lines, where the number of anonymity sink nodes is equal to the total
   number of nodes in the network. More specifically, under the RBR scheme
   the routing rings move in irregular patterns which can confuse
   adversaries even if the sink location is static and this greatly
   improves the sink-location privacy. In addition, the routing rings are
   constructed according to comprehensive analysis of network energy, which
   can fully use the remaining energy and improve energy efficiency and
   network lifetime. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show
   that our scheme can protect location privacy of sinks effectively. (C)

Abstract = {{In-vehicle Internet access is one of the main applications of vehicular
   ad hoc networks (VANETs), which aims at providing the vehicle passengers
   with a low-cost access to the Internet via on-road gateways. This paper
   introduces a new strategy for deploying Internet gateways on the roads,
   together with a novel scheme for data packet routing, in order to allow
   a vehicle to access the Internet via multihop communications in a VANET.
   The gateway placement strategy is to minimize the total cost of gateway
   deployment, while ensuring that a vehicle can connect to an Internet
   gateway (using multihop communications) with a probability greater than
   a specified threshold. This cost-minimization problem is formulated
   using binary integer programming, and applied to a realistic city
   scenario, consisting of the roads around the University of Waterloo,
   Waterloo, ON, Canada. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
   deployment strategy is the first study to address the probability of
   multihop connectivity among the vehicles and the deployed gateways. On
   the other hand, the developed packet routing scheme is based on a
   multichannel medium access control protocol, known as VeMAC, using time
   division multiple access. The performance of this cross-layer design is
   evaluated for a multichannel VANET in a highway scenario, mainly in
   terms of the end-to-end packet delivery delay. The end-to-end delay is
   calculated by modeling each relay vehicle as a queuing system, in which
   the packets are served in batches of no more than a specified maximum
   batch size. The proposed gateway placement and packet routing schemes
   represent a step toward providing reliable and ubiquitous in-vehicle
   Internet connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous monitoring over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is of
   increasing interest in industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs).
   Question of how to understand a situation of physical system by
   estimating process parameters is largely unexplored. This paper is
   concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial
   automation over relay-assisted WSNs. Different from most existing works
   on WSN with homogeneous sensor nodes, the network considered in this
   paper consists of two types of nodes, i.e., sensing nodes (SNs), which
   is capable of sensing and computing, and relay nodes (RNs), which is
   only capable of simple data aggregation. We first adopt a Kalman
   filtering (KF) approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters. In
   order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the KF algorithm
   in relay-assisted WSNs, a tree-based broadcasting strategy is provided
   for distributed sensor fusion. With the fused information, the
   consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs,
   respectively. The proposed method is applied to estimate the slab
   temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system,
   which is a typical industrial CPS. It is demonstrated that the
   introduction of RNs improves temperature estimation efficiency and
   accuracy compared with the homogeneous WSN with SNs only.}},

Abstract = {{Task offloading from smartphones to the cloud is a promising strategy to
   enhance the computing capability of smartphones and prolong their
   battery life. However, task offloading introduces a communication cost
   for those devices. Therefore, the consideration of the communication
   cost is crucial for the effectiveness of task offloading. To make task
   offloading beneficial, one of the challenges is to estimate the energy
   consumed in communication activities of task offloading. Accurate energy
   estimation models will enable these devices to make the right decisions
   as to whether or not to perform task offloading, based on the energy
   cost of the communication activities. Simply put, if the offloading
   process consumes less energy than processing the task on the device
   itself, then the task is offloaded to the cloud. To design an
   energy-aware offloading strategy, we develop energy models of the WLAN,
   third-generation, and fourth-generation interfaces of smartphones. These
   models make smartphones capable of accurately estimating the energy cost
   of task offloading. We validate the models by conducting an extensive
   set of experiments on five smartphones from different vendors. The
   experimental results show that our estimation models accurately estimate
   the energy required to offload tasks.}},

Abstract = {{With the advancement of smartphones, mobile social networks (MSNs) have
   emerged where information can be shared among mobile users via
   opportunistic peer-to-peer links. Since the social ties and users'
   behaviors in MSNs have diverse characteristics, the information
   dissemination in MSNs becomes a new challenge. In particular, mobile
   users' interested information may vary, which can significantly affect
   the information dissemination. In this paper, we develop an analytical
   model to analyze the epidemic information dissemination in MSNs. We
   first adopt preimmunity and immunity to represent the features of mobile
   nodes when they change their interests. Then, the information
   dissemination mechanism is introduced with four proposed dissemination
   rules according to the process of the epidemic information
   dissemination. We develop the analytical model through ordinary
   differential equations to mimic epidemic information dissemination in
   MSNs. The trace-driven simulation demonstrates that our analytical model
   is more accurate to mimic epidemic information dissemination than other
   existing ones.}},

Abstract = {{This extensive study investigated the ability of rapid biofiltration to

   Carbamazepine and atrazine were refractory to biodegradation, whereas
   removals of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), naproxen, and ibuprofen
   increased in the order listed. Pseudo-firstorder rate constants were
   estimated, and values for intermediate temperatures showed some
   influence of the direction of the seasonal temperature trend, indicating
   that in real systems there is not a unique relationship between

Abstract = {{Cerium oxide has proven as a proper hole-blocking contact in multilayer
   amorphous selenium X-ray detectors to reduce leakage current by limiting
   hole injection. To further improve its blocking properties, one of the
   key factors is to prepare a thin layer of cerium oxide with full
   oxidation. In this paper, a cerium oxide thin film was deposited by
   reactive oxygen ion assisted e-beam evaporation that utilized an
   independent oxygen ion source to create ionized oxygen, allowing for a
   refined oxidation control without requiring high process temperatures.
   Compared with films obtained without ion-beam assistance, oxygen ion
   assisted deposition enhanced the refractive index of oxide film from
   similar to 1.8 to 2.2 at a wavelength of 550 nm and improved the
   electrical resistivity from similar to 10(6) to 10(10) Omega cm. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements further
   gave insights into the stoichiometry and the crystal structures. To
   investigate blocking effectiveness, multilayer selenium sandwich
   structures with and without the cerium oxide blocking contact were
   fabricated and the leakage current was evaluated.}},

Title = {{An ensemble neuro-fuzzy radial basis network with self-adaptive swarm
   based supervisor and negative correlation for modeling automotive engine
   coldstart hydrocarbon emissions: A soft solution to a crucial automotive
   problem}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors propose a novel intelligent framework to
   identify the exhaust gas temperature (T-exh) and the engine-out
   hydrocarbon emission (HCraw) during the coldstart operation of an
   automotive engine. These are two key variables affecting the cumulative
   tailpipe emissions (HCcum) over the coldstart phase, which is the number
   one emission-related problem for today's spark-ignited (SI) engine
   vehicles. The coldstart operation is regarded as a highly nonlinear,
   transient and uncertain phenomenon. The proposed identifier integrates
   different soft computational strategies, i.e. neuro-fuzzy computing,
   fuzzy controller, swarm intelligent computing, and ensemble network
   design, beneficial for capturing both uncertainty and nonlinearity of
   the problem at hand. Furthermore, concepts of negative correlation
   topology design and hierarchical pair competition based parallel
   training are extracted from literature to form a diverse and robust
   ensemble identifier. Training of each neuro-fuzzy sub-component in
   ensemble network is carried out using a hybrid learning scheme. One
   feature of the antecedent part of neuro-fuzzy system, i.e. number of
   linguistic terms for each variable, as well as characteristics of rules
   in rule base are adjusted using hierarchical fair competition-based
   parallel adaptive particle swarm optimization (HFC-APSO) and the rest of
   features, i.e. the shape of (membership functions) MFs and the
   consequent variables of each rule, are tuned using back-propagation (BP)
   and steepest descent techniques. As it was mentioned, the authors try to
   design an ensemble identifier with acceptable rate of generalization,
   robustness and accuracy. These features help them to tame the intuitive
   uncertainties associated with the rate of T-exh and HCraw emission over
   the coldstart period. To do so, the potential characteristics of
   sub-components (solution domain of network design) are divided into a
   set of partitions and then HFC-APSO is utilized to explore/exploit each
   of those partitions. The exploration/exploitation rate of PSO (the core
   of HFC-APSO) is dynamically controlled by a fuzzy logic based
   controller. Hence, it is expected that HFC-APSO yields a set of accurate
   sub-identifiers with different operating characteristics. To further
   foster the diversity of the ensemble, negative correlation criterion is
   considered which obstructs the integration of identical sub-identifiers.
   The identification results demonstrate that the method is highly capable
   of providing an authentic model for estimation of T-exh and HCraw
   emission during the coldstart period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A stochastic alternating renewal process model for unavailability

Abstract = {{The paper presents a stochastic approach to analyze instantaneous
   unavailability of standby safety equipment caused by latent failures.
   The problem of unavailability analysis is formulated as a stochastic
   alternating renewal process without any restrictions on the form of the
   probability distribution assigned to time to failure and repair
   duration. An integral equation for point unavailability is derived and
   numerically solved for a given maintenance policy. The paper also
   incorporates an age-based preventive maintenance policy with random
   repair time. In case of aging equipment, the asymptotic limit or average
   unavailability should be used with a caution, because it cannot model an
   increasing trend in unavailability as a result of increasing hazard rate
   (i.e. aging) of the time to failure distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We study the stability of simplified phosphorescent organic

   electron/hole ratio in the hole transport layer and a lower
   concentration of un-recombined positive charges in the emission layer.
   The results suggest that their higher stability is due to reduced

Abstract = {{Contrast distortion is often a determining factor in human perception of

   propose a simple but effective method for no-reference quality
   assessment of contrast distorted images based on the principle of
   natural scene statistics (NSS). A large scale image database is employed
   to build NSS models based on moment and entropy features. The quality of
   a contrast-distorted image is then evaluated based on its unnaturalness
   characterized by the degree of deviation from the NSS models. Support
   vector regression (SVR) is employed to predict human mean opinion score
   (MOS) from multiple NSS features as the input. Experiments based on
   three publicly available databases demonstrate the promising performance
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a conventional solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is modeled,
   and its performance is assessed to investigate the main challenges that
   limit low temperature operation. SOFCs have numerous advantages over
   other fuel cell technologies; however, a major drawback of SOFCs is the
   high operating temperature (over 600 degrees C) which significantly
   reduces SOFCs lifetime and constrains manufacturing materials to costly
   produced composites. Therefore, the development of a low temperature
   solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC) will improve the cost effectiveness of
   this technology and thereby enhance efficient energy utilization and
   contribute to CO2 emission reduction. In this regard, a model is
   employed to predict the conventional SOFC performance under different
   operating and design conditions, in general, and at low operating
   temperatures, in particular. Furthermore, the contribution of each of
   the polarizations is evaluated. The model results are validated through
   a comparison with published experimental data and found to be in a good
   agreement with a maximum possible error value of 10.3\% in cell
   potential and power density output. The results show that conventional
   SOFCs are vulnerable to a significant performance reduction when
   operating at low temperatures (below 600 degrees C). In addition, the
   polarization that SOFCs experience at low operating temperatures is
   mainly attributed to electrolyte ohmic loss. Copyright (C) 2014,

Abstract = {{There is a growing trend to apply field emission (FE) electron sources
   in vacuum electronic devices due to their fast response, high efficiency
   and low energy consumption compared to thermionic emission ones. Carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) have been regarded as a promising class of electron
   field emitters since the 1990s and have promoted the development of FE
   technology greatly because of their high electrical and thermal
   conductivity, chemical stability, high aspect ratio and small size.
   Recent studies have shown that FE from CNTs has the potential to replace
   conventional thermionic emission in many areas and that it exhibits
   advanced features in practical applications. Consequently, FE from
   nanotubes and applications thereof have attracted much attention. This
   paper provides a comprehensive review of both recent advances in CNT
   field emitters and issues related to applications of CNT based FE. FE
   theories and principles are introduced, and the early development of
   field emitters is related. CNT emitter types and their FE performance
   are discussed. The current situation for applications based on nanotube
   FE is reviewed. Although challenges remain, the tremendous progress made
   in CNT FE over the past ten years indicates the field's development
   potential.}},

   first time. The nanocomposites possess a hierarchical structure of 50 nm
   VS2 sheets in thickness homogeneously anchored on graphene. The VS2/GNS
   nanocomposites exhibit an impressive high-rate capability and good
   cyclic stability as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries, which
   retain 89.3\% of the initial capacity 180.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles
   at 0.2 C. Even at 20 C, the composites still deliver a high capacity of
   114.2 mAh g(-1) corresponding to 62\% of the low-rate capacity. Expanded
   studies show that VS2/GNS, as an anode material, also has a good
   reversible performance with 528 mAh g(-1) capacity after 100 cycles at
   200 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance of the
   composites for reversible Li+ storage should be attributed to the
   exceptional interaction between VS2 and GNS that enabled fast electron
   transport between graphene and VS2. facile Li-ion diffusion within the
   electrode. Moreover, GNS provides a topological and structural template
   for the nucleation and growth of two-dimensional VS2 nanosheets and
   acted as buffer matrix to relieve the volume expansion/contraction of
   VS2 during the electrochemical charge/discharge, facilitating improved
   cycling stability. The VS2/GNS composites may be promising electrode
   materials for the next generation of rechargeable lithium ion batteries.}},

Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{In a standard optimization approach, the underlying process model is
   first identified at a given se of operating conditions and this updated
   model is, then, used to calculate the optimal conditions for the
   process. This ``two-step{''} procedure can be repeated iteratively by
   conducting new experiments at optimal operating conditions, based on
   previous iterations, followed by re-identification and re optimization
   until convergence is reached. However, when there is a model plant
   mismatch, the set of parameter estimates that minimizes the prediction
   error in the identification problem may not predict the gradients of the
   optimization objective accurately. As a result, convergence of the
   ``two-step{''} iterative approach to a process optimum cannot be
   guaranteed. This paper presents a new methodology where the model
   outputs are corrected explicitly for the mismatch such that, with the
   updated parameter estimates the identification and optimization
   objectives are properly reconciled. With the proposed corrections being
   progressively integrated over the iterations, the algorithm has
   guaranteed convergence to the process optimum and also, upon
   convergence, the final corrected model predicts the process behavior
   accurately. The proposed methodology is illustrated in a run-to-run
   optimization framework with a fed batch bioprocess as a case study. (C)

Abstract = {{A new method of sorting dielectric Janus particle is proposed and
   studied numerically in this paper. The Janus particles are composed of
   two hemispheres of two different dielectric materials. When the particle
   is placed in a microchannel under uniform DC electric field along the
   channel, vortices are induced near the particle. The strengths of the
   four vortices are determined by the dielectric permittivity of the
   particle surface, the size of the particle, the external electric field
   and the orientation of the Janus particle in the electric field. The
   numerical simulation results show that the dividing line of the Janus
   particle will align with the channel walls in the uniform electric
   field. The equilibrium distance between the wall and a particle is
   determined by the relative polarizability ratio and the size of the
   Janus particle. Thus Janus particles of the same polarizability ratio
   and the same size will follow the same streamline: Janus particles of
   different polarizability ratio and different sizes will have different
   trajectories. Consequently, by inducing different streamlines into
   different branch channels, Janus particles can be separated and
   collected by their polarizability ratios and their sizes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel processing method promoting a rapid hydrogen generation from the
   solid state Li-B-Fe-H system is presented. The Li-B-Fe-H system is quite
   remarkable since the mechanical dehydrogenation rate at the ambient
   temperature is much higher than the thermal dehydrogenation rate at the
   100 -250 degrees C range. The quantity of 4.02 wt.\% H-2 is desorbed
   after barely 0.5 h of ball milling with a very low energy input of 36.4
   kJ/g while at 250 degrees C, after the same desorption time, only 3.2
   wt.\% H-2 is desorbed. Thus this system is a rapid, solid state H-2
   generator at the ambient temperature. X-ray diffraction after ball
   milling shows the presence of the crystalline LiCl diffraction peaks.
   The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements show a
   spectrum characteristic of the disordered Fe(BH4)(2) hydride. Samples
   milled under varying energy inputs are attracted to a permanent magnet.
   It is shown that the thermal dehydrogenation behavior of the pre-milled
   samples is initially fast but then quickly slows down. The pre-milled
   samples after thermal dehydrogenation are also attracted to a permanent
   magnet. Diffraction peaks of alpha-Fe are clearly observed after thermal
   desorption of powders at 100 and 250 degrees C. For the sample
   dehydrogenated at 250 degrees C the crystallite size of the alpha-Fe
   phase, estimated from its diffraction peak breadths, is within a
   nanometric range of 27-47 nm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Lap joint friction stir welding (FSW) between dissimilar AZ31B and Al
   6061 alloys sheets was conducted using various welding parameters
   including tool geometry, rotation and travel speeds. Tapered threaded
   pin and tapered pin tools were applied to fabricate FSW joints, using
   different rotation and travel speeds. Metallurgical investigations
   including X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), optical microscopy images
   (OM), scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA)
   were used to characterize joints microstructures made with different
   welding parameters. Intermetallic phases were detected in the weld zone
   (WZ). Various microstructures were observed in the stir zone which can
   be attributed to using different travel and rotation speeds. Mechanical
   evaluation including lap shear fracture load test and microhardness
   measurements indicated that by simultaneously increasing the tool
   rotation and travel speeds, the joint tensile strength and ductility
   reached a maximum value. Microhardness studies and extracted results
   from stress-strain curves indicated that mechanical properties were
   affected by FSW process. Furthermore, phase analyses by XRD indicated
   the presence of intermetallic compounds in the weld zone. Finally, in
   the Al/Mg dissimilar weld, fractography studies showed that
   intermetallic compounds formation in the weld zone had an influence on
   the failure mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although microbial fuel cells are potential candidates for electricity
   generation with concomitant treatment of wastewater, operational and
   technological improvements are still required to make them a cost
   effective process. In this paper, a full factorial design in combination
   with a central composite design were employed to probe the effects of pH
   and buffer concentration of catholyte on the performance of a two
   chamber microbial fuel cell. It was observed that at high level of
   buffer concentration (150 mM) varying the pH between 5.8 and 7.4 did not
   markedly influence the maximum power density and columbic efficiency.
   However, at a low level of buffer concentration (25 mM) reducing the pH
   led to higher power density. Furthermore, it was observed that higher
   concentrations of buffer were beneficial to power generation when pH was
   at its high level, but negatively impacted the cell performance at low
   pH levels. The highest maximum power was predicted to be 461 mWm(-2) (at
   a pH of 6.3 and a buffer concentration of 82 mM) and this was confirmed
   by experimental results. The findings of this paper highlight the
   importance of the joint effect of pH and buffer concentration, which is
   even more influential than their main individual effects. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Localized optical absorption in aluminum masks used for vertical silicon
   nanowire fabrication is demonstrated experimentally and supported using

   nanowires are 1 mu m long, with diameters ranging from 60 nm to 100 nm
   and spaced 400 nm apart. New spectral features appear in the 500 nm-700
   nm wavelengths range and are dependent on both the nanowire diameter and
   length. The former is due to the excitation of radial modes, whereas the
   latter stems from longitudinal (Fabry-Perot) resonances. The salient

   nanowire plays in this connection are discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Bacterial Acclimation Inside an Aqueous Battery}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Specific environmental stresses may lead to induced genomic instability
   in bacteria, generating beneficial mutants and potentially accelerating
   the breeding of industrial microorganisms. The environmental stresses
   inside the aqueous battery may be derived from such conditions as ion
   shuttle, pH gradient, free radical reaction and electric field. In most
   industrial and medical applications, electric fields and direct currents
   are used to kill bacteria and yeast. However, the present study focused
   on increasing bacterial survival inside an operating battery. Using a
   bacterial acclimation strategy, both Escherichia coli and Bacillus
   subtilis were acclimated for 10 battery operation cycles and survived in
   the battery for over 3 days. The acclimated bacteria changed in cell
   shape, growth rate and colony color. Further analysis indicated that
   electrolyte concentration could be one of the major factors determining
   bacterial survival inside an aqueous battery. The acclimation process
   significantly improved the viability of both bacteria E. coliand B.
   subtilis. The viability of acclimated strains was not affected under
   battery cycle conditions of 0.18-0.80 mA cm(-2) and 1.4-2.1 V. Bacterial
   addition within 1.0x10(10) cells mL(-1) did not significantly affect
   battery performance. Because the environmental stress inside the aqueous
   battery is specific, the use of this battery acclimation strategy may be
   of great potential for the breeding of industrial microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Fine grained (FG) and ultra-fine grained (UFG) materials processed by
   severe plastic deformation exhibit beneficial hardness and tensile
   properties. Constrained groove pressing (CGP) were employed for
   fabrication of FG and UFG sheet metals and accomplished into different
   types of metals and alloys, such as commercial pure aluminum, AA3003
   aluminum alloy, commercial pure copper, nickel, titanium and low carbon
   steels. Tensile and hardness characteristics in the FG and UFG sheets
   have been assessed with the aim of evaluating the hardness strength
   relationship frequently established for coarse-grained metals and alloys
   (sigma UTS/H-V = 3.45). However, it was revealed that the FG and UFG
   materials do not obey widely used hardness strength relationships in the
   conventional coarse grained structures. A new multiplicity factor less
   than 3, depending on the chemical composition of processed materials, is
   proposed in this study. This is attributed to different strain hardening
   response of the FG and UFG materials with slight work hardening before
   necking instability. In fine grained and ultra-fine grained structures
   failure does not occur in (or right after) the onset of necking point.
   That is, tensile deformation sustains significantly up to fracture point
   due to the role of superplasticity mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A fabrication method for the FeAl intermetallic based porous graded
   materials (PGMs) is described and discussed in detail in the present
   paper. A multi-step manufacturing process for the FeAl PGMs is proposed.
   Open-cell FeAl PGMs with adjustable porosity and corresponding
   mechanical properties have been successfully prepared using the NaCl
   preforms via a sintering-dissolution process. The FeAl PGMs were
   obtained from the Fe and Al elemental powder mixtures and NaCl powder
   with a varying particle size. A quantitative metallographic evaluation
   of both chemical and phase composition shows that obtained PGMs are
   characterized by a homogeneous FeAl intermetallic matrix exhibiting a
   graded distribution of the pore size within the range 0.6-2 mm and
   porosity from 40\% to 60\%. Moreover, a proper preparation of the batch
   material allows obtaining a discrete or quasi-continuous porosity
   gradient. Mechanical properties of the fabricated FeAl PGMs were
   examined in static compression tests. It was observed that sample
   destruction started in the area of the smallest pores (weakest link)
   through a walls shearing and crushing mechanism. The quasi-continuous
   PGMs exhibit a nearly twice higher compressive strength than that for
   samples with the discrete gradient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The interfacial tension of poly lactic acid (PLA) melt is measured in
   supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) at the temperature range of 143
   degrees C to 168 degrees C and CO2 pressures up to 13,790 kpa, using
   axisymmetric drop shape analysis profile (ADSA-P). The results show a
   decrease in interfacial tension with increasing temperature and
   pressure. However, the interfacial tension dependency on temperature at
   high pressures decreases because of a reduction in CO2 solubility at
   high temperatures. The relationship between the interfacial tension and
   the density-difference of polymer-supercritical CO2 mixtures is also
   examined by the generalized Macleod's equation. Moreover, the range of
   stability for the melted drop, in interfacial tension measurements, is
   obtained by dimensionless Bond number. The results indicate the validity
   of the measurements for Bond number between 0.36 and 0.48. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Perylene diimides (PDIs) are one of the most widely studied n-type
   materials, showing great promise as electron acceptors in organic
   photovoltaic devices and as electron transport materials in n-channel
   organic field effect transistors. Amongst the well-established chemical
   modification strategies for increasing the electron mobility of PDI,
   substitution of the imide oxygen atoms with sulfur, known as thionation,
   has remained largely unexplored. In this work, it is demonstrated that
   thionation is a highly effective means of enhancing the electron
   mobility of a bis-N-alkylated PDI derivative. Successive oxygen-sulfur
   substitution increases the electron mobility such that the fully
   thionated derivative (S4) has an average mobility of 0.16 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1). This is two orders of magnitude larger than the nonthionated
   parent compound (P), and is achieved by solution deposition and without
   thermal or solvent vapor annealing. A combination of atomic force
   microscopy and 2D wide angle X-ray scattering experiments, together with
   theoretical modeling of charge transport efficiency, is used to explain
   the strong positive correlation observed between electron mobility and
   degree of thionation. This work establishes thionation as a highly
   effective means of enhancing the electron mobility of PDI, and provides
   motivation for the development of thionated PDI derivatives for organic
   electronics applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an adaptive amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
   scheme that selects the best relay among the available relay nodes
   opportunistically to cooperate with a source node for improvement of the
   spectral efficiency. This improvement can be achieved by introducing a
   policy that gives the useful cooperative regions and defines a switching
   threshold signal-to-noise ratio that guarantees the bit error rate (BER)
   of cooperative transmission is below the target. We model all links as
   independent non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. We
   then derive closed-form expressions for the average spectral efficiency,
   average BER, and outage probability when an upper bound for the
   signal-to-noise ratio of the end-to-end relay path is applied and
   adaptive discrete rate is considered. Numerical and simulation results
   show that the proposed scheme, compared with the outage-based AF
   incremental relaying, AF fixed relaying, and the conventional direct
   transmission, can achieve the maximum average spectral efficiency while
   maintaining the average BER and outage probability. Copyright (c) 2013

Title = {{Design and characterization of a new peptide vector for short
   interfering RNA delivery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{RNA interference holds tremendous potential as one of the most powerful
   therapeutic strategies. However, the properties of short interfering RNA
   (siRNA), such as hydrophilicity, negative charge, and instability in
   serum have limited its applications; therefore, significant efforts have
   been undertaken to improve its cellular uptake. Cell penetrating
   peptides have been utilized to deliver various biologically active
   molecules, such as proteins, liposomes, nanoparticles, peptide nucleic
   acids, and recently small interfering RNAs. Here, we introduce a new
   cell penetrating peptide GL1(Ac-GLWRAWLWKAFLASNWRRLLRLLR-NH2) to improve
   the intracellular uptake of siRNA. This peptide consists of four
   tryptophan residues that facilitated its binding with the cell membrane,
   five arginine residues and one lysine residue which are positively
   charged at physiological pH, which induced the formation of
   peptide-siRNA complexes and enhanced the affinity of the peptide and
   cell membrane. Moreover, GL1 adopted helical secondary structure due to
   the altered distribution of polar and nonpolar residues in the sequence.
   In this study, we investigated the effect of peptide/siRNA molar ratio
   on the particle size, surface charge, secondary structure, and uptake
   efficiency. The results showed that GL1 formed stable complexes with
   siRNA mainly through electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic
   interaction, and the complexes displayed a spherical shape with the size
   of similar to 100 nm and positive surface charge. Utilizing the
   techniques of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, the
   intracellular localization of Cy3-labeled GAPDH siRNA was visualized and
   the cellular uptake was quantified. It is worth noting that in the serum
   free environment, compared to Lipofectamine 2000, GL1 achieved higher
   cellular uptake of siRNA (similar to 95\%); in the presence of serum,
   GL1 retained the same level of siRNA cellular uptake (similar to 84\%)
   as Lipofectamine 2000. In addition, the viability of cells treated by
   GL1 in all studied molar ratios was >85\%, which was significantly
   higher than that treated by Lipofectamine 2000 (similar to 70\%). Taken
   together, the peptide GL1 demonstrated promise as a siRNA delivery
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The main proposition of the current investigation is to develop a
   computational intelligence-based framework which can be used for the
   real-time estimation of optimum battery state-of-charge (SOC) trajectory
   in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The estimated SOC
   trajectory can be then employed for an intelligent power management to
   significantly improve the fuel economy of the vehicle. The devised
   intelligent SOC trajectory builder takes advantage of the upcoming route
   information preview to achieve the lowest possible total cost of
   electricity and fossil fuel. To reduce the complexity of real-time
   optimization, the authors propose an immune system-based clustering
   approach which allows categorizing the route information into a
   predefined number of segments. The intelligent real-time optimizer is
   also inspired on the basis of interactions in biological immune systems,
   and is called artificial immune algorithm (AIA). The objective function
   of the optimizer is derived from a computationally efficient artificial
   neural network (ANN) which is trained by a database obtained from a
   high-fidelity model of the vehicle built in the Autonomie software. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the integration of immune inspired
   clustering tool, AIA and ANN, will result in a powerful framework which
   can generate a near global optimum SOC trajectory for the baseline
   vehicle, that is, the Toyota Prius PHEV. The outcomes of the current
   investigation prove that by taking advantage of intelligent approaches,
   it is possible to design a computationally efficient and powerful SOC
   trajectory builder for the intelligent power management of PHEVs.}},

   the feasibility of applying an automated approach to extracting driver

   at three different locations on the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto,
   Canada. A comparison was made between the automated approach and manual
   approach, and issues in collecting data using the automated approach
   under winter conditions were identified. The second case study was based
   on high quality data collected in the winter 2014, at a location on
   Highway 25 in Montreal, Canada. The results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the automated analytical framework in analyzing driver
   behavior, as well as evaluating the impact of adverse winter weather

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study aimed at comparing the outcome of two
   geostatistical-based approaches, namely kernel density estimation (KDE)
   and kriging, for identifying crash hotspots in a road network. Aiming at
   locating high-risk locations for potential intervention, hotspot
   identification is an integral component of any comprehensive road safety
   management programs. A case study was conducted with historical crash
   data collected between 2003 and 2007 in the Hennepin County of
   Minnesota, U.S. The two methods were evaluated on the basis of a
   prediction accuracy index (PAI) and a comparison in hotspot ranking. It
   was found that, based on the PAI measure, the kriging method
   outperformed the KDE method in its ability to detect hotspots, for all
   four tested groups of crash data with different times of day.
   Furthermore, the lists of hotspots identified by the two methods were
   found to be moderately different, indicating the importance of selecting
   the right geostatistical method for hotspot identification.
   Notwithstanding the fact that the comparison study presented herein is
   limited to one case study, the findings have shown the promising
   perspective of the kriging technique for road safety analysis.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Runtime verification is a monitoring technique to gain assurance about
   well-being of a program at run time. Most existing approaches use
   sequential monitors; i.e., when the state of the program with respect to
   an event of interest changes, the monitor interrupts the program
   execution, evaluates a set of logical properties, and finally resumes
   the program execution. In this paper, we propose a GPU-based method for
   design and implementation of monitors that enjoy two levels of
   parallelism: the monitor (1) works along with the program in parallel,
   and (2) evaluates a set of properties in a parallel fashion as well. Our
   parallel monitoring algorithms effectively exploit the many-core
   platform available in the GPU. In addition to parallel processing, our
   approach benefits from a true separation of monitoring and functional
   concerns, as it isolates the monitor in the GPU. Thus, our monitoring
   approach incurs minimal intrusion, as executing monitoring tasks take
   place in a different computing hardware from execution of the program
   under inspection. Our method is fully implemented for parametric and
   non-parametric 3-valued linear temporal logic. Our experimental results
   show significant reduction in monitoring overhead, monitoring
   interference, and power consumption due to leveraging the GPU
   technology. In particular, we observe that our parallel verification
   algorithms are indeed scalable.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of hyperspectral imagery using few labeled samples is a
   challenging problem, considering the high dimensionality of
   hyperspectral imagery. Classifiers trained on limited samples with
   abundant spectral bands tend to overfit, leading to weak generalization
   capability. To address this problem, we have developed an enhanced
   ensemble method called multiclass boosted rotation forest (MBRF), which
   combines the rotation forest algorithm and a multiclass AdaBoost
   algorithm. The benefit of this combination can be explained by
   bias-variance analysis, especially in the situation of inadequate
   training samples and high dimensionality. Furthermore, MBRF innately
   produces posterior probabilities inherited from AdaBoost, which are
   served as the unary potentials of the conditional random field (CRF)
   model to incorporate spatial context information. Experimental results
   show that the classification accuracy by MBRF as well as its integration
   with CRF consistently outperforms the other referenced state-of-the-art
   classification methods when limited labeled samples are available for
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is essential for enhancing HSI
   quality and facilitating HSI processing tasks. However, the reduction of
   noise in HSI is a difficult work, primarily due to the fact that HSI
   consists much more spectral bands than other remote sensing images.
   Therefore, comparing with other image denoising jobs that rely primarily
   on spatial information, efficient HSI denoising requires the utilization
   of both spatial and spectral information. In this paper, we design an
   unsupervised spatial-spectral HSI denoising approach based on Monte
   Carlo sampling (MCS) technique. This approach allows the incorporation
   of both spatial and spectral information for HSI denoising. Moreover, it
   addresses the noise variance heterogeneity effect among different HSI
   bands. In the proposed HSI denoising scheme, MCS is used to estimate the
   posterior distribution, in order to solve a Bayesian least squares
   optimization problem. Based on the proposed scheme, we iterate all
   pixels in HIS and denoise them sequentially. A referenced pixel in
   hyperspectral image is denoised as follows. First, some samples are
   randomly drawn from image space close to the referenced pixel. Second,
   based on a spatial-spectral similarity likelihood, relevant samples are
   accepted into a sample set. Third, all samples in the accepted set will
   be used for calculating the estimation of posterior distribution.
   Finally, based on the posterior, the noise-free pixel value is estimated
   as the discrete conditional mean. The proposed method is tested on both
   simulated and real hyperspectral images, in comparison with several
   other popular methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
   is capable of removing the noise largely, while also preserving image
   details very well.}},

Abstract = {{A novel analytical solution approach for problems of steady flow in
   two-dimensional heterogeneous porous media is presented, where the
   hydraulic conductivity may be represented as an arbitrary polynomial in
   space. The solution approach uses Wirtinger calculus and the Bers-Vekua
   theory of elliptical functions. The final form of the solution comprises
   an arbitrary complex polynomial solution to the Laplace equation and
   additional nonholomorphic terms which are determined directly from the
   coefficients of this polynomial. The arbitrary polynomial coefficients
   may be chosen to satisfy general flow conditions along system
   boundaries. The approach is also extended to singular flow, such as that
   induced by pumping wells. The solution is demonstrated to be effectively
   exact for a number of test cases; the problems are solved to machine
   precision.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, two-step chemical reduction route is suggested to synthesize
   highly active and well-dispersed Pd3Sn alloy nanoparticles supported on
   chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for the alcohol-tolerant oxygen

   individuals are easily obtained, and graphene oxide is served as the
   stablization agent for Pd3Sn nanoparticles, and as carbon support which
   is co-deposited with metal or alloy particles. Transmission electron
   microscopy, Raman and powder X-ray diffraction results show that Pd and
   Pd3Sn nanoparticles are finely-dispersed on multi-layer rGO with
   well-controlled particle sizes, dispersities and composition
   uniformities. Electrochemical measurements confirm that Pd3Sn/rGO
   exhibites higher oxygen reduction activity and alcohol-tolerant ability
   than the Pd/rGO thanks to the smaller sizes of Pd3Sn nanoparticles and
   the strong interaction between metal and rGO. This new strategy provides
   a facile route to synthesize multicomponent alloy loaded rGO composites

Abstract = {{LiAlH4 and CaCl2 were employed for mechano-chemical activation synthesis
   (MCAS) of Ca(AlH4)(2) and LiCl hydride composite. After short ball
   milling time, their X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks are clearly observed.
   After ball milling for a longer duration than 0.5 h, the CaAlH5
   diffraction peaks are observed which indicates that Ca(AlH4)(2) starts
   decomposing during ball milling into CaAlH5+Al+1.5H(2). It is estimated
   that less than 1 wt \% H-2 was mechanically dehydrogenated in
   association with decomposition reaction. After 2.5 h of ball milling, no
   Ca(AlH4)(2) diffraction peaks were observed on XRD patterns which
   suggests that Ca(AlH4)(2) was decomposed. Thermal behavior of ball
   milled powders, which was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis
   (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicates that a
   certain fraction of Ca(AlH4)(2) could have been disordered/amorphized
   during ball milling being undetectable by XRD. The apparent activation
   energy for the decomposition of Ca(AlH4)(2) and CaAlH5 equals 135 kJ/mol

Abstract = {{The phenomenal growth of mobile data demand has brought about increasing
   scarcity in available radio spectrum. Meanwhile, mobile customers pay
   more attention to their own experience, especially in communication
   reliability and service continuity on the move. To address these issues,
   LTE-Unlicensed, or LTE-U, is considered one of the latest groundbreaking
   innovations to provide high performance and seamless user experience
   under a unified radio technology by extending LTE to the readily
   available unlicensed spectrum. In this article, we offer a comprehensive
   overview of the LTE-U technology from both operator and user
   perspectives, and examine its impact on the incumbent unlicensed
   systems. Specifically, we first introduce the implementation
   regulations, principles, and typical deployment scenarios of LTE-U.
   Potential benefits for both operators and users are then discussed. We
   further identify three key challenges in bringing LTE-U into reality
   together with related research directions. In particular, the most
   critical issue of LTE-U is coexistence with other unlicensed systems,
   such as widely deployed WiFi. The LTE/WiFi coexistence mechanisms are
   elaborated in time, frequency, and power aspects, respectively.
   Simulation results demonstrate that LTE-U can provide better user
   experience to LTE users while well protecting the incumbent WiFi users'
   performance compared to two existing advanced technologies:
   cellular/WiFi interworking and licensed-only heterogeneous networks
   (Het-Nets).}},

Abstract = {{This letter addresses the very critical challenge facing the successful

   expression is proposed to alleviate the dynamic range requirements for

   algorithm is devised to determine the coefficients of the proposed
   reformulated EMP within a specified hardware limitation. As
   proof-of-concept validation, a 20 W Doherty power amplifier driven by 20
   MHz LTE signals was linearized using the conventional and newly proposed
   EMP expressions. An adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of - 50.5 dBc
   was achieved with a dynamic range of about 50 dB for the proposed
   reformulated EMP and 155 dB for the conventional formulation.}},

Title = {{Flow development and structural loading on dual step cylinders in
   laminar shedding regime}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The flow development over a dual step cylinder is investigated
   numerically at a Reynolds number (Re-D) of 150 for a range of aspect
   ratios, 0.2 <= L/D <= 5, and diameter ratios, 1.1 <= D/d <= 4. The
   results reveal the following four distinct types of wake topology
   downstream of the larger diameter cylinder: (i) shedding of hairpin
   vortices, (ii) transient asymmetric shedding, (iii) primarily spanwise
   shedding, and (iv) no vortex shedding. Dominant vortex interactions are
   reconstructed for each regime. These interactions, involving half-loop
   vortex connections, vortex merging, and direct vortex connections are
   shown to occur periodically as the large and small cylinder structures
   undergo vortex dislocations. Topological schematics are introduced to
   relate the characteristic frequencies to the periodic vortex
   interactions. The observed types of wake topology are shown to produce
   distinctly different mean and fluctuating forces on the dual step
   cylinder. For lower aspect and diameter ratios (L/D similar to 1 and D/d
   similar to 1.5), a reduction in fluctuating lift of up to 80\% can be
   achieved on the base cylinder with a minor reduction in mean drag
   (similar to 5\%). The results indicate that similar performance
   improvements can be sustained by attaching multiple larger diameter
   cylinders to the base cylinder. The changes in the fluid forcing are
   shown to be related to the secondary flow produced by the downwash at
   the stepwise discontinuities. This process also involves the production
   of streamwise vorticity at the steps, which is shown to be associated
   with the deformation of the main spanwise vortical structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A preliminary study compares the feasibility and microstructures of pure
   copper claddings produced on a pressure vessel A516 Gr. 70 steel plate,
   using friction stir welding versus gas metal arc welding. A combination
   of optical and scanning electron microscopy is used to characterize the
   grain structures in both the copper cladding and heat affected zone in
   the steel near the fusion line. The friction stir welding technique
   produces copper cladding with a grain size of around 25 pm, and no
   evidence of liquid copper penetration into the steel. The gas metal arc
   welding of copper cladding exhibits grain sizes over I mm, and with
   surface microcracks as well as penetration of liquid copper up to 50 pm
   into the steel substrate. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that
   metallurgical bonding is produced in both processes. Increased diffusion
   of Mn and Si into the copper cladding occurs when using gas metal arc
   welding, although some nano-pores were detected in the FSW joint
   interface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   evaluate the performance in terms of data transmission rate. The results

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of connected devices and emerging data-hungry
   applications, the volume of mobile data traffic is predicted to have a
   1000-fold growth by the year 2020. To address the challenge of this data
   explosion, industry and academia have initiated research and development
   of 5G wireless networks, which are envisaged to cater to the massive
   data traffic volume, while providing ubiquitous connectivity and
   supporting diverse applications with different quality of service (QoS)
   requirements. To support the expected massive growth of mobile data, a
   large number of small cells are expected to be deployed indoors and
   outdoors, giving rise to heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which are
   considered to be the key path toward 5G. With such large-scale HetNets,
   network operators face many serious challenges in terms of operation and
   management, costeffective small cell deployment, and intercell
   interference mitigation. To deal with those issues, a cloud based
   platform is introduced, aiming to simplify the deployment, operation and
   management, and facilitate round-the-clock optimization of the network,
   to pave the way for the development of 5G. Two case studies are provided
   to illustrate the benefits of the cloud based architecture. Finally, the
   related standardization activities are provided and some research topics
   essential for a successful development of 5G are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To prevent ill-formed configurations, highly configurable software often
   allows defining constraints over the available options. As these
   constraints can be complex, fixing a configuration that violates one or
   more constraints can be challenging. Although several fix-generation
   approaches exist, their applicability is limited because (1) they
   typically generate only one fix or a very long fix list, difficult for
   the user to identify the desirable fix; and (2) they do not fully
   support non-Boolean constraints, which contain arithmetic, inequality,
   and string operators. This paper proposes a novel concept, range fix,
   for software configuration. A range fix specifies the options to change
   and the ranges of values for these options. We also design an algorithm
   that automatically generates range fixes for a violated constraint. We
   have evaluated our approach with three different strategies for handling
   constraint interactions, on data from nine open source projects over two
   configuration platforms. The evaluation shows that our notion of range
   fix leads to mostly simple yet complete sets of fixes, and our algorithm
   is able to generate fixes within one second for configuration systems
   with a few thousands options and constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel unified structure to estimate tire forces.
   The proposed structure uses estimation modules to calculate/estimate
   tire forces by means of nonlinear observers. The novelty in the proposed
   approach lies in the independence of the estimates from the vehicle tire
   model, thereby making the structure robust against variations in vehicle
   mass, tire parameters due to tire wear, and, most importantly, road
   surface conditions. In the proposed structure, we have a dedicated
   module to estimate the longitudinal tire forces and another to calculate
   the vertical tire forces. Subsequently, these forces are fed into a
   third module that utilizes a nonlinear observer to estimate lateral tire
   forces. The proposed structure is validated through experimental
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{In cloud, data access control is a crucial way to ensure data security.
   Functional encryption (FE) is a novel cryptographic primitive supporting
   fine-grained access control of encrypted data in cloud. In FE, every
   ciphertext is specified with an access policy, a decryptor can access
   the data if and only if his secret key matches with the access policy.
   However, the FE cannot be directly applied to construct access control
   scheme due to the exposure of the access policy which may contain
   sensitive information. In this paper, we deal with the policy privacy
   issue and present a mechanism named multi-authority vector policy (MAVP)
   which provides hidden and expressive access policy for FE. Firstly, each
   access policy is encoded as a matrix and decryptors can only obtain the
   matched result from the matrix in MAVP. Then, we design a novel function
   encryption scheme based on the multi-authority spatial policy (MAVP-FE),
   which can support privacy-preserving yet non-monotone access policy.
   Moreover, we greatly improve the efficiency of encryption and decryption
   in MAVP-FE by shifting the major computation of clients to the
   outsourced server. Finally, the security and performance analysis show
   that our MAVP-FE is secure and efficient in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrated salt solutions are currently being used as antiicing and

   commonly-used brines are predominantly CaCl2, NaCl, MgCl2, or a

   to determine if the different cation(s) of the brine have an influence
   on the chloride threshold concentration for corrosion initiation of
   reinforcing steel and on the subsequent active corrosion rates. The
   tests were carried out in synthetic pore solution in order to allow for
   control of the chloride content and observation of any corrosion. The
   results show that the MgCl2 results in a significant drop in pH of the
   solution and a corresponding high level of corrosion, while the NaCl
   solution has the lowest chloride threshold value and most anodic

Abstract = {{We propose an improved coarse-grain scalable video coding (SVC) approach
   based on the structural similarity (SSIM) index as the visual quality
   criterion, aiming at maximizing the overall coding performance

   First, we develop an interlayer rate-SSIM dependency model, by
   investigating bit rate and SSIM relationships between different layers.
   Second, a reduced-reference SSIM-Q model and a Laplacian R-Q model are
   introduced for SVC, by incorporating the characteristics of hierarchical
   prediction structure in each layer. Third, based on the user-defined
   weightings and the proposed models, we design a rate-distortion
   optimization approach to adaptively adjust Lagrange multipliers for all
   layers to maximize the overall rate-SSIM performance of the scalable
   encoder. Experiments with multiple layers, different layer weightings,
   and various videos demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve
   better rate-SSIM performance than single layer optimization method, and
   provide better coding efficiency as compared to the conventional SVC
   scheme. Subjective tests further demonstrate the benefits of the
   proposed scheme.}},

   proved to be efficient especially for low power circuit applications

   the impacts of major variation sources are analyzed for different
   circuit applications, showing a different trend from the ED-only
   approach. In addition, the methodology is also extended to include the

   assessments of situations in the environment. However, such systems rely
   on a massive number of sensors with diverse capabilities but limited
   resources, e.g., power, processing, and storage. Thus, successful
   management of tasks hinges on the systems architecture. Sensor
   management architectures (SMAs) coordinate the sensor nodes and their
   resources in a manner that improves system control and situation
   awareness. This paper introduces a scalable and flexible SMA for many
   sensor management (SM) applications, particularly, pervasive
   surveillance. This novel SMA is called the extended hybrid architecture
   for SM (E-HASM), an architecture that combines the advantages of the
   holonic, federated, and market-based paradigms. The E-HASM models each
   node as an intelligent sensor by using the beliefs, desires, and
   intentions model and defines the interaction and cooperation among the
   nodes. The simulation results illustrate the performance of the E-HASM
   over a variety of security threats, background targets, and network
   sizes. The results prove that the proposed architecture is significantly
   more scalable and flexible than centralized architectures.}},

Title = {{Assessment of ghost-cell based cut-cell method for large-eddy
   simulations of compressible flows at high Reynolds number}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations (LES) of high Reynolds number flows are performed
   using a non-body conformal method in conjunction with a wall model. We
   use a simple wall function to model the wall-shear stress and the
   truncation error of the numerical discretization to model the sub-grid
   scale turbulence (implicit LES), although these can be easily replaced
   if necessary. The validation cases are: turbulent flow through an
   inclined channel, turbulent flow over a wavy surface, and supersonic
   flow over a circular cylinder. Since the near-wall grids are naturally
   coarse, the key is to use a method that is capable of capturing the flow
   dynamics accurately in the vicinity of the interface. Towards the
   purpose, we develop a Cartesian cut-cell method, referred to as the
   ghost-cell based cut-cell method (GC-CCM), in the context of fully
   compressible solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This method employs
   ghost-cells inside the solid interface such that the local spatial
   reconstruction remains consistent everywhere including in the vicinity
   of the boundary. In order to capture the near-wall flow behavior more
   accurately with coarse grids, this method decomposes cell faces of
   merged cells and computes fluxes through each decomposed segment
   separately. The objective of this work is to qualify whether the
   proposed method can accurately represent the high Reynolds number flows
   in the vicinity of immersed interfaces. To analyze the performance of
   the proposed method, we compare the results to the corresponding
   numerical results from the two other non-body conformal methods, namely
   the ghost-cell based immersed boundary method (GCIBM) and standard
   cut-cell method (S-CCM), that are implemented in the same numerical
   solver. The comparison demonstrates that the proposed method is capable
   of capturing near-wall flows relatively accurately with coarse grids.

Abstract = {{Growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNT) on nickel nanoparticles has
   been investigated using a multiscale modeling approach that integrates
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Kinetic Monte Carlo
   (KMC) simulations. The proposed elementary steps that control the
   catalytic CNT growth were first analyzed using DFT. The energetic
   results were then used to build an intrinsic kinetic database that was
   incorporated into a novel KMC framework that has been developed to
   overcome large disparities in time scales for this system. KMC
   simulations show that CNT growth is dominated by the surface diffusion
   of carbon species. Moreover, it was found that the surface diffusion of
   the small carbon cluster, e.g., trimer, is a critical step in the growth
   mechanism of the CNT since it prevents further nucleation of the C atoms
   on the catalyst surface, and therefore inhibits the deactivation of the
   catalyst. The CNT growth rates predicted by the KMC simulations agree
   reasonably well with experimental data, verifying the proposed CNT
   growth mechanism and KMC model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical model for better understanding of the
   functionality of a newly-proposed Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) diagnosis
   device. MH is a rare life-threatening condition that is usually
   triggered by exposure to certain drugs such as a volatile anesthetic
   agent, neuromuscular blocking agent, or succinylcholine. It is highly
   recommended to have this condition diagnosed immediately after its
   common symptoms appear. However, it is often only when the patient has
   had a severe or fatal reaction to anesthetic that a diagnosis is finally
   made. Due to this, many deaths have been reported before a patient has
   been diagnosed with this condition. Further for the diagnosis, the
   patients are subject to an expensive clinical diagnostic procedure and
   it is also necessary to continuously monitor the condition. In this
   study, a micro-total analysis system for MH diagnosis through the
   assessment of the end-tidal CO2 concentration level that can also aid
   point-of-care testing is presented. Various model parameters of the
   system are considered and their effects on the behaviour of the system
   are assessed. The results presented in this study are based on the
   proposed mathematical model for the new MH diagnosis device and can be
   used to evaluate the device's functionality and performance prior to its

Abstract = {{Long glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites (LGFPP) are widely
   used in the industrial field, especially in automotive applications, due
   to their excellent mechanical properties and low cost. This article
   focuses on obtaining optimal mechanical properties of LGFPP for

   the composite. The other objective is to obtain specific, desired
   properties of the composite (irrespective of the composite cost). The
   latter case is useful in designing products where quality of the
   composite cannot be compromised (while the cost of the composite is
   secondary). The properties that were optimized include tensile Young's
   modulus, flexural Young's modulus, and notched Izod impact. Surrogate
   models were obtained and used to predict these properties as functions
   of corresponding compositions of the composites. Furthermore,
   optimization framework that employs these models either as constraints
   or as objective functions was developed with the aim of developing
   tailored fiber-reinforced polypropylene. All simulations are programmed
   using MATLAB version 7.10.0 (R2010a).}},

Abstract = {{In high-fluence laser-induced incandescence (LII), current LII models
   significantly overpredict the soot nanoparticle temperature decay rate
   compared to that inferred from two-color pyrometry at the first 100 ns
   after the peak laser pulse in atmospheric pressure flames. One possible
   cause is the back flow of sublimed species, which to date has been
   neglected in LII modeling. In this study, the transient direct
   simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been used, for the first time,
   to calculate the temperature evolution of soot particles, taking into
   account recondensation of sublimed species. In this algorithm, the
   physical time is discretized into a number of time steps called ensemble
   time steps, and the heat flux is calculated by performing several DSMC
   runs in each ensemble time step before proceeding to the next ensemble
   time step until the variance reaches an acceptable value. This heat flux
   is then used to update the nanoparticle temperature over the ensemble
   time step. Using the new algorithm, the temperature evolution of the
   particle can be predicted by the DSMC code, which is an improvement to
   previous DSMC simulations in which predetermined temperature decay
   curves must be prescribed. The results show that recondensation of
   sublimed species on the originating nanoparticle is not significant.
   Although accounting for condensation of sublimed species originating
   from neighboring soot particles enhances the role of recondensation of
   sublimed species in slowing down the soot particle temperature decay, it
   is still not sufficient to be considered as a plausible cause for the
   discrepancy between modeled soot temperature and the two-color pyrometry
   measured one in high-fluence LII.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling partially shaded photovoltaic (PV) systems for online
   applications such as model-based MPPTs requires a PV circuit model with
   low computational time to simulate the large number of connected PV
   units within a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately, the accurate PV
   models available in the literature are complex and suffer from high
   computational time due to their dependence on a transcendental implicit
   equation. This paper proposes a photovoltaic circuit model featuring
   lower computational time and comparable accuracy. The model utilizes the
   accuracy of the practical PV model and reduces the computational time by
   replacing the model series resistance with a third-degree-polynomial
   voltage-dependent source. The proposed model mimics the accurate
   characteristics of the practical model without being dependent on a
   transcendental implicit equation, thus providing low computational time.
   The model also introduces a new parameter to enhance the model's
   accuracy at low irradiance. The effectiveness of the model is shown by
   comparing the computational time and accuracy of the proposed model with
   those of the available models. A case study of partially shaded PV
   systems shows that the percentage of reduction in computational time
   improves with increases in the number of PV units in a simulated PV
   system, providing a clear advantage when simulating large PV systems.}},

   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) angles is introduced in this study. The
   proposed retrofit method is relatively cheap and easy to use and does
   not require deck removal or any other severe modification to the steel
   girder. Fatigue tests were conducted on specimens designed to model the
   conditions in the region between a web stiffener and a flange in a steel
   girder bridge. Fatigue life increases on the order of several hundred
   percent were achieved by implementing the proposed retrofit. The effect
   of the retrofit on the hot-spot stress in the critical weld detail can
   be seen in the experimental strain data and in a subsequent
   finite-element (FE) analysis of the tested specimen geometry. Further
   research is recommended to assess the performance of the retrofit on
   full-scale girders and to develop guidelines for fatigue verification
   and design of the FRP angle and adhesive. However, the presented
   research shows the potential of the proposed retrofit and the
   suitability of the hot-spot stress method for predicting its
   effectiveness.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The importance of reliable estimates of travel demand for effective
   planning, design, and management of roads and facilities is well known
   by transportation engineers. A review of current short-term traffic
   monitoring practices shows that most transportation agencies simply use
   road functional class as the criteria to assign short-term traffic
   counts (STTCs) to permanent traffic counter (PTC) factor groups, or they
   commit significant resources to implement other data intensive methods,
   such as regression analysis. The improved methods described in this
   study estimate average annual daily traffic (AADT) with higher accuracy
   using all historical counts collected to date for a short-term counting
   site to create its seasonal traffic pattern and assign it to a PTC or a
   PTC group without imposing additional data collection cost. Two
   pattern-matching methods, and their combination with Bayesian
   statistics, are proposed and tested using PTC data from Alberta, and
   their results are compared to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
   method. Study results show that, compared to the FHWA method, the
   proposed methods reduce the 95th percentile of the absolute percent AADT
   estimation errors (P95) by 0.5 to 31.9 when applied to different testing
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Because different parts of the brain have rich interconnections, it is
   not possible to model small parts realistically in isolation. However,
   it is also impractical to simulate large neural systems in detail. This
   article outlines a new approach to multiscale modeling of neural systems
   that involves constructing efficient surrogate models of populations.
   Given a population of neuron models with correlated activity and with
   specific, nonrandom connections, a surrogate model is constructed in
   order to approximate the aggregate outputs of the population. The
   surrogate model requires less computation than the neural model, but it
   has a clear and specific relationship with the neural model. For
   example, approximate spike rasters for specific neurons can be derived
   from a simulation of the surrogate model. This article deals
   specifically with neural engineering framework (NEF) circuits of
   leaky-integrate-and-fire point neurons. Weighted sums of spikes are
   modeled by interpolating over latent variables in the population
   activity, and linear filters operate on gaussian random variables to
   approximate spike-related fluctuations. It is found that the surrogate
   models can often closely approximate network behavior with
   orders-of-magnitude reduction in computational demands, although there
   are certain systematic differences between the spiking and surrogate
   models. Since individual spikes are not modeled, some simulations can be
   performed with much longer steps sizes (e.g., 20 ms). Possible
   extensions to non-NEF networks and to more complex neuron models are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We have designed single-bit comparators and multibit flash
   analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) using three flavors of periodic
   comparators; one flavor uses a differential ``quasi-one-junction{''}
   SQUID (DQOS) comparator, the second use a differential SQUID wheel
   comparator (DSW) and the third uses a symmetric differential SQUID wheel
   comparator (SDSW) with time-interleaved clocks. We have also developed a
   new performance analysis scheme that enables full reconstruction of
   input signal using a single-bit comparator. The signal is reconstructed
   based on multiple beat frequency measurements that track the position of
   the comparator thresholds in response to a dc offset to the input
   signal. In addition, to eliminate the frequency dependent distortions
   resulting from impedance mismatches over wide bandwidths, the signal and
   clock distribution network have been optimized using EM simulations. For
   distributing the clock signal to the multi-bit comparators, a 50 Omega
   coplanar transmission line has been designed. Test results for a 1-bit
   DSW comparator demonstrates a performance of 4.5 bits of resolution in
   Gray code for a beat frequency test using a 20 GHz input signal and 5.3
   bits for 10 GHz input. 4 and 8-bit versions of the flash ADC with a DQOS
   comparator and a 3-bit time-interleaved ADC using the SDSW comparator
   have also been designed. The DQOS ADC has been tested up to 25 GHz input
   signal frequency with performance of 4.3 bits of resolution in Gray code
   for 19.7 GHz input signal. The time-interleaved ADC performance is 4.3
   bits for a 15 GHz beat frequency test with an effective sampling rate of
   30 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992, a non-interactive k-secure m-conference protocol based on an
   m-variate polynomial has been proposed. Each user needs to store a
   (m-1)-polynomial having degree k as a private share. A secret conference
   key involving m users can be computed by each conference member
   non-interactively using each private share. There is no overhead to
   exchange information in order to establish a conference key. However,
   the storage space of each user is exponentially proportional to the
   group size of the conference. In this paper, we propose a key
   establishment protocol using a multivariate polynomial in Z(N), where N
   is a RSA modulus. One unique feature of using this special type of
   polynomials for conference key protocol is that the storage space of
   each user is fixed and is independent to the group size of the
   conference. User can use their shares obtained from a key generation
   center initially to establish conference keys consisting of different
   users. Furthermore, we propose two applications to demonstrate the
   importance of using this special type of polynomials to design
   solutions. One is the private reconstruction of secret in a secret
   sharing scheme over network, and the other is the secure group

Abstract = {{The pore-level recovery mechanisms of the SA-SAGD process were recently
   studied for the first time in the literature in Porous Media Lab at the
   University of Waterloo using glass-etched micromodels. The experiments
   were conducted at controlled environmental conditions of an
   inverted-bell vacuum chamber to reduce the excessive heat loss to the
   surroundings. Different chemical additives (n-pentane and n-hexane) were
   added to steam prior to injecting into the models. An integrated data
   acquisition and control system was used to control, monitor and adjust
   the environmental vacuum pressure as well as to monitor and record local
   temperatures along the model's height and width. The pore-scale events
   were videotaped, and the captured snapshots were analysed thoroughly
   using image processing techniques. The pore-scale visualizations
   revealed that gravity drainage process takes place in the mobilized
   region, formed ahead of the pore-scale oil-vapour mixture interface in
   which all the flowing fluid phases are present. The interplay between
   gravity and capillary forces results in the drainage of the mobile oil
   with a reduced viscosity due to combined pore-level heat and mass
   transfer. Heat transfer at the pore level is believed to take place by
   conduction as well as convection. The solvent content of injected vapour
   mixture diffuses into the oil phase and hence reduces its viscosity
   following dilution as a result of molecular diffusion as well as
   convective mass transfer. Asphaltene precipitation was observed when the
   condensed solvent reached the bitumen interface. The average horizontal
   advancement velocity of the pore-scale SA-SAGD interface was measured
   and then correlated with operating temperature, macroscopic and
   pore-scale properties of porous media and bitumen properties within the
   range of experimental conditions. Quantitative analysis of the
   experimental results revealed that is a more effective steam additive
   compared with at similar operating conditions. Greater solvent content
   of the injecting vapour accelerates the pore-scale recovery by
   increasing the pore-scale interface advancement velocity. When all the
   other experimental variables were remained unchanged, smaller in situ
   oil viscosity values resulted in superior pore-scale production
   performance of the SA-SAGD process. The pore-level sweep rate was also
   found to be a function of the pore-scale dimensional characteristics of
   the porous media including pore-to-pore distance, pore body width, pore
   throat width and diffusion distance.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage reversal is a critical issue for serially stacking microbial
   fuel cells (MFCs). It occurs when current density in stacked MFCs
   increases over critical current density (j(critical)). In this study, we
   clearly show that no voltage reversal occurs in stacked MFCs if current
   density is maintained below j(critical) where the anode and the cathode
   potential in an inferior unit become identical, with an external
   resistance placed between individual MFCs. We define threshold
   resistance (R-threshold) that enables current density below j(critical)
   in stacked MFCs, and demonstrate the validity of R-threshold
   theoretically and experimentally. Voltage reversal is controlled in the
   stacked MFC equipped with R-threshold by which the current density in
   the stacked MFC is kept below j(critical). In comparison, a stacked MFC
   without R-threshold faces voltage reversal over j(critical). Energy loss
   in R-threshold is comparable to energy loss with other voltage control
   methods, such as passive or active methods. However, the R-threshold
   approach is a simple, inexpensive way of controlling voltage reversal,
   especially for small MFCs (<50 mL). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of electrostatic forces on the granular filtration of
   nanoaerosol NaCl particles in the range of 10 nm to 100 nm was
   investigated experimentally in this study. The test granular filters
   were made of 2 mm homogeneous glass beads at three media thicknesses
   (25,76 and 127 mm), and they were tested at three air flow rates (27,
   45, and 65 Ipm). The filtration efficiencies were measured for
   neutralized and charged NaCl nanoparticles. The corresponding difference
   was considered as the filtration efficiency attributed to the
   electrostatic attraction between the charged NaCl particles and the
   glass granules. Results showed that the electrostatics played a great
   role in nanoaerosol filtration, which is different from conventional
   filtration theories. Its contribution to filtration efficiency increased
   with the size of the nanoparticles to a level of 30\% or so. Results
   also showed a positive correlation between the separation efficiency due
   to electrostatic forces and the residence time of the air flow. The
   correlation is relatively strong (between 0.6 and 0.9) for particles in
   the range of 20-100 nm. However, it is weak, although positive, for
   sub-20 nm particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple protocol was used to prepare amine functionalized cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNC-NH2). In the first step, epichlorohydrin (EPH) was
   reacted with ammonium hydroxide to produce 2-hydroxy-3-chloro
   propylamine (HCPA). In the next step, HCPA was grafted to CNC using the
   etherification reaction in an organic solution media. Various reaction
   parameters, such as time, temperature, and reactant molar ratio were
   performed to determine the optimal reaction conditions. The final
   product (CNC-NH2(T)) was dialyzed for a week. Further purification via
   centrifugation yielded the sediment (CNC-NH2(P)) and supernatant
   (POLY-NH2). The presence of amine groups on the surface of modified CNC
   was confirmed by FTIR and the amine content was determined by
   potentiometric titration and elemental analysis. A high amine content of
   2.2 and 0.6 mmol amine/g was achieved for CNC-NH2(T) and CNC-NH2(P),
   respectively. Zeta potential measurements confirmed the charge reversal
   of amine CNC from positive to negative when the pH was increased from 3
   to 10. The flocculation of amine functionalized CNC due to its
   interactions with a negatively charged surfactant namely, sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS) was investigated at pH 4. It showed promising results for
   applications, such as in flocculation of fine dispersions in water
   treatment. This simple and versatile synthetic method to produce high
   amine content CNC can be used for further conjugation as required for
   various applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the purpose of fabricating polymer nanocomposite foams and
   preventing coalescence in foaming processes, the interfacial tension of
   poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-silica composites is investigated in this work.
   Synthesized silica nanoparticles (SNs) with a CO2-philic surface
   modification are used as the dispersed nanoparticles. Interfacial
   tension is a key parameter in processing of polymer foams since it
   directly affects the final foam properties, such as cell size and cell
   density. Interfacial tension of silica-containing PLA and supercritical
   carbon dioxide (CO,) is measured using axisymmetric drop shape analysis
   profile (ADSA-P) pendant drop method at high pressures and high
   temperatures. The interfacial tension between PLA and supercritical CO2
   is observed to decrease as a result of the nanoparticles' adsorption to
   the interface. These results indicate that the reduction in interfacial
   tension with increasing silica content significantly deviates from a
   linear trend; there is a minimum at 2 wt \% loading of the SNs and then
   the interfacial tension curve reaches a plateau. Contact angle
   measurements show an affinity of the SNs for the polymer-supercritical
   CO2 interface, and these obtained results are used to calculate the
   binding energy of the nanopartides to the PLA/CO2 interface. In addition
   to interfacial properties, the adsorption of silica nanopartides at the
   interface is also studied in detail with scanning electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer process of hydrogen during hydrogenation of
   diene-based latex nanoparticles remains as one of the most discussed and
   sought-after research topics particularly for potential commercial
   processes carried out in a semibatch reaction mode. In this research,
   in-house prepared nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) nanoparticle latices
   were prepared as the substrate for the subsequent hydrogenation
   experiments. The mass transfer pathway of hydrogen molecules in a gas
   (hydrogen)-liquid (water)-solid (polymer) three phase hydrogenation
   system under semibatch operation was examined, wherein the hydrogen
   transports from the bulk gas phase to an intermediate liquid phase, and
   then to the solid polymer phase. The mass transfer of hydrogen across
   the interfacial surfactant layer at the water/polymer interface was
   studied. A one-dimensional, moving boundary model was developed to
   describe the diffusion of hydrogen into the polymer nanoparticles by
   incorporating the level of bound hydrogen in the aqueous phase and the
   mass diffusivity of hydrogen in the polymer phase. Our results show that
   the mass transfer of hydrogen cannot account for the rate-determining
   step of NBR latex hydrogenation. This research report provides some
   further insight into the mass transfer of hydrogen during catalytic
   latex hydrogenation. (C) 2014 The Korean Society of Industrial and

Abstract = {{In hot forming die quenching, furnaces are used to austenitize ultra
   high strength steel blanks. In the case of coated steels, like Usibor
   (R) 1500 P, furnace heating also transforms a protective Al-Si layer
   into a permanent Al-Si-Fe coating. Modeling this process requires
   knowledge of how the sensible energy and latent heat of austenitization
   change with blank temperature; while the former is known, there is
   considerable uncertainty regarding the latter. In this work the
   effective specific heat of Usibor (R) 1500 P is inferred through inverse
   analysis of temperature data collected on coupons heated in a muffle
   furnace. This technique is first used to validate the heat transfer
   model, and then used to investigate austenitization at higher
   temperatures. Finally, the methodology is applied to analyze temperature
   data collected from an instrumented blank heated in a roller hearth

   limitations; for example, it is sensitive to noisy data, which may
   impede the generalization capability of the derived classifier and lead
   to overfitting problem. A selective boosting, sBoost, technique is
   proposed in this paper to tackle these problems. The proposed sBoost
   classifier focuses on the generalized classification performance rather
   than those hard-to-learn samples, and the penalties of hard-to-learn
   samples are mitigated to the degree associated with their noise level.
   An error correction method is suggested to detect potential clean
   samples and prevent them from misclassification to further alleviate the
   overfitting problem. The effectiveness of the developed sBoost technique
   is tested by a series of simulation tests. Test results show that the
   developed sBoost technique can improve the classification accuracy and
   prevent the overfitting problem effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present experiments on the dynamics of a two-state parametric
   fluctuator in a superconducting flux qubit. In spectroscopic
   measurements, the fluctuator manifests itself as a doublet line. When
   the qubit is excited in resonance with one of the two doublet lines, the
   correlation of readout results exhibits an exponential time decay which
   provides a measure of the fluctuator transition rate. The rate increases
   with temperature in the interval 40 to 158 mK. Based on the magnitude of
   the transition rate and the doublet line splitting, we conclude that the
   fluctuation is induced by quasiparticle tunneling. These results
   demonstrate the importance of considering quasiparticles as a source of
   decoherence in flux qubits.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the chloride penetration resistance of a
   silane-based sealer (SS1), an acrylic-based coating (AC1), and two
   cementitious coatings (CC1 and CC2) when applied on concrete surface.
   Concrete powder samples were collected from 15, 30 and 45 mm depths of
   sealer and coating treated concrete prism specimens, which were exposed
   to H2O and de-icing solutions of NaCl, Geomelt S30, MgCl2 and CaCl2 for
   100 freeze-thaw cycles followed by 25 wet-dry cycles. Chloride analysis
   was carried out to determine the total water-soluble chlorides of
   concrete. Test results revealed that the chloride penetration for
   exposure to the de-icing chemicals occurred at a depth of 15 mm from the
   concrete surface. The highest chloride penetration occurred for the
   non-treated concrete. The sealer `SS1' exhibited good performance except
   with exposure to NaCl solution. Among the three different coating
   products, the acrylic-based coating `AC1' was the best-performing
   coating, whereas the cementitious coating `CC1' had the worst
   performance. The amount of penetrated water-soluble chlorides was
   greater than the maximum recommended value of 0.025\% (by concrete
   weight) at 15 mm depth for the sealer `SS1' when exposed to NaCl
   de-icing solution, and for the coating `CC1' when exposed to NaCl, CaCl2
   and MgCl2 solutions.}},

Title = {{Catchment Legacies and Time Lags: A Parsimonious Watershed Model to
   Predict the Effects of Legacy Storage on Nitrogen Export}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Nutrient legacies in anthropogenic landscapes, accumulated over decades
   of fertilizer application, lead to time lags between implementation of
   conservation measures and improvements in water quality. Quantification
   of such time lags has remained difficult, however, due to an incomplete
   understanding of controls on nutrient depletion trajectories after
   changes in land-use or management practices. In this study, we have
   developed a parsimonious watershed model for quantifying catchment-scale
   time lags based on both soil nutrient accumulations (biogeochemical
   legacy) and groundwater travel time distributions (hydrologic legacy).
   The model accurately predicted the time lags observed in an Iowa
   watershed that had undergone a 41\% conversion of area from row crop to
   native prairie. We explored the time scales of change for stream
   nutrient concentrations as a function of both natural and anthropogenic
   controls, from topography to spatial patterns of land-use change. Our
   results demonstrate that the existence of biogeochemical nutrient
   legacies increases time lags beyond those due to hydrologic legacy
   alone. In addition, we show that the maximum concentration reduction
   benefits vary according to the spatial pattern of intervention, with
   preferential conversion of land parcels having the shortest
   catchment-scale travel times providing proportionally greater
   concentration reductions as well as faster response times. In contrast,
   a random pattern of conversion results in a 1: 1 relationship between
   percent land conversion and percent concentration reduction,
   irrespective of denitrification rates within the landscape. Our modeling
   framework allows for the quantification of tradeoffs between costs
   associated with implementation of conservation measures and the time
   needed to see the desired concentration reductions, making it of great
   value to decision makers regarding optimal implementation of watershed
   conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Lensfree on-chip microscopy is an emerging imaging technique that can be
   used to visualize and study biological specimens without the need for
   imaging lens systems. Important issues that can limit the performance of
   lensfree on-chip microscopy include interferometric aberrations,

   introduce a Bayesian-based method for performing aberration correction
   and numerical diffraction that accounts for all three of these issues to
   improve the effective numerical aperture (NA) and signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) of the reconstructed microscopic image. The proposed method was
   experimentally validated using the USAF resolution target as well as
   real waterborne Anabaena flos-aquae samples, demonstrating improvements
   in NA by similar to 25\% over the standard method, and improvements in
   SNR of 2.8 and 8.2 dB in the reconstructed image when compared to the
   reconstructed images produced using the standard method and a maximum

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1394}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{A thermo-responsive random copolymer, POEGMA (poly(oligoethylene glycol)
   methacrylate) grafted on cationized agarose adsorbent was used for size
   selective protein adsorption. The effects of OEGMA(300) ((oligoethylene
   glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, M-n = 300 g/mol) content and
   temperature on the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were
   evaluated. Increasing the content of OEGMA(300) resulted a reduction in
   BSA adsorption due to the enhanced shielding effect of OEGMA(300)
   chains. Grafting of POEGMA chains onto cationized agarose adsorbent
   reduced the BSA adsorption by more than 95\% at 26.5 degrees C which is
   below the LCST (lower critical solution temperatuie) of POEGMA. The BSA
   adsorption capacities for adsorbents grafted with 10 and 20 mol\% of
   OEGMA(300) decreased by 48\% and 46\% respectively at 38 degrees C, a
   temperature higher than their LCSTs. The temperature-dependent
   adsorption of BSA on the adsorbents was attributed to changes in the
   polymer conformation. The thermal transition of grafted POEGMA
   conformation exposed the ligand when the temperature was increased.
   Myoglobin (Myo), which was smaller than BSA, its adsorption behavior was
   less dependent on the polymer conformation. The adsorption of myoglobin
   onto the adsorbent with and without POEGMA showed similar percentage of
   reduction whereas the adsorption of BSA onto the adsorbent with POEGMA
   decreased by 7.6 times compared to the one without POEGMA. The packed
   bed of POEGMA grafted adsorbent was used for flow through separation of
   a protein mixture consisted of virus-like particle, Hepatitis B
   virus-like particle (HBVLP), BSA and insulin aspart. The recovery of
   HBVLP in 20 mol\% of OEGMA(300) grafted adsorbent was increased by 19\%
   compared to ungrafted adsorbent. The flow through of BSA can be reduced
   by increasing the operating temperature above LCST of 20 mol\% of
   OEGMA(300) while the smaller protein, insulin aspart, remained adsorbed
   onto the cationized surface. Hence, this thermo-responsive adsorbent has
   a potential for size-selective separation of protein especially for the
   recovery of large biomolecule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend the classic problem of finding the maximum
   weight Hamiltonian cycle in a graph to the case where the objective is a
   submodular function of the edges. We consider a greedy algorithm and a
   2-matching based algorithm, and we show that they have approximation
   factors of TIT, and max\{2/3(2+kappa), 2/3(1 - kappa)\} respectively,
   where kappa is the curvature of the submodular function. Both algorithms
   require a number of calls to the submodular function that is cubic to
   the number of vertices in the graph. We then present a method to solve a
   multi-objective optimization consisting of both additive edge costs and
   submodular edge rewards. We provide simulation results to empirically
   evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate an
   application in monitoring an environment using an autonomous mobile
   sensor, where the sensing reward is related to the entropy reduction of
   a given set of measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{63-75}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology to identify and diagnose
   intermittent stochastic faults occurring in a process. A generalized
   polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion representing the stochastic inputs is
   employed in combination with the nonlinear mechanistic model of the
   process to calculate the resulting statistical distribution of measured
   variables that are used for fault detection and classification. A
   Galerkin projection based stochastic finite difference analysis is
   utilized to transform the stochastic mechanistic equation into a coupled
   deterministic system of equations which is solved numerically to obtain
   the gPC expansion coefficients. To detect and recognize faults, the
   probability density functions (PDFs) and joint confidence regions (JCRs)
   of the measured variables to be used for fault detection are obtained by
   substituting samples from a random space into the gPC expansions. The
   method is applied to a two dimensional heat transfer problem with faults
   consisting of stochastic changes combined with step change variations in
   the thermal diffusivity and in a boundary condition. The proposed
   methodology is compared with a Monte Carlo (MC) simulations based
   approach to illustrate its advantages in terms of computational
   efficiency as well as accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Artificial muscles are soft actuators with the capability of either
   bending or contraction/elongation subjected to external stimulation.
   However, there are currently no artificial muscles that can accomplish
   these actions simultaneously. We found that the single layered, latticed
   microstructure of onion epidermal cells after acid treatment became
   elastic and could simultaneously stretch and bend when an electric field
   was applied. By modulating the magnitude of the voltage, the artificial
   muscle made of onion epidermal cells would deflect in opposing
   directions while either contracting or elongating. At voltages of 0-50
   V, the artificial muscle elongated and had a maximum deflection of -30
   mu m; at voltages of 50-1000 V, the artificial muscle contracted and
   deflected 1.0 mm. The maximum force response is 20 mu N at 1000 V. (c)

   therefore has absorbed an increasing attention of the researchers of

   intelligent methods can result in a very efficient tool suited for
   identifying the characteristics of coldstart phenomenon. To do so, a
   recent spotlighted natural-inspired optimiser called mutable smart bee
   algorithm is utilised to evolve a Gaussian generalised regression neural

Abstract = {{Side impact continues to be a significant source of vehicle occupant
   injuries and fatalities requiring an improved understanding of response
   sensitivity to occupant position and the potential for injury. The
   primary interaction between the occupant and vehicle in near-side impact
   is the intruding door and vehicle structure where contact with the
   intruding structures is observed to be the most frequent cause of
   injuries. Restraints and protective systems are tested for a specific
   driving position with a prescribed set of anthropometric test devices;
   however, studies have shown that the initial position and posture of the
   occupant within the vehicle may have an influence on occupant response.
   In this study, a finite-element human body model with a detailed
   representation of the thorax and an ES-2re anthropomorphic test device
   (ATD) model were integrated with a mid-sized sedan vehicle model to
   investigate occupant response from a moving deformable barrier side
   impact. All models were verified using established tests (pendulum, side
   sled) and physical test data available in the literature. A parametric
   study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of arm position and car door
   material properties on thoracic response, assessed using thoracic
   deflection and the viscous criterion. In the standard driving position,
   the human and ATD model responses were similar. The human body model
   demonstrated significant sensitivity, relative to the ATD, to different
   arm positions with a lesser sensitivity to the door interior properties.
   It was found that in side impact which has the characteristics of high
   energy and limited displacement, the arm aligned with the body can act
   as a significant source of load transmission to the thorax, increasing
   the potential for injury. This study demonstrates that the choice of
   occupant model, injury metric and occupant arm position plays an
   important role in evaluating side impact safety.}},

Abstract = {{High purity phenol crystal was recovered from dilute aqueous solution
   via a novel pervaporationcrystallization coupling (PVCC) system, which
   used a two-stage condenser to collect the permeate. The First stage was
   used as a crystallizer of phenol and the second stage was to collect
   remaining permeate that was not trapped in the first stage. Due to the
   low equilibrium pressure of phenol in the crystallizer operated at low
   temperatures (e.g., -9 degrees C) and excellent membrane permselectivity
   for phenol, a large proportion of phenol vapor leaving from membrane
   surface was condensed as high purity phenol crystals in the first
   condenser (crystallizer). The crystallization mechanism of phenol under
   vacuum condition was discussed. Phenol crystals were obtained when the
   temperature of the crystallizer was maintained in the range of -7 to 19
   degrees C. Phenol crystals at a purity of 99.8\% were recovered in the
   crystallizer cooled at -9 degrees C under a permeate pressure of 280 Pa,
   and the quantity of phenol collected as crystals accounted for
   75.9-96.1\% of the total amount of phenol permeated through the membrane
   for a broad feed concentration range of 220-10,100 ppm at an operating
   temperature of 80 degrees C. Phase equilibrium analysis revealed that
   water vapor would also be precipitated when the temperature was below a
   certain point at a given pressure. Thus, the crystallizer should be
   operated at an appropriate temperature in order to prevent water
   condensation in the phenol crystallizer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study is to evaluate the applicability of a
   new partially premixed combustion model, Doubly Conditional Source-term
   Estimation (DCSE), applied to a series of lifted jet flames using
   Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) calculations. The partially
   premixed implementation involves double conditioning on two variables,
   mixture fraction and progress variable. The present work represents the
   first application of DCSE for lifted turbulent flames. Conditionally
   averaged chemical source terms are closed by conditional averaged
   scalars which are obtained by inverting an integral equation. Three
   different jet conditions are simulated, over a range of Reynolds number
   between 7,000 and 19.500. Two-equation k-epsilon turbulence model is
   used to solve the flow field. The predicted mean centerline and radial
   profiles of methane concentration are in good agreement with the
   experimental values. The present DCSE calculations are successful in
   predicting the lift-off heights and reproducing many aspects of the
   flame structure in agreement with the experimental observations. The
   stabilization point is located on the fuel lean side, the mixture
   fraction isolines are deflected around the flame base, significant
   entrainment of air by the fuel jet upstream of the flame stabilization
   point is observed and the calculated flame width becomes larger with
   increasing Reynolds number. Some discussion is given related to triple
   flames. Future work is suggested related to the scalar dissipation rate
   modelling and DCSE implementation in Large Eddy Simulation (LES). (C)

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{The simulated outcome of a calibrated hydrologic model should be
   hydrologically consistent with the measured response data. Hydrologic
   modelers typically calibrate models to optimize residual-based
   goodness-of-fit measures, e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency measure,
   and then evaluate the obtained results with respect to hydrological
   signatures, e.g., the flow duration curve indices. The literature
   indicates that the consideration of a large number of hydrologic
   signatures has not been addressed in a full multiobjective optimization
   context. This research develops a model calibration methodology to
   achieve hydrological consistency using goodness-of-fit measures, many
   hydrological signatures, as well as a level of acceptability for each
   signature. The proposed framework relies on a scoring method that
   transforms any hydrological signature to a calibration objective. These
   scores are used to develop the hydrological consistency metric, which is
   maximized to obtain hydrologically consistent parameter sets during
   calibration. This consistency metric is implemented in different
   signature-based calibration formulations that adapt the sampling
   according to hydrologic signature values. These formulations are
   compared with the traditional formulations found in the literature for
   seven case studies. The results reveal that Pareto dominance-based
   multiobjective optimization yields the highest level of consistency
   among all formulations. Furthermore, it is found that the choice of
   optimization algorithms does not affect the findings of this research.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges for widespread penetration of plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles (PHEVs) is their impact on the electricity grid. The
   energy sector must anticipate and prepare for this extra demand and
   implement long-term planning for electricity production. In this paper,
   the additional electricity demand on the Ontario electricity grid from
   charging PHEVs is incorporated into an electricity production planning
   model. A case study pertaining to Ontario energy planning is considered
   to optimize the value of the cost of the electricity over sixteen years
   (2014-2030). The objective function consists of the fuel costs, fixed
   and variable operating and maintenance costs, capital costs for new
   power plants, and the retrofit costs of existing power plants. Five
   different case studies are performed with different PHEVs penetration
   rates, types of new power plants, and CO2 emission constraints. Among
   all the cases studied, the one requiring the most new capacity, (similar
   to 8748 MW), is assuming the base case with 6\% reduction in CO2 in year
   2018 and high PHEV penetration. The next highest one is the base case,
   plus considering doubled NG prices, PHEV medium penetration rate and no
   CO2 emissions reduction target with an increase of 34.78\% in the total
   installed capacity in 2030. Furthermore, optimization results indicate
   that by not utilizing coal power stations the CO2 emissions are the
   lowest: similar to 500 tonnes compared to similar to 900 tonnes when
   coal is permitted.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the reported effectiveness of analytical algorithms in facility
   layout planning, a detailed literature survey suggests a lack of new
   analytical methods in recent years. This paper focuses on open space
   facilities layout planning that involves modules with constant aspect
   ratios. We propose a construction-cum-improvement algorithm involving a
   novel combination of a boundary search-based heuristic placement and
   steepest descent-based analytical improvement. In the construction
   phase, the algorithm places a new module at the optimal location on the
   boundary of a previously constructed cluster of modules. In the
   improvement phase, the algorithm alternates between boundary search and
   steepest descent moves until it converges to a local optimum.
   Experiments with well-known test problems indicate that the proposed
   algorithm produced solutions superior both to published results and to
   those produced by VIP-PLANOPT, a popular, oft-cited and commercially
   available layout planning and optimisation software.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a real-life experiment implementing an artificial

   However, as demonstrated in this work, implementing artificial
   intelligence to classify cracked from non-cracked surfaces has
   appreciable impacts in terms of sensing sensitivity, cost, and
   automation. Furthermore, applying artificial intelligence for
   post-processing the data collected from microwave sensors is a
   cornerstone for handheld test equipment that can outperform rack

Abstract = {{Contact resistance measurement configurations for the evaluation of ball
   bond reliability on thin metallizations are studied. Samples with
   symmetrical and asymmetrical four-wire probe configurations are analyzed
   and compared with a calibrated finite-element model. It is found that
   the measured contact resistance strongly depends on the geometric
   placement of the probe wires, and the value closest to the true value is
   obtained from a probe placement that is opposite and away from
   high-current-density regions on the metallization. Probes should also be
   placed as close as possible to the contact interface. Sheet resistance
   components contributed by intermediate thin metallizations are of the
   same order of magnitude as the unaged reported R-C. Therefore, they are
   considered. Symmetrical current distributions yield a more homogeneous
   potential drop across the bond interface being probed, but also capture
   a larger component of metallization sheet resistance. Experimental
   samples were aged, and the contact resistance increase was measured. The
   impacts of various probe placements on the sensed R-C were studied.}},

Abstract = {{A supported immobilized lipase was investigated as a suitable
   biocatalyst for the transesterification of triolein to methyl oleate in
   a packed bed reactor (PBR). The packing material for the bioreactor was
   comprised of lipase immobilized in sol gel and supported on Celite
   (CSG). A kinetic- and mass transfer-based model was developed,
   incorporating a novel efficiency correlation to account for the effect
   of glycerol on the immobilized enzyme. Comparing the CSG PBR performance
   to that using a commercial lipase preparation (Novozym 435 (N435)),
   higher product conversion was achievable using CSG over a shorter time
   period, indicating the superior performance of CSG for enzymatic
   transesterification. A rate equation accounting for alcohol inhibition
   was used to compare the kinetics of the CSG and N435 PBRs. It was found
   that CSG exhibited a higher maximum reaction rate and was less prone to
   inhibition by methanol relative to N435. The resulting model showed good
   agreement with the experimental data, and CSG exhibited good stability
   without loss of activity over a five day period. This biocatalyst shows
   significant potential for the efficient production of biodiesel, and the
   mechanistic model developed has broader applications for similar enzyme
   and reaction systems.}},

Abstract = {{Although motion analysis is frequently employed in upper limb motor
   assessment (e.g. visually-guided reaching), they are resource-intensive
   and limited to laboratory settings. This study evaluated the reliability
   and accuracy of a new markerless motion capture device, the Leap Motion
   controller, to measure finger position. Testing conditions that
   influence reliability and agreement between the Leap and a
   research-grade motion capture system were examined. Nine healthy young
   adults pointed to 15 targets on a computer screen under two conditions:
   (1) touching the target (touch) and (2) 4 cm away from the target
   (no-touch). Leap data was compared to an Optotrak marker attached to the
   index finger. Across all trials, root mean square (RMS) error of the
   Leap system was 17.30 +/- 9.56 mm (mean +/- SD), sampled at 65.47 +/-
   21.53 Hz. The \% viable trials and mean sampling rate were significantly
   lower in the touch condition (44\% versus 64\%, p < 0.001; 52.02 +/-
   2.93 versus 73.98 +/- 4.48 Hz, p = 0.003). While linear correlations
   were high (horizontal: r(2) = 0.995, vertical r(2) = 0.945), the limits
   of agreement were large (horizontal: -22.02 to +26.80 mm, vertical:
   -29.41 to +30.14 mm). While not as precise as more sophisticated optical
   motion capture systems, the Leap Motion controller is sufficiently
   reliable for measuring motor performance in pointing tasks that do not
   require high positional accuracy (e.g. reaction time, Fitt's, trails,
   bimanual coordination).}},

Abstract = {{Generation 6.0 polyamidoamine (G6 PAMAM) dendrimer-grafted cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNCs) (CNC-PAMAM) were synthesized and employed as

   dendrimers was confirmed by conductometric-potentiometric titration and
   pH-dependent zeta-potential analyses. Gold nanoparticles with diameters
   of approximately 2 to 4 nm were synthesized with the PAMAM dendrimers
   playing the role of nanoreactors and NaBH4 as the reducing agent. More
   importantly, gold nanoparticles were successfully prepared at pH 3.3

   Temperature and the concentration of CNC-PAMAM had an impact on the
   resulting size of gold nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles immobilized
   on CNC-PAMAM displayed superior catalytic properties toward the
   reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The enhanced catalytic
   behavior may be attributed to the improved dispersity and accessibility

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of mobile devices and emerging data-hungry
   applications, mobile data has been increasing dramatically. To
   accommodate massive mobile data, the cellular network has been straining
   to meet the need due to the scarcity of spectrum. As a promising
   technology, cognitive radio can be leveraged by the cellular network to
   harvest spectrum holes on demand. By employing cognitive radio, the
   cellular network becomes a cognitive cellular network. In this article,
   we first provide an overview of the cognitive cellular network,
   including the network architecture and main applications. Then existing
   spectrum harvesting approaches are reviewed, and the limitations are
   identified. To better explore spectrum access opportunities, three types
   of cooperation-based approaches are introduced for different scenarios,
   based on which an integrated cooperative framework is devised to fully
   harvest spectrum holes. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed cooperative approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time path planning can efficiently relieve traffic congestion in
   urban scenarios. However, how to design an efficient path-planning
   algorithm to achieve a globally optimal vehicle-traffic control still
   remains a challenging problem, particularly when we take drivers'
   individual preferences into consideration. In this paper, we first
   establish a hybrid intelligent transportation system (ITS), i.e., a
   hybrid-VANET-enhanced ITS, which utilizes both vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs) and cellular systems of the public transportation system to
   enable real-time communications among vehicles, roadside units (RSUs),
   and a vehicle-traffic server in an efficient way. Then, we propose a
   real-time path-planning algorithm, which not only improves the overall
   spatial utilization of a road network but reduces average vehicle travel
   cost for avoiding vehicles from getting stuck in congestion as well. A
   stochastic Lyapunov optimization technique is exploited to address the
   globally optimal path-planning problem. Finally, the transmission delay
   of the hybrid-VANET-enhanced ITS is evaluated in VISSIM to show the
   timeliness of the proposed communication framework. Moreover,
   system-level simulations conducted in Java demonstrate that the proposed
   path-planning algorithm outperforms the traditional distributed path
   planning in terms of balancing the spatial utilization and drivers'
   travel cost.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of using 3D point clouds obtained with the aid of a handheld 3D
   laser scanner for the quality assurance of high-frequency mechanical
   impact (HFMI) treatment is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. The
   effectiveness of impact treatments for extending the fatigue lives of
   welded structures has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Guidelines
   for the proper execution of impact treatments have been developed. A
   lack of suitable quality assurance (QA) procedures for accepting or
   rejecting the treatment after completion has been previously identified.
   In contrast with the existing QA procedures, which are based mainly on
   controlling inputs and visual inspection, a technology-based,
   quantitative methodology is developed in this paper. Five welded
   specimens were subjected to impact treatment at various levels to
   simulate under-, proper, and over-treatment. A handheld 3D laser scanner
   was then used to facilitate a point cloud-based method to determine the
   geometric parameters of the treated weld toe groove, which were then
   measured manually. The results show that the proposed methodology is
   successful in identifying the different treatment levels. This approach
   has a number of advantages over the existing QA methods, including the
   following: providing quantitative measures, ease of use, and
   archive-ability.}},

Abstract = {{The low-temperature bonding process using metal nanoparticles has
   attracted considerable attention due to its potential applications
   including electronic packaging. However, the fundamental understanding
   of this advanced bonding technology is still limited. In this study, Ag
   nanoparticle paste used as a bonding material is prepared by the
   chemical reduction method. The sintering behaviors of Ag nanoparticles
   during the bonding process were investigated using the classical
   sphere-to-sphere approach. At low sintering temperatures (160-250
   degrees C), the calculated mechanism-characteristic exponent n is 7.9,
   which indicates that surface diffusion is the dominant diffusion
   mechanism. With the increase of temperatures (300-350 degrees C),
   mechanism-characteristic exponent n changes to 3.75. This indicates that
   volume diffusion is probably the prevailing diffusion mechanism at this
   stage. Based on the classical sphere-to-sphere model, the relationship
   between the joint strength evolution and neck growth of Ag particles is
   revealed. It is found that the joint strength is proportional to square
   of neck size ratio (x/r)(2) of sintered Ag particles.}},

Abstract = {{A promising, recently explored, alternative to ultra-high b-value
   diffusion weighted imaging (UHB-DWI) is apparent ultra-high b-value
   diffusion-weighted image reconstruction (AUHB-DWR), where a
   computational model is used to assist in the reconstruction of apparent
   DW images at ultra-high b-values. Firstly, we present a novel approach
   to AUHB-DWR that aims to improve image quality. We formulate the
   reconstruction of an apparent DW image as a hidden conditional random
   field (HCRF) in which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden
   states in this random field. The second contribution of this paper is a
   new generation of fully connected conditional random fields, called the
   hidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (HSFCRF)
   that allows for efficient inference with significantly reduced
   computational complexity via stochastic clique structures. The proposed
   AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF, are evaluated quantitatively in
   nine different patient cases using Fisher's criteria, probability of
   error, and coefficient of variation metrics to validate its
   effectiveness for the purpose of improving intensity delineation between
   expert identified suspected cancerous and healthy tissue within the
   prostate gland. The proposed methods are also examined using a prostate
   phantom, where the apparent ultra-high b-value DW images reconstructed
   using the tested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured
   UHB-DWI. The results illustrate that the proposed AUHB-DWR methods has
   improved reconstruction quality and improved intensity delineation
   compared with existing AUHB-DWR approaches.}},

   Industry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Labor performance drives construction project performance. Labor
   performance can be improved by increasing the direct-work rate, which is
   the time spent by workers on installing materials and equipment.
   However, setting baseline rates for direct-work rate and determining
   expectation levels during the construction phase requires further
   investigation. The focus of the research reported in this paper is to
   establish a methodology for setting a desirable and realistic baseline
   rate based on activity analysis, primarily for industrial projects.
   First, an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based method was
   developed as a means of estimating baseline rates based on existing
   knowledge. The method was trained using 272 data points. Its flexibility
   and functionality validate its usefulness; however, three additional
   methods of defining baseline rates were also developed based on simpler
   concepts and demonstrated with data points available from 14 projects,
   and the experience associated with these projects. As a result,
   comprehensive methods and a valuable initial dataset for industrial
   construction projects to better establish baseline rates for direct work
   and supporting activities were contributed. This should help project
   managers to estimate appropriate baselines and set realistic goals for
   direct-work rate which ultimately may lead to improvement of labor
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A graft copolymerization model for using cumene
   hydroperoxide/tetraethylenepentamine (CHPO/TEPA) as a redox initiator
   was developed to describe the grafting of methyl methacrylate onto
   natural rubber latex as a core-shell particle. The model allows
   estimating the effects of the initiator concentration, monomer-rubber
   weight ratio, and temperature on the properties of graft product, e.g.,
   \% grafting efficiency and the \% monomer composition in the graft
   copolymer and free polymer. The rate expressions of polymer chain
   formation are developed by taking into account a reduction of CHPO by
   TEPA and a population event of radicals between core/shell phases. The
   parameter estimation is performed to find the kinetic parameters.
   Validation with experimental results demonstrates a good applicability
   of the proposed model. The model results reveal that the formation of
   grafted polymer chains rather form by the chain transfer reaction to
   rubber chains from homopolymer radicals and the initiation reaction of
   cumyloxy radicals to rubber chains.}},

Abstract = {{Flow focusing generators have been widely used to generate droplets for
   many applications which call for accurate physical models that describe
   the droplet formation process in such configurations for design and
   operation purposes. Most existing models are empirical correlations
   obtained based on extensive experimental results and thus very sensitive
   to their own data sets. A comprehensive model that involves less
   parameter fitting by incorporating more theoretical arguments and thus
   has an improved applicability is urgently needed to guide the design and
   operation of flow focusing generators. This work presents a 3D physical
   model describing the droplet formation process in microfluidic flow
   focusing generators that operate in the squeezing regime where droplet
   size is usually larger than the channel width. This model incorporates
   an accurate geometric description of the 3D droplet shape during the
   formation process, an estimation of the time period for the formation
   cycle based on the conservation of mass and a semi-analytical model
   predicting the pressure drop over the 3D corner gutter between the
   droplet curvature and channel walls, which allow an accurate
   determination of the droplet size, spacing and formation frequency. The
   model considers the influences of channel geometry (height-to-width
   ratio), viscosity contrast, flow rate ratio and capillary number with a
   wide variety. This model is validated by comparing predictions from the
   model with experimental results obtained through high-speed imaging.}},

Abstract = {{A novel and simple method of determining both the critical micelle
   concentration (CMC) and polarities of ionic surfactants at the same time
   is presented in this paper. This method is based on the dependence of
   electrical potential at the liquid-air interface on the aggregation of
   the surfactant. When the measuring electrode contacts the liquid-air
   interface, the difference between the electrical potential of the
   electrode surface and the electrical potential of the liquid-air
   interface generates an electrical current through an electrical circuit.
   The dependences of the magnitudes of the measured signals on the
   concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate and hexadecyltrimethylammonium
   bromide were measured. The results show that the magnitude of the
   measured signal increases with the increasing surfactant concentration
   before it reaches to the CMC. The signal magnitude remains constant
   after the CMC. The value of CMC can be determined from the intersection
   point of the two lines before and after CMC. The CMC values calculated
   with this method are in good agreement with those reported in the
   reference papers. The experimental results also show that the directions
   of the signals generated by anionic and cationic surfactants are in
   opposite direction, which can be used to determine the polarities of the
   surfactants. The method described in this paper provides a simple and
   reliable tool to determine the CMC value and the polarity of ionic
   surfactants.}},

Abstract = {{Fire fighting is an extremely physiologically and psychologically
   demanding occupation, requiring tremendous resources for training
   personnel as well as incurring significant workplace safety and
   insurance board (WSIB) costs. Approximately 33\% of fire fighter
   injuries result from exposure to fire leading to the possibility of
   reducing these injuries through training fire fighters to make better
   decisions, particularly when under stress. Simulation (and virtual
   simulation in particular) offers a safe and cost-effective alternative
   to practice with real fire, offering entry level training to aid fire
   fighters to reach a specific competency level. With the ubiquity of
   video game play and advent of new consumer-level physical interfaces for
   video games (e.g., the Nintendo Wii Fit balance-board and the Microsoft
   Kinect), serious games (games whose primary purpose is education and
   training), are able to provide users with innovative interactive
   techniques that are highly engaging and immersive. This paper reviews
   the development of serious games and virtual simulation applications
   that may be utilized for training in the fire service. Current
   technology allows for the simulation of fire spread and smoke movement
   along with training certain fire fighting skills and incident command
   co-ordination. To date, gaming technology is not capable of providing a
   real world scenario that is completely and faithfully accurate in a
   dynamic virtual environment. Future work could utilize serious games to
   also recreate the decision making processes and the physical
   requirements that fire fighters encounter in an emergency situation.
   These could be incorporated into a simulation environment where the
   physical and psychological stresses are analogous to live fire fighting
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{As the main basic building blocks of the interference networks, in this
   paper the broadcast channel, the classical interference channel (CIC),
   and the cognitive radio channel (CRC) are considered. New capacity outer
   bounds are established for these channels. These outer bounds are all
   derived based on a novel unified framework. Using the derived outer
   bounds, some new capacity results are proved for the CIC and the CRC; a
   mixed interference regime is identified for the two-user CIC, where
   decoding interference at one receiver and treating interference as noise
   at the other one is sum-rate optimal. In addition, a noisy interference
   regime is derived for the one-sided CIC. Our new capacity theorems for
   the CIC contain the previously obtained results regarding the Gaussian
   channel as special cases. For the CRC, a full characterization of the
   capacity region for a class of more-capable channels is derived.
   Moreover, it is shown that the derived outer bounds are useful to study
   channels with one-sided receiver side information wherein one of the
   receivers has access to the nonintended message; capacity bounds are
   also discussed in details for such scenarios. Our results lead to new
   insights regarding the nature of information flow in the basic
   interference networks.}},

Title = {{Numerical Methods to Calculate Fuzzy Boundaries for Brownfield
   Redevelopment Negotiations}},
Journal = {{GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{515-536}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A numerical method is proposed to represent the likelihood of
   contamination of a brownfield using fuzzy boundaries, and then to
   estimate the parameters in a fuzzy real options model for brownfield
   evaluation from different decision maker perspectives. These different
   values can be used to facilitate negotiations on redevelopment projects.
   Linguistic quantifiers and ordered weighted averaging (OWA) techniques
   are utilized to determine the pollution likelihood at sample locations
   based on multiple environmental indicators. Risk preferences of decision
   makers are expressed as different ``orness{''} levels of OWA operators,
   which affect likelihood estimates. When the fuzzy boundary of a
   brownfield is generated by interpolation of sample points, the
   parameters of fuzzy real options, drift rate and volatility, can be
   calculated as fuzzy numbers. Hence, this proposed method can act as an
   intermediate between decision makers and the fuzzy real options models,
   making this model much easier to apply. A potential negotiation support
   system (NSS) implementing these numerical methods is discussed in the
   context of negotiating brownfield redevelopment projects. A
   public-private-partnership will be enhanced through information sharing,
   scenario generation, and conflict analysis provided by the NSS,
   encouraging more efficient brownfield redevelopment and leading to
   greater regional sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{To avoid inconvenient vehicle stops at charging stations, on-road
   wireless charging of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising application
   in the future smart grid. In this paper, we study a critical yet open
   problem for this application, i.e., the impact of wireless charging and
   mobility of EVs on the wholesale electricity market based on locational
   marginal price (LMP), which is mainly determined by the EV mobility
   patterns. To capture the dynamics in vehicle traffic flow and state of
   charge of EV batteries, we model the EV mobility as a queuing network
   based on the statistics obtained via traffic information systems. Then,
   the load on each power system bus with respect to EV wireless charging
   is obtained using the stationary distribution of the queuing network. An
   economic dispatch problem is formulated to incorporate the EV wireless
   charging demand, and the LMP of each power system bus is obtained.
   Furthermore, a pricing mechanism based on the LMP variations of power
   system buses is investigated to enhance the social welfare. The
   performance of our proposed analytical model is verified by a realistic
   road traffic simulator (SUMO) based on a 3-bus test system and an IEEE
   30-bus test system, respectively. Simulation results indicate that our
   proposed analytical model can accurately provide an estimation of the
   LMP variations due to EV wireless charging.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We address a problem of stochastic optimal control drawn from the area
   of mathematical finance. The goal is to minimize the expected value of a
   general quadratic loss function of the wealth at close of trade when
   there is a specified convex constraint on the portfolio over the trading
   interval, together with a specified almost-sure lower-bound on the
   wealth at close of trade. We use a variational approach of Rockafellar
   which leads naturally to an appropriate vector space of dual variables,
   a dual functional on the space of dual variables such that the dual
   problem of maximizing the dual functional is guaranteed to have a
   solution (i.e. a Lagrange multiplier) when a simple and natural Slater
   condition holds for the terminal wealth constraint, and obtain necessary
   and sufficient conditions for optimality of a candidate wealth process.
   The dual variables are pairs, each comprising an Ito process paired with
   a member of the adjoint of the space of essentially bounded random
   variables measurable with respect to the event sigma-algebra at close of
   trade. The necessary and sufficient conditions are used to construct an
   optimal portfolio in terms of the Lagrange multiplier. The dual problem
   simplifies to maximization of a concave function over the real line when
   the portfolio is unconstrained but the terminal wealth constraint is
   maintained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a systematic methodology and corresponding tools
   to support the decision-making process for the integration of various
   improvement options, including new technologies, into existing mature
   processes. The proposed methodology was applied on a case study focusing
   on planning the capacity supply to meet the projected electricity demand
   for the fleet of electric generating stations owned and operated by
   Ontario Power Generation (OPG). A deterministic mixed integer linear
   program with a goal to minimize total annualized costs while satisfying
   various CO2 emission constraints was developed. The results show that
   achieving the CO2 emission mitigation goal while minimizing costs
   affects the configuration of the OPG fleet in terms of generation mix,
   capacity, selection of new technologies and optimal configuration with
   and without new technologies. By using new technologies including
   integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and natural gas combined
   cycle (NGCC) with and without carbon capture and sequestration, the
   optimum electricity cost obtained was 1.1661 c/KW h at base caseload

Title = {{Surface Reconstruction in Gradient-Field Domain Using Compressed Sensing}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{1628-1638}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Surface reconstruction from measurements of spatial gradient is an
   important computer vision problem with applications in photometric
   stereo and shape-from-shading. In the case of morphologically complex
   surfaces observed in the presence of shadowing and transparency
   artifacts, a relatively large dense gradient measurements may be
   required for accurate surface reconstruction. Consequently, due to
   hardware limitations of image acquisition devices, situations are
   possible in which the available sampling density might not be
   sufficiently high to allow for recovery of essential surface details. In
   this paper, the above problem is resolved by means of derivative
   compressed sensing (DCS). DCS can be viewed as a modification of the
   classical CS, which is particularly suited for reconstructions involving
   image/surface gradients. In DCS, a standard CS setting is augmented
   through incorporation of additional constraints arising from some
   intrinsic properties of potential vector fields. We demonstrate that
   using DCS results in reduction in the number of measurements as compared
   with the standard (dense) sampling, while producing estimates of higher
   accuracy and smaller variability as compared with CS-based estimates.
   The results of this study are further supported by a series of numerical
   experiments.}},

Volume = {{514}},
Pages = {{202-210}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The removal of estrogenicity in a University of Cape Town-biological
   nutrient removal (UCT-BNR) wastewater treatment process was investigated
   using pilot and bench scale systems, batch experiments and mathematical
   modeling. In the pilot BNR process, 96 +/- 5\% of the estrogenicity
   exerted by the influent wastewater was removed by the treatment process.
   The degradation efficiencies in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones
   of the pilot BNR bioreactor were 11 +/- 9\%, 18 +/- 2\% and 93 +/- 10\%,
   respectively. In order to further understand the performance of the BNR
   process in the removal of estrogenicity from wastewater, a bench scale
   BNR process was operated with synthetic wastewater dosed with E1 and E2.
   The removal of estrogenicity in the bench scale system (95 +/- 5\%) was
   comparable to the pilot BNR process and the degradation efficiencies
   were estimated to be 8 +/- 0.8\%, 38 +/- 4\% and 85 +/- 22\% in the
   anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones, respectively. A biotransformation
   model developed to predict the fate of El and E2 in batch tests using
   the sludge from the BNR process was calibrated using the data from the
   experiments. The biotransformation rate constants for the transformation
   of E2 to El were estimated as 71 +/- 15, 31 +/- 3.3 and 1 +/- 0.9 L g
   COD-1 d(-1) for the aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic batch tests,
   respectively, while the corresponding biotransformation rate constants
   for the transformation of El were estimated to be 73 +/- 1.0, 3 +/- 2.0,
   and 0.85 +/- 0.6 L.g COD-1 d(-1). A steady state mass balance model
   formulated to describe the interactions between E2 and El in BNR

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is employed to reduce the
   order of small-scale automotive multibody systems. The reduction
   procedure is demonstrated using three models of increasing complexity: a
   simplified dynamic vehicle model with a fully independent suspension, a
   kinematic model of a single double-wishbone suspension, and a
   high-fidelity dynamic vehicle model with double-wishbone and
   trailing-arm suspensions. These three models were chosen to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the POD given systems of ordinary differential
   equations (ODEs), algebraic equations (AEs), and differential-algebraic
   equations (DAEs), respectively. These models are also components of more
   complicated full vehicle models used for design, control, and
   optimization purposes, which often involve real-time simulation. The
   governing kinematic and dynamic equations are generated symbolically and
   solved numerically. Snapshot data to construct the reduced subspace are
   obtained from simulations of the original nonlinear systems. The
   performance of the reduction scheme is evaluated based on both accuracy
   and computational efficiency. Good agreement is observed between the
   simulation results from the original models and reduced-order models,
   but the latter simulate substantially faster. Finally, a robustness
   study is conducted to explore the behavior of a reduced-order system as
   its input signal deviates from the reference input that was used to
   construct the reduced subspace.}},

Title = {{An evaluation of classifier-specific filter measure performance for

Abstract = {{Feature selection is an important part of classifier design. There are
   many possible methods for searching and evaluating feature subsets, but
   little consensus on which methods are best. This paper examines a number
   of filter-based feature subset evaluation measures with the goal of
   assessing their performance with respect to specific classifiers.
   This work tests 16 common filter measures for use with K-nearest
   neighbors and support vector machine classifiers. The measures are
   tested on 20 real and 20 artificial data sets, which are designed to
   probe for specific challenges. The strengths and weaknesses of each
   measure are discussed with respect to the specific challenges and
   correlation with classifier accuracy. The results highlight several
   challenging problems with a number of common filter measures.
   The results indicate that the best filter measure is
   classifier-specific. K-nearest neighbors classifiers work well with
   subset-based RELIEF, correlation feature selection or conditional mutual
   information maximization, whereas Fisher's interclass separability
   criterion and conditional mutual information maximization work better
   for support vector machines. Despite the large number and variety of
   feature selection measures proposed in the literature, no single measure
   is guaranteed to outperform the others, even within a single classifier,
   and the overall performance of a feature selection method cannot be
   characterized independently of the subsequent classifier. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The present work is dedicated to analyze the flow and heat transport of
   ferrofluids along a flat plate subjected to uniform heat flux and slip
   velocity. A magnetic field is applied in the transverse direction to the
   plate. Moreover, three different kinds of magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4,
   CoFe2O4, Mn-ZnFe2O4) are incorporated within the base fluid. We have
   considered two different kinds of base fluids (kerosene and water)
   having poor thermal conductivity as compared to solid magnetic
   nanoparticles. Self-similar solutions are obtained and are compared with
   the available data for special cases. A simulation is performed for each
   ferrofluid mixture by considering the dominant effects of slip and
   uniform heat flux. It is found that the present results are in an
   excellent agreement with the existing literature. The variation of skin
   friction and heat transfer is also performed at the surface of the plate
   and then the better heat transfer and of each mixture is analyzed.
   Kerosene-based magnetite Fe3O4 provides the higher heat transfer rate at
   the wall as compared to the kerosene-based cobalt ferrite and Mn-Zn
   ferrite. It is also concluded that the primary effect of the magnetic
   field is to accelerate the dimensionless velocity and to reduce the
   dimensionless surface temperature as compared to the hydrodynamic case,
   thereby increasing the skin friction and the heat transfer rate of
   ferrofluids.}},

Abstract = {{Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is used to evaluate the excess free

   this first study of its kind, we focus on the boundaries separating the
   short- and long-period lamellar phases that form in mixtures of small
   and large symmetric diblock copolymers of polymerizations N-s and N-l,
   respectively, when Ns << Nl. According to strong-segregation theory
   (SST), the tension is minimized when both sets of lamellae orient
   parallel to the boundary, but experiments {[}Hashimoto, , Macromolecules
   1994, 27, 1562] tend to observe kink boundaries instead, where the
   domains of one lamellar phase evolve continuously into those of the
   other lamellar phase. Our more refined SCFT calculations, on the other
   hand, do predict a lower tension for the kink boundary consistent with
   the experimental observations. For completeness, we also examine the
   boundaries that form when the short-period lamellar phase disorders, and
   again the SCFT results are in agreement with experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Head injury resulting from blast loading, including mild traumatic brain
   injury, has been identified as an important blast-related injury in
   modern conflict zones. A study was undertaken to investigate potential
   protective ballistic helmet liner materials to mitigate primary blast
   injury using a detailed sagittal plane head finite element model,
   developed and validated against previous studies of head kinematics
   resulting from blast exposure. Five measures reflecting the potential
   for brain injury that were investigated included intracranial pressure,
   brain tissue strain, head acceleration (linear and rotational) and the
   head injury criterion. In simulations, these measures provided
   consistent predictions for typical blast loading scenarios. Considering
   mitigation, various characteristics of foam material response were
   investigated and a factor analysis was performed which showed that the
   four most significant were the interaction effects between modulus and
   hysteretic response, stress-strain response, damping factor and density.
   Candidate materials were then identified using the predicted optimal
   material values. Polymeric foam was found to meet the density and
   modulus requirements; however, for all significant parameters, higher
   strength foams, such as aluminum foam, were found to provide the highest
   reduction in the potential for injury when compared against the
   unprotected head.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a study of the effect of process uncertainty on
   the optimal design of a CO2 capture pilot-scale plant for coal-based
   power plants. The presented Work employed a novel method in the Optimal
   design of large-scale chemical processes (such as the CO2-capture plant)
   under uncertainty, which uses a power series expansion (PSE)
   approximation to the actual nonlinear process in computing the output
   distribution of the process constraints due to uncertainty. A
   ranking-based approach is employed here where priorities Or
   probabilities of satisfaction are assigned to the process constraints
   considered in the analysis. In this work, uncertainty is assumed in
   three input variables affecting the operation of a CO2-capture pilot
   plant, namely, the CO2 content and the temperature and flow rate of the
   flue gas stream. The design of the optimal plant aims to specify the
   sizes of the key process units included in the CO2-capture pilot plant,
   such as the packed column height and diameters and heat exchanger and
   condenser areas, that minimize the process economics in the presence of
   uncertainty in the flue-gas stream conditions. The results of the study
   using the proposed method show that, to ensure a desired target CO2
   removal rate in the presence of process uncertainties in the flue gas
   stream, larger designs for both the absorber and stripper towers and a
   higher reboiler heat duty are required. Although the present method
   yields larger and, thus, more expensive designs, it ensures that the
   environmental and operating constraints are satisfied according to the
   user-defined probability of satisfaction, whereas the original
   pilot-plant base-case design violates the target for the CO2 removal
   rate most of the time when operating under uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{A two-phase flow eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) model is
   presented to analyse the injection and sequestration of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) in deep saline aquifers. XFEM is introduced to accurately
   approximate near-injection well pressure behaviour with elements
   significantly larger than the injection well diameter. We present a
   vertically averaged multiphase flow model that combines XFEM to
   approximate the pressure field, with a Streamline Upwind/Finite Element
   Method/Finite Difference Method (SU-FEM-FDM) to approximate the
   distribution of CO2 in the aquifer. Near-well enrichment functions are
   presented along with the solution procedure for the coupled problem. Two
   examples are presented: in the first, CO2 injection into a perfectly
   horizontal aquifer is modelled with both XFEM and FEM-based methods. The
   results suggest that XFEM is able to provide low relative errors in the
   pressure near the well at a reduced computational cost compared with
   FEM. The impact and selection of the stabilization coefficient of the
   SU-FEM-FDM is also discussed. In the second example, the XFEM and
   SU-FEM-FDM model is applied to a more realistic problem of an inclined
   aquifer to demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the
   buoyancy-driven migration of CO2 in a deep saline aquifer. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The present work investigates strengthening mechanisms and mechanical
   assessment of Ti/Al2O3 nano-composites produced by friction stir
   processing of commercially pure titanium using nano-sized Al2O3 with
   different volume fractions and particle sizes. Microstructural analyses
   were conducted to characterize the grain size of matrix, size and
   dispersion of reinforcing particles. The mean grain size of the
   composites ranged from similar to 0.7 to 1.1 mu m that is much lower
   than 28 mu m of the as-received material. Reduction of grain size was
   found to be in agreement with Rios approach (based on energy dissipated
   during the motion of an interface through particle dispersion), and
   showed deviation from Zener pinning model. Scanning and transmission
   electron microscopies revealed a near uniform dispersion of Al2O3
   nano-particles, with only a small fraction of widely spaced clusters.
   The maximum compression yield strength of the fabricated nano-composite
   (Ti/3.9\%vol of 20 nm-Al2O3) was found to be similar to 494 MPa that is
   similar to 1.5 times higher than that of the as-received material.
   Strengthening analyses based on grain refining (Hall-Petch approach),
   load transfer from matrix to reinforcements, Orowan looping, and
   enhanced dislocation density due to thermal mismatch effects were
   carried out considering Al2O3 reinforcement with different volume
   fractions and sizes. However, Hall-Petch approach was found to be the
   dominant mechanism for the enhancement of yield strength. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Isooctane is a valuable octane enhancer for gasoline and the primary
   component of aviation gasoline, also known as Avgas, because of its high
   antiknock quality. Conventional industrial processes for isooctane
   production involve the steps of dimerization of isobutene, dimer
   separation, and hydrogenation. The efficacy of catalytic distillation
   (CD) and its merits, in terms of energy savings and reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions, for the production of isooctane are
   quantitatively presented. The feed considered for the isooctane
   production is composed of isobutene (C-4) and inerts (isopentane)
   produced in refineries as byproducts of steam cracking of naphtha and
   light gas oil. Process flow sheets for the two routes for the production
   of isooctane, with and without CD, are modeled. The conventional
   industrial flow sheet composed of a dimerization reactor, distillation
   column, and a hydrogenation reactor (configuration A), is simulated
   using Aspen Plus. The intensified process flow sheet comprising a CD
   column for the dimerization, hydrogenation, and separation
   (configuration B) is modeled using gPROMS. A validated, nonequilibrium,
   three-phase model is developed in a gPROMS environment and is used to
   quantify the energy savings and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions
   achieved using a CD column for the intensified process. Results
   demonstrate CD to be a promising candidate to replicate the conversions
   and product purity obtained in the conventional process while resulting
   in significant energy savings, more efficient utilization of isobutene
   feed, and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was covalently bound onto the surface of
   polyurethane (PU) sponge using two different coupling agents:
   (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and
   titanium(IV)(triethanolaminato)isopropoxide. The coupling agents were
   introduced before and after reduction of graphene oxide to compare the
   impact of the sequence on the absorbance capacities. The sponges were
   evaluated based on hydrophobicity and pump oil absorbance capacities.
   The structure and properties of the sponges were evaluated using
   scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Results revealed that reacting the graphene oxide PU
   sponge with the coupling agent
   titanium(IV)(triethanolaminato)isopropoxide prior to reduction
   significantly improved oil absorbance. This was due to the improved
   binding of reduced graphene oxide to the polyurethane framework. The
   resulting improved rGO-coated PU sponge is a highly efficient and
   reusable sorbent material and is a promising alternative for oilwater
   separation applications.}},

Abstract = {{Using a passive sampler, the results of the analyses of water soluble
   ions (Na+, Cl-, K+, NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg2+) in Abali,
   Firouzkouh and Varamin stations were registered. Dry deposition fluxes
   of water soluble ions were collected weekly for 14 months (Oct. 2010 to
   Dec. 2011). The results showed that the weekly dry deposition mass
   fluxes ranged from 16.48 to 922.68 mg m(-2) day(-1), with annual average
   deposition of 15937, 124.46 and 237.09 in mg m(-2) day(-1) in Abali,
   Firouzkouh and Varamin, respectively. In Abali, Na+, SO42- and NO3- the
   dominant ionic species were Na+, SO42- and NO3-, SO42-, Ca2+ and NO3-
   and SO42- Na+ and Ca2+, accounting for 28\%, 23\% and 17\%, 36\%, 25\%
   and 18\% and 30\%, 20\% and 19\% of the total mass of ions, in Abali,
   Firouzkouh and Varamin, respectively. Dry deposition flux of major ions
   was higher during the dust storm and other weather phenomena. Air mass
   back trajectories calculated for all three sampling sites on October
   2011 (when there was pollution), revealed four sectors of air mass
   origin: NW to N of Siberia/Russia and Caspian Sea, local, Middle East
   and W to SW of Oman Sea. Seasonal variation of total ion flux was
   significant, with the highest depositions observed in winter 2011,
   autumn 2010 and autumn 2011 and the lowest depositions in spring 2011,
   spring 2011 and autumn 2010 in Abali, Firouzkouh and Varamin,
   respectively. These major ions were mainly in the form of Ca(NO3)(2),
   CaSO4, CaCl2, and NaCl. Firouzkouh had the lowest NO3-/SO42- flux value
   among the two other sampling sites, indicating that the stationary
   source of the air pollution was the more dominant one. Stationary
   emissions were still the dominant source in all three sampling sites
   demonstrated by the NO3-/SO42- ratio being lower than one. NO3-, SO42-
   and NH4+ were primarily affected by anthropogenic emissions, while SO42-
   might have been partially influenced by the sea. Na+ and K+ were derived
   from both soil crust and marine sources, but Ca2+ was mainly coming from
   the soil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents numerical simulations of punching shear in a
   reinforced concrete slab-column configuration formerly tested in the
   laboratory. A brief description of the test program at the University of
   Waterloo is reported. For the simulation, a symmetric quarter of the
   test configuration is employed. Full three-dimensional finite element
   discretized geometry is considered together with elastic-plastic
   reinforcement embedded as truss elements in concrete. Two regularized
   numerical models of concrete, formulated within elastic-plastic-damage
   theories, are applied. The first one, called gradient damage, is refined
   by an additional averaging equation where gradient enhancement involves
   an internal length scale. In the second one, called rate-dependent
   damaged plasticity model, a viscoplastic strain rate is introduced. The
   results for the first model implemented in FEAP and the second model
   from ABAQUS are discussed in detail. Different issues of numerical
   simulation to properly predict punching shear behaviour in the
   slab-column configuration are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The influence of Ni/Nd-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst on microstructure
   configurations and properties of butadiene rubber}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Neodymium (Nd)-based ZieglerNatta catalyst has been well known for
   preparing polybutadiene rubber (BR) containing high, about 98\%, cis-1,4
   configuration with extremely low gel content providing superior
   resistance to low-temperature fatigue and abrasion. However, its cost is
   more expensive than a conventional nickel (Ni)-based catalyst. The Nd-BR
   has poor processability with high cold flow due to its high linearity
   and molecular weight. To compare with a traditional process, the BR
   produced by Ni-based catalyst has higher level of branching resulting in
   the better processability, but it contains medium amount of gel. To
   balance the catalyst cost and the BR properties, this article reported
   the influence of a solution containing Ni- and Nd-based ZieglerNatta
   catalyst (Ni/Nd) using diethyl aluminum chloride and triethyl aluminum
   as co-catalysts on 1,3-butadiene (BD) conversion and physical properties
   of the elastomeric materials based on obtained rubber (Ni/Nd-BR). In the
   presence of toluene, the increase in the Ni/Nd molar ratio from 0.0/1.0
   to 0.4/0.6 yielded Ni/Nd-BR containing cis-1,4 units of 95\%96\% with
   significantly decreasing both levels of vinyl-1,2 and trans-1,4
   configurations from 0.26\% to 0.13\% and 4.44\% to 3.07\%, respectively.
   When cyclohexane was applied as the reaction media, 100\% BD conversion
   was achieved and the Ni/Nd-BR had very low content of vinyl-1,2 unit
   (0.07\%). The mechanical properties in terms of tensile properties and
   abrasion resistance of the elastomer based on Ni/Nd-BR having high
   cis-1,4 and relatively higher trans-1,4 configurations were superior to
   elastomers based on commercial BRs produced by using Ni- and Nd-based
   catalyst systems. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design of a metamaterial medium for electromagnetic
   energy harvesting based on the full absorption concept. A metamaterial
   slab was designed comprising 13 x 13 electrically small cells, each
   loaded with an 82 Omega resistor which mimics the input impedance of a
   rectification circuitry. Unlike earlier designs of metamaterial
   absorbers, here the power absorption is mostly dissipated across a
   resistive load instead of the dielectric substrate. This implies that
   effective electromagnetic energy harvesting can be achieved. The power
   is channeled through a via connected to each cell. For a design

Title = {{Biphasic monopolar electrical stimulation induces rapid and directed
   galvanotaxis in adult subependymal neural precursors}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Following injury such as stroke, adult mammalian
   subependymal neural precursor cells (NPCs) are induced to proliferate
   and migrate toward the lesion site where they differentiate into neural
   cells, albeit with limited efficacy. We are interested in enhancing this
   migratory ability of NPCs with the long-term goal of promoting neural
   repair. Herein we build on our previous studies demonstrating that
   direct current electric fields (DCEFs) promote rapid and
   cathode-directed migration of undifferentiated adult NPCs (but not
   differentiated phenotypes) - a phenomenon known as galvanotaxis. While
   galvanotaxis represents a promising strategy to promote NPC recruitment
   to lesion sites, stimulation of neural tissue with DCEFs is not a
   clinically-viable strategy due to the associated accumulation of charge
   and toxic byproducts. Balanced biphasic waveforms prevent the
   accumulation of charge and thus are outside of the limitations of DCEFs.
   In this study, we investigated the effects of balanced biphasic
   electrical stimulation on the migratory behaviour of undifferentiated
   subependymal NPCs and their differentiated progeny.
   Methods: NPCs were isolated from the subependymal zone of adult mouse
   brains and cultured in a NPC colony-forming assay to form neurospheres.
   Neurospheres were plated onto galvanotaxis chambers in conditions that
   either promoted maintenance in an undifferentiated state or promoted
   differentiation into mature phenotypes. Chambers containing cells were
   then time-lapse imaged in the presence of either biphasic monopolar, or
   biphasic bipolar electrical stimulation, or in the complete absence of
   electrical stimulation. Single cell migration was subsequently tracked
   and the cells' magnitude of velocity, directedness and tortuosity were
   quantified.
   Results: We demonstrate, for the first time, the use of balanced
   biphasic electric fields to induce galvanotaxis of NPCs.
   Undifferentiated adult mouse subependymal NPCs exposed to biphasic
   monopolar stimulation undergo rapid and directed migration toward the
   cathode. In contrast, both biphasic bipolar stimulation and the lack of
   electrical stimulation produced non-directed migration of NPCs. Notably,
   NPCs induced to differentiate into mature phenotypes prior to exposure
   to electrical stimulation do not migrate in the presence or absence of
   biphasic stimulation.
   Conclusion: We purport that balanced biphasic stimulation represents a
   clinically-viable technique for mobilizing NPCs that may be integrated
   into strategies for promoting endogenous neurorepair.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper is focused on investigating a Jacobian-free
   Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method to obtain a fully implicit solution for
   two-phase flows. In the JFNK formulation, the Jacobian matrix is not
   directly evaluated, potentially leading to major computational savings
   compared with a simple Newton's solver. The objectives of the present
   paper are as follows: (i) application of the JFNK method to two-fluid
   models; (ii) investigation of the advantages and disadvantages of the
   fully implicit JFNK method compared with commonly used explicit
   formulations and implicit Newton-Krylov calculations using the
   determination of the Jacobian matrix; and (iii) comparison of the
   numerical predictions with those obtained by the Canadian Algorithm for
   Thermaulhydraulics Network Analysis 4. Two well-known benchmarks are
   considered, the water faucet and the oscillating manometer.An isentropic
   two-fluid model is selected. Time discretization is performed using a
   backward Euler scheme. A Crank-Nicolson scheme is also implemented to
   check the effect of temporal discretization on the predictions.
   Advection Upstream Splitting Method+ is applied to the convective
   fluxes. The source terms are discretized using a central differencing
   scheme. One explicit and two implicit formulations, one with Newton's
   solver with the Jacobian matrix and one with JFNK, are implemented. A
   detailed grid and model parameter sensitivity analysis is performed.For
   both cases, the JFNK predictions are in good agreement with the
   analytical solutions and explicit profiles. Further, stable results can
   be achieved using high CFL numbers up to 200 with a suitable choice of
   JFNK parameters. The computational time is significantly reduced by JFNK
   compared with the calculations requiring the determination of the
   Jacobian matrix. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we report a numerical and experimental study of
   turbulent dispersion of a passive scalar released from a continuous
   ground-level point source in a staggered array of 16x16 cubical

   fluorescence (for concentration) and laser Doppler velocimetry (for
   velocity). Numerical simulations of the flow and scalar fields for this
   experimental configuration were performed using two in-house computer
   codes based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method.
   Results of a detailed comparison between water-channel measurements and
   model predictions of the mean flow, turbulence kinetic energy, mean
   concentration, and concentration variance are presented. An advanced

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to develop a model of the water uptake by
   yellow peas during the steeping step of a malting process to serve for
   the selection of most appropriate time-temperature conditions. Two
   empirical (Peleg and lag phase equations) and three mechanistic models
   (Fick law analytical solution with and without consideration of the
   surface resistance to mass transfer and a comprehensive model coupling
   mass transfer and mechanical deformation) were developed. The coupled
   mass transfer and mechanical deformation model (RMSE = 0.025, R-2 =
   0.98), the Peleg equation (RMSE = 0.025, R-2 = 0.97) and Fick law
   analytical solution with consideration of the surface resistance to mass
   transfer (RMSE = 0.026, R-2 = 0.97) provided the best description of the
   water uptake of peas measured at five temperatures. The coupled mass
   transfer and mechanical deformation model provided accurate estimate of
   the volume of peas at saturation. A sensitivity analysis indicated that
   the mechanical deformation has negligible effect on the water absorption
   while the most important model components for appropriate estimation of
   the water content of peas during steeping were the rate constant for the
   Peleg equation and the surface mass transfer coefficient for the
   mechanistic models. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{We show that metallic wires embedded in narrow waveguide bends and
   channels demonstrate resonance behavior at specific frequencies. The
   electromagnetic energy at these resonances tunnels through the narrow
   waveguide channels with almost no propagation losses. Under the
   tunneling behavior, high-intensity electromagnetic fields are produced
   in the vicinity of the metallic wires. These intense field resonances
   can be exploited to build highly sensitive dielectric sensors. The
   sensor operation is explained with the help of full-wave simulations. A
   practical setup consisting of a 3D waveguide bend is presented to
   experimentally observe the tunneling phenomenon. The tunneling frequency
   is predicted by determining the input impedance minima through a
   variational formula based on the Green function of a probe-excited
   parallel plate waveguide.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements Traceability (RT) links help developers during program
   comprehension and maintenance tasks. However, creating RT links is a
   laborious and resource-consuming task. Information Retrieval (IR)
   techniques are useful to automatically create traceability links.
   However, IR-based techniques typically have low accuracy (precision,
   recall, or both) and thus, creating RT links remains a human intensive
   process. We conjecture that understanding how developers verify RT links
   could help improve the accuracy of IR-based RT techniques to create RT
   links. Consequently, we perform an empirical study consisting of four
   case studies. First, we use an eye-tracking system to capture
   developers' eye movements while they verify RT links. We analyse the
   obtained data to identify and rank developers' preferred types of Source
   Code Entities (SCEs), e.g., domain vs. implementation-level source code
   terms and class names vs. method names. Second, we perform another
   eye-tracking case study to confirm that it is the semantic content of
   the developers' preferred types of SCEs and not their locations that
   attract developers' attention and help them in their task to verify RT
   links. Third, we propose an improved term weighting scheme, i.e.,
   Developers Preferred Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (D P T F
   / I D F), that uses the knowledge of the developers' preferred types of
   SCEs to give more importance to these SCEs into the term weighting
   scheme. We integrate thisweighting scheme with an IR technique, i.e.,
   Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), to create a new technique to RT link
   recovery. Using three systems (iTrust, Lucene, and Pooka), we show that
   the proposed technique statistically improves the accuracy of the
   recovered RT links over a technique based on LSI and the usual Term
   Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (T F / I D F) weighting scheme.
   Finally, we compare the newly proposed D P T F / I D F with our original
   Domain Or Implementation/Inverse Document Frequency (D O I / I D F)
   weighting scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Endocrine disruption and high occurrences of intersex have been observed
   in wild fish associated with municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
   effluents in urbanized reaches of rivers around the globe. These
   reproductive effects have often been attributed to the presence of
   estrogen receptor agonists in effluents. However, recent studies have
   isolated a number of androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogens) that
   may also contribute to the endocrine disruption observed at sites that
   are influenced by WWTP outfalls. This study aimed to characterize the
   spatial and temporal distribution of anti-androgenic personal care
   products (triclosan, chlorophene, dichlorophene, oxybenzone, 1-naphthol,
   and 2-naphthol), along with a herbicide (atrazine) and representative
   pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, and venlafaxine) in
   the Grand River watershed in southern Ontario. Surface water sampling of
   30 sites associated with six municipal WWTP outfalls was conducted
   during a summer low flow. Monthly samples were also collected
   immediately upstream and downstream of a major WWTP from August to
   November 2012.
   Atrazine was consistently found in all surface water sampling locations.
   Many of the target pharmaceuticals and triclosan were detected in WWTP
   effluents, especially those that did not nitrify. Under low flow
   conditions, the concentrations of triclosan and several pharmaceuticals
   increased directly downstream of the WWTPs then decreased rapidly with
   distance downstream. Chlorophene was either found at trace levels or
   below detection limits in the effluents while dichlorophene, oxybenzone,
   1-naphthol, and 2-naphthol were not detected in any samples. Chlorophene
   was detected in surface water during the low flow summer period and once
   during the monthly sampling from August to November. However, the
   primary source of chlorophene did not appear to be associated with WWTP
   effluent. This study documents the spatial and temporal occurrence of
   several antiandrogens and pharmaceuticals in a highly impacted Canadian
   watershed. It supports previous observations that there is a diversity
   of contaminants in wastewater effluents and other sources that have the
   potential to alter endocrine function in wild fish. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Convolutional lattice codes, also known as signal codes, have been
   proposed as a technique to generate structured codes that have good
   performance. While in principle optimal decoding can be achieved using
   the Viterbi Algorithm, in practice due to Tomlinson-Harashima precoding,
   the size of the state space is too large, and one must resort to
   suboptimal techniques such as sequential decoding. In this paper, we
   take an alternate approach. By employing a judicious selection of tap
   coefficients and in combination with precoding, we show that the state
   space can be constrained to a relatively small set such that Viterbi
   decoding is practical. The performance of such codes still exhibits a
   large gap to capacity, and we further propose a parallel concatenation
   similar to that of turbo codes, resulting in a ``turbo signal code.{''}
   Due to the relatively small state space, iterative decoding based on the
   BCJR algorithm is now possible. The gaps between the SNR for a frame
   error rate of 1\% and the optimal performance theoretically achievable
   for a code of the same rate over an AWGN channel are found by simulation
   to be within 0.75-0.85 dB with a block length of 8192.}},

Abstract = {{Timing jitter in OFDM systems results in non-ideal sampling and
   pulse-shaped transmission times and thus, is an important limiting
   factor for practical OFDM systems. In this paper, the effect of sampling
   jitter on the spectrum of a transmitted OFDM signal is considered. This
   effect in particular can lead to a significant degradation in the
   performance of spectral shaping techniques in OFDM, e.g., out-of-band
   radiation reduction techniques, that are mostly based on the assumption
   of ideal sampling times and accurate synchronization. In this work, we
   first evaluate the effect of random sampling time jitter on the
   performance of the active interference cancellation (AIC) technique, a
   well-known out-of-band radiation reduction technique for OFDM. Then,
   using a minimax approach, we propose a robust scheme that takes the
   jitter effect into consideration and therefore, makes the sidelobe
   suppression technique robust against worst-case random jitter. Numerical
   simulations show a performance improvement of almost 3 dB in
   interference reduction for our proposed robust scheme in the presence of
   timing jitter.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, energy efficient uplink communications are investigated
   for battery-constrained mobile terminals (MTs) with service quality
   requirements and multi-homing capabilities. A heterogeneous wireless
   medium is considered, where MTs communicate with base stations (BSs) and
   access points (APs) of different networks with overlapped coverage.
   Different from the existing works, we develop a quality of service
   (QoS)-based optimization framework for joint uplink bandwidth and power
   allocation to maximize energy efficiency for a set of MTs with
   multi-homing capabilities. The proposed framework is implemented in a
   decentralized architecture, through coordination among BSs/APs of
   different networks and MTs, which is a desirable feature when different
   networks are operated by different service providers. A suboptimal
   framework is presented with a reduced computational complexity as
   compared with the optimal framework. Simulation results demonstrate the
   improved performance of both the optimal and suboptimal frameworks over
   a state-of-the-art benchmark.}},

Abstract = {{Warm forming has some important advantages, the most significant being
   that forming limit strains increase at elevated temperatures. To
   quantify this advantage for an AA3003 brazing sheet, forming limit
   diagrams were determined using warm tooling developed to perform
   limiting dome height (LDH) experiments together with a digital image
   correlation (DIC) system used to perform in situ strain measurement.
   Forming limit curves (FLCs) were developed at several temperature levels
   and strain-rates. The formability experiments demonstrated that while
   temperature has a significant effect on formability, forming speed has a
   mild effect within the studied range. Elevating the temperature to 250
   degrees C improved the formability more than 200\% compared to room
   temperature forming while forming at lower speeds increased the limiting
   strains by 10\% and 17\% at room temperature and 250 degrees C,
   respectively. A comparison between FLDs developed using DIC methods
   versus circle grid (CG) analysis showed good agreement between the two
   methods; however, the degree of scatter in the CG method increased
   significantly for the higher temperature tests.}},

Abstract = {{Latency and image blurring are major limitations of machine vision
   processes, which often require every target object to pause for a moment
   for capturing and processing a still image. When a large number of
   objects are to be inspected, such a stop-and-go approach may
   significantly degrade the test efficiency due to a long inspection time.
   This paper investigates the performance and error analysis of dynamic
   imaging approach where the image is captured and processed on-the-fly
   while the target object is still moving. Taking images of a moving
   object can substantially enhance the inspection speed but intensifies
   latency and image blurring. To overcome these issues, firstly, we
   implement the controlled trigger, i.e., to operate the machine vision in
   synchrony with the position sensing while the target object is moving
   Then, we attempt to restore the blurred pixel data through advanced
   image restoration techniques. The main ideas are applied to a
   semiconductor test process called the probe card analysis and its
   performance is experimentally verified.}},

Abstract = {{As technology scaling increases embedded static random access memory
   bit-cell density, the number of soft errors due to radiation-induced
   multiple-bit upsets (MBUs) also increases. Traditionally, these errors
   have been addressed using a simple error correction code (ECC) combined
   with word interleaving. With continued scaling, however, errors beyond
   this setup begin to emerge. Although more powerful ECCs exist, they come
   at an increased overhead in terms of area and latency. Additionally,
   interleaving adds complexity to the system and may not always be
   feasible for the given architecture. In this brief, a set of double
   adjacent error correction (DAEC) codes is modified to provide triple
   adjacent error correction for a cost of zero additional check-bits over
   the code's DAEC equivalent, yielding a 2.25x reduction in bit-level soft
   error rate for a 22-nm MBU error channel model. MATLAB simulation and
   HDL synthesis results are included for standard 16- and 32-data-bit
   memory word sizes and compared against existing codes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the network throughput and energy
   sustainability of green-energy-powered maritime wireless communication
   networks. Specifically, we study how to optimize the schedule of data
   traffic tasks to maximize the network throughput with Worldwide
   Interoperability for Microwave Access technology. To this end, we
   formulate it as an optimization problem to maximize the weight of the
   total delivered data packets, while ensuring that harvested energy can
   successfully support transmission tasks. The formulated energy and
   content-aware vessel throughput maximize problem is proved to be
   NP-complete. We propose a green energy and content-aware data
   transmission framework that incorporates the energy limitation of both
   infostations and delay-tolerant network throw boxes. The green energy
   buffer is modeled as a G/G/1 queue, and two heuristic algorithms are
   designed to optimize the transmission throughput and energy
   sustainability. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed
   algorithms can provide simple yet efficient solutions in a maritime
   wireless communication network with sustainable energy.}},

Abstract = {{Bus rapid transit system is designed to provide high-quality and
   cost-efficient passenger transportation services. In order to achieve
   this design objective, effective scheduling strategies are required.
   This research aims at improving the operation efficiency and service
   quality of a BRT system through integrated optimization of its service
   headways and stop-skipping strategy. Based on cost analysis for both
   passengers and operation agencies, an optimization model is established.
   A genetic algorithms based algorithm and an application-oriented
   solution method are developed. Beijing BRT Line 2 has been chosen as a
   case study, and the effectiveness of the optimal headways with
   stop-skipping services under different demand levels has been analyzed.
   The results has shown that, at a certain demand level, the proposed
   operating strategy can be most advantageous for passengers with an
   accepted increase of operating costs, under which the optimum headway is
   between 3.5 and 5.5min for stop-skipping services during the morning
   peak hour depending on the demand with the provision of stop-skipping
   services. The effectiveness of the optimal headways with stop-skipping
   services is compared with those of existing headways and optimal
   headways without stop-skipping services. The results show that operating
   strategies under the optimal headways with stop-skipping services
   outperforms the other two operating strategies with respect to total
   costs and in-vehicle time for passengers. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley

   the energy convergence of an electrically thin flat lens and reflector
   when illuminated by a plane wave with specific polarization. The
   advantages of these models are twofold: first, prediction of the
   performance of electrically thin flat lenses and reflectors can be made
   significantly faster than full-wave simulators, and second, providing
   insight on the performance of these electrically thin devices. The
   analytic models were validated by comparison with full-wave simulation
   for several interesting examples. The validation results show that the

   accurately predicted through a design that assumes low coupling between

Abstract = {{Acrylamide (AAm)/acrylic acid (AAc) copolymer application performance is
   tied to copolymer properties, which in turn are related to the kinetics
   of the copolymerization. A systematic study has been conducted to
   investigate the effect of reaction factors such as total monomer
   concentration and solution pH on polymerization kinetics and copolymer
   microstructure. To study the effect of these factors, reliable
   reactivity ratios were estimated first. The trends in copolymer
   composition, molecular weight, sequence length distribution, and triad
   fractions were subsequently examined. Having a better understanding of
   kinetic profiles is needed in order to manipulate influential factors
   for tailoring AAm/AAc copolymer properties for the desired application.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystal grafted with chitosan oligosaccharide (CNC-CSOS)
   was used to encapsulate vitamin C and prepare CNCS/VC complexes using
   tripolyphosphte via ionic complexation. The stability of vitamin C and
   the antioxidant activity of the CNCS/VC complexes were elucidated. The
   formation of the complex was confirmed using DSC and UV-vis
   spectrophotometry, and TEM was used to study the morphology of the
   complexes. The encapsulation efficiency of vitamin C at pH 3 and 5 was
   71.6\% +/- 6.8 and 91.0 +/- 1.0, respectively. Strong exothermic peaks
   observed in isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) studies at pH 5
   could be attributed to additional electrostatic interactions between
   CNC-CSOS and vitamin C at pH 5. The in vitro release of vitamin C from
   CNCS/VC complexes showed a sustained release of up to 20 days. The
   vitamin C released from CNCS/VC complex displayed higher stability
   compared with the control vitamin C solution, and this was also
   confirmed from the ITC thermograms. CNC-CSOS possessed a higher
   scavenging activity and faster antioxidant activity compared with its
   precursors, i.e., oxidized CNC and CSOS and their physical mixtures.
   Complexing vitamin C into CNC-CSOS particles yielded a dynamic
   antioxidant agent, where the vitamin C is released over time and
   displayed sustained antioxidant properties. Therefore, CNCS/VC can
   potentially be used in cosmeceutical applications as topical
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{With the integration of distributed generation (DG) to meshed

   distribution networks. The proposed tripping characteristic is described
   in detail. Moreover, the protection coordination problem is formulated
   as a constrained nonlinear programming problem to determine the optimal
   relay settings. The proposed characteristic is tested on the power
   distribution system of the IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 30 bus with
   inverter-based and synchronous-based DG units. The outcome of this study
   reveals that the new tripping characteristic for DOCRs achieves notable
   reduction in total relays' operating time over the conventional

Title = {{A Novel Multiagent Control Scheme for Voltage Regulation in DC
   Distribution Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel multiagent control scheme to mitigate the
   voltage regulation challenges of dc distribution systems (DCDSs) with
   high penetration of distributed and renewable generation (DG). The
   proposed control scheme consists of two sequential stages. In the first
   stage, a distributed state estimation algorithm is implemented to
   estimate the voltage profile in a DCDS, thus enhancing the ac/dc
   converter operation to keep the system voltages within specified limits.
   The second stage is activated only when the ac/dc fails to regulate the
   system voltages. Two distributed power management control strategies are
   proposed in the second stage. The first is based on a distributed equal
   curtailment, at which all DG units responsible for the voltage violation
   are equally curtailed. The second strategy aims to optimize the output
   power in order to maximize the revenue of DG units. The formulated
   problem in the second strategy is classified as a convex optimization
   problem under global constraints. A distributed Lagrangian primal-dual
   subgradient (DLPDS) algorithm is proposed in order to obtain the global
   optimal solution of the formulated problem. Various case studies are
   performed to prove the effectiveness, robustness, and convergence
   characteristics of the proposed control schemes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{150-161}},

Abstract = {{In current construction practice, vertical slotted holes are widely used
   in the lapped joints of cold-formed steel (CFS) Z-shaped purlins to
   simplify the erection of multi-span purlin systems by providing extra
   installation tolerance. However, almost no research has been conducted
   on the performance of CFS Z-purlin lapped joints with vertical slotted
   holes. Presented in this paper is an experimental study on the
   structural behavior of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlin connections with
   vertical slotted holes. A total of 42 flexural tests were performed on
   lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with different lap lengths, purlin depths,
   thicknesses and spans. The results indicate that the flexural strength
   and stiffness of the lapped purlins are primarily influenced by four
   parameters, i.e., the ratio of lap length to purlin depth, the ratio of
   lap length to purlin thickness, the ratio of purlin depth to purlin
   thickness, and the ratio of lap length to span. Based on the test
   results, design recommendations for evaluating the moment resistance and
   flexural stiffness of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with vertical slotted
   holes are proposed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Addressing subjective decision-making inherent in GLUE-based

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{GLUE is one of the most commonly used informal methodologies for
   uncertainty estimation in hydrological modelling. Despite the
   ease-of-use of GLUE, it involves a number of subjective decisions such
   as the strategy for identifying the behavioural solutions. This study
   evaluates the impact of behavioural solution identification strategies
   in GLUE on the quality of model output uncertainty. Moreover, two new
   strategies are developed to objectively identify behavioural solutions.
   The first strategy considers Pareto-based ranking of parameter sets,
   while the second one is based on ranking the parameter sets based on an
   aggregated criterion. The proposed strategies, as well as the
   traditional strategies in the literature, are evaluated with respect to
   reliability (coverage of observations by the envelope of model outcomes)
   and sharpness (width of the envelope of model outcomes) in different
   numerical experiments. These experiments include multi-criteria
   calibration and uncertainty estimation of three rainfall-runoff models
   with different number of parameters. To demonstrate the importance of
   behavioural solution identification strategy more appropriately, GLUE is
   also compared with two other informal multi-criteria calibration and
   uncertainty estimation methods (Pareto optimization and DDS-AU). The
   results show that the model output uncertainty varies with the
   behavioural solution identification strategy, and furthermore, a robust
   GLUE implementation would require considering multiple behavioural
   solution identification strategies and choosing the one that generates
   the desired balance between sharpness and reliability. The proposed
   objective strategies prove to be the best options in most of the case
   studies investigated in this research. Implementing such an approach for
   a high-dimensional calibration problem enables GLUE to generate robust
   results in comparison with Pareto optimization and DDS-AU. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur battery is an attractive candidate for advanced energy
   storage devices due to its high specific energy of 2600 Wh kg(-1)
   arising from the high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g(-1)) of
   the sulfur cathode. However, short cycle life and low cycling efficiency
   are still the main obstacles preventing the practical development of
   this promising battery system. In this work, we show that a low-cost
   Li/S cell employing an activated hardwood charcoal-sulfur (S-AHC)
   nanocomposite cathode can be operated for more than 300 cycles while
   still maintaining high specific capacity (600 mAh g(-1)) and coulombic
   efficiency of 97 \%, achieved by a new formulation of liquid electrolyte
   containing a fluorinated solvent. Such an improved capacity retention
   and cycle life, as compared to its conventional counterparts, prove that
   active mass lost via polysulfide dissolution can be effectively
   inhibited by utilization of this liquid electrolyte solution.
   Considering these results, we believe that the Li/S battery consisted of
   this composite cathode and the liquid electrolyte may be proposed as a
   promising candidate for low-cost energy storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, in order to simultaneously resolve the transmission
   security and availability in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) group communications, we propose a robust and efficient group
   key management scheme, called LiSH+, which is characterized by
   developing a secure self-healing mechanism with t-revocation and
   collusion resistance capability. A dual direction hash chain is utilized
   to guarantee the backward secrecy and forward secrecy of group key. A
   novel self-healing mechanism is constructed to ensure availability of
   the group member in case of devices failure and prevent the collusive
   users from exploiting the group key in the proposed scheme. In addition,
   the compromised users can be revoked from the group dynamically by
   broadcasting message. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed
   LiSH+ scheme meets the requirements of group communication and is secure
   in terms of t user collusion-free. Performance evaluation also
   demonstrates its efficiency in terms of low storage requirement and
   communication overheads. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{A NEW MODEL FOR THE VISCOSITY OF ASPHALTENE SOLUTIONS}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of viscosity of asphaltene solutions is a longstanding
   unresolved problem. A number of empirical and semi-empirical viscosity
   models have been proposed. However, no single equation is found to
   adequately describe all the asphaltene systems. In this article, a new
   viscosity model for asphaltene solutions is developed taking into
   consideration the clustering of asphaltene nano-aggregates. At low
   concentrations of asphaltenes, the asphaltenes are assumed to exist in
   the form of isolated disk-shaped nano-aggregates. At high
   concentrations, clustering of nano-aggregates is allowed, resulting in
   an increase in the effective volume fraction of asphaltenes due to
   continuous-phase immobilization within the clusters. A model is proposed
   to relate the effective volume fraction of asphaltenes to the actual
   volume fraction. The ratio of effective volume fraction to actual volume
   fraction of asphaltenes is dependent on the type of packing of
   nano-aggregates within the clusters. The viscosity model is developed
   using the effective medium approach, taking into account the clustering
   of nano-aggregates and the relationship between effective volume
   fraction and actual volume fraction of asphaltenes. Twenty-one sets of
   literature data covering different sources of asphaltenes, different
   types of asphaltenes, different types of solvents, and broad ranges of
   temperature and volume fraction of asphaltenes, are used to validate the
   proposed model. All the viscosity data could be described very well with
   the proposed model assuming random close packing of nano-aggregates
   within the clusters. Only intrinsic viscosity is required to predict
   relative viscosity of concentrated asphaltene solutions from the model.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the degree of neuromuscular transmission
   variability and motor unit (MU) remodelling in patients with diabetic
   polyneuropathy (DPN) using decomposition-based quantitative
   electromyography (DQEMG) and near fibre (NF) motor unit potential (MUP)
   parameters.
   Methods: The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was tested in 12 patients
   with DPN (65 +/- 15 years) and 12 controls (63 +/- 15 years). DQEMG was
   used to analyze electromyographic (EMG) signals collected during
   voluntary contractions. MUP and NF MUP parameters were analyzed. NF MUPs
   were obtained by high-pass filtering MUP template waveforms, which
   isolates contributions of fibres that are close to the needle detection
   surface. NF MUP parameters provided assessment of motor unit size (NF
   area), fibre density (NF fibre count) and contribution dispersion (NF
   dispersion) and neuromuscular transmission instability (NF jiggle).
   Results: DPN patients had larger (+45\% NF area), more complex (+30\% NF
   fibre count), and less stable (+30\% NF jiggle) NF MUPs (p < 0.05). No
   significant relationships were found between NF MUP stability and
   denervation, or strength; however NF MUP complexity was positively
   related to TA denervation in the DPN group (r = 0.63; p < 0.05). NF MUP
   complexity and instability were positively related in DPN patients (r =
   0.46; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: DPN is associated with neuromuscular transmission
   instability and MU remodelling that can be assessed using DQEMG.
   Significance: DQEMG-derived NF MUP parameters may be useful in
   identifying patients in early stages of neuromuscular dysfunction
   related to DPN. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{An empirical model for commercial lithium-ion batteries is developed
   based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. An

   battery operating output potential difference in battery electric and
   plug-in hybrid vehicles at various operating conditions. This model
   demonstrates up to 6\% improvement compared to simple resistance and
   Thevenin models and is suitable for modeling and on-board controller
   purposes. Results also show that this model can be used to predict the
   battery internal resistance obtained from hybrid pulse power
   characterization (HPPC) tests to within 20 percent, making it suitable
   for low to medium fidelity powertrain design purposes. In total, this
   simple battery model can be employed as a real-time model in electrified

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a relatively new method for fluid
   flow simulations, and is recently gaining popularity due to its simple
   algorithm and parallel scalability. Although the method has been
   successfully applied to a wide range of flow physics, its capabilities
   in simulating turbulent flow is still under-validated. Hence, in this
   paper, a 3D LBM code was developed to investigate the validity of the
   LBM for turbulent flow simulations through large eddy simulations (LES).
   A GPU enabled LBM code was developed, and validated against a benchmark
   test case involving the flow over a square cylinder in square channel.
   The flow results showed good agreement with literature, and speedups of
   over 150 times were observed when two GPUs were used in parallel.
   Turbulent flow simulations were then conducted using LES with the
   Smagorinsky subgrid model. The methodology was first validated by
   computing the fully developed turbulent channel flow, and comparing the
   results against direct numerical simulation results. The results were in
   good agreement despite the relatively coarse grid. The code was then
   used to simulate the turbulent flow over a square cylinder confined in a
   channel. In order to emulate a realistic inflow at the channel inlet, an
   auxiliary simulation consisting of a fully developed turbulent channel
   flow was run in conjunction, and its velocity profile was used to
   enforce the inlet boundary condition for the cylinder flow simulation.
   Comparison of the results with experimental and numerical results
   revealed that the presence of the turbulent flow structures at the inlet
   can significantly influence the resulting flow field around the
   cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose E-STAR for establishing stable and reliable
   routes in heterogeneous multihop wireless networks. E-STAR combines
   payment and trust systems with a trust-based and energy-aware routing
   protocol. The payment system rewards the nodes that relay others'
   packets and charges those that send packets. The trust system evaluates
   the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of
   multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the
   nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions.
   We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those
   highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the
   probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the
   nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability
   and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss
   of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the
   efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are
   computed by processing the payment receipts. Analytical results
   demonstrate that E-STAR can secure the payment and trust calculation
   without false accusations. Simulation results demonstrate that our
   routing protocols can improve the packet delivery ratio and route
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge structures
   due to corrosion of steel reinforcement has resulted in an increased use
   of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bars as an
   alternative reinforcement type for new bridge construction.
   Disadvantages of glass fiber-reinforced polymer reinforced concrete
   (GFRP-RC) flexural elements may include increased deflections and crack
   widths, significant reductions in the concrete contribution to shear
   resistance and susceptibility to fatigue failure. Posttensioned carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons can be used to effectively
   improve serviceability and shear resistance while increasing the fatigue
   life of the structure. An experimental study on the fatigue behavior of
   full-scale slab bridge strips with a reinforcement system combining
   passive GFRP reinforcing bars and active CFRP tendons is presented,
   along with analytical models to predict their fatigue lives and changes
   in stiffness resulting from repeated loading. The fatigue models

   changes in deflections, crack widths, and fatigue strength. The proposed

Abstract = {{Rechargeable hybrid aqueous batteries (ReHABs) were constructed from
   LiMn2O4 cathode, aqueous electrolyte containing ZnSO4 and Li2SO4, and
   polished zinc foil anode. Cyclability data were obtained from a Neware
   battery tester and the data were modeled by the particle filter method.
   This method exhibits superior performance in both tracking and
   predicting the cyclability behavior of ReHABs. Data from both Swagelok
   and coin cells are modeled successfully and the results show that the
   non-linear term in the model of Swagelok batteries is larger than that
   in the model of coin cells. This nonlinear term is varied versus battery
   types. This fact shows the versatility of the particle filter method in
   modeling different types of batteries. This finding is crucial because
   it proves the suitability of particle filter method as a promising
   candidate in the evaluation of battery cycle life, without the need for
   running batteries till the end of life, which may take up to a few
   thousands of cycles and last for several months or years. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate steady triple convective-diffusive
   boundary layer free convection flow past a vertical flat plate embedded
   in a porous medium filled by a water-based nanofluid and two salts. The
   plate is assumed to be convectively cooled by a surrounding fluid. It is
   assumed that there is no nanoparticle flux at the surface and the effect
   of thermophoresis is taken in to account in the boundary condition. The
   effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis parameters are also
   introduced through a Buongiorno model in the governing equations. The
   self-similar solutions are obtained numerically using an implicit finite
   difference method. The effects of the buoyancy ratio, regular Lewis
   numbers and modified Dufour parameters of both salts and nanofluid
   parameters on the flow and heat transfer are investigated. It is found
   that the heat transfer rate increases as we include nanoparticles and
   salts. Furthermore, it is also shown that the Brownian motion has
   negligible effects on reduced Nusselt number. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{We present a frequency-domain method to measure angular speeds using
   electrostatic micro-electro-mechanical system actuators. Towards this
   end, we study a single-axis gyroscope made of a micro-cantilever and a
   proof-mass coupled to two fixed electrodes. The gyroscope possesses two
   orthogonal axes of symmetry and identical flexural mode shapes along
   these axes. We develop the equations of motion describing the coupled
   bending modes in the presence of electrostatic and Coriolis forces.
   Furthermore, we derive a consistent closed-form higher-order expression
   for the natural frequencies of the coupled flexural modes. The
   closed-form expression is verified by comparing its results to those
   obtained from numerical integration of the equations of motion. We find
   that rotations around the beam axis couple each pair of identical
   bending modes to produce a pair of global modes. They also split their
   common natural frequency into a pair of closely spaced natural
   frequencies. We propose the use of the difference between this pair of
   frequencies, which is linearly proportional to the speed of rotation
   around the beam axis, as a detector for the angular speed.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL CONTROL \& HEALTH MONITORING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{595-614}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of underdetermined modal identification where
   the number of modes to be identified is larger than the available sensor
   measurements is addressed using parallel factor decomposition and blind
   source separation. Underdetermined situations not only arise when the
   number of sensors are limited but also when narrowband excitations are
   present in the measurements, for example, in pedestrian-induced
   vibration of footbridges. The basic premise of the proposed algorithm is
   based on multiple-rank parallel factor decomposition of covariance
   tensors constituted from vibration response measurements. Unlike
   conventional parallel factor decomposition using a single rank order,
   the proposed method utilizes multiple rank order decompositions. A
   stability chart constructed from identified sources through such
   multiple rank orders allows for the robust estimation of active modes.
   The statistical characteristics of the resulting modes are evaluated in
   order to delineate the sources corresponding to external disturbances
   versus inherent modes of the system. The proposed framework enables an
   automated selection of rank order, detection of external harmonics and
   an estimation of modal parameters that are relatively insensitive to the
   sensor configuration. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated
   using both numerical studies and an experimental study using
   pedestrian-induced vibration measurements of a stress-ribbon bridge

   Interband Cascade Lasers}},
Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Variation of leakage current in interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with
   different carrier concentrations achieved by coating the facet with
   antireflections (AR) coating was experimentally studied. Single-layer
   Al2O3 and double-layer ZnS-YF3, ZnS-SiO2, and Ti2O5-SiO2 AR coatings are
   applied to midinfrared (mid-IR) ICL devices to achieve reflectance
   ranging from 0.15 to 7 x 10(-4). By monitoring the laser performance
   before and after coating, it was observed that, for lower reflectivity
   coatings, the leakage current appreciably rises with increasing carrier
   concentration, thus diminishing the slope efficiency improvements and,
   in fact, degrading the slope efficiency at very low reflectance. It was
   observed that the ratio of leakage to threshold current could increase
   by 17\% for high carrier concentrations at very low AR coating values.
   The results also allow for experimental optimization of AR coatings for
   increased slope efficiency in mid-IR ICLs. Therefore, in this paper, we
   propose an optimal value for the AR coatings in order to maximize the
   power in ICLs.}},

Abstract = {{Biosensors for point-of-care testing of critical illnesses are urgently
   needed, especially in many areas of poor healthcare infrastructure.
   Polydiacetylene-based sensors are ideal because of their unique
   colorimetric properties where blue to red color shifts can be observed
   with the naked eye. In this work, a colorimetric biosensor capable of
   simple, rapid magnetic separation is optimized, using horse IgG as a
   model antibody, to obtain higher sensitivity. Composed of a unique
   combination of polydiacetylene and superparamagnetic iron oxide, the
   biosensor is fabricated at varying ratios of polydiacetylene to
   demonstrate optimization of color responsiveness. At increasing
   polydiacetylene ratios, improved color responsiveness and aqueous
   dispersion are observed, but the magnetic separation efficiency starts
   to suffer. The optimal color response is obtained at 90 wt\%
   polydiacetylene. In addition, a 50 times improved lower detection limit
   of 0.01 mg/mL horse IgG is achieved, a relevant biomarker concentration
   for diagnosing sepsis. This platform provides a promising colorimetric
   biosensor for point-of-care use.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{The security of quantum communication using a weak coherent source
   requires an accurate knowledge of the source's mean photon number.
   Finite calibration precision or an active manipulation by an attacker
   may cause the actual emitted photon number to deviate from the known
   value. We model effects of this deviation on the security of three
   quantum communication protocols: the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84)
   quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol without decoy states,
   Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) QKD protocol, and a
   coin-tossing protocol. For QKD we model both a strong attack using
   technology possible in principle and a realistic attack bounded by
   today's technology. To maintain the mean photon number in two-way
   systems, such as plug-and-play and relativistic quantum cryptography
   schemes, bright pulse energy incoming from the communication channel
   must be monitored. Implementation of a monitoring detector has largely
   been ignored so far, except for ID Quantique's commercial QKD system
   Clavis2. We scrutinize this implementation for security problems and
   show that designing a hack-proof pulse-energy-measuring detector is far
   from trivial. Indeed, the first implementation has three serious flaws
   confirmed experimentally, each of which may be exploited in a cleverly
   constructed Trojan-horse attack. We discuss requirements for a
   loophole-free implementation of the monitoring detector.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{A method for quantitative analysis of local pattern strength and defects
   in surface self-assembly imaging is presented and applied to images of
   stripe and hexagonal ordered domains. The presented method uses
   ``shapelet{''} functions which were originally developed for
   quantitative analysis of images of galaxies (alpha 10(20)m). In this
   work, they are used instead to quantify the presence of translational
   order in surface self-assembled films (alpha 10(-9)m) through
   reformulation into ``steerable{''} filters. The resulting method is
   computationally efficient (with respect to the number of filter
   evaluations), robust to variation in pattern feature shape, and, unlike
   previous approaches, is applicable to a wide variety of pattern types.
   An application of the method is presented which uses a nearest-neighbor
   analysis to distinguish between uniform (defect-free) and nonuniform
   (strained, defect-containing) regions within imaged self-assembled

Title = {{Depth Profilometry via Multiplexed Optical High-Coherence Interferometry}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Depth Profilometry involves the measurement of the depth profile of
   objects, and has significant potential for various industrial
   applications that benefit from non-destructive subsurface profiling such
   as defect detection, corrosion assessment, and dental assessment to name
   a few. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of depth
   profilometry using an Multiplexed Optical High-coherence Interferometry
   MOHI instrument. The MOHI instrument utilizes the spatial coherence of a
   laser and the interferometric properties of light to probe the
   reflectivity as a function of depth of a sample. The axial and lateral
   resolutions, as well as imaging depth, are decoupled in the MOHI
   instrument. The MOHI instrument is capable of multiplexing
   interferometric measurements into 480 one-dimensional interferograms at
   a location on the sample and is built with axial and lateral resolutions
   of 40 mu m at a maximum imaging depth of 700 mu m. Preliminary results,
   where a piece of sand-blasted aluminum, an NBK7 glass piece, and an
   optical phantom were successfully probed using the MOHI instrument to
   produce depth profiles, demonstrate the feasibility of such an
   instrument for performing depth profilometry.}},

   Energy Range}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{The increased use of diagnostic x-rays, especially in the field of
   medical radiology, has necessitated a significant demand for high
   resolution, real-time radiation detectors. In this regard, the
   photoresponse of bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), an n-type semiconducting metal
   chalcogenide, to low energy x-rays has been investigated in this study.
   In recent years, several types of nanomaterials of Bi2S3 have been
   widely studied for optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications.
   However, photoresponse of Bi2S3 nanomaterials for dosimetric
   applications has not yet been reported. The photosensitivity of Bi2S3
   with nanoscale ``flower-like'' structures was characterized under x-ray
   tube-potentials typically used in mammographic procedures. Both dark
   current and photocurrent were measured under varying x-ray doses, field
   sizes, and bias voltages for each of the tube potentials -20, 23, 26 and
   30 kV. Results show that the Bi2S3 nanoflowers instantaneously responded
   to even minor changes in the dose delivered. The photoresponse was found
   to be relatively high (few nA) at bias voltage as low as +1 V, and
   fairly repeatable for both short and long exposures to mammographic
   x-rays with minimal or no loss in sensitivity. The overall
   dose-sensitivity of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers was found to be similar to
   that of a micro-ionization chamber.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of Basin-Scale Nitrogen Load Reductions under Intensified
   Irrigated Agriculture}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Irrigated agriculture can modify the cycling and transport of nitrogen
   (N), due to associated water diversions, water losses, and changes in
   transport flow-paths. We investigate dominant processes behind observed
   long-term changes in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations
   and loads of the extensive (465,000 km(2)) semi-arid Amu Darya River
   basin (ADRB) in Central Asia. We specifically considered a 40-year
   period (1960-2000) of large irrigation expansion, reduced river water
   flows, increased fertilizer application and net increase of N input into
   the soil-water system. Results showed that observed decreases in
   riverine DIN concentration near the Aral Sea outlet of ADRB primarily
   were due to increased recirculation of irrigation water, which extends
   the flow-path lengths and enhances N attenuation. The observed DIN
   concentrations matched a developed analytical relation between
   concentration attenuation and recirculation ratio, showing that a
   fourfold increase in basin-scale recirculation can increase DIN
   attenuation from 85 to 99\%. Such effects have previously only been
   observed at small scales, in laboratory experiments and at individual
   agricultural plots. These results imply that increased recirculation can
   have contributed to observed increases in N attenuation in
   agriculturally dominated drainage basins in different parts of the
   world. Additionally, it can be important for basin scale attenuation of
   other pollutants, including phosphorous, metals and organic matter. A
   six-fold lower DIN export from ADRB during the period 1981-2000,
   compared to the period 1960-1980, was due to the combined result of
   drastic river flow reduction of almost 70\%, and decreased DIN
   concentrations at the basin outlet. Several arid and semi-arid regions
   around the world are projected to undergo similar reductions in
   discharge as the ADRB due to climate change and agricultural
   intensification, and may therefore undergo comparable shifts in DIN
   export as shown here for the ADRB. For example, projected future
   increases of irrigation water withdrawals between 2005 and 2050 may
   decrease the DIN export from arid world regions by 40\%.}},

Title = {{Homotopic non-local regularized reconstruction from sparse positron
   emission tomography measurements}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Positron emission tomography scanners collect measurements
   of a patient's in vivo radiotracer distribution. The system detects
   pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting
   radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a
   biologically active molecule, and the tomograms must be reconstructed
   from projections. The reconstruction of tomograms from the acquired PET
   data is an inverse problem that requires regularization. The use of
   tightly packed discrete detector rings, although improves
   signal-to-noise ratio, are often associated with high costs of positron
   emission tomography systems. Thus a sparse reconstruction, which would
   be capable of overcoming the noise effect while allowing for a reduced
   number of detectors, would have a great deal to offer.
   Methods: In this study, we introduce and investigate the potential of a
   homotopic non-local regularization reconstruction framework for
   effectively reconstructing positron emission tomograms from such sparse
   measurements.
   Results: Results obtained using the proposed approach are compared with
   traditional filtered back-projection as well as expectation maximization
   reconstruction with total variation regularization.
   Conclusions: A new reconstruction method was developed for the purpose
   of improving the quality of positron emission tomography reconstruction
   from sparse measurements. We illustrate that promising reconstruction
   performance can be achieved for the proposed approach even at low
   sampling fractions, which allows for the use of significantly fewer
   detectors and have the potential to reduce scanner costs.}},

Abstract = {{Since its discovery, little work has been done on the vanadium
   chalcogenide VS4. Recently, a facile method for synthesizing VS4 was
   discovered using a graphitic template. Here we show for the first time
   that template free VS4 can be synthesized in a hydrothermal reaction by
   controlling key parameters of the reaction mainly time, temperature, and
   pH. The phase and morphology of VS4 materials are tracked carefully
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   under each reaction condition. It is found that lower reaction
   temperatures and longer reaction times are sufficient to form VS4
   crystals, while variations in pH do not appear to greatly affect VS4
   crystallinity but rather surface area and morphology. By use of
   optimized reaction parameters, further characterization shows template
   free VS4 to be comparable with VS4 templated with graphene oxide.
   Initial photo catalytic testing of these materials shows that VS4 has
   the potential to be usectin photocatalysis.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The effect of degree of pore saturation (PS) in concrete on corrosion
   current is investigated in this paper. Results showed that the maximum
   of corrosion current appeared in the saturated concrete and it decreased
   in dried concrete. After the corrosion products were enough, FeOOH in
   corrosion layer could act as a depolarizer instead of oxygen. As a
   result, the corrosion rate remained high even when the concrete was
   completely water saturated. Therefore, oxygen is not the factor
   controlling corrosion process of steel rebar in concrete, although it is
   one of the key factors. When the concrete drying process stars from
   water saturation, there is little difference between the control degree
   of cathodic reaction and the control degree of anodic reaction on
   corrosion process; the control type of corrosion reaction is mixed
   control. Part I of this article presents experimental results obtained
   from the thermostatic drying tests and the effect of corrosion products
   on process control of reinforcement corrosion in concrete. The
   time-dependent dominating factors of rebar corrosion process under
   different environmental conditions will be discussed in Part 2. (c) 2015

   femtosecond laser pulses}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{331}},
Pages = {{392-398}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Highly localized heating can be obtained in plasmonic nanomaterials
   using laser excitation but the high fluences required often produce
   unacceptable damage in and near irradiated components and structures. In
   this work we show that plasmonic nanostructures involving aggregated Ag
   nanoparticles (Ag NPs) can be heated effectively without attendant
   damage to the surrounding material when these structures are irradiated
   with many overlapping femtosecond (fs) laser pulses at very low fluence.
   Under these conditions, the effectiveness of heating is such that the
   temperature of 50 nm Ag NPs can be raised to their melting point from
   room temperature. Aggregates of these NPs are then observed to grow into
   larger spherical particles as laser heating continues. Imaging of these
   materials shows that the initiation of melting in individual Ag NPs
   depends on the local geometry surrounding each NP and on the
   polarization of the incident laser radiation. Finite difference time
   domain (FDTD) simulations indicate that melting is triggered by
   localized surface plasmon (LSP)-induced electric field enhancement at
   ``hotspots{''}. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We proved that sluggish kinetics on the cathode and the imbalance of
   cathode kinetics cause voltage reversal in a stacked microbial fuel cell
   (MFC) equipped with a non-Pt cathode. Catholyte aeration to a unit MFC
   against passive air diffusion to the cathode in the other unit MFC
   shifted voltage reversal between the two units, due to improved mass
   transport and O-2 concentration effects in the aerated MFC. The shifted
   voltage reversal returned to an original status when catholyte aeration
   was stopped. A Ptcoated cathode increased the rate of oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) by a factor of similar to 20, as compared to the non-Pt
   cathode. As a result, the anodic reaction rate that became slower than
   the rate on the Ptcathode limited current density to overpotential in
   the stacked MFC equipped with the Pt-cathode. This work shows that
   dominant kinetic bottlenecks, which are the primary cause of voltage
   reversal, can be shifted between individual MFCs of stacked MFCs or
   electrodes depending on relative kinetics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1588-1597}},

Abstract = {{A template-free benign approach to modify polypyrrole (PPy) with
   bioinspired catechol derivatives dopamine (DA), 1,2-dihydroxybenzene or
   catechol (CA), and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is reported. It
   is found that PPy functionalized with these catechol derivatives (DA,
   CA, and DOPA) exhibited fibrous structure, smaller particle size, good
   water dispersibility, and enhanced film adhesion. Surprisingly, it is
   found that adding a small amount of catechols can also improve PPy's
   electrical conductivity. This rapid, one-step, in situ, template-free
   method provided an alternative strategy to the facile production of PPy
   fibers. Among these three catechols, functionalized PPy and DA-PPy
   exhibits the smallest particle size and best performance in both
   adhesion and electrical conductivity. In contrast, the control
   phenylethlamine (PA) modification had almost negligible influence on the
   PPy properties, which provides strong evidence that instead of amine
   functional group or coexistence of both catechol and amine moieties,
   catechol itself is responsible for the successful functionalization of
   PPy and overall performance improvement. Furthermore, catechol-PPy
   nanofibers are blended into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution and
   casted to form thin films; as-synthesized conductive films are found
   able to bond strongly onto the surface and may find broad applications
   in manufacturing biosensors and electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Cell humidification is an important factor affecting PEM fuel cell
   performance. A new cell was designed with slanted grooves on both
   cathode and anode sides to improve water management. Water transport
   measurements provided information on flooding, hydration, and
   back-diffusion. The results showed less water flowing out from the
   cathode side of an anode down-slanted channel than from that of a
   rectangular channel, because anode down-slanting induced a hydration
   gradient which caused water back-diffusion into the anode, leading to
   better performance due to improved membrane hydration and conductivity.
   At high humidification, performance decreased because of condensation
   and blocking of the gas diffusion layer, but replacing the rectangular
   channel with an anode down-slanted channel improved performance to match
   that of a rectangular cell at normal humidification. However, the
   cathode down-slanted channel showed membrane dehydration due to water
   draining away. Moreover, anode or cathode up-slanted channels. induced
   flooding, leading to poor performance. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{In this investigation, an advanced modeling method, called online
   sequential extreme learning machine with a hyper-level fault
   tolerance-based supervisor (OSELM-FTS), is utilized to develop a robust
   safety-oriented autonomous cruise control based on the model predictive
   control (MPC) technique. The resulting MPC-based cruise controller is
   used to improve the driving safety and reduce the energy consumption of
   an electric vehicle (EV). The structural flexibility of OSELM-FTS allows
   us to not only improve the operating features of the EV, but also
   develop an intelligent supervisor which can detect any operating fault
   and send proper commands for the adaption of the MPC controller. This
   introduces a degree of robustness to the devised controller, as
   OSELM-FTS automatically detects and filters any operating faults which
   may undermine the performance of the MPC controller. To ascertain the
   veracity of the devised controller, three well-known MPC formulations,
   i.e. linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and diagonal recurrent
   neural network MPC (DRNN-MPC), are applied to the baseline EV and their
   performances are compared with OSELM-FTS-MPC. To further elaborate on
   the computational advantages of OSELM, a well-known chunk-by-chunk
   incremental machine learning approach, namely selective negative
   correlation learning (SNCL), is taken into account. The results of the
   comparative study indicate that OSELM-FTS-MPC is a very promising
   control scheme and can be reliably used for safety-oriented autonomous
   cruise control of the EVs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the implementation of the constructive alignment
   theory (CAT) in a power system analysis course through a consensus-based
   course design process. The consensus-based design process involves both
   the instructor and graduate-level students and it aims to develop the
   CAT framework in a holistic manner with the goal of including different
   perceptions. The considerations required to implement this approach are
   described in detail. To examine the effect of this approach, three
   different course evaluations were conducted by querying the students
   during different stages of the course. These evaluations show that most
   of the students find a benefit for their learning in the implementation
   of CAT within the new course design. These observations are supported by
   a comparison of the students' performance in the new course and the
   previous one. Finally, the revised two-factor study process
   questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) is utilised to identify the students' learning
   approach towards the course. The aim is to correlate the students'
   approach with their final grade to assess if students adopting a deep
   learning approach are rewarded with higher marks and vice versa, that
   is, to check if the CAT implementation was successful. Meanwhile, some
   of the R-SPQ-2F limitations, which affect the quality of the results,
   are identified and discussed. Additionally, to facilitate the practical
   usage of R-SPQ-2F, an algorithm was developed by the authors to rank the
   students' approach towards the course. The results of the new ranking
   algorithm demonstrate positive correlation with the students' final
   grade, which is an indication of the effective CAT implementation.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, a comparative experimental study is conducted to
   obtain an efficient hybrid intelligent framework for analysing and
   optimising the operating parameters of the laser solid freeform
   fabrication (LSFF) process. Here, the experimental studies are conducted
   in two different stages. In the first stage, different concepts of
   machine learning systems are taken into account to find a simple yet
   accurate intelligent model for identifying the LSFF process. To do so,
   multi-layered neural network with different types of analytical,
   gradient-based and heuristic learning strategies, i.e. extreme learning
   machine, back-propagation and steepest descend gradient-based learning
   and Nelder-Mead simplex heuristic, respectively, are adopted and applied
   to the LSFF process. In the second stage, different types of swarm- and
   evolutionary-based metaheuristics, i.e. differential evolutionary
   algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, the great salmon run, firefly
   algorithm, bee algorithm, are used to simultaneously find the optimal
   values of melt-pool depth and clad height during the LSFF process. The
   statistical results of the simulation indicate that the conducted
   experiments can result in a fast, robust and accurate hybrid intelligent
   system which can easily cope with the nonlinearities and uncertainties
   of the resulting optimisation problem.}},

Abstract = {{Civil infrastructure assets require continuous renewal (repair,
   rehabilitation or replacement) actions to modernise the inventory and
   sustain its operability. Allocating limited renewal funds among numerous
   asset components, however, represents a complex optimisation problem.
   Earlier efforts using genetic algorithms (GAs) could optimise small size
   problems yet exhibiting steep degradation in solution quality as problem
   size increases. Even by applying sophisticated mechanisms such as
   `segmentation' to improve the performance of GAs, large processing time
   hinders the practicality of the algorithm for large-scale problems. This
   article, therefore, aims at improving both processing speed and solution
   quality for very large-scale problems (up to 50,000 assets). The article
   develops optimisation models using an advanced modelling tool
   (GAMS/CPLEX), and compares its results with GAs on three different model
   formulations. Both approaches proved to be beneficial, yet the advanced
   mathematical approach showed superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) properties of polar
   and nonpolar fluids are modeled by the use of a statistically-based
   equation of state (EOS). The equation of state used in this work is that
   of Ihm-Song-Mason (ISM) EOS. An alternative approach is to revise the
   isothermal integration on liquid. In this respect, a
   temperature-dependent revision factor beta (T) is introduced to the
   liquid fugacity coefficient expression which was already derived from
   traditional isothermal integration. By this modification, the vapor
   pressure of pure liquids can be successfully reproduced using ISM EOS.
   This equation of state originally cannot predict the vapor pressure of
   fluids. The novelty of the present work is to introduce a method such
   that the ISM EOS is able to predict vapor pressure of pure substances
   and mixtures. Furthermore, the revisionzaSX method is extended to
   represent the VLE properties of binary mixtures including noble gases,
   refrigerants and hydrocarbons. Our computation results on the VLE and
   PVT behaviors of 24 pure substances and 9 binary mixtures are
   impressive.}},

Title = {{Effects of Ce additions on the age hardening response of Mg-Zn alloys}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The effects of Ce additions on the precipitation hardening behaviour of
   Mg-Zn are examined for a series of alloys, with Ce additions at both
   alloying and microalloying levels. The alloys are artificially aged, and
   studied using hardness measurement and X-ray diffraction, as well as
   optical and transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the
   age-hardening effect is driven by the formation of fine precipitates,
   the number density of which is related to the Zn content of the alloy.
   Conversely, the Ce content is found to slightly reduce hardening. When
   the alloy content of Ce is high, large secondary phase particles
   containing both Ce and Zn are present, and remain stable during
   solutionizing. These particles effectively reduce the amount of Zn
   available as solute for precipitation, and thereby reduce hardening.
   Combining hardness results with thermodynamic analysis of alloy solute
   levels also suggests that Ce can have a negative effect on hardening
   when present as solutes at the onset of ageing. This effect is confirmed
   by designing a pre-ageing heat treatment to preferentially remove Ce
   solutes, which is found to restore the hardening capability of an
   Mg-Zn-Ce alloy to the level of the Ce-free alloy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

   AA3xxx-AA6xxx aluminum alloy system}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{71-77}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The through-thickness annealing behavior of a laminated AA3xxx-AA6xxx
   alloy system at 300 degrees C has been studied by scanning electron
   microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction analysis, electron probe
   micro-analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and hardness
   measurement. Results show that the rectystallization process starts at
   the interface region between the AA3xxx (clad) and AA6xxx (core) layers.
   Subsequently, the recrystallization process front progresses into the
   core layer, while the clad layer is the last region to recrystallize. It
   is also found that precipitation precedes recrystallization in the
   entire laminate at the investigated temperature. The preferential onset
   of recrystallization at the interface region is attributed to the net
   driving pressure being the highest in this region. The factors that lead
   to such enhanced net driving pressure are (a) deformation
   incompatibility between the two alloy layers, (b) lower solute content
   of the interface, which also leads to lower volume fraction of
   precipitates, and (c) an accelerated rate of precipitate coarsening due
   to the presence of a higher density of dislocations. The gradual
   progress of recrystallization from the interface towards the core layer
   is dictated by precipitate coarsening and the dependence of its rate on
   the density of deformation-induced dislocations. The lower driving
   pressure due to lower work hardening capacity, high solute drag pressure
   due to Mn, and additional Zener drag from precipitates that form due to
   solute redistribution during annealing explain the late initiation of
   recrystallization in the clad layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Friction stir welding is an efficient manufacturing method for joining
   dissimilar alloys, which can dramatically reduce grain sizes and offer
   high mechanical joint efficiency. Lap FSW joints between dissimilar
   AZ31B and Al 6061 alloy sheets were made at various tool rotation and
   travel speeds. Rotation and travel speeds varied between 560-1400 r/min
   and 16-40 mm/min respectively, where the ratio between these parameters
   was such that nearly constant pitch distances were applied during
   welding. X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), optical microscopy images
   (OM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron
   microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (SEM-EDS) were used to investigate the microstructures of the joints
   welded. Intermetallic phases including Al12Mg17 (gamma) and Al3Mg2
   (beta) were detected in the weld zone (WZ). For different tool rotation
   speeds, the morphology of the microstructure in the stir zone changed
   significantly with travel speed. Lap shear tensile test results
   indicated that by simultaneously increasing the tool rotation and travel
   speeds to 1400 r/min and 40 mm/min, the joint tensile strength and
   ductility reached a maximum. Microhardness measurements and tensile
   stress-strain curves indicated that mechanical properties were affected
   by FSW parameters and mainly depended on the formation of intermetallic
   compounds in the weld zone. In addition, a debonding failure mode in the
   Al/Mg dissimilar weld nugget was investigated by SEM and surface
   fracture studies indicated that the presence of intermetallic compounds
   in the weld zone controlled the failure mode. XRD analysis of the
   fracture surface indicated the presence of brittle intermetallic
   compounds including Al12Mg17 (gamma) and Al3Mg2 (beta). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Surface waves propagating in a medium provide information about the
   mechanical properties and condition of the material. Variations in the
   material condition can be inferred from changes in the surface wave
   characteristics. Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) is a
   well-established surface wave method used for determination of the
   shear-wave profile of the soil layers near the surface. The MASW test
   configuration is also applicable to assess the condition of construction
   materials using appropriate frequency range. Previous studies on the
   detection of surface-breaking cracks in concrete elements, using the
   dispersion and attenuation of ultrasonic waves, were successful;
   however, a complete damage assessment of the whole element was not in
   the scope of these studies. In this study, different wave
   characteristics, such as Rayleigh wave velocity, wave attenuation, and
   phase velocity dispersion, are investigated to evaluate their
   sensitivity to the damage in a medium. The condition of a test specimen,
   which is a half-space medium made of cement and sand, is evaluated using
   ultrasonic transducers for different damage cases. The recorded signals
   are processed using the Fourier and wavelet transforms to determine the
   surface wave characteristics. A new dispersion index (DI) is introduced,
   which represents the global correlation between the dispersion of phase
   velocity and damage level. All features are found to be capable of
   reflecting the damage in the test medium with different levels of
   sensitivity. Among the investigated parameters, the proposed dispersion
   index shows high sensitivity and linear correlation with the damage.}},

Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Pressure pulsing technology is an innovative method that has been
   developed with the aim of overcoming preferred flow paths associated
   with remediation techniques that rely on the injection of reagents.
   Numerical and field experiments were conducted to assess how pressure
   pulsing affects groundwater flow and solute transport during reagent
   injection. A series of field experiments were performed at two field
   sites where a monitoring network designed to capture the breakthrough of
   solutes delivered from an injection well was installed. Pressure pulsing
   and conventional injection methods were used at each site. One site was
   comprised of fine sand with low heterogeneity, while the other was
   moderately heterogeneous with discrete layers varying from fine sand to
   silt. The data suggest that breakthrough was more uniform for the
   pressure pulsing injections; however, this difference was minor and
   complicated by sorption of some of the tracers employed. The groundwater
   flow and solute transport modeling exercise simulated the rapid boundary
   pressure modulation that occurs in association with pressure pulsing.
   Two-dimensional (2D) simulations revealed that repeated sudden onset of
   injection cessation produces brief periods of gradient reversal and the
   development of a mixing zone near the injection well. The spatial
   extents of this mixing zone were found to be highly dependent upon the
   hydraulic diffusivity of the medium, with medium heterogeneity and
   pulsing frequency playing secondary roles. Three-dimensional (3D)
   numerical simulations were used to benchmark the observations from one
   of the field sites. The results from the modeling effort showed that
   solute breakthrough from a pressure pulsing injection is more dispersed
   relative to a conventional injection as a result of the mixing zone
   phenomenon; however, we were unable to directly observe this mixing zone
   using the instrumentation deployed at the two field sites.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether pelvis acceleration-derived parameters
   can differentiate between dynamic stability states for transtibial
   amputees during level (LG) and uneven ground (UG) walking. Correlations
   between these parameters and clinical balance and mobility measures were
   also investigated. A convenience sample of eleven individuals with
   unilateral transtibial amputation walked on LG and simulated UG while
   pelvis acceleration data were collected at 100 Hz. Descriptive
   statistics, Fast Fourier Transform, ratio of even to odd harmonics, and
   maximum Lyapunov exponent measures were derived from acceleration data.
   Of the 26 pelvis acceleration measures, seven had a significant
   difference (p <= 0.05) between LG and UG walking conditions. Seven
   distinct, stability-relevant measures appeared in at least one of the
   six regression models that correlated accelerometer-derived measures to
   Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CBMS),
   and Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) scores, explaining up to
   100\% of the variability in these measures. Of these seven measures,
   medial-lateral acceleration range was the most frequent model variable,
   appearing in four models. Anterior-posterior acceleration standard
   deviation and stride time appeared in three models. Pelvis
   acceleration-derived parameters were able to differentiate between LG
   and UG walking for transtibial amputees. UG walking provided the most
   relevant data for balance and mobility assessment. These results could
   translate to point of patient contact assessments using a wearable
   system such as a smartbelt or accelerometer-equipped smartphone. (C)

Title = {{Simulation and optimization of natural gas processing and production
   network consisting of LNG, GTL, and methanol facilities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{500-508}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A considerable growth is expected for the natural gas sector and some
   believe that it will be the leading primary fuel between 2020 and 2030.
   Different options are available to utilize the natural gas resource.
   Three processes namely, LNG, GTL, and methanol considered as the most
   promising utilization options are addressed in this paper to represent a
   natural gas processing and production network. The objective of this
   work is to illustrate the importance of incorporating rigorous
   simulation models in the decision-making process in the gas processing
   industry. A steady state simulation is carried out for LNG, GTL, and
   methanol processed to determine mass and energy balances, operating
   conditions, and equipment specification. The simulations' flowsheet is
   beneficial in many aspects. For example, accurate yield values can be
   obtained. Also, both the capital and operating costs can be estimated.
   Moreover, the environmental impact can be assessed quantitatively. Then,
   an optimization model is presented that is able to represent the
   processing and production network over a wide range of forecasted
   economic changes. The main feature of this work is the usage of an
   integrated simulation-optimization framework. Although the modeling,
   simulation and optimization of a single natural gas system have been
   addressed previously, the simulation and optimization of enterprise-wide
   natural gas processing has not been addressed to this extent in the
   literature. Furthermore, besides considering more than one utilization
   process, namely LNG, GTL, and methanol, this work addresses the
   preprocessing units of these utilization processes in a comprehensive
   manner. The results of the optimization are improved by utilizing data
   from process simulation. Such data are used to tune the optimization
   model. An illustrative case study is used to show the applicability of
   formulated optimization model on natural gas processing and production
   network and show how accurate representations of the plants are obtained
   from process simulation. The end result is a more highly optimized and
   sustainable processing and production network. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Microwave devices based on tunable materials are of vigorous current

   this reduced representation can be used as a set of surrogate process
   outputs for process control and design of thin-films. Finally, the
   effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in several simulation

Abstract = {{Developing an effective bifunctional catalyst is a significant issue, as
   rechargeable metal-air batteries are very attractive for future energy
   systems. In this study, a facile one-pot process is introduced to
   prepare an advanced bifunctional catalyst (op-LN) incorporating
   nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) into perovskite
   La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 nanoparticles (LSCF-NPs). Confirmed by half-cell
   testing, op-LN exhibits synergistic effects of LSCF-NP and NCNT with
   excellent bifunctionality for both the oxygen reduction reaction and the
   oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, op-LN exhibits comparable
   performances in these reactions to Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, which
   highlights its potential for use as a commercially viable bifunctional
   catalyst. Moreover, the results obtained by testing op-LN in a practical
   Li-air battery demonstrate improved and complementary charge/discharge
   performance compared to those of LSCF-NP and NCNT, and this confirms
   that simply prepared op-LN is a promising candidate as a highly
   effective bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of increasingly powerful mobile devices, mobile
   users can collaboratively form a mobile cloud to provide pervasive
   services, such as data collecting, processing, and computing. With this
   mobile cloud, mobile crowdsourcing, as an emerging service paradigm, can
   enable mobile users to take over the out-sourced tasks. By leveraging
   the sensing capabilities of mobile devices and integrating
   human-intelligence and machine-computation, mobile crowdsourcing has the
   potential to revolutionize the approach of data collecting and
   processing. In this article we investigate the mobile crowdsourcing
   architecture and applications, then discuss some research challenges and
   countermeasures for developing mobile crowdsourcing. Some research
   orientations are finally envisioned for further studies.}},

Abstract = {{A set of high-level intuitive features (HLIFs) is proposed to
   quantitatively describe melanoma in standard camera images. Melanoma is
   the deadliest form of skin cancer. With rising incidence rates and
   subjectivity in current clinical detection methods, there is a need for
   melanoma decision support systems. Feature extraction is a critical step
   in melanoma decision support systems. Existing feature sets for
   analyzing standard camera images are comprised of low-level features,
   which exist in high-dimensional feature spaces and limit the system's
   ability to convey intuitive diagnostic rationale. The proposed HLIFs
   were designed to model the ABCD criteria commonly used by dermatologists
   such that each HLIF represents a human-observable characteristic. As
   such, intuitive diagnostic rationale can be conveyed to the user.
   Experimental results show that concatenating the proposed HLIFs with a
   full low-level feature set increased classification accuracy, and that
   HLIFs were able to separate the data better than low-level features with
   statistical significance. An example of a graphical interface for
   providing intuitive rationale is given.}},

Abstract = {{Travelers in vehicles often have a strong willingness to share their
   travel experience and exchange information to each other through social
   networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. This, however, can be costly due
   to the limited connections on the road to the Internet. In this paper,
   we develop Verse to facilitate the social communications among vehicle
   travelers on highways. Verse enables passengers onboard vehicles to
   share the content information, such as travel blogs with pictures, among
   each other using impromptu wireless intervehicle communications. Unlike
   traditional online social networks, which are built upon reliable
   internet protocol (IP) networks, vehicular social networks face
   fundamental challenges in that 1) users are anonymous and strangers to
   each other and that it is hard to identify potential friends of shared
   interests and that 2) users communicate through intermittent and
   unreliable intervehicle connections. On addressing the two challenges,
   Verse implements a friend recommendation function, which helps
   passengers efficiently identify potential social friends with both
   shared interests and relatively reliable wireless connections. In
   addition, Verse is equipped with a social-aware rate control scheme
   toward efficient utilization of network bandwidth. Using extensive
   simulations, we show that the friend recommendation function of Verse
   can effectively predict the mobility of vehicles to assist in social
   communication and that the social-aware rate control scheme quickly and
   efficiently adapts to the vehicle's transmission rate according to their
   social impact.}},

Abstract = {{A topologically-informed hyperstreamline seeding method is presented for
   visualization of alignment tensor fields. The method is inspired by and
   applied to visualization of nematic liquid crystal (LC) orientation
   dynamics simulations. The method distributes hyperstreamlines along
   domain boundaries and edges of a nearest-neighbor graph whose vertices
   are degenerate regions of the alignment tensor field, which correspond
   to orientational defects in a nematic LC domain. This is accomplished
   without iteration while conforming to a user-specified spacing between
   hyperstreamlines and avoids possible failure modes associated with
   hyperstreamline integration in the vicinity of degeneracies in alignment
   (orientational defects). It is shown that the presented seeding method
   enables automated hyperstreamline-based visualization of a broad range
   of alignment tensor fields which enhances the ability of researchers to
   interpret these fields and provides an alternative to using glyph-based
   techniques.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In situ sensors can measure wire bond reliability nondestructively
   during thermal aging. Conventional thermal aging of ball bonds requires
   ovens heating the entire microchip along with the wire bonds, also
   affecting interconnects for in situ sensors. To protect the
   interconnects and on-chip logic components of in situ sensor chips,
   conventional thermal aging is kept below a safe temperature limit of 200
   degrees C. At higher temperatures, the doped Si components change their
   characteristics and transistors stop working. Localized on-chip heating
   is introduced to circumvent these drawbacks using a new microheater to
   increase the safe temperature limit for nondestructive reliability
   assessment with in situ sensors. The effect of temperature on
   surrounding components is reduced. The microheater is a rectangular
   design resistive heater made from N+ silicon. In addition, a pad
   resistance measurement is introduced that indicates bond aging more
   conveniently than previously reported bond resistance measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a conceptually simple, and robust, yet highly
   effective, approach to both texture classification and material
   categorization. The proposed system is composed of three components: 1)
   local, highly discriminative, and robust features based on sorted random
   projections (RPs), built on the universal and information-preserving
   properties of RPs; 2) an effective bag-of-words global model; and 3) a
   novel approach for combining multiple features in a support vector
   machine classifier. The proposed approach encompasses the simplicity,
   broad applicability, and efficiency of the three methods. We have tested
   the proposed approach on eight popular texture databases, including
   Flickr Materials Database, a highly challenging materials database. We
   compare our method with 13 recent state-of-the-art methods, and the
   experimental results show that our texture classification system yields
   the best classification rates of which we are aware of 99.37\% for
   Columbia-Utrecht, 97.16\% for Brodatz, 99.30\% for University of
   Maryland Database, and 99.29\% for Kungliga Tekniska hogskolan-textures

   approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach
   in materials categorization, with an improvement to classification
   accuracy of 67\%.}},

Abstract = {{In clinical gait analysis, the gait of a patient is recorded with
   optical motion capture and compared with a healthy reference group.
   High-dimensional gait datasets are difficult to interpret; machine
   learning can provide guidance regarding the most relevant gait phases
   and joint angles for visual analysis and quantify the difference between
   healthy and pathological gait. We propose an explicit state duration
   hidden Markov model (HMM) modeling the timeseries data of a subject or a
   group and the use of a reference-based measure that compares the most
   likely observations in each state. Based on this stochastic framework,
   the similarity between healthy and pathological gait can be quantified
   for each state, each joint angle, and each subject. This concept also
   includes an overall gait index useful for group comparison or the
   assessment of an individual's gait. For visualization, joint angle
   timeseries can be generated from the explicit state duration HMM. The
   accuracy of the explicit state duration HMM and the performance of the
   reference-based measures are evaluated on a dataset including strides of
   healthy subjects and patients suffering from arthritis.}},

   the proposed technology, all mmW passive components are made of
   high-resistivity Silicon (Si) on a glass substrate. The proposed
   technique leads to a high-precision and low-cost fabrication process,
   which eliminates the need for costly assembly of the complex structures.
   This is achieved by photolithography and dry etching of the entire
   integrated passive circuit through the Si layer of the SOG wafer.
   Silicon-on-Glass dielectric waveguide, as the basic component of the SOG
   integrated circuit, is theoretically and experimentally investigated. A
   test setup is designed to measure propagation characteristics of the
   proposed SOG waveguide. Measured dispersion diagrams of the SOG
   dielectric waveguide show average attenuation constants of 0.63 dB/cm,
   0.28 dB/cm, and 0.53 dB/cm over 55-65 GHz, 90-110 GHz, and 140-170 GHz,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A low-loss sub-millimeter-wave/THz integrated dielectric waveguide is
   presented. The proposed waveguide consists of a highly resistive Silicon
   (Si) guiding channel bonded to a glass substrate. To reduce the
   waveguide insertion loss due to the glass substrate, part of the
   substrate below the Si guiding channel is etched. A periodic
   configuration of supporting beams is used to hold the Si guiding channel
   over the glass substrate. A low-cost and high-precision fabrication
   process, which is fully compatible with current Si-based fabrication
   technologies, is developed for the proposed waveguide. Numerical
   simulations and experiments are conducted to investigate the performance
   of the proposed waveguide. Measured attenuation constant of the proposed
   waveguide is 0.0346 dB/(average value) over the 440-500 GHz band.}},

Abstract = {{The viscoelastic mucus layer of gastrointestinal tracts is a host
   defense barrier that a successful enteric pathogen, such as Vibrio
   cholerae, must circumvent. V. cholerae, the causative agent of cholera,
   is able to penetrate the mucosa and colonize the epithelial surface of
   the small intestine. In this study, we found that mucin, the major
   component of mucus, promoted V. cholerae movement on semisolid medium
   and in liquid medium. A genome-wide screen revealed that Vibrio
   polysaccharide (VPS) production was inversely correlated with
   mucin-enhanced motility. Mucin adhesion assays indicated that VPS bound
   to mucin. Moreover, we found that vps expression was reduced upon
   exposure to mucin. In an infant mouse colonization model, mutants that
   overexpressed VPS colonized less effectively than wild-type strains in
   more distal intestinal regions. These results suggest that V. cholerae
   is able to sense mucosal signals and modulate vps expression accordingly
   so as to promote fast motion in mucus, thus allowing for rapid spread
   throughout the intestines.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR) of
   polymers have focused on performing mechanical tests in the solid state.
   In this work, investigations in the melt state were carried out, to
   identify potential melt indicators for a relative measure of ESCR. A
   normalized characteristic relaxation time (lambda(N)), obtained from
   dynamic shear experiments, was established as a valid measure of ESCR of
   linear low density polyethylene, where a large content of short chain
   branches is present. In addition, the melt strain hardening coefficient
   (MSHC), obtained from extensional rheological methodologies, was found
   to be another potential and reliable indicator of ESCR. An inverse
   correlation between MSHC and ESCR was observed, indicating an inverse
   relationship between ESCR and chain extensibility in the melt.
   Furthermore, a new factor called ``melt hardening stiffness (mHS){''}
   was developed from the slope of a stress vs. Hencky strain obtained from
   a Sentmanat extensional rheometer. mHS was found to be another promising
   indicator of ESCR obtained from rheological studies conducted in this
   work.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Realistic driver models can play an important role in developing new
   driver assistance technologies. A realistic driver model can reduce the
   time-consuming trial-and-error process of designing and testing
   products, and thereby reduce the vehicle's development time and cost. A
   realistic model should provide both driver path planning and arm motions
   that are physiologically possible. The interaction forces between a
   driver's hand and steering wheel can influence control performance and
   steering feel. The aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive yet
   practical model of the driver and vehicle. Consequently, a neuromuscular
   driver model in conjunction with a high-fidelity vehicle model is
   developed to learn and understand more about the driver's performance
   and preferences, and their effect on vehicle control and stability. This
   driver model can provide insights into task performance and energy
   consumption of the driver, including fatigue and cocontraction dynamics
   of a steering task. In addition, this driver model in conjunction with a
   high-fidelity steering model can be used to develop new steering

Abstract = {{Dynamic charge carriers play a vital role in active photonic
   quantum/nanodevices, such as electrically pumped semiconductor lasers.
   Here we present a systematic experimental study of gain-providing
   charge-carrier distribution in a lasing interband cascade laser. The
   unique charge-carrier distribution profile in the quantum-well active
   region is quantitatively measured at nanometer scales by using a
   noninvasive scanning voltage microscopy technique. Experimental results
   clearly confirm the accumulation and spatial segregation of holes and
   electrons in the beating heart of the device. The measurement also shows
   that the charge-carrier density is essentially clamped in the presence
   of stimulated emission at low temperatures. The threshold charge-carrier
   density exhibits a linear but fairly weak temperature dependence, in
   contrast to the exponential temperature dependence of the threshold
   current. The experimental approach will lead to a deeper understanding
   of fundamental processes that govern the operation and performance of
   nanoelectronic devices, quantum devices and optoelectronic devices.}},

Title = {{Signatures of human impact: size distributions and spatial organization

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{More than 50\% of global wetland area has been lost over the last 200
   years, resulting in losses of habitat and species diversity as well as
   decreased hydrologic and biogeochemical functionality. Recognition of
   the magnitude of wetland loss as well as the wide variety of ecosystem
   services provided by wetlands has in recent decades led to an increased
   focus on wetland restoration. Restoration activities, however, often
   proceed in an ad hoc manner, with a focus on maximizing the total
   restored area rather than on other spatial attributes of the wetland
   network, which are less well understood. In this study, we have
   addressed the question of how human activities have altered the size
   distribution and spatial organization of wetlands over the Prairie
   Pothole Region of the Des Moines Lobe using high-resolution LIDAR data.
   Our results show that as well as the generally accepted 90\% loss of
   depressional wetland area, there has been a preferential loss of smaller
   wetlands, with a marked alteration of the historical power-law
   relationship observed between wetland size and frequency and a resulting
   homogenization of the wetland size distribution. In addition, our
   results show significant decreases in perimeter-to-area ratios,
   increased mean distances between wetlands, particularly between smaller
   wetlands, and a reduced likelihood that current wetlands will be located
   in upland areas. Such patterns of loss can lead to disproportionate
   losses of ecosystem services, as smaller wetlands with larger
   perimeter-to-area ratios have been found to provide higher rates of
   biogeochemical processing and groundwater recharge, while increased mean
   distances between wetlands hinder species migration and thus negatively
   impact biodiversity. These results suggest the need to gear restoration
   efforts toward understanding and recreating the size distribution and
   spatial organization of historical wetlands, rather than focusing
   primarily on an increase in overall area.}},

   generation units based on an optimizer that requires the forecasting of
   both renewable resources and loads. The forecasting system discussed in
   this paper includes a representation of the uncertainties associated
   with renewable resources and loads. The proposed modeling generates
   fuzzy prediction interval models that incorporate an uncertainty
   representation of future predictions. The model is demonstrated using
   solar and wind generation and local load data from a real microgrid in
   Huatacondo, Chile, for one-day ahead forecasts to obtain the expected
   values together with fuzzy prediction intervals to represent future
   measurement bounds with a certain coverage probability. The proposed
   prediction interval models would help to enable the development of
   robust microgrid EMS.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new modeling framework for analysis of impact and
   scheduling of price-responsive as well as controllable loads in a
   three-phase unbalanced distribution system. The price-responsive loads
   are assumed to be linearly or exponentially dependent on price, i.e.,
   demand reduces as price increases and vice versa. The effect of such
   uncontrolled price-responsive loads on the distribution feeder is
   studied as customers seek to reduce their energy cost. Secondly, a novel
   constant energy load model, which is controllable by the local
   distribution company (LDC), is proposed in this paper. A controllable
   load is one that can be scheduled by the LDC through remote signals,
   demand response programs, or customer-end home energy management
   systems. Minimization of cost of energy drawn by LDC, feeder losses, and
   customers cost pertaining to the controllable component of the load are
   considered as objectives from the LDCs and customers' perspective. The
   effect of a peak demand constraint on the controllability of the load is
   further examined. The proposed models are tested on two feeders: 1) the
   IEEE 13-node test feeder; and 2) a practical LDC feeder system. Detailed
   studies examine the operational aspects of price-responsive and
   controllable loads on the overall system. It is observed that the LDC
   controlled load model results in a more uniform system load profile, and
   that with a reduction in the peak demand cap, the energy drawn
   decreases, consequently reducing feeder losses and LDC's and customers'
   costs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel hierarchical control approach and new
   mathematical optimization models of greenhouses, which can be readily
   incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) in the context
   of smart grids to optimize the operation of their energy systems. In
   greenhouses, artificial lighting, CO2 production, and climate control
   systems consume considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of
   greenhouses appropriate for their optimal operation is proposed, so that
   it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing greenhouse
   control systems. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and
   demand charges while considering important parameters of greenhouses; in
   particular, inside temperature and humidity, CO2 concentration, and
   lighting levels should be kept within acceptable ranges. Therefore, the
   proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price
   information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing
   control systems in greenhouses. Effects of uncertainty in electricity
   price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage
   facilities are studied through Monte Carlo simulations. The presented
   simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to
   reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a simple method to fabricate controllable microscale
   wave structures on the top of regular interdigitated electrode (IDE)
   arrays using electrically-assisted lithography techniques. Smooth wave
   structures are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate
   using traditional multilayer photolithography technology. The fabricated
   wave structures were carefully measured using an optical profiler and
   the measured wave profiles were used in the numerical simulation of
   electrical field and for evaluating the parameters influencing the
   fabricated wave structure. It is demonstrated that the combined smooth
   wave structure and IDE array offer unique capability for particle
   manipulation including particle concentration, aggregation and
   separation. Particle motion manipulated via the combined wave structure
   and IDE array is governed by ac electroosmosis (ACEO), dielectrophoresis
   (DEP) or a combination of both depending on the applied frequency. At
   lower frequencies (similar to 30 kHz), ACEO dominates and particles are
   driven to move along the valleys of the wave structures; while at higher
   frequencies (similar to 200 kHz), DEP force dominates which concentrates
   particles at the peaks of the wave structures. In addition, varying the
   ac waveform from sine-wave to square-wave allows for dynamic control of
   particle motion. Size-dependent particle separation over the wave
   structure is also demonstrated for a mixture of 0.5 mu m and 2 mu m
   particles that are separated into two populations by the joint effects
   of drag and DEP forces when being pumped to flow via ACEO.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model for the electrothermomechanical analysis of
   out-of-plane deformation in resistively heated single-stepped beams is
   presented. The model takes into account the conductive heat transfer
   from the beam to the substrate in which it is anchored. It also
   considers the temperature dependence of the beam material properties and
   accounts for the locally enhanced resistive heating effect around the
   release holes in the beam to predict temperature distribution along the
   beam. Energy method and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory are used for the
   prediction of out-of-plane deformation and stress distribution of the
   beam, as well as the out-of-plane rotation at the middle of the beam.
   The model considers the nonuniformity of the air gap between the beam
   and the substrate and captures the resultant asymmetric temperature
   distribution along the beam. The out-of-plane rotations in the middle of
   the single-stepped beam predicted by the analytical model and measured
   experimentally agree within 10\%. The analytical model is then used to
   predict the maximum actuation current, which results in high temperature
   plastic deformation and agrees with the experiments within 5\%. The
   proposed analytical model provides a good approach for systematic design
   and analysis of out-of-plane electrothermal microactuators based on
   single-stepped beam design.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive impact of the human gut microbiota on its human host calls
   for a need to understand the types of communication that occur among the
   bacteria and their host. A metabolomics approach can provide a snapshot
   of the microbe-microbe interactions occurring as well as variations in
   the microbes from different hosts. In this study, metabolite profiles
   from an anaerobic continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) system
   supporting the growth of several consortia of bacteria representative of
   the human gut were established and compared. Cell-free supernatant
   samples were analyzed by 1D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy, producing spectra representative of the metabolic activity
   of a particular community at a given time. Using targeted profiling,
   specific metabolites were identified and quantified on the basis of NMR
   analyses. Metabolite profiles discriminated each bacterial community
   examined, demonstrating that there are significant differences in the
   microbiota metabolome between each cultured community. We also found
   unique compounds that were identifying features of individual bacterial
   consortia. These findings are important because they demonstrate that
   metabolite profiles of gut microbial ecosystems can be constructed by
   targeted profiling of NMR spectra. Moreover, examination of these
   profiles sheds light on the type of microbes present in the gut and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new performance improvement technique,
   window memoization, for software implementations of local image
   processing algorithms. Window memoization combines the memoization
   techniques proposed in software and hardware with data redundancy in
   image processing to improve the performance of local image processing
   algorithms. It minimizes the number of redundant computations performed
   on an image by identifying similar neighborhoods of pixels in the image
   and skipping the computations that are not necessary. This leads to
   performance improvement in software. We have developed an optimized
   architecture for window memoization in software and applied it to six
   image processing algorithms. We have also developed a performance model
   to predict the speedups obtained by window memoization in software. The
   typical (average) speedups range from 1.2x to 7.9x while the total

Title = {{Model of separation performance of bilinear gradients in scanning format

Abstract = {{Counter-flow gradient electrofocusing allows the simultaneous
   concentration and separation of analytes by generating a gradient in the
   total velocity of each analyte that is the sum of its electrophoretic
   velocity and the bulk counter-flow velocity. In the scanning format, the
   bulk counter-flow velocity is varying with time so that a number of
   analytes with large differences in electrophoretic mobility can be
   sequentially focused and passed by a single detection point. Studies
   have shown that nonlinear (such as a bilinear) velocity gradients along
   the separation channel can improve both peak capacity and separation
   resolution simultaneously, which cannot be realized by using a single
   linear gradient. Developing an effective separation system based on the
   scanning counter-flow nonlinear gradient electrofocusing technique
   usually requires extensive experimental and numerical efforts, which can
   be reduced significantly with the help of analytical models for design
   optimization and guiding experimental studies. Therefore, this study
   focuses on developing an analytical model to evaluate the separation
   performance of scanning counter-flow bilinear gradient electrofocusing
   methods. In particular, this model allows a bilinear gradient and a
   scanning rate to be optimized for the desired separation performance.
   The results based on this model indicate that any bilinear gradient
   provides a higher separation resolution (up to 100\%) compared to the
   linear case. This model is validated by numerical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) nanoparticles were prepared in a
   semi-batch differential microemulsion polymerization (DMP) system using
   sodium oleate as the emulsifier. The size of the SBR nanoparticles could
   be easily tailored by controlling the monomer addition speed, the
   reaction temperature, the composition of the monomer feed stream and the
   amount of a surfactant introduced to the process. The smallest particle
   size, which is about 8 nm, was achieved at 70 degrees C with a very low
   surfactant concentration (25 mM) as well as a reasonable conversion
   (72\%). Moreover, the effects of n-dodecyl mercaptan (n-DDM), which was
   used as the chain transfer agent, on the particle size and the reaction
   conversion were investigated. Larger spherical particles and higher
   reaction conversions were observed at a higher n-DDM concentration.
   n-DDM can well regulate the SBR molecular weight of a polymer and a
   higher n-DDM concentration resulted in a smaller molecular weight. The
   DMP is found to be a very effective approach that requires a minimum
   amount of surfactant to prepare fine-tuned polymeric nanoparticles. (C)

Abstract = {{The non-invasive detection of debonding conditions and cavities beneath
   the wall of a steel tank are common applications in a variety of
   engineering and construction fields. Compressional ultrasonic waves have
   been used for the evaluation of steel plate thicknesses; however, they
   lack energy for penetrating a Portland cement grout in contact with a
   steel wall to detect debonding conditions. In this work, a joint
   analysis of surface waves and Lamb waves (high and low frequency) is
   used for the detection of debonding conditions in a scale model grouting
   steel tank. The propagation of high frequency ultrasonic waves generated
   by a 50-kHz transmitter along the side of the tank model is analyzed in
   the time domain and the frequency domain. In addition, using
   instrumented hammers with plastic or aluminum tips (low frequency
   sources) and a 50-kHz transmitter, three different configurations are
   used for the analysis of surface waves. The low-frequency Rayleigh waves
   generated by the hammer are used for void detection. Fourier spectra of
   the measured signals indicate that the effect of a void on the waves
   propagating through the medium is reduced when there is debonding. The
   comparisons of theoretical (high frequency) dispersion curves with
   experimental ones, computed from frequency wavenumber (FK) spectra, show
   that Lamb waves dominate the surface response in the wall of the steel
   tank. High frequency Lamb waves are successfully used in the detection
   of debonding between the tank wall and the grout because of the lower
   attenuation measured on top of the void.}},

Abstract = {{The brazeability of AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy sheet to Sn-coated plain
   carbon steel sheet using a Mg-Al-Zn alloy filler metal and a diode laser
   heat source has been investigated. While the Sn coating promoted good
   wetting between the molten filler metal and the steel sheet, it did not
   play a role in forming the final metallic bond. Its primary function
   appeared to be in maintaining an oxide-free steel surface until the
   molten Mg filler metal could come in direct contact with the steel
   surface. In all cases, failure of transverse tensile shear test
   specimens of the joint occurred in the steel base metal. Metallic
   bonding between the magnesium alloy and the steel was facilitated by the
   formation of two transition layers, including a Fe(AI) solid solution
   formed on the surface of the steel and a nano-scale layer of
   Al-8(Mn,Fe)(5) phase on the Fe(AI) surface layer. Examination of the
   Fe(Al)-Al-8(Mn,Fe)(5) and Al-8(Mn,Fe)(5)-Mg interfaces using HR-TEM
   showed that orientation relationships (OR) with a low angle of rotation
   of the matching planes and low interplanar mismatch and therefore low
   interfacial energy density existed at the Fe(Al) Al-8(Mn,Fe)(5)
   interface (i.e., when {[}10 (1) over bar1](Al8Mn5)//{[}(1) over bar
   11]Fe(Al), \{110\}(Fe(Al)) was 4.2 deg from \{30 (3) over bar3\}(Al8Mn5)
   with 5.2\% interplanar mismatch) and a high angle of rotation of the
   matching planes and large interplanar mismatch, and therefore, high
   interfacial energy density existed at the Al8Mn5-Mg interface (i.e.,
   when {[}10 (1) over bar1](Al8Mn5)//{[}10 (1) over bar0]Mg, \{30 (3) over
   bar3\}(Al8Mn5) was within 47.4 deg of the \{0002\}(Mg) with 16.8\%

Abstract = {{Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, requiring
   surgical implantation of an intraocular lens. Despite evidence of
   leukocyte ingress into the postoperative lens, few studies have
   investigated the leukocyte response to intraocular lens materials. A
   novel coculture model was developed to examine macrophage activation by
   hydrophilic acrylic (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) and hydrophobic
   acrylic (polymethylmethacrylate) commercial intraocular lens. The human
   monocytic cell line THP-1 was differentiated into macrophages and
   cocultured with human lens epithelial cell line (HLE-B3) with or without
   an intraocular lens for one, two, four, or six days. Using flow
   cytometry and confocal microscopy, expression of the macrophage
   activation marker CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and
   production of reactive oxygen species via the fluorogenic probe
   2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate were examined in macrophages.
   -Smooth muscle actin, a transdifferentiation marker, was characterized
   in lens epithelial cells. The poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
   intraocular lens prevented adhesion but induced significant macrophage
   activation (p<0.03) versus control (no intraocular lens), while the
   polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens enabled adhesion and
   multinucleated fusion, but induced no significant activation. Coculture
   with either intraocular lens increased reactive oxygen species
   production in macrophages after one day (p<0.03) and increased
   expression of -smooth muscle actin in HLE B-3 after six days, although
   only poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) induced a significant difference
   versus control (p<0.01). Our results imply thatcontrary to prior uveal
   biocompatibility understandingmacrophage adherence is not necessary for
   a strong inflammatory response to an intraocular lens, with hydrophilic
   surfaces inducing higher activation than hydrophobic surfaces. These
   findings provide a new method of inquiry into uveal biocompatibility,
   specifically through the quantification of cell-surface markers of
   leukocyte activation.}},

   uncertain parameters and utilizes the measurement update stage of the
   unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to approximate the posterior. The second
   stage of UIS uses a mixture of approximate posterior computed in the
   first stage and a heavy tailed distribution as the proposal distribution
   for Bayesian importance sampling. UIS is repeated whenever new
   monitoring data becomes available. Two case studies were developed to
   study the UIS method and to compare it UKF and importance sampling (IS)
   methods: a non-linear analytical system model and synthesized CO2
   injection model using a numerical multi-phase flow simulator. In
   analytical case study, it is shown that UIS is more accurate than both
   UKF and traditional IS with static proposal and the relative accuracy of
   the UIS over traditional IS increases with dimensionality of the
   parameter space. The higher accuracy of UIS compared to UKF and
   traditional IS with static proposal is also shown in the CO2 injection
   case study. It is also shown that increasing number of samples and a
   defensive mixture distribution with a mixture ratio between 0.1 and 0.25
   enhances the performance of UIS.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{113-121}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Near surface mounting (NSM) is a promising strengthening technique
   provided that the full bond between the strengthening material and the
   existing structure develops. Wahab et al. (2011) reported fatigue bond
   failures by de-bonding between the CFRP rod and the epoxy that started
   at mid span. As the load was cycled, the de-bonding propagated towards
   the support. The model presented here describes the failure of those
   beams. The de-bonding was modeled as a crack growing at the interface
   between the CFRP rod and the epoxy where the driving force was the
   interfacial shear stresses between the CFRP rod and the epoxy. Once the
   stresses at the crack tip exceeded the allowable fatigue stresses
   between the CFRP rod and the epoxy, de-bonding occurred and the crack
   length increased. Ahead of the crack tip, the CFRP rod was fully bonded
   to the epoxy and the forces decayed exponentially. Behind the crack tip,
   the rod was partially de-bonded. The experimental and calculated number
   of cycles until excessive slipping between the CFRP rod and the epoxy
   occurred and the forces in the CFRP rod at all locations in the shear
   span at the onset of failure were in good agreement. Crown Copyright (C)

Journal = {{ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{98-114}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A study, entitled ``Wabamun Lake Sequestration Project{''} or
   ``WASP,{''} was performed to evaluate large-scale CO2 storage
   opportunities in the Wabamun area including potential risks. The project
   examined the feasibility of storing 20 megatons (Mt) of CO2 per year
   over 50 years. This scale is one order of magnitude larger than the
   typical benchmark (1 Mt/year) used in academic research and commercial
   projects that are currently in place or under review. The study was
   conducted by a group of researchers from several universities as well as
   industry consultants. This study presents an overview of the reservoir
   modeling part of this study, which the authors were responsible for. The
   main objectives of the reservoir modeling for WASP project were as
   follows: (1) estimation of storage capacity (traditionally, this value
   is projected based on the available pore space, but we have an
   additional practical consideration: the maximum amount one can inject
   within short period of time {[}similar to 50 years] and within a
   localized injection area {[}similar to 30 km x 90 km]); (2)
   investigation of CO2 plume movement and pressure distribution during and
   after injection including the effect of formation dip angle on the plume
   shape and its migration; (3) investigation of the long-term fate of
   injection associated with free phase CO2 (risks of leakage) and aquifer
   pressurization (possible geomechanical changes and related phenomena);
   (4) investigation of the phase behavior of H2S initially available and
   dissolved in brine during CO2 sequestration process. The WASP reservoir
   modeling study mentioned above led to a few important findings. The most
   important one is that, when CO2 is being injected into a sour aquifer,
   initially dissolved H2S will release into the expanding CO2 plume and
   accumulate at the leading edge of the plume. Also, the large-scale
   injection scheme (20 Mt/year), which requires multi well injectors,
   provides very different pressure response compared to a one well (1
   Mt/year) scenario.}},

Title = {{Bond of Reinforcement in Concrete Incorporating Recycled Concrete
   Aggregates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Using recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) as coarse aggregate in
   concrete has the potential to supplement current natural aggregate
   reserves, divert construction and demolition debris from landfills, and
   promote the adoption of sustainable civil infrastructure. As many of the
   design equations used to calculate structural concrete properties are
   based on empirical data for natural aggregate concrete, using these
   equations for RCA concrete may not be applicable. This study examined
   the bond of reinforcement in concrete produced using RCA as coarse
   aggregate. One natural aggregate (NA) and three RCA sources were
   evaluated and used as coarse aggregate in 14 separate concrete mixtures
   with four compressive strength levels. Various concrete mechanical
   properties, including compressive strength, splitting tensile strength,
   modulus of rupture, and fracture energy, were tested, and correlations
   between these properties and reinforcement bond were studied. The
   reinforcement bond was measured using 48 beam-end specimens
   incorporating several bonded lengths. The results showed that bond
   strength of RCA concrete was reduced by up to 21\% in comparison to NA
   concrete, and that there was a strong correlation between bond strength
   and coarse aggregate crushing strength. A regression model was developed
   to relate bond strength to coarse aggregate strength, concrete
   compressive strength, and the bonded length. Using this model,
   experimentally predicted development lengths were calculated to be up to
   9\% greater for RCA concrete members in comparison to NA concrete
   members. Overall, this study was directed at providing guidance on the
   evaluation of multiple RCA sources and their respective impact on the
   bond of reinforcement in structural concrete.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a performance characterization and efficient
   modeling of the dc-side interactions between renewable dc resources and
   interfacing voltage-source inverters (VSIs). The VSI is considered in
   both grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. On the other side,
   the dc source is modeled by an equivalent and a detailed circuit. In the
   former, an ideal current-source in parallel to a dc capacitor is used to
   represent a non-dispatchable source whereas an ideal dc voltage source
   is used to represent a dispatchable dc source. In the latter, an
   additional dc/dc boost converter interfaces the dc source to regulate
   the input dc-link voltage of the VSI. In all topologies,
   computationally-efficient small-signal admittance-based models, i. e.
   transfer-functions, are thoroughly developed for the dc source as well
   as the VSI. Using the Nyquist stability criterion, it is shown that the
   dc-link voltage dynamics is negatively affected under some operating
   conditions. The worst performance is yielded when the dc source is
   modeled by an ideal voltage source where the dc-link voltage is not
   controlled by the VSI. On the contrary, the dc/dc boost converter
   enhances the system damping. The dc-link voltage-controlling VSIs show
   the most damped performance. In order to enhance the system damping,
   active stabilizing compensators are proposed and embedded in the
   conventional control structure of VSIs. Large-signal time-domain
   simulation model is implemented under Matlab/Simulink environment to
   validate the small-signal models and show the effectiveness of the
   proposed compensators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An Efficient DCT-Based Image Compression System Based on Laplacian
   Transparent Composite Model}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{886-900}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a new probability model dubbed the Laplacian transparent
   composite model (LPTCM) was developed for DCT coefficients, which could
   identify outlier coefficients in addition to providing superior modeling
   accuracy. In this paper, we aim at exploring its applications to image
   compression. To this end, we propose an efficient nonpredictive image
   compression system, where quantization (including both hard-decision
   quantization (HDQ) and soft-decision quantization (SDQ)) and entropy
   coding are completely redesigned based on the LPTCM. When tested over
   standard test images, the proposed system achieves overall coding
   results that are among the best and similar to those of H.264 or HEVC
   intra (predictive) coding, in terms of rate versus visual quality. On
   the other hand, in terms of rate versus objective quality, it
   significantly outperforms baseline JPEG by more than 4.3 dB in PSNR on
   average, with a moderate increase on complexity, and ECEB, the
   state-of-the-art nonpredictive image coding, by 0.75 dB when SDQ is OFF
   (i.e., HDQ case), with the same level of computational complexity, and
   by 1 dB when SDQ is ON, at the cost of slight increase in complexity. In
   comparison with H.264 intracoding, our system provides an overall 0.4-dB
   gain or so, with dramatically reduced computational complexity; in
   comparison with HEVC intracoding, it offers comparable coding
   performance in the high-rate region or for complicated images, but with
   only less than 5\% of the HEVC intracoding complexity. In addition, our
   proposed system also offers multiresolution capability, which, together
   with its comparatively high coding efficiency and low complexity, makes
   it a good alternative for real-time image processing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing (FSP) is a solid state route with a capacity of
   preparing fine grained nanocomposites from metal sheets. In this work,
   we employed this process to finely distribute TiO2 nanoparticles
   throughout an Al-Mg alloy, aiming to enhance mechanical properties.
   Titanium dioxide particles (30 nm) were preplaced into grooves machined
   in the middle of the aluminium alloy sheet and multipass FSP was
   afforded. This process refined the grain structure of the aluminium
   alloy, distributed the hard nanoparticles in the matrix and promoted
   solid state chemical reactions at the interfaces of the metal/ceramic
   particles. Detailed optical and electron microscopic studies showed that
   the microstructural homogeneity was improved with repetition of FSP up
   to four passes. The average grain size of the nanocomposite was similar
   to 2 mu m, while nanometric MgO and Al3Ti particles were formed in situ
   and homogenously distributed in the metal matrix. Mechanical
   characterisations showed that the yield strength and elongation were
   increased from 93 +/- 5 MPa and 13.8\% to 117 +/- 3 MPa and 25.3\% after
   employing four-pass FSP. Fractographic studies also revealed that
   agglomerated TiO2 particles could operate as sites of crack initiation
   and propagation, which led to brittle fracture. By increasing the number
   of FSP passes, the agglomerates were disappeared and the ductility was
   enhanced remarkably.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly more and more organizations are opting for outsourcing data
   to remote cloud service providers (CSPs). Customers can rent the CSPs
   storage infrastructure to store and retrieve almost unlimited amount of
   data by paying fees metered in gigabyte/month. For an increased level of
   scalability, availability, and durability, some customers may want their
   data to be replicated on multiple servers across multiple data centers.
   The more copies the CSP is asked to store, the more fees the customers
   are charged. Therefore, customers need to have a strong guarantee that
   the CSP is storing all data copies that are agreed upon in the service
   contract, and all these copies are consistent with the most recent
   modifications issued by the customers. In this paper, we propose a
   map-based provable multicopy dynamic data possession (MB-PMDDP) scheme
   that has the following features: 1) it provides an evidence to the
   customers that the CSP is not cheating by storing fewer copies; 2) it
   supports outsourcing of dynamic data, i.e., it supports block-level
   operations, such as block modification, insertion, deletion, and append;
   and 3) it allows authorized users to seamlessly access the file copies
   stored by the CSP. We give a comparative analysis of the proposed
   MB-PMDDP scheme with a reference model obtained by extending existing
   provable possession of dynamic single-copy schemes. The theoretical
   analysis is validated through experimental results on a commercial cloud
   platform. In addition, we show the security against colluding servers,
   and discuss how to identify corrupted copies by slightly modifying the
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance and repair of wind turbine structures have become more
   challenging and at the same time essential as they evolve into larger
   dimensions or located in places with limited access. Even small
   structural damages may invoke catastrophic detriment to the integrity of
   the system. So, cost-effective, predictive, and reliable structural
   health monitoring (SHM) system has been always desirable for wind
   turbines. A real-time nondestructive SHM technique based on multisensor
   data fusion is proposed in this paper. The objective is to critically
   analyze and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique to
   identify and localize damages in wind turbine blades. The structural
   properties of the turbine blade before and after damage are investigated
   through different sets of finiteelement method simulations. Based on the
   obtained results, it is shown that information from smart sensors,
   measuring strains, and vibrations data, distributed over the turbine
   blades can be used to assist in more accurate damage detection and
   overall understanding of the health condition of blades. Data fusion
   technique is proposed to combine these two diagnostic tools to improve
   the detection system that provides a more robust reading with reduced
   false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{A fine-grained aluminum-matrix hybrid nanocomposite reinforced with
   TiO2, MgO and Al3Ti nanoparticles was prepared via reactive friction
   stir processing (FSP) of an Al-Mg sheet with pre-placed TiO2 particles
   (50 nm; 3.1 vol\%). The microstructure of the hybrid nanocomposite
   comprises high-angle grain boundaries (similar to 90\%) with an average
   size of 2 mu m and hard inclusions with sizes in the range of 30-50 nm.
   Evaluation of the hot deformation behavior of the nanocomposite by
   uniaxial tensile testing at different temperatures (300-450 degrees C)
   and strain rates (0.001-0.1 s(-1)) shows that the deformation apparent
   activation energy of the nanocomposite is 137 kJ mol(-1) at <= 300
   degrees C. The values of the activation energy for the Al-Mg alloy
   before and after FSP at this temperature range are about 105 and 135 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. This observation highlights the role of ultrafine
   hard particles and the structural changes induced by FSP on the
   deformation process. At the higher temperatures, the deformation
   activation energy for the aluminum alloy without and with the
   reinforcing particles is 303 and 456 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Detailed
   microstructural analysis by electron back scattered diffraction and
   transmission electron microscopy suggests that dynamic recrystallization
   is responsible for the deformation behavior at the elevated
   temperatures. Meanwhile, the presence of the hard nanoparticles operates
   as a grain growth inhibitor improving the thermal stability of the
   fine-grained aluminum alloy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing has been employed to produce metal matrix
   composites by incorporating reinforcement particles in an Al 5059
   matrix. The fabrication method involved repeated friction stir passes on
   a groove which contained powder reinforcements, with different
   processing parameters and tool geometries used for each pass. Various
   particles with sizes from 130 nm to 4.3 mu m, and different process
   parameters were examined to obtain a uniform distribution of particles
   within the stir zone. Mechanical properties (i.e. tensile and
   microhardness) of the Al 5059 matrix MMCs reinforced with Al2O3, SiC,
   and B4C with particle sizes of 130, 250, and 35 nm respectively were
   compared. Tensile tests showed 11\%, 20\%, and 38\% increases in yield
   strength compared to the matrix alloy for composites containing
   nano-scale Al2O3, SiC, and B4C, respectively. When 4.3 mu m Al2O3
   particles were employed, higher volume fractions could be achieved which
   resulted in a 32\% increase in yield strength compared to the base
   metal. The average microhardness value within the stir zone increased
   from 85 HV in the base material to a maximum of 170 HV in the
   B4C-reinforced composite. Nano-scale particles seem to be more effective
   to increase hardness by increasing the particle fraction in the produced

   Na doping enhances the charge/discharge rate capability. The structure
   of prepared samples was characterized by XRD: the c-axis lattice
   parameter increases with increase in the amount of Na ions
   (parameterized by x, above). The Na-doped sample with x = 0.05 shows
   capacities of 208 and 184 mA h g (-1) at high current densities of 1.0 C

   of 189 and 167 mA h g(-1) for the bare sample. The ratio of the capacity
   at 1.0 C to that at 0.1 C is enhanced from 77\% for the bare sample to
   84\% for the Na-doped sample with x = 0.05. The Li diffusion
   coefficients obtained from the galvanostatic intermittent titration
   technique (GITT) are higher for Na-doped samples than for the bare
   sample. In particular, the Na-doped sample (x = 0.05), in the potential
   range around 4 V, has a higher DLi+ value of 3.34 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1),
   compared with 1.35 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) for the bare sample. The
   Na-doped samples (0 < x < 0.075) show high capacity retention: the

Abstract = {{assembled on soft polymeric surfaces by the vertical deposition method.
   Both hydrophilic andhydrophobic polymers, polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA) and
   polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS), were employed assubstrates and were
   investigated for their influences on silica colloidal crystal
   formations. In SEM micrographs, silica colloidal crystals formed on both
   PVA and PDMS surfaces presented similar hexagonalalignment to those on
   glass. However, on the macroscopic scale, substrates were found to have
   a profoundinfluence on both the adhesion and structural behavior of
   silica colloidal crystals. Regarding interfacialadhesion, at low silica
   deposition concentrations, films of silica colloidal crystals would form
   uniformlyon glass and PVA but only form partially on PDMS due to the
   hydrophobic nature of the PDMS substrate. At high silica deposition
   concentrations, films of colloidal crystals formed on glass, PVA and
   PDMS surfaces; however, the colloidal crystal film delaminated from both
   glass and PVA surfaces; in contrast, theyremained intact on PDMS. In
   terms of structure, as the silica concentration increased, random
   microscopic to orderly macroscopic cracks were observed on samples
   deposited on glass and PVA, while onlyorderly macroscopic cracks were
   observed on PDMS. The high adhesion and stability of silica crystals
   onPDMS might be explained by the low elastic modulus of PDMS which
   allowed PDMS to deform to releasethe shrinkage stress that occurs during
   the self- assembly process. Water contact angle measurementsshowed that
   the colloidal crystals deposited on hydrophobic PDMS were unexpectedly
   hydrophobic, witha water contact angle ( WCA) around 120., while the
   WCAs were < 50. for those on hydrophilic surfaces. This phenomenon might
   be attributed to the migration of hydrophobic constituent in PDMS to the
   silicaparticles during the deposition process. This work provides
   fundamental insights and the first step to thepossible application of
   silica colloidal crystals on soft materials. c 2014 Elsevier B. V. All

Title = {{Facilitating risky project negotiation: An integrated approach using
   fuzzy real options, multicriteria analysis, and conflict analysis}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{544-557}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a risky project negotiation framework, comprising
   fuzzy real options, ordered weighted averaging (OWA), and the graph
   model of conflict resolution (GMCR). Fuzzy real options analysis is
   employed to evaluate risky projects where the value of managerial
   flexibility cannot be overlooked. For civil engineering project
   evaluation, OWA is used to estimate the parameters of the fuzzy real
   options model, such as initial values and volatilities, to reflect the
   risk preference of decision makers (DMs). Because it can take into
   account DMs' values and preferences for a risky project, GMCR is
   utilized to identify equilibria, or potential resolutions of the
   conflict, among all possible states, or combinations of DMs' choices.
   While an option pricing model is employed to estimate the values of
   decision makers (DMs) toward a risky project, all parts are integrated
   via fuzzy functions in this framework. A brownfield redevelopment case,
   the Ralgreen Community in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, is used as a
   typical risky project to demonstrate how to apply this integrated
   approach. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the
   comprehensive use of fuzzy methods to assess brownfield projects. For
   this purpose, stochastic methods face difficulties because risks cannot
   be fully reflected in market prices. Expert knowledge that is
   descriptive, multi-attribute, or subjective in nature can be effectively
   quantified using fuzzy representations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Quantum chemical calculations are performed using density functional

   donor-acceptor type conjugated polymer which ascertains the
   optoelectronic properties and plays a crucial role, especially in
   polymeric solar cell applications. In this paper, the most stable
   conformers of the FSeF monomer and its corresponding oligomers are
   investigated at the B3LYP/Def2TZV and B3LYP/LANL2DZ levels of theory,
   and their molecular structures are revealed. The band gap of the polymer
   is determined by linear-fitting and extrapolation of the DFT data. This
   gap is found to be 1.44 eV and 1.45 eV by the B3LYP/Def2TZV, and
   B3LYP/LANL2DZ with PCM calculations, respectively. Our theoretical
   findings related to the band gap of the FSeF polymer (PFSeF) are in good
   agreement with other experimental studies in the literature and, hence,
   the theoretical methods used in this study are promising for the design

Abstract = {{Bedload transport and bedform mobility in large gravel-bed rivers are
   not easily monitored, especially during floods. Large reaches present
   difficulties in bed access during flows for flow measurements. Because
   of these logistical issues, the current knowledge about bedload
   transport processes and bedform mobility lacks field-based information,
   while this missing information would precisely match river management
   needs. The lack of information linking channel evolution and particle
   displacements is even more striking in wandering reaches. The Durance
   River is a large, wandering, gravel-bed river (catchment area: 14,280
   km(2); mean width: 240 m), located in the southern French Alps and
   highly impacted by flow diversion and gravel mining. In order to improve
   current understanding of the link between sediment transport processes
   and river bed morphodynamics, we set up a sediment particle survey in
   the channel using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking and
   topographic surveys (GPS RTK and scour chains) for a 4-year recurrence
   interval flood. By combining topographic changes before and after a
   flood, intraflood erosion/deposition patterns from scour chains,
   differential routing of tracer particles, and spatial distribution of
   bed shear stress through a complex reach, this paper aims to define the
   critical shear stress for significant sediment mobility in this setting.
   Gravel tracking highlights displacement patterns in agreement with bar
   downstream migration and transport of particles across the riffle within
   this single flood event. Because no velocity measurements were possible
   during flood, a TELEMAC three-dimensional model helped interpret
   particle displacements by estimating spatial distribution of shear
   stresses and flow directions at peak flow. Although RFID tracking in a
   large, wandering, gravel-bed river does have some technical limitations
   (burial, recovery process time-consuming), it provides useful
   information on sediment routing through a riffle-pool sequence. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Traditional techniques for the growth of crystals are typically lengthy
   and are based on the slow over saturation of either solutions or melts.
   By contrast, the reactions of solids at moderate temperatures and
   pressures normally lead to the formation of powders of small
   crystallites. In this paper, we present a new and effective method to
   grow crystals of surprisingly large sizes (up to ca. 0.05 mm in the
   largest dimension). We use the reaction of {[}Ni(H2O)(6)](NO3)(2) with
   NH3(g) at room temperature to create macro crystals of
   {[}Ni(NH3)(6)](NO3)(2). The synthesis proceeds via simple ligand
   exchange and crystal growth is facilitated in situ via the solvent
   effect of the released water. The nitrate ammine product was
   characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) and Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM). This reaction is important since it demonstrates that
   aquo complexes can undergo facile ligand exchange with gaseous ammonia
   under realistic conditions for ammonia storage. The single crystal
   structure of {[}Ni(H2O)(6)] (NO3)(2) was determined for the first time
   below ambient temperature (at 100 K). The latter result offers 110
   evidence to support a previously postulated low temperature
   phase-transformation at 100 <= T/K <= 295. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Effects of ionic concentration gradient on electroosmotic flow (EOF)
   mixing of one stream of a high concentration electrolyte solution with a
   stream of a low concentration electrolyte solution in a microchannel are

   potential, dielectric constant and electric conductivity. The results
   show that the electric field and the flow velocity are non-uniform when
   the concentration dependence of these parameters is taken into
   consideration. It is also found that when the ionic concentration of the
   electrolyte solution is higher than 1 M, the electrolyte solution
   essentially cannot enter the channel due to the extremely low
   electroosmotic flow mobility. The effects of the concentration
   dependence of zeta potential, dielectric constant and electric

Title = {{Scheduling of Operations in a Large-Scale Scientific Services Facility

Abstract = {{Success of companies in the scientific services sector highly relies on
   the effective scheduling of operations as large numbers of samples from
   customers are received and analyzed and reports are generated for each
   sample. Therefore, it is extremely important to efficiently use all the
   various resources (labor and machine) for such facilities to remain
   competitive. This study focuses on the development of an algorithm to
   schedule operations in an actual large scale scientific services plant
   using models based on multicommodity flow (MCF) and integer linear
   programming (IP) techniques. The proposed scheduling algorithm aims to
   minimize the total turnaround time of the operations subject to
   capacity, resource, and flow constraints. The basic working principles
   of the optimization-based algorithm are illustrated with a small
   representative case study, while its relevance and significance are
   demonstrated through another case study of a real large scale plant. In
   the latter case study, the algorithms results are compared against
   historical data and results obtained by simulating the current policy
   implemented in the real plant, i.e., first-come, first-served. Besides
   obtaining significantly better results in terms of turnaround time, the
   results of the algorithm also displayed less variance when compared to
   historical data.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{294}},
Pages = {{376-389}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{An approach to handling uncertainty in Multiple Criteria Decision
   Analysis (MCDA) using grey numbers is proposed. The grey-based PROMETHEE
   II methodology is designed to represent and analyze decision problems
   under uncertainty, which are characterized by limited input data and
   uncertain preferences of Decision Makers (DMs). To begin with, the basic
   structure of a grey decision system is developed, including definitions,
   notation, and detailed calculation procedures. By integrating continuous
   grey numbers with linguistic expressions, each DM's uncertain preference
   according to multiple criteria can be expressed. The new methodology
   takes account of both quantitative and qualitative data, first
   aggregating the DMs' individual judgements on the performance of
   alternatives according to each criterion, and then integrating the
   criteria in order to determine the relative preference of any two
   alternatives. These preferences are then incorporated into the PROMETHEE
   II method to generate a complete ranking of alternatives. The
   methodology is illustrated using a case study in which source water
   protection strategies are ranked for Waterloo Region, Ontario, Canada.

Title = {{Multipseudopotential interaction: A solution for thermodynamic
   inconsistency in pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann models}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann (LB) models have been recognized as
   efficient numerical tools to simulate complex fluid systems, including
   those at thermodynamic equilibrium states and with phase transitions.
   However, when the equation of state (EOS) of real fluids is implemented,
   the existing pseudopotential LB models suffer from thermodynamic
   inconsistency. This study presents a multipseudopotential interparticle
   interaction (MPI) scheme, which is fully consistent with thermodynamics
   and applicable to engineering applications. In this framework, multiple
   pseudopotentials are employed to represent dominant interaction
   potentials at different extents of the mean free path of particles. By
   simulating van der Waals and Carnahan-Starling fluids, it is
   demonstrated that the MPI scheme can correctly simulate the physical
   nature of two-phase systems on the lattice including the continuum
   predictions of liquid-vapor coexistence states and the sound speeds in
   liquid and vapor phases. It is also shown that the lattice interactions
   of the MPI scheme represent underlying molecular interactions as they
   vary in a broad range from strong short-distance repulsions to weak
   long-distance attractions during phase transitions. Consequently, the
   MPI is proved to be a reliable LB scheme as it avoids generating
   unphysical potentials in implementing the EOSs of real fluids and
   limiting the spurious velocities at the interface of two-phase systems.
   Additionally, a straightforward procedure is suggested and discussed to
   preset the MPI system with the two-phase properties of a selected fluid.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{128-142}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a multirobot scheduling problem in which autonomous
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must be recharged during a long-term
   mission. The proposal is to introduce a separate team of dedicated
   charging robots that the UAVs can dock with in order to recharge. The
   goal is to schedule and plan minimum cost paths for charging robots such
   that they rendezvous with and replenish the UAVs, as needed, during the
   mission. The approach is to discretize the 3-D UAV flight trajectories
   into sets of projected charging points on the ground, thus allowing the
   problem to be abstracted onto a partitioned graph. Solutions consist of
   charging robot paths that collectively charge each of the UAVs. The
   problem is solved by first formulating the rendezvous planning problem
   to recharge each UAV once using both an integer linear program and a
   transformation to the Travelling Salesman Problem. The methods are then
   leveraged to plan recurring rendezvous' over longer horizons using fixed
   horizon and receding horizon strategies. Simulation results using
   realistic vehicle and battery models demonstrate the feasibility and
   robustness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents SOR, a vehicular social network to enable social
   communications and interactions among users on the road during their
   highway travels. Motivated by the limited connection to Internet
   contents and services, the essential goal of SOR is to encourage
   distributed users on the road to spontaneously contribute as the
   information producer, assembler, and distributer in order to provide
   timely and localized infotainments to each other through low-cost
   inter-vehicle communications. To be specific, SOR enables individual
   users to maintain a personal blog, similar to one on Facebook and
   Twitter, over which users can create and share personal content
   information to the public such as travel blogs with pictures and videos.
   By accessing each other's SOR blogs and commenting on interesting
   topics, passengers can exchange messages and initiate social
   interactions. In the specific highway environment, SOR addresses two
   challenges in the context of vehicular social communications. First,
   vehicular social communications tend to be frequently interrupted by
   diverse vehicle mobility and intermittent intervehicle connections,
   which is annoying to users. To address this issue, SOR adopts a
   proactive mechanism by estimating the connection time between peer
   vehicles, and recommending vehicles with relatively long-lasting and
   stable intervehicle connections for social communications. Second, as
   users on the road are typically strangers to each other, they are
   reluctant to disclose personal information to others. This makes it
   challenging to identify users of shared interests and accordingly
   restricts the scale of users' social interactions. To remedy that, SOR
   provides a secured solution to protect sensitive user information during
   social communications. Lastly, we use simulations to verify the
   performance of SOR.}},

Journal = {{IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Coordinated charging is an effective charging plan for PEVs to improve
   the overall system energy utilization and prevent the overload of an
   electric power grid. On the other hand, PEVs, which have energy storage
   and controllable loads, can be discharged to help the grid to smooth the
   fluctuations, for example, introduced by distributed generators (DGs).
   Either to prevent overloading or to regulate the power grid, most
   existing charging/discharging plans focus on temporal
   charging/discharging coordination for parked vehicles. However, for
   moving vehicles, spatial coordination can also bring benefits to the
   grid. For spatial coordination, the range anxiety problem should be
   carefully handled, since PEVs cannot reach some charging stations due to
   the limited battery levels. In this article, by exploiting both spatial
   and temporal coordinations, we introduce an online PEV
   charging/discharging strategy considering range anxieties. To collect
   real-time information for the proposed online strategy, a heterogeneous
   wireless infrastructure is proposed by integrating cellular networks
   with vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Challenging issues are
   discussed in terms of modeling PEV mobility, network selection for
   real-time information delivery, balancing the trade-off between the grid
   power utilization and drivers' preferences, and modeling business
   revenues for charging/discharging. Case studies demonstrate that joint
   spatial and temporal charging coordination can effectively improve power
   utilization and avoid overloading the power grid.}},

Abstract = {{An accelerated optimization method is developed to minimize required
   time and resources, and demonstrated for a 25 pm diameter Au ball
   bonding process. After a preparation phase to pre-set many parameters
   based on literature values, the values for more significant process
   parameters, impact force (IF) and EFO time (t(EFO)) for a given target
   bond geometry are optimized in a second phase, utilizing a 3(2) full
   factorial experiment and the response surface method (RSM). The target
   bond strength of 120 +/- 2 MPa is achieved in a third phase by
   optimizing the ultrasonic energy (US) parameter using an iterative
   method. For an example process with a target geometry of 58 mu m for the
   bonded ball diameter measured at the capillary imprint (BDC) and 16 mu m
   for the height of the bonded ball (BH), the optimized process parameters
   (phases 2 \& 3) can be found in less than 4 h. The values for IF and
   t(EFO) are found to be 424 mN and 0.474 ms, respectively. The bond is
   strengthened with incrementing US until additional ball deformation
   occurs. The bond strength achieved is >120 MPa with 48.6\% US. Other
   bonding parameters include EFO current (I-EFO) = 50 mA, temperature (T)
   = 158 degrees C, bond time (Bt) = 20 ms, and bond force (BF) = 185 mN.

Abstract = {{Drug-carriers, capable of releasing the drug at the target sites upon
   external stimuli, are attractive for theranostic applications. In recent
   years, photo-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) have received considerable
   attention because of their potentials in providing spatial, temporal,
   and dosage control over the drug release. However, most of the relevant
   technologies are still in the process of development and are
   unprocurable by the clinics. Here, we demonstrated facile fabrication of
   these photo-responsive NPs by loading hydrophilic gold NPs within
   thermo-responsive liposomes. Calcein was used as a model drug to
   evaluate the encapsulation efficiency and the release kinetic profile
   upon heat/light stimulation. Furthermore, we characterized their size,
   morphology, phase transition temperature and stability. Finally, we
   demonstrated that this photo-triggered release might be due to the
   membrane disruption caused by microbubble cavitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Subgroup analysis of PD tremor with loading: Action tremor as a
   combination of classical rest and physiological tremor}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{114-120}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: In Parkinson disease, tremor is a challenging symptom to
   manage, partly due to inadequate characterization. The current (classic)
   model of tremor is characterized by a resting tremor with a single
   strong peak in 3.5-6.5 Hz range. The presence of action tremor,
   including postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors, has been disputed in
   the literature but not comprehensively evaluated. Analysis of hand
   tremor in action compared to rest, and possible subgrouping of tremor
   trends, may improve characterization.
   Methods: Twenty Parkinson patients and 14 controls were recruited.
   Tremor amplitude was measured across 9 sequentially loaded tasks, in off
   and on medication states. Tremor energy was separated into 2 frequency
   bands (B1, 3:5-6.5 Hz; B2 = physiological tremor, 7.5-16.5 Hz) across
   all activity levels. Automatic classification was used for subgroup
   analysis.
   Findings: Automatic classification yielded 3 predominant tremor trends
   (G1, G2, and G3). These were significantly different from each other and
   from controls. G1 demonstrated closest resemblance to classical
   Parkinsonian tremor, with highest tremor energy at rest and with overall
   dominance in B1 for lower loads. G2-G3 did not show tremor energy
   dominance in either band. Medication reduced tremor energy only for G1
   in both B1 and B2.
   Interpretation: Subgrouping the loading effect on tremor is a novel and
   viable method of rationalizing (non-classic) action tremor in Parkinson
   disease. Rest and action tremors appear not to be limited to 3.5-6.5 Hz
   and may have considerable share of physiological tremor. Finding the
   contribution of each frequency band to total tremor energy and their
   trends with load may optimize therapy options. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{High-throughput particle counting by a differential resistive pulse
   sensing method in a microfluidic chip is presented in this paper. A
   sensitive differential microfluidic sensor with multiple detecting
   channels and one common reference channel was devised. To test the
   particle counting performance of this chip, an experimental system which
   consists of the microfluidic chip, electric resistors, an amplification
   circuit, a LabView based data acquisition device was developed. The
   influence of the common reference channel on the S/N of particle
   detection was investigated. The relationship between the hydraulic
   pressure drop applied across the detecting channel and the counting
   throughput was experimentally obtained. The experimental results show
   that the reference channel designed in this work can improve the S/N by
   ten times, thus enabling sensitive high-throughput particle counting.
   Because of the greatly improved S/N, the sensing gate with a size of 25
   x 50 x 10 mu m (W x L x H) in our chips can detect and count particles
   larger than 1.5 mu m in diameter. The counting throughput increases with
   the increase in the flowing velocity of the sample solution. An average
   throughput of 7140/min under a flow rate of 10 mu L/min was achieved.
   Comparing with other methods, the structure of the chip and particle
   detecting mechanism reported in this paper is simple and sensitive, and
   does not have the crosstalking problem. Counting throughput can be
   adjusted simply by changing the number of the detecting channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the suppression of dry-band arcing erosion of
   silicone rubber by alumina tri-hydrate and silica fillers in the DC
   inclined plane test, employing the wavelet based multiresolution
   analysis of leakage current. The third detail component of the leakage
   current as decomposed by the wavelet-based multiresolution analysis is
   shown to be an indicator of the effectiveness of the filler type in
   suppressing erosion by dry-band arcing. The addition of alumina
   tri-hydrate or silica filler to silicone rubber increases the thermal
   conductivity of the composites, retarding the development of the eroding
   temperature, and thus the evolution of the third detail. Additional
   effect is also obtained for the dehydration enthalpy, of alumina
   tri-hydrate in silicone rubber at a filler level of 30 wt\%, in impeding
   the development of hot spots on the tested surface. A reduction in the
   magnitude of the third detail is evident with filler level, indicating
   that the increasing volume of silica or alumina tri-hydrate reduces the
   temperature of the dry-band arcing plasma. Comparable levels of the
   leakage current third detail is found between 30 wt\% alumina
   tri-hydrate and silica filled composites which suggests the water of
   hydration plays a minor role in diluting the SiR but at 58 wt\% an
   internal oxidation mechanism that produces gases diluting the arcing
   phase appears to suppress erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Topical formulations, commonly applied for treatment of anterior eye
   diseases, require frequent administration due to rapid clearance from
   the ocular surface, typically through the lacrimal drainage system or
   through over-spillage onto the lids. We report on a mucoadhesive
   nanoparticle drug delivery system that may be used to prolong the
   precorneal residence time of encapsulated drugs. The nanoparticles were
   formed from self-assembly of block copolymers composed of poly(d,
   l-lactide) and Dextran. The enhanced mucoadhesion properties were
   achieved by surface functionalizing the nanoparticles with phenylboronic
   acid. The nanoparticles encapsulated up to 12 wt.\% of Cyclosporine A
   (CycA) and sustained the release for up to five days at a clinically
   relevant dose, which led us to explore the therapeutic efficacy of the
   formulation with reduced administration frequency. By administering
   CycA-loaded nanoparticles to dry eye-induced mice once a week,
   inflammatory infiltrates were eliminated and the ocular surface
   completely recovered. The same once a week dosage of the nanoparticles
   also showed no signs of physical irritation or inflammatory responses in
   acute (1 week) and chronic (12 weeks) studies in healthy rabbit eyes.
   These findings indicate that the nanoparticles may significantly reduce
   the frequency of administration for effective treatment of anterior eye
   diseases without causing ocular irritation.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites play a key role in performance improvements of hydroxide
   conductors employed in a wide range of alkalineelectrochemical systems
   such as fuel cells and metalair batteries. Graphene oxide (GO)
   nanosheets are considered to be outstanding nanofillers for polymeric
   nanocomposites on account of their excellent physicochemical strength
   and electrochemical properties. In this work, a fast hydroxide conductor
   was developed on the basis of a chemically modified GO nanocomposite
   membrane. The high surface area of GO was functionalized with highly
   stable hydroxide-conductive groups using a dimethyloctadecyl
   {[}3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (DMAOP) precursor, named
   QAFGO, and then composed with porous polybenzimidazole PBI (pPBI) as a
   well-suited polymeric backbone. The nanocomposite exhibited outstanding
   hydroxide conductivity of 0.085 S cm(1), high physicochemical strength,
   and electrochemical stability for 21 days. An alkaline fuel cell (AFC)
   setup was fabricated to determine the functionality of QAFGO/pPBI
   nanocomposite in an alkaline-based system. The high AFC performance with
   peak power density of 86.68 mW cm(2) demonstrated that QAFGO/pPBI
   nanocomposite membrane has promising potential to be employed as a
   reliable hydroxide conductor for electrochemical systems working in
   alkaline conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Providing high data rates with minimum energy consumption is a crucial
   challenge for next generation wireless networks. There are few papers in
   the literature which combine these two issues. This paper focuses on
   multi-hop wireless mesh networks using a MAC layer based on Spatial Time
   Division Multiple Access (S-TDMA). We develop an optimization framework
   based on linear programming to study the relationship between throughput
   and energy consumption. Our contributions are twofold. First, we
   formulate and solve, using column generation, a new MILP to compute
   offline energy-throughput tradeoff curve. We use a physical interference
   model where the nodes can perform continuous power control and can use a
   discrete set of data rates. Second, we highlight network engineering
   insights. We show, via numerical results, that power control and
   multi-rate functionalities allow optimal throughput to be reached, with
   lower energy consumption, using a mix of single hop and multi-hop

Abstract = {{Analysis of the available published data calls into question some of the
   reported effects of silver, graphene, and boron nitride nanoparticles on
   the cure behavior and glass transition temperature (T (g)) of
   epoxy-based conductive nanocomposites. The usefulness of most studies is
   limited, as the final T (g) value is only reported for a single
   composition. More useful studies provide a comparison of T (g) across
   compositions and/or to the T (g) of the neat matrix material. However,
   the main focus is on nanoparticle effect, while the presence of residual
   solvent is generally overlooked. Although the data are too sparse for
   firm conclusions, reductions in T (g) seem to correlate with a known
   residual solvent or mild degas conditions (low temperature, unagitated),
   while increases are more likely when no solvent is used or after
   rigorous degassing. Using solvent control groups to differentiate
   solvent effects from filler effects, we conducted our own differential
   scanning calorimetry experiments. It was found that silver
   microparticles have no statistically significant effect on T (g), but
   appeared to when solvent content was not accounted for. The erroneous
   apparent effect is very similar to reported effects for nanoparticles in
   the literature. If a solvent must be used, we recommend that the
   residual solvent content be quantified and provide the T (g) of a
   control sample with a representative solvent content without
   nanoparticles. Analysis of the present literature also suggests that (i)
   nanoparticle surface chemistry has a significant effect and (ii) poor
   dispersion/aggregation results in a reduction in T-g.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have received much attention
   for cellular delivery of therapeutic molecules. However, in the case of
   CPPs as carriers for siRNA delivery, their utility is often restricted
   by low cellular uptake and/or entrapment in endosomes. Here, in order to
   deliver siRNAs with high efficiency, oligoarginine, a prominent member
   in CPPs, is rationally modified with oligohistidine and stearyl moieties
   (STR-) by fully taking into account the formation of nanoparticles,
   uptake and intracellular trafficking. We show that when the ratio of
   histidine/arginine in a peptide sequence is >1.5, pronounced gene
   silencing is induced. Following this rule, STR-HnR8 (n = 16 and 20) are
   developed, which show a high knockdown efficiency rarely reported
   before. Finally, we find that endosomal escape of siRNA induced by
   stearylated and oligohistidylated oligoarginine is only from
   ``proton-sponge{''} effect. Taken together, our results suggest a new
   strategy for the improvement of CPP-based siRNA delivery systems. (C)

Abstract = {{An electrokinetic microfluidic chip is developed to detect and sort
   target cells by size from human blood samples. Target-cell detection is
   achieved by a differential resistive pulse sensor (RPS) based on the
   size difference between the target cell and other cells. Once a target
   cell is detected, the detected RPS signal will automatically actuate an
   electromagnetic pump built in a microchannel to push the target cell
   into a collecting channel. This method was applied to automatically
   detect and sort A549 cells and T-lymphocytes from a peripheral fingertip
   blood sample. The viability of A549 cells sorted in the collecting well
   was verified by Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide staining. The results
   show that as many as 100 target cells per minute can be sorted out from
   the sample solution and thus is particularly suitable for sorting very
   rare target cells, such as circulating tumor cells. The actuation of the
   electromagnetic valve has no influence on RPS cell detection and the
   consequent cell-sorting process. The viability of the collected A549
   cell is not impacted by the applied electric field when the cell passes
   the RPS detection area. The device described in this article is simple,
   automatic, and label-free and has wide applications in size-based rare
   target cell sorting for medical diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the capacitance and conductance of the through
   silicon vias (TSVs) with consideration of the multilayer media along the
   vertical direction and different shapes. According to the moment method,
   the capacitance and conductance of the straight and two types of tapered
   TSVs are calculated and compared with those of the conventional 2-D
   method. It is shown that the capacitance calculated by the 2-D method
   for the straight TSVs will produce a large error when the radius and
   pitch of the TSVs become larger. For the two types of tapered TSVs,
   their capacitance decreases with the increase in the slop angle and the
   pitch due to less surface area and capacitance coupling, respectively.
   Therefore, the tapered TSVs with larger slop angle and pitch are
   beneficial to reduce the propagation delay. With the increase in the
   pitch, the conductance of both the straight and the tapered TSVs
   increases slightly at low frequency, while it decreases at high
   frequency. All the results by the method in this paper agree well with
   those of the electromagnetic simulations up to 40 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{A least-squares-based adaptive algorithm with forgetting factor is
   proposed for localization of a target by a mobile distance measurement
   sensor. This problem, in its most general form, was tackled in a recent
   paper using a gradient adaptive algorithm, assuming distance
   measurements are directly available. We establish that the proposed
   algorithm bears the same stability and convergence properties as the
   gradient algorithm previously studied. It is demonstrated via
   simulations that the proposed algorithm converges significantly faster
   to the location estimates than the gradient algorithm for high
   forgetting factor values and significantly reduces the noise effects for
   small values of the forgetting factor. Furthermore, a more challenging
   form of the original problem is considered, where distance information
   is required to be deduced from time of flight measurements, considering
   a time of flight-based active distance measurement sensor and an
   environment with unknown signal permittivity/speed; the proposed
   algorithm is redesigned to solve this problem. Copyright (c) 2014 John

   electrolyte is investigated. The optimized electrolyte containing 10
   wt\% MMT exhibits ionic conductivity of 3.22 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 60 A
   degrees C, a value that meets the operation requirements of an all
   solid-state sulfur cell. At 60 A degrees C, all solid-state Li/S
   batteries using PEO/MMT solid polymer electrolyte display a good cycling
   performance, delivering 998 mAh g(-1) initial discharge capacities and
   retaining a reversible specific discharge capacity of 634 mAh g(-1)
   after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate. At a higher rate of 0.5 C, the
   solid-state batteries still could deliver an acceptable specific
   discharge capacity of 643 mAh g(-1) at 60 A degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{The electrodeposition of Co-Ni alloys is investigated to examine the
   mechanistic effects of chloride, sulfate and saccharin on the resulting
   alloy composition, deposition current efficiency and partial current
   densities of the cathodic reactions. When deposition is carried out in
   chloride, sulfate or mixed sulfate-chloride solutions without saccharin,
   the influence of hydrogen evolution (HER) becomes dominant and
   deleterious at higher overpotentials, leading to very low metal
   deposition current efficiency and the formation of a hydroxide/oxide
   film on the substrate. This problem is significantly reduced when
   saccharin is added to the mixed sulfate-chloride plating bath and to a
   lesser extent the sulfate-only solution. Although saccharin is
   ineffective in suppressing H+ reduction at low overpotentials, it is
   very effective at inhibiting H2O reduction at high overpotentials and
   enabling metal deposition to more easily occur. The system follows
   anomalous behavior at all current densities both in the absence and
   presence of saccharin, although it approaches normal behavior as the
   current density increases toward -1,000 A m(-2) due to Co(II) reduction
   being mass transfer-controlled.}},

Title = {{Vacuum deposited ternary mixture organic solar cells}},

Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{229-239}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ternary mixtures of photo-active organic materials are an intuitive
   approach to achieve enhanced photocurrent in organic solar cells (OSCs).
   In this work, we study ternary mixtures of vacuum deposited small
   molecules, complementing the recent surge of interest in solution
   processed ternary OSCs. The mixed layer composition is systematically
   varied to study all possible film configurations, and the resulting OSCs
   are successful in harvesting photocurrent from all three components to
   grant broad spectral photoresponse. However, the performance of the
   ternary OSC is generally less than the binary OSC, largely due to
   reduced fill factors. By examining ternary OSC transient photocurrents
   and multi-donor planar heterojunction devices, we demonstrate that the
   ternary OSC is strongly affected by the energy levels of its constituent
   materials, with small differences in the two donor materials' highest
   occupied molecular orbitals degrading hole transport. The results stress
   the importance of fine molecular engineering for ternary OSCs, and
   further hint that the enhancements commonly observed in solution
   processed ternary OSCs may in part be associated with morphological
   variations that are not present in vacuum deposited OSCs. The research
   verifies that, by designing small molecules with specific energy levels,
   ternary OSCs provide an alternative pathway to low cost, high efficiency
   photovoltaics in lieu of more complicated device architectures. (C) 2014

   phase differences,-phi. Changing phi caused variation of the results,
   which can be highlighted as significantly augmented and dramatically
   damped dynamic stall loads, both increasing and decreasing trends for
   vortex growth time during phi increase, a shifted location of the
   maximum loads and a change in the order of the vortex pair circulation
   in each cycle. The results showed strong dependency on the velocity and
   acceleration of the freestream during dynamic stall, which categorized
   the results in four individual subdomains with different behaviors.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{To study the effects of ground motion spatial variations on curved
   bridges, this paper presents a shake-table test for a 1/10-scale typical
   curved bridge under spatial ground motions, including wave passage
   effect, local site effect, and ground motion multidimensionality. The
   experimental results show that both wave passage and local site effects
   have significant influence on seismic responses of curved bridges. Wave
   passage effect on curved bridges is attributed primarily to the higher
   asymmetric modes and pseudostatic displacements induced by asynchronous
   excitations, whereas local site effect is more obvious for structures
   with fundamental frequencies close to the predominant frequencies of the
   sites. Compared with straight bridges, the curvature radius causes
   curved bridges to be more sensitive to ground motion spatial variations,
   especially the local site effect. Therefore, curved bridges may be
   damaged more seriously than straight bridges during the same earthquake.
   Furthermore, seismic responses of irregular curved bridges are more
   sensitive to ground motion multidimensionality than are those of
   straight bridges. In this experiment, the effects of bridge abutments
   and nonuniform sites along the bridge were not considered. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A simplified physics-based model is developed to predict the performance
   of an LiFePO4 cathode at various operating and design conditions.
   Newman's full-order porous-electrode model is simplified using
   polynomial approximations for electrolyte variables at the
   electrode-level while a multi-particle model featuring variable
   solid-state diffusivity is employed at the particle level. The
   computational time of this reduced-order model is decreased by almost
   one order of magnitude compared to the full-order model without
   sacrificing the accuracy of the results. The model is general and can be

Abstract = {{A modified hydrogen bubble technique is developed for simultaneous
   three-dimensional flow visualization and surface visualization on bluff
   bodies. A detailed description of the technique implementation and
   operating principles is presented. The technique is validated on two
   geometries: (1) a uniform circular cylinder for Re-D = 1,050 and 2,100;
   and (2) a dual-step cylinder for Re-D = 2,100, D/d = 2, and L/D = 0.5.
   The results demonstrate that flow visualizations effectively capture
   intricate three-dimensional wake vortex development including the
   formation of streamwise structures and vortex interactions in the wake
   of a dual-step cylinder. The surface visualizations capture boundary
   layer separation and its variation along the span of the models.
   Moreover, the results reveal complex three-dimensional surface flow
   patterns, shedding light on the topology of vortical structures forming
   near dual-step cylinder junctions.}},

Abstract = {{The damping-induced self-recovery phenomenon is well understood for
   finite-dimensional mechanical systems. In this paper, we discover a
   self-recovery phenomenon in a composite system that consists of a
   cylindrical vessel and a surrounding fluid, where the vessel is equipped
   with an internal rotor and the fluid is incompressible and viscous. In
   the system dynamics, interactions between the vessel and the ambient
   fluid are fully taken into account. A combination of the Lyapunov method
   and the final-value theorem is applied for analysis of the dynamics. It
   is mathematically shown that after the spin of the rotor comes to a
   complete stop in finite time or exponentially as time tends to infinity,
   the vessel, which has deviated from its initial position due to the
   reaction to rotor spinning, converges back to its initial position as
   time tends to infinity, and so does every fluid particle. An
   experimental test is conducted to verify the occurrence of this
   phenomenon. The simultaneous self-recovery of the vessel and the fluid
   to the initial configuration is induced by the fluid viscosity as if the
   viscosity has a memory of the initial configuration. We envision that
   our discovery may be useful in designing and operating mechatronic
   systems interacting with fluids such as underwater vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the veracity of claims, reported in the
   literature, that slow heating of Al-Si coated boron steel blanks in a
   roller hearth furnace can allow sufficient diffusion of iron from the
   steel substrate to the coating and prevent liquefaction of the Al-Si
   layer. The results of differential scanning calorimetry experiments
   conducted at various heating rates indicate that melting cannot be
   avoided under realistic industrial heating conditions. Heating rates as
   low as 0.08 K/s as well as isothermal heat treatments at 550 degrees C
   for 60 min are insufficient to prevent melting of the binary Al-Si layer
   at the eutectic temperature. A two-stage treatment in which the coating
   was pre-treated up to 650 degrees C to form solid Al-Si-Fe
   intermetallics is investigated. Intermetallic formation at 650 degrees C
   is shown to occur very quickly due to the enhanced iron diffusion in the
   liquid Al-Si phase. The coating of pre-treated blanks does not melt
   during the second stage of the heat treatment; however the properties of
   the final component obtained via this two-stage heat treatment remain to
   be assessed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To increase membrane fouling resistance a new membrane post-treatment
   process, i.e solvent induced microswelling, was used to increase
   membrane surface hydrophilicity and smoothness. Driven by interfacial
   free energy minimization, the surface of microporous membranes will
   reassemble when exposed to a dilute aqueous solution of a suitable
   solvent. To prove this concept, three commercial membranes for water
   treatment were used: a polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane and
   poly(vinylidene fluoride) ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes.
   The membrane physiochemical properties were characterized by pure water
   permeation, contact angle, X-ray-photoelectron spectroscopy and
   roughness measurements. After the membranes were post-treated with
   dilute aqueous solutions of a suitable solvent, membrane surface
   hydrophilicity and smoothness were effectively increased while the
   permeance of pure water was maintained. After 18 h of permeation using
   surface water, the modified poly(vinylidene fluoride) ultrafiltration
   membrane exhibited a 50\% higher flux and the same permeate water
   quality compared to the unmodified membrane. The microswelling
   conditions (including processing time and temperature, type and amount
   of solvents) affected the extent of the surface reassembly and thus the
   surface properties and anti-fouling behavior. These results show that
   microswelling treatment induced by dilute solvent solutions is a
   promising method for altering membrane surface properties for fouling
   control in drinking water treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The redox initiator, cumene hydroperoxide/tetraethylenepentamine
   (CHPO/TEPA), was used to initiate the emulsion polymerizations of
   styrene and methyl methacrylate (MMA). The hydrophobic CHPO acting as
   oxidizer would interact with the hydrophilic TEPA employed as the
   reducer at the particle-water interface where the vinyl monomer is
   present. The kinetics of the styrene and MMA polymerizations were
   studied under a temperature range of 30-70 degrees C. The polymerization
   rate, the concentration of monomer in the particles, the average number
   of latex particles and the number of radicals per particle were
   investigated to evaluate the propagation rate constant during interval
   II of the polymerization. With increasing temperature, the number of
   latex particles increases while the monomer concentration in the
   particles slightly decreases. The observed number of radicals per
   particle, calculated from the number average volume of the particles and
   the relation between the entry rate coefficients of free radicals into
   the particles and the exit rate coefficients of free radicals from the
   particle, was found to be approximately 0.47 and 0.5 in case of styrene
   and MMA polymerization, respectively. The calculation shows that the
   propagation rate constant, k(p)=6.84x10(7)e(-37.65/RT) and
   k(p)=3.4x10(7)e(-31.05/RT) L/mol s for styrene and MMA polymerizations

Abstract = {{As humans age, a characteristic pattern of widespread neocortical
   dendritic disruption coupled with compensatory effects in hippocampus
   and other subcortical structures is shown in postmortem investigations.
   It is now possible to address age-related effects on gray matter (GM)
   neuritic organization and density in humans using multishell
   diffusion-weighted MRI and the neurite-orientation dispersion and
   density imaging (NODDI) model. In 45 healthy individuals across the
   adult lifespan (21-84 years), we used a multishell diffusion imaging and
   the NODDI model to assess the intraneurite volume fraction and neurite
   orientation-dispersion index (ODI) in GM tissues. Wealso determined the
   functional correlates of variations inGMmicrostructure by obtaining
   resting-state fMRI and behavioral data. We found a significant
   age-related deficit in neocortical ODI (most prominently in
   frontoparietal regions), whereas increased ODI was observed in
   hippocampus and cerebellum with advancing age. Neocortical ODI
   outperformed cortical thickness and white matter fractional anisotropy
   for the prediction of chronological age in the same individuals. Higher
   GM ODI sampled from resting-state networks with known age-related
   susceptibility (default mode and visual association networks) was
   associated with increased functional connectivity of these networks,
   whereas the task-positive networks tended to show no association or even
   decreased connectivity. Frontal pole ODI mediated the negative
   relationship of age with executive function, whereas hippocampal ODI
   mediated the positive relationship of age with executive function. Our
   in vivo findings align very closely with the postmortem data and provide
   evidence for vulnerability and compensatory neural mechanisms of aging
   in GM microstructure that have functional and cognitive impact in vivo.}},

Title = {{Effect of interactions between Ni and Mo on catalytic properties of a
   bimetallic Ni-Mo/Al2O3 propane reforming catalyst}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{490}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{The effect of promoting a 15 wt.\% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with small amounts
   of Mo (0.1 and 0.5 wt.\%) to produce Hy via propane oxidative steam
   reforming was investigated. Activity and stability experiments run at
   450 degrees C showed that the 0.1 wt.\% Mo-promoted catalyst had higher
   H-2 propane conversion, higher Hy yields and showed superior performance
   in terms of resisting deactivation by coking. Different characterization
   techniques show that the impact on activity, selectivity and stability
   are driven by an electronic effect of Mo on Ni, even with such small
   amounts. For example, oxygen storage capacity measurements revealed
   higher oxygen mobility over the promoted catalyst surface. This high O-2
   mobility led to higher gasification rates of carbonaceous species,
   leading to higher H-2 yields and preventing coking of the catalyst.
   In-situ DRIFTS experiments also showed that the addition of Mo affected
   the stability of adsorbed reaction intermediates on the catalyst
   surface. Higher CO yields over the Mo-promoted catalyst resulted from
   weak adsorption or rapid desorption of CO in the presence of these small
   amounts of Mo. These changes in intermediate species stabilities
   affected some pathways in the general propane oxidative steam reforming
   scheme. Weak adsorption of CO also decreased the amount further oxidized
   to CO2 while the increased oxidation of CHx species lowered the amount
   hydrogenated to CH4. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Welding of nanomaterials is a promising technique for constructing
   nanodevices with robust mechanical properties. To date, fabrication of
   these devices is limited because of difficulties in restricting damage
   to the nanomaterials during the welding process. In this work, by
   utilizing very low fluence (similar to 900 mu J cm(-2)) femtosecond (fs)
   laser irradiation, we have produced a metallic interconnection between
   two adjacent silver (Ag) submicron/nanoparticles which were fixed on a
   silicon (Si) wafer after fs laser deposition. No additional filler
   material was used, and the connected particles remain almost damage
   free. Observation of the morphology before and after joining and finite
   difference time domain simulations indicate that the interconnection can
   be attributed to plasmonic excitation in the Ag submicron/nanoparticles.
   Concentration of energy between the particles leads to local ablation
   followed by re-deposition of the ablated material to form a bridging
   link that joins the two particles. This welding technique shows
   potential applications in the fabrication of nanodevices.}},

   dehydration units}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{421-428}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Natural gas is an extremely vital supply of energy. Compared to other
   fossil fuels, demand for natural gas is experiencing a considerable
   growth due to its accessibility, availability, versatility and smaller
   environmental footprint. Glycol dehydration is the most common and
   economic method of water removal from natural gas streams. The water
   content of the dehydrated gas depends primarily on the lean triethylene
   glycol (TEG) concentration. Injecting stripping gas into the reboiler is
   taken into account as an effective way to improve the glycol
   concentration. In this article, two intelligent approaches including
   multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and least squares support
   vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm are utilized to predict optimum
   stripping gas flow rate in natural gas dehydration systems. Furthermore,
   a simple mathematical tool is presented for the application of interest.
   Based on the statistical analysis, an excellent match is noticed between
   the values obtained from the predictive tools (e. g., MLP, LSSVM and the
   empirical equations) and the real data so that the average absolute
   relative deviation percent (AARD \%) is determined to be lower than
   0.01\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Synergistic Bifunctional Catalyst Design based on Perovskite Oxide
   Nanoparticles and Intertwined Carbon Nanotubes for Rechargeable Zinc-Air
   Battery Applications}},

Abstract = {{Advanced morphology of intertwined core-corona structured bifunctional
   catalyst (IT-CCBC) is introduced where perovskite lanthanum nickel oxide
   nanoparticles (LaNiO3 NP) are encapsulated by high surface area network
   of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) to produce highly active and
   durable bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable metal-air battery
   applications. The unique composite morphology of IT-CCBC not only
   enhances the charge transport property by providing rapid
   electron-conduction pathway but also facilitates in diffusion of
   hydroxyl and oxygen reactants through the highly porous framework.
   Confirmed by electrochemical half-cell testing, IT-CCBC in fact exhibits
   very strong synergy between LaNiO3 NP and NCNT demonstrating
   bifunctionality with significantly improved catalytic activities of
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
   Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-art catalysts, IT-CCBC
   outperforms Pt/C and Ir/C in terms of ORR and OER, respectively, and
   shows improved electrochemical stability compared to them after cycle
   degradation testing. The practicality of the catalyst is corroborated by
   testing in a realistic rechargeable zinc-air battery utilizing
   atmospheric air in ambient conditions, where IT-CCBC demonstrates
   superior charge and discharge voltages and long-term cycle stability
   with virtually no battery voltage fading. These improved electrochemical
   properties of the catalyst are attributed to the nanosized dimensions of
   LaNiO3 NP controlled by simple hydrothermal technique, which enables
   prolific growth of and encapsulation by highly porous NCNT network. The
   excellent electrochemical results presented in this study highlight
   IT-CCBC as highly efficient and commercially viable bifunctional
   catalyst for rechargeable metal-air battery applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the femtosecond laser-induced crystallization of CuNiSnP
   amorphous ribbons was investigated by utilizing an amplified Ti:sapphire
   laser system. X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscope were
   applied to examine the phase and morphology changes of the amorphous
   ribbons. Micromachining without crystallization, surface patterning, and
   selective crystallization were successfully achieved by changing laser
   parameters. Obvious crystallization occurred under the condition that
   the laser fluence was smaller than the ablation threshold, indicating
   that the structural evolution of the material depends strongly on the
   laser parameters. Back cooling method was used to inhibit heat
   accumulation; a reversible transformation between the disordered
   amorphous and crystalline phases can be achieved by using this method.

   multiphase flows}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper makes the first attempt of extending implicit AUSM-family
   schemes to multiphase flow simulations. Water faucet, air-water shock
   tube and oscillating manometer problems are used as benchmark tests with
   the generic four-equation two-fluid model. For solving the equations
   implicitly, Newton's method along with a sparse matrix solver (UMFPACK
   solver) is employed, and the numerical Jacobian matrix is calculated.
   Comparison between implicit and explicit AUSM-family schemes is
   presented, indicating that similarly accurate results are obtained with
   both schemes. Furthermore, the water faucet problem is solved using both
   staggered and collocated grids. This investigation helps integrate
   high-resolution schemes into staggered-grid-based computational
   algorithms. The influence of the interface pressure correction on the
   simulation results is also examined. Results show that the interfacial
   pressure correction introduces numerical dissipation. However, this
   dissipation cannot eliminate the overshoots because of the
   incompatibility of numerical discretization of the conservative and
   non-conservative terms in the governing equations. The comparison of CPU
   time between implicit and explicit schemes is also studied, indicating
   that the implicit scheme is capable of improving the computational
   efficiency over its explicit counterpart. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify the correlation between microstructure of
   mechanically processed olivine powders and the milling energy input, for
   an ultimate purpose of optimizing the ball milling approach for
   achieving the best CO2 sequestration characteristics. Powders were
   processed in a high energy magneto ball mill. A variety of instrumental
   techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized
   to characterize the particle size, specific surface area, pore volume,
   crystallinity and crystallite size of processes powders obtained with
   different levels of milling energy input. In each case, the variation of
   microstructural parameters with milling energy is compared for different
   milling devices extracted from the literature. Structural parameters of
   activated powders are correlated as a function of milling energy input,
   regardless of the ball mill type. The optimal range of milling energy
   input, expected to achieve the most desirable microstructure for CO2
   sequestration is found to be about 55 kJ/g. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{620}},
Pages = {{76-84}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{A strategy is proposed to enhance the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of Mg-Zn alloys by combining microalloying additions of the
   rare earth element Ce and the non-rare earth element Ca. The double
   additions of Ce-Ca are found to significantly increase tensile
   elongation compared to binary Mg-Zn, or single additions of either Ce or
   Ca. Microstructure analysis reveals that the Ce-Ca additions increase
   ductility by modifying texture and refining grain size. Texture
   modification is attributed to solute effects from the microalloying
   elements, particularly Ca, while grain refinement is additionally
   influenced by a fine dispersion of Mg6Ca2Zn3 precipitates that form
   during rolling and pin grain boundaries. The microalloying element
   additions also lead to large secondary phase particles in the alloys,
   which can limit ductility enhancement by promoting early fracture. By
   scaling Zn content in the Mg-Zn-Ce-Ca alloys, the Mg6Ca2Zn3 phase
   fraction and Zn solute content can be controlled for optimum ductility
   or strengthening potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Submerged friction-stir processing under cryogenic conditions was
   employed to fabricate ultrafine-grained nanocomposites with enhanced
   mechanical characteristics. Al-Mg alloy sheet with 3 vol\% TiO2
   nanoparticles were processed under air (ambient temperature), a
   water-dry ice medium (similar to-25 degrees C), and liquid nitrogen. It
   is shown that a homogenous distribution of reinforcement particles
   throughout the metal matrix is attained at a rotational speed of 1400
   rpm and a traverse velocity of 50 mm/min after 4 passes. In situ
   formation of Al3Ti and MgO nanophases during multi-pass processing is
   shown by transmission electron microscopy. Under the cryogenic cooling
   condition, ultrafine grains and cellular structures with sizes smaller
   than 1 mu m and 200 nm are attained. It is shown that the formation of
   an ultrafine-grained structure is accompanied with significant
   improvement (150-200\%) in the mechanical strength. The tensile yield
   strength of similar to 170 MPa, elongation of similar to 22\% and
   Vickers hardness of similar to 165 HV are attained. A change in the
   fracture mode from ductile-brittle to fully ductile is presented when
   the cryogenic processing is employed. A relationship between the grain
   size and the fracture features is demonstrated. Effects of cooling
   conditions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of friction
   stir processed Al-based nanocomposites are addressed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors consider the robust adaptive attitude
   synchronisation problem for a network of rigid body agents using a
   modified version of the error function, which is recently introduced for
   constructing the attitude errors on SO(3). These attitude error vectors
   are particularly useful for networks with large initial attitude
   difference. They focus on devising an adaptive geometric approach to
   cope with situations where the inertia matrices are not available for
   measurement. The Frobenious norm is used as a measure for the difference
   between the actual values of moments of inertias and their estimated
   values, to construct the individual adaptive laws of agents. Compared to
   the previous methods for synchronisation on SO(3) such as those using
   quaternions, the authors' approach based on the introduced modified
   error function enables us to avoid any ambiguity for attitude
   representation. Finally, they study the robustness of the
   synchronisation task in the presence of external disturbances and
   unmodelled dynamics and propose a method to attenuate such effects.
   Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of smartphones is retarded by energy inefficient
   applications and energy bugs. These energy bugs severely impact the user
   experience and cause significant user frustrations. To detect energy
   bugs, we need to characterize the power consumption behaviour of
   software. To achieve that, we develop an operational definition of
   energy bugs that can be easily translated to a procedure to detect them
   in smartphones. We integrate the proposed definition with a diagnostic
   framework to provide a step-by-step procedure for application
   developers. Using the proposed testing framework, we can investigate the
   existence of energy bugs when apps or platforms evolve. We validate the
   proposed framework with experiments and realistic energy bug examples.
   The results show that there are energy bugs across different versions of
   the same app as well as across different versions of the same
   smartphone.}},

Abstract = {{We study two metrics in stochastic consensus dynamics with leaders or
   stubborn agents: network coherence (defined in terms of the system H-2
   and H-infinity norms), and convergence rate. We allow each agent to
   maintain an individual level of stubbornness in deviating from its
   initial values. We give bounds on the convergence rate and present
   sufficient conditions under which the bounds become tight. Moreover we
   study the effect of the level of stubbornness of the agents on network
   coherence and convergence rate. We then characterize these two metrics
   in random regular graphs and Erdos-Renyi random graphs. From a leader
   selection point of view, we show that maximizing H-infinity coherence is
   equivalent to maximizing convergence rate. Moreover we study conditions
   under which the optimal leader for maximizing H-2 coherence differs from
   the optimal leader for maximizing convergence rate, and conversely,
   provide sufficient conditions on the network for a single leader to
   maximize both metrics simultaneously.}},
