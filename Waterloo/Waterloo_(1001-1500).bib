Abstract = {{This paper presents a push-pull Doherty power amplifier (PPDPA) with an
   octave bandwidth. It includes balanced to unbalanced (balun)
   transformers, which are custom designed to limit the dispersion of the
   second harmonic terminations seen by the main and auxiliary transistors.
   When integrated into the broadband impedance inverter, the resulting
   combiner network allows for maintaining proper load modulation and
   consequently high efficiency at back-off (BO) for more than an octave
   bandwidth. A mixed-signal PPDPA demonstrator was successfully designed
   using two packaged 90 Watt GaN transistors. It demonstrated drain
   efficiencies (DEs) of 52-64\% and 51-58\% at full and 6 dB BO powers,
   respectively, across a fractional bandwidth of 80\% (0.6 GHz-1.4 GHz).
   It also maintained an output power of about 51.5 dBm +/- 1.5 dB.}},

Abstract = {{During the estimation phase of megaprojects, many traits must be
   addressed and taken into account in order to obtain realistic results.
   Objectives, influential factors, and their interdependencies must be
   accurately identified and measured. As part of this process, it is
   crucial to determine the uncertainty around project objectives as well
   as risk events that may impact the project on various levels. This paper
   proposes a method of defining and incorporating the uncertainty and risk
   events around the two main objectives of any megaproject (i.e., cost and
   schedule). To serve this purpose, a stochastic event simulation model
   which operates based on Monte Carlo simulation and uses Microsoft
   Project (TM) and @Risk for Microsoft Excel (TM) as an integrated
   simulation platform has been developed. The goal of the proposed model
   is to incorporate uncertainty and risk into the project schedule and
   assess the variations of the model output with respect to the
   deterministic estimation of cost and schedule. The focus of this study
   is on megaprojects that incorporate both sequential construction
   activities as well as cyclical manufacturing activities. The project
   used to validate this approach is a nuclear plant Retube and Feeder
   Replacement (RFR) project in Ontario, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Given that labor is one of the most important resources in a
   construction project, collecting field data on workers' activities
   (i.e., work sampling) is critical to understanding and managing workers'
   performance for a productivity analysis. Unlike manual observation used
   for work sampling, automated action recognition and analysis using
   sensors, such as motion and image sensors, enable continuous worker
   monitoring and corresponding task assessment. Among diverse sensors, an
   accelerometer has great potential for automated action recognition due
   to its data richness and mobility. In this paper, we propose wrist-worn
   accelerometer-based action recognition with selected features and
   classifiers and apply it to masonry work to demonstrate its feasibility.
   The novelty of this approach is the use of a single affordable
   wrist-worn sensor, which would not interfere with workers' ongoing work.
   The result shows that Multilayer Perceptron classifier can achieve about
   97\% of accuracy in posture classification in masonry work. The proposed
   approach has an immense potential to be used for non-intrusive action
   recognition for construction workers, which can open a door for diverse
   productivity analyses.}},

   emitter to the overall emission current would lead to non-uniform field
   emission (FE) performance and emitter failure. Therefore, we propose a
   novel field emission microscopy (FEM) method that allows us to visualize
   and record the FE performance of each emitter in free standing CNT
   arrays. In this study, this method successfully leads us to record and
   observe that about 70\% of the emitters participate in the FE and two of
   them make a very strong FE contribution in an 11x11 freestanding CNT
   array. This study proves that this method will facilitate the study of
   FE non-uniformity and emitter failure mechanism by overcoming the
   difficulty of observing and quantifying FE performance of each emitter

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of streaming media applications, there has been a
   strong demand of objective models that can predict end users'
   quality-of-experience (QoE) when watching the video being streamed to
   their display devices. Existing methods typically use bitrate and global
   statistics of stalling events as the QoE indicators. This is problematic
   for two reasons. First, using the same bitrate to encode different video
   content could result in drastically different presentation QoE. Second,
   the interactions between presentation visual quality and playback
   stalling are not accounted for. Here we propose a novel QoE prediction
   approach that takes into consideration the instantaneous quality
   degradation due to perceptual video presentation impairment, the
   playback stalling events caused by imperfect network delivery, and the
   instantaneous interactions between presentation quality and playback
   stalling. The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong promise when tested
   using a subject-rated video streaming QoE database.}},

Abstract = {{Joint decoding is employed in many coding schemes to achieve a larger
   rate region. However, decoding complexity escalates considerably when
   joint decoding is used. This paper studies the achievable sum-rate of
   the two-user Gaussian interference channel when joint decoding is
   replaced by successive decoding. When interference is weak, it is shown
   that, for a wide range of transmitters' powers, rate-splitting and joint
   decoding are not required. A single split scheme with successive
   decoding achieves the Han-Kobayashi sum-rate. When rate-splitting is
   required, a novel rate-splitting scheme is proposed that does not use
   joint decoding. The number of required splits and the amount of power
   allocated to each split are expressed in closed forms. It is proved that
   the difference between the sum-rate of this scheme and that of the
   Han-Kobayashi scheme is bounded, even when transmitters' powers approach
   infinity.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, many countries spend billions of dollars on the development
   of renewable energy sources, especially wind generation, to counter the
   effects of global warming and in response to other environmental
   concerns. Given the increasing number of remotely located large power
   offshore wind farms, power sharing control and voltage regulation are
   significant challenges in the development of large multi-terminal
   voltage source converter high-voltage direct current (MT VSC-HVDC)
   transmission grids. Additionally, a wind power curtailment algorithm is
   needed in cases of high wind-power generation during low power demand
   from onshore AC networks. This work presents a power sharing control and
   wind power curtailment algorithm. This algorithm is based on selecting
   the optimal droop parameters of the power receiving converters and the
   reference power output for the offshore wind farms to share the offshore
   wind energy to the MT HVDC network among different AC grids based on
   desired shares. These desired power shares are defined to fulfill the

Abstract = {{Natural gas, a fuel source that provides power generation and heating
   application, offers significant emissions and efficiency improvements
   over coal. The majority of natural gas is obtained through non-renewable
   deposits; however, it is possible to generate methane through the
   creation of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). RNG is generated when biogas
   composed of CO2 and CH4 is methanated through the addition of hydrogen.
   An alternative sustainable pathway, however, is the creation of Hydrogen
   Enriched Natural Gas (HENG). HENG is created from the addition of
   hydrogen, in low volume percentages, to create a blend that emits less
   greenhouse gasses per unit of energy. The hydrogen used to create RNG
   and HENG can be generated from electrolysis using surplus electricity.
   Using surplus electricity, during off-peak hours, helps a jurisdiction
   effectively manage the power grid. As demonstrated through this case
   study the use of RNG and HENG to be utilized within the natural gas
   network can create an overall positive impact in any jurisdiction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a renewable hydrogen powered micro-grid is developed that
   is capable of supporting a community in islanded mode or while the macro
   grid is active. To accomplish this task, different renewable energy
   based technologies, such as Solar PVs, wind turbines, electrolysers,
   hydrogen tanks and fuel cells are considered. The energy hub approach is
   used for the modeling, which enables the provision of smart grid
   services and allows the management of both the energy generation and the
   energy loads of an entire community. As a case study, a community
   consisting of a large distribution center and a residential complex is
   considered. The micro grid is responsible for meeting the electricity
   demands of the community as well as supplying hydrogen for the forklifts
   and hydrogen vehicles. The hydrogen can be used directly as fuel for a
   fuel cell forklift, or vehicle, and for the generation of electricity
   via vehicles for the bi-directional grid connection, which allows the
   option to supply electricity during peak hours by means of stored
   hydrogen energy. The objective of this work is to find the optimum size
   of the different renewable technologies for the micro-grid considering

Abstract = {{Geometrical discontinues such as notches need to be carefully analysed
   by engineers because of the stress concentration generated by them.
   Notches become even more important when the component is subjected, in
   service, to very severe conditions, such as the high temperature fatigue
   and imposed visco-plastic behaviour such as creep.
   The aim of the paper is to present an improvement and extension of the
   existing notch tip creep stress-strain analysis method developed by
   Nunez and Glinka, validated for U-notches only, to a wide variety of
   blunt V-notches.
   The key in getting the extension to blunt V-notches is the assumption of
   the generalized Lazzarin-Tovo solution that allows a unified approach to
   the evaluation of linear elastic stress fields in the neighbourhood of
   both cracks and notches. Numerous examples have been analysed up to
   date, and the stress fields obtained according to the proposed method
   were compared with appropriate finite element data, showing a very good

Abstract = {{This paper reports the absorption of SO2 in a transversal flow hollow
   fiber membrane contactor (HFMC) using water at 27 degrees C.
   Experimental results show that gas and liquid flow rates can be
   regulated independently without causing operational failures in the
   HFMC. High SO2 removal efficiencies could be achieved at water flow
   rates from 194 and 463 mL min(-1), gas flow rates between 8276 and 18073
   mL min(-1), and the inlet SO2 concentration of 2000 ppm. The SO2 removal
   efficiency increased with increasing liquid flow rate and decreasing gas
   flow rate. The overall volumetric gas phase mass transfer coefficient
   (K(G)a) of the HFMC is in the range of 10(-3) mol s(-1) m(-3)Pa (-1). It
   is higher than that of conventional wet SO2 scrubbers although water is
   used in HFMC while effective alkaline absorbents are used in the
   compared reactors. It indicates that the HFMC is superior in SO2
   absorption over conventional absorbers.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging paradigm of the Internet of Everything, along with the
   increasing demand of Internet services everywhere, results in a
   remarkable and continuous growth of the global Internet traffic. As a
   cost-effective Internet access solution, WiFi networks currently
   generate a major portion of the global Internet traffic. Furthermore,
   the number of WiFi public hotspots worldwide is expected to increase by
   more than sevenfold by 2018. To face this huge increase in the number of
   densely deployed WiFi networks, and the massive amount of data to be
   supported by these networks in indoor and outdoor environments, it is
   necessary to improve the current WiFi standard and define specifications
   for high efficiency wireless local area networks (HEWs). This paper
   presents potential techniques that can be applied for HEWs, in order to
   achieve the required performance in dense HEW deployment scenarios, as
   expected in the near future. The HEW solutions under consideration
   includes physical layer techniques, medium access control layer
   strategies, spatial frequency reuse schemes, and power saving
   mechanisms. To accurately assess a newly proposed HEW scheme, we discuss
   suitable evaluation methodologies, by defining simulation scenarios that
   represent future HEW usage models, performance metrics that reflect HEW
   user experience, traffic models for dominant HEW applications, and
   channel models for indoor and outdoor HEW deployments. Finally, we
   highlight open issues for future HEW research and development.}},

Abstract = {{Residue Number Systems (RNS) have been a topic of interest for years.
   Many previous works show that RNS is a good candidate for fast
   computations in asymmetric cryptography by using its intrinsic
   parallelization features. A recent result demonstrates that redundant
   RNS and modular reduction can fit together efficiently, providing an
   efficient RNS modular reduction algorithm owning a single-fault
   detection capability. In this paper, we propose to generalize this
   approach by protecting the classical Cox-Rower architecture against
   multi-fault attacks. We prove that faults occuring at different places
   and at different times can be detected with a linear cost for the
   architecture and a constant time for the execution.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a wide variety of different texture descriptors has
   been proposed, including many LBP variants. New types of descriptors
   based on multistage convolutional networks and deep learning have also
   emerged. In different papers the performance comparison of the proposed
   methods to earlier approaches is mainly done with some well-known
   texture datasets, with differing classifiers and testing protocols, and
   often not using the best sets of parameter values and multiple scales
   for the comparative methods. Very important aspects such as
   computational complexity and effects of poor image quality are often
   neglected.
   In this paper, we propose a new extensive benchmark (RoTeB) for
   measuring the robustness of texture operators against different
   classification challenges, including changes in rotation, scale,
   illumination, viewpoint, number of classes, different types of image
   degradation, and computational complexity. Fourteen datasets from the
   eight most commonly used texture sources are used in the benchmark. An
   extensive evaluation of the recent most promising LBP variants and some
   non-LBP descriptors based on deep convolutional networks is carried out.
   The best overall performance is obtained for the Median Robust Extended
   Local Binary Pattern (MRELBP) feature. For textures with very large
   appearance variations, Fisher vector pooling of deep Convolutional
   Neural Networks is clearly the best, but at the cost of very high
   computational complexity. The sensitivity to image degradations and
   computational complexity are among the key problems for most of the
   methods considered.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the variable solid-state diffusivity concept, a semi-physical
   model is developed to simulate the electrochemical performance of
   commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) and graphite electrodes. Although the developed
   model is not accurately describing the phase change process within the
   active material, it is reliable for engineering applications such as
   battery management, thermal analysis and management, and aging studies.
   The developed LFP and graphite models extend previous works by
   validating the models against galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments
   conducted at various currents (C/5 to 5C) and temperatures (10 degrees
   C, 23 degrees C, 35 degrees C, and 45 degrees C). The fidelity of the
   model is confirmed by the satisfactory fit of the model to the
   experimental data for two different materials over a wide range of
   operating conditions. Temperature dependency of transport and kinetic
   properties of LFP and graphite is analyzed, and yields the activation
   energies of 86 kJ mol(-1) and 20 kJ mol(-1) for diffusion of
   intercalated species in LFP and graphite particles, respectively. The
   activation energies for charge transfer reaction at the surface of LFP
   and graphite particles are also found to be 9 kJ mol(-1) and 20 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. The estimated kinetic and transport parameters
   and their temperature dependencies can be reliably used in thermal,
   electrochemical, or aging modeling of batteries involving these two
   materials. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are limited by the
   sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, necessitating
   the use of platinum-based catalysts for practical use. However, such
   catalysts suffer from degradation issues related to the catalyst and the
   support material that prevent prolonged operation. Sulfur-doped graphene
   (SG) as a catalyst support material promises high durability with pure
   Pt, but its contribution to lattice-strained Pt as in bimetallic alloys
   has not yet been determined. In this work, platinum-nickel alloy
   nanoparticles with SG are synthesized (denoted as Pt-Ni/SG), then
   chemically dealloyed (denoted as Pt-Ni/SG-DA) and finally subjected to a
   post heat treatment (denoted as Pt-Ni/SG-PHT). The prepared catalysts
   Pt-Ni/SG, Pt-Ni/SG-DA and Pt-Ni/SG-PHT are physically characterized and
   electrochemically tested in half-cell conditions. Pt-Ni/SG-PHT is found
   to be superior, exhibiting the highest ECSA and mass activity retention
   with losses of 27 and 28\% respectively after 1500 cycles from 0.05 to
   1.3 V vs. RHE in HClO4. This is compared to a 59\% ECSA loss and 69\%
   activity loss for commercial Pt/C under the same conditions. Hence, the
   strong interaction between the metal particles and sulfur-doped graphene
   resulting from the annealing process as in Pt-Ni/SG-PHT yields a highly
   stable electrocatalyst for the ORR.}},

   the impact of adding tactile sensations to audio-visual (AV)

   roller coaster with a fully immersive AV simulator. The impact of adding
   tactile sensations through the addition of tactile actuation is studied.
   Although the subjects perceived no difference in presence or motion
   sickness, quantitative measurements of anterior body sway seem to
   indicate that there is less impairment with the tactile haptic
   sensations. Additional subjects will be added to ascertain the
   statistical significance of this finding in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the end to end distortion of transmission of a
   layered encoded source over a cooperative relay broadcast channel. A
   jointly optimised source-channel code is proposed to multicast a
   two-layered encoded source to two destinations. A degraded discrete
   memoryless broadcast channel is assumed, where the first destination
   with better channel conditions decodes both layers consisting of the
   common base layer and the refining layer for source reconstruction at a
   higher quality. Meanwhile, the second destination only decodes the base
   layer for a lower quality reconstruction of the source. The first
   destination cooperates in transmitting the common base layer to the
   second destination using a decode-forward (DF) relaying protocol over an
   orthogonal receive component (ORC) relay channel. An inner bound on the
   capacity region of the ORC-DF cooperative broadcast channel with a
   degraded message set is derived and the end to end distortion of
   reconstructing the source at both of the destinations is characterized.
   The achievable rate region and distortion performance of such network
   are demonstrated to outperform another variant of a DF-based cooperative
   broadcast channel, as well as with the non-cooperative broadcast
   channel.}},

   applications in medical diagnosis from deriving vascular mechanical
   properties to calculating wall shear stress (WSS). Contrast enhanced

   segmentation in 3D CEUS images. The intra-lumen signal inhomogeneity and
   weak signal from tissue-vessel boundary in CEUS images create
   difficulties for existing methods. This study aims to develop a 3D

Abstract = {{An annular cell has been reported with improved transmit sensitivity
   over a conventional circular cell for air-coupled CMUTs. The particular
   geometry of an annular cell also allows multi of them to be arranged in
   a concentric layout such that high-intensity ultrasound can be focused
   in the depth direction. This paper presents a 9.3-mm-diameter CMUT array
   consisting of four concentric annular cells. The wafer-bonded CMUT has a
   plate thickness of 18.3 mu m and cell width of 930 mu m. Under
   atmospheric pressure, the ratio of average-to-maximum displacement
   (RAMD) of the annular cells was measured to be 0.53 using a
   profilometer. At 200-V DC bias and 20-Vpp AC actuation voltage, the
   frequency response of the maximum displacement was measured using a
   laser Doppler vibrometer, and a resonance frequency of 182.5 kHz was
   observed. At the same DC bias, the resonance frequency of the array was
   also measured to be 182.5 kHz using a vector network analyzer. Based on
   the frequency response, the acoustic filed of the CMUT array was
   simulated to have an 11.4-mm natural focal depth with -3-dB beam width
   of 3.14 mm. This study demonstrates the potential of using concentric
   annular-cell CMUT array to generate focused ultrasound in air.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation is to determine if the heterogeneous
   sonoporation depends on the microbubble size. Using a customized
   ultrasound exposure and observation setup, we observed sonoporation
   dynamics at the single-cell level and quantified exogenous molecular
   uptake levels to evaluate the degree of sonoporation. The non-uniform
   size distribution of SonoVue microbubbles themselves allowed us to
   analyze the influence of bubble size on sonoporation. 1 MHz ultrasound
   with 10-mu s duration and 0.6 MPa peak rarefactional pressure was used
   to induce the inertial collapse of microbubbles. Our data revealed the
   relationship between the microbubble size (diameter: D) and the
   heterogeneity of sonoporation when the bubble-to-cell distance was
   fixed. 1) The localized collapse of relatively small bubbles (D < 5.5 mu
   m) led to predictable sonoporation, the degree of which correlated with
   the bubble-to-cell distance (d). No sonoporation was observed when dID >
   1, whereas reversible sonoporation occurred when d/D < 1. 2) Large
   bubbles (D > 5.5 mu m) exhibited translational movement over large
   distances, resulting in unpredictable sonoporation. Translation towards
   the cell surface led to reversible or irreversible sonoporation, and
   translation away from the cell caused either no or reversible
   sonoporation. 3) Theoretical calculations indicated a nonlinear
   dependency of the primary radiation force on the bubble diameter, and
   the large bubbles were more strongly influenced by the radiation force.}},

Abstract = {{Minimum variance beamformer has high potential in improving image
   quality through an adaptive apodization weight optimization approach,
   but its impact is conventionally limited to lateral resolution
   enhancements. Recently, we reported a high range resolution technique
   that applies minimum variance beamformer to the frequency components of
   the RF signal after a delay-and-sum process. The technique has high
   performance in the improvement of the range resolution when a target has
   flat interfaces, such as a longitudinal section of an artery. In the
   present study, we report further advance of this technique to enhance
   image quality of a normal swine eye whose anatomy is marked by multiple
   layers of curved interfaces. The reference signal is acquired by the
   coherent integration of the echoes from isolated interfaces to take
   account of the attenuation and the interface shape. The proposed
   technique succeeded to offer a sharp rendering of the cornea boundaries
   of the swine eye, where the center frequency of the transmit ultrasound
   pulse was 12 MHz. Computationally, it required 5 seconds using a laptop
   PC with a single CPU for the depiction of an image in the ROI that
   consists of 422,528 pixels. We reckon that, if the proposed technique is
   implemented using GPUs, high-quality images of the eye (with both
   lateral and range resolution enhancements) can be readily achieved in
   real time.}},

   developed based on a three-dimensional linear inverted pendulum model
   and zero moment point stability criterion. In order to estimate the

   proposed which guarantees robustness of the control loop through loop
   transfer recovery and provides asymptotic stability of the error
   covariance. This approach necessitates developing and utilizing forward
   and inverse kinematic analysis. Inverse kinematic relations are employed
   within the controller as an estimator of joint angles given positions of
   the zero moment point and center of mass trajectories. The results show
   effectiveness of the proposed preview controller and the observer scheme

Abstract = {{It has long been a challenge to control the end-effector trajectory of
   mechanical manipulators using only taskspace parameterization. While
   there exist some taskspace control strategies (such as the potential
   energy shaping) that guarantee the convergence of the end-effector to
   the target point without any inverse transformations, how to make the
   end-effector follow a desired path during the intermediate motion or to
   make it remain in certain subsets of taskspace, without resorting to
   inverse kinematics or inverse dynamics in one way or other, is still
   challenging. This paper studies the gyroscopic force as an auxiliary
   control action that can realize the desired motion profile of the
   end-effector without using any inverse transformations. Gyroscopic force
   is a specific type of force that does not affect the mechanical energy
   because its direction is always orthogonal to the velocity. This paper
   presents several ways to parameterize the artificial gyroscopic force
   with respect to the desired path profile of the end-effector as well as
   the desired velocity field that is often used as an indirect way to
   specify the target path. The formulated gyroscopic force is combined
   with the taskspace potential energy shaping control law to achieve the
   target tracking and the path following at the same time free from any
   inverse transformation. Simulation results are presented to validate the
   performance of proposed control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Many people develop lasting social bonds by playing games together, and
   there are a variety of games available so that individuals are likely to
   find games that appeal to their specific play preferences, abilities,
   and available time. However, there are many instances where people might
   want to play together, but would normally choose vastly different games
   for themselves, due to these various asymmetries in play experiences,
   such as grandparents and grandchildren, highly skilled players and
   novices, or even simply two players that enjoy different games. In this
   work, we aim to improve the design of asymmetric games-games that are
   designed to embrace and leverage differences between players to improve
   multiplayer engagement. This paper builds upon prior work to describe
   the elements of asymmetry that can be used to design such games, and
   uses these elements in the design of an asymmetric game, Beam Me `Round
   Scotty! We present the results of a thematic analysis of a player
   experience study, discuss these findings, and propose an initial
   conceptual framework for discussion of design elements relevant to

   (acoustophoresis) is a well-studied and popular technique in

   resonators is presented, using inexpensive materials and without the
   need for cleanrooms or the special equipment typically found within
   them. By utilizing a simple glass and polyimide sandwiching technique,
   single, bifurcating, and trifurcating microchannels were built and
   tested. Various half and full wavelength transversal resonators were
   established in microchannel widths of 300, 600, and 750 mu m using 1,
   2.5, and 5 MHz ultrasound. In significantly simplifying the fabrication
   and prototyping of these microfluidic resonators we hope to address some
   of the major drawbacks preventing acoustophoresis technology from being
   incorporated into the toolkits of laboratories around the world.}},

Abstract = {{A novel DC-dielectrophoresis (DEP) method employing a pressure-driven
   flow for the continuous separation of micro/nano-particles is presented
   in this paper. To generate the DEP force, a small voltage difference is
   applied to produce a non-uniformity of the electric field across a
   microchannel via a larger orifice of several hundred microns on one side
   of the channel wall and a smaller orifice of several hundred nanometers
   on the opposite channel wall. The particles experience a DEP force when
   they move with the flow through the vicinity of the small orifice, where
   the strongest electrical field gradient exists. Experiments were
   conducted to demonstrate the separation of 1 mu m and 3 mu m polystyrene
   particles by size by adjusting the applied electrical potentials. In
   order to separate smaller nanoparticles, the electrical conductivity of
   the suspending solution is adjusted so that the polystyrene
   nanoparticles of a given size experience positive DEP while the
   polystyrene nanoparticles of another size experience negative DEP. Using
   this method, the separation of 51 nm and 140 nm nanoparticles and the
   separation of 140 nm and 500 nm nanoparticles were demonstrated. In
   comparison with the microfluidic DC-DEP methods reported in the
   literature which utilize hurdles or obstacles to induce the
   non-uniformity of an electric field, a pair of asymmetrical orifices on
   the channel side walls is used in this method to generate a strong
   electrical field gradient and has advantages such as capability of
   separating nanoparticles, and locally applied lower electrical voltages
   to minimize the Joule heating effect.}},

Abstract = {{With the popularity of cloud computing, many cloud service providers
   deploy regional data centers to offer services and applications. These
   large-scale data centers have drawn extensive attention in terms of the
   huge energy demand and carbon emission. Thus, how to make use of their
   spatial diversities to green data centers and reduce cloud provider's
   costs is an important concern. In this paper, we integrate service
   reward, electricity cost, carbon taxes and service performance to study
   cost-effective request scheduling for cloud data centers. We propose an
   online and distributed scheduling algorithm CESA to achieve the flexible
   tradeoff between these conflicting objectives. The time complexity of
   CESA is polynomial, and it can be implemented in a parallel way. CESA
   requires no prior knowledge of the statistics of request arrivals or
   future electricity prices, yet it provably approximates the optimal

Abstract = {{Software attestation seeks to verify the authenticity of a system
   without the aid of trusted hardware, and has important applications in
   the field of security. Such attestation schemes are of particular
   interest in the embedded domain, where simplicity and limited resources
   constrain more complex security solutions. At the same time, these
   properties enable attestation approaches that rely on predictable
   side-effects. Most software attestation schemes aim to verify the
   integrity of memory using a combination of cryptographic schemes,
   internal side-effects like TLB misses, and known timing constraints.
   However, little attention has been paid to leveraging non-traditional
   side-effects, in particular, externally observable side-effects such as
   power consumption.
   In this paper we introduce a method for software attestation using power
   consumption as the side-effect. We show how to circumvent the
   undecidable nature of program execution for this purpose and present a
   static compiler transformation which implements the technique. Our
   approach is less intrusive than traditional software attestation because
   the system does not require interruption to compute a cryptographic
   checksum. It is particularly well suited to real-time systems where
   consistent timing is more important than speed.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs), as a kind of flexible
   platform to monitor machinery status and enhance industrial automation,
   bring enormous benefits in manufacturing, automated metering,
   conditioned-based maintenance and inventory, etc. However, security
   threats, such as Sybil attacks, hinder the flourish of IWSNs, since they
   are hardly detected in the harsh industrial environments with dispersive
   distortion, impulse noise and interference. In this paper, we propose a
   Sybil detection scheme in IWSNs, called PGDS, based on power gain and
   delay spread exacted from receiving packets. For wireless channel model,
   we consider the significant effects of impulse noise, interference,
   vibrating obstacle and user mobility. The Sybil packets are detected by
   classifying the channel-vector obtained by power gain and delay spread
   from each sensor. An adapter factor is utilized to enhance the detection
   accuracy. Security analysis demonstrates that the PGDS can detect the
   packets from Sybil attackers when they adaptively change the transition
   power. Simulation results with an increasing number of sensors show that
   the PGDS with lower value of adaptor factor can detect the packets from
   Sybil attackers with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{``Bring Your Own Device{''} (BYOD) allows employees to bring their own
   mobile devices to their workplace and use them to access corporate

   issues against the data protection and device management obligations of

   management for BYOD, in this paper, we propose a device-invisible
   two-factor authenticated key agreement protocol (Dtaka) based on
   identity-based and password-based authentications. With BYOD, every
   device and the data server can mutually authenticate to each other and
   negotiate a session key for secure communications. During this process,
   the data server can learn the employee's identity rather than which
   device the employee uses to access the data. Thus, the data server only
   manages the employees' identities, instead of all mobile devices of
   employees, such that the overhead of mobile devices management for
   corporations is reduced. In addition, the data server is able to trace a
   lost or stolen device when it authenticates to the data server. Finally,
   we evaluate the computational and communication overheads to demonstrate
   the efficiency of Dtaka.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of cloud storage, outsourced data transfer
   becomes an essential requirement for users to migrate their outsourced
   data from one cloud to another. However, data confidentiality and
   integrity are big concerns for users when their data are migrating
   between two semi-honest clouds. In this paper, we propose a secure
   outsourced data transfer scheme (SODT) to achieve secure data migration
   in cloud storage. SODT allows users to migrate the remote data from one
   cloud to another without retrieving the data from the former cloud, such
   that the data confidentiality and integrity can be achieved during this
   process. In addition, the cloud can perform secure data erasure after
   the data are migrated by utilizing the proxy re-encryption technique.
   Finally, we discuss the security properties including confidentiality
   and integrity of SODT, and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of the
   computational and communication overhead.}},

   problem is formulated, with the objective of maximizing the users'
   satisfaction across the network. In order to reduce the complexity and

   this end, we employ game-theoretic approach and interference graph to
   re-formulate the problem. We prove the existence of Nash Equilibrium

   the original problem. A concurrent best response iterative (CBSI)

Abstract = {{With the growing popularity of mobile applications, mobile cloud
   computing has been envisioned as a promising approach to help mobile
   devices enhance computation capability and reduce energy consumptions.
   In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-user computation
   offloading for mobile cloud computing under dynamic environment, wherein
   mobile users may become active or inactive (i. e., silent) dynamically,
   and the wireless channels for users to offload computation vary
   randomly. Taking into account the mutual interference among different
   users when offloading computation to mobile could via wireless channels,
   we formulate the mobile users' offloading decision process as a
   stochastic game. We further prove that the formulated stochastic game is
   equivalent to a potential game which has at least one Nash Equilibrium
   (NE). At the NE, no single user will unilaterally change its computation
   offloading strategy. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent stochastic
   learning algorithm to reach the NE with guaranteed convergence. Finally,
   we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm and evaluate its performance under dynamic environment.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{554-570}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Current processes to manage changes are subject to failure
   since they are heavily dependent on human discipline. The purpose of
   this paper is to evaluate and quantify the difference between levels of
   automation of change management processes and to provide input for
   determining the use of automation systems for change management.
   Design/methodology/approach - Three generations of change management
   processes are defined to represent progressive practices used in major
   capital projects over the past few decades. Discrete event simulation
   was used to model these processes to capture their behavior and compare
   their performance according to time and compliance metrics. An oil and
   gas megaproject served to validate the findings of this modeling and
   analysis.
   Findings - The results showed that automated processes can bring more
   compliance and real-time traceability, but not a significant time
   reduction in the change process. This contributes to the understanding
   of the impact of workflow-based automation on construction process
   performance. The validity of the conclusions are limited by the breadth
   of sectors studied and the inability to capture off-line time
   allocations of the personnel involved. Future research may build on the
   work presented here by studying additional processes such as requests
   for information, project change notices, requests for scaffolding, and
   interface management in various industry sectors.
   Originality/value - A new approach for modeling and evaluating
   construction management process automation is contributed and the
   specific results of the paper indicate that automated workflow-based
   change management processes should be implemented in megaprojects.}},

   experimentally investigated; the athlete has an incomplete cervical
   spinal cord injury. Two-dimensional body segment parameters (i.e., mass,
   length, position vector of the center of mass, and principal mass moment
   of inertia about the center of mass) were quantified using dual-energy
   x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In addition to measuring the body segment
   parameters in the interest of developing a subject-specific multibody
   biomechanical model, the mass of each body segment as experimentally
   measured via the DXA imaging was compared with that reported by previous
   research of able-bodied cadavers. In general, there were significant
   differences in the body segment masses between the different methods.
   The composition of each body segment (i.e., percentage of skeletal

Abstract = {{Radon being radioactive gas has adverse impacts on human health. In
   recent decades, radon gas has been listed as a human carcinogen sincethe
   massive effect of radon gas associated with lung cancer is widely
   recognized.Moreover, the health effects of indoor air pollution, with
   radon being one of the major contributors is aseriousconcern. The radon
   gas exposure limits are mainly obtained by various epidemiological and
   toxicological studies. Accordingly, different surveys conducted in
   particular parts of the world. Considering the harmful effects of radon
   gas on human life, quantitative researches are carried onto emphasize
   the importance of monitoring indoor radon gas levels. One of the main
   goal is to accommodate more accurate estimation for protection from the
   risks of long-term exposures to radon gas in the indoor environment. In
   this paper, the recent status of radon gas and its contributions to
   indoor air pollution aresummarized. Results of the comprehensive review
   demonstrate that, however treat of radon gas exposure as an air
   pollutant is being raised overtime, the knowledge and awareness of the
   impacts of these exposures in different situations still need more
   investigations. In case of encountering radon gas problems, specialists
   should be consulted toutilize appropriate radon testing and mitigation
   techniques. Studies are still being conducted to clarify certain
   discrepancies with the aim of providing consistent results and
   informationon the impacts of radon gas on environment and human health.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel fault-detection method for gearbox vibration
   signatures using synchro-squeezing transform (SST). Premised upon the
   concept of time-frequency (TF) reassignment, SST provides a sharp
   representation of signals in TF plane compared to many popular TF
   methods. Additionally, it can also extract the individual components,
   called intrinsic mode functions or IMFs, of a non-stationary
   multi-component signal, akin to empirical mode decomposition. The rich
   mathematical structure based on continuous wavelet transform makes SST a
   promising candidate for gearbox diagnosis. This work utilizes the
   decomposing power of SST to extract the IMFs from gearbox signals. For
   robust detection of faults in gear-motors, a fault detection technique
   based on time-varying autoregressive coefficients of IMFs as features is
   utilized. Sequential Karhunen-Loeve transform is employed on the
   condition indicators to select the appropriate window sizes on which SST
   can be applied. Laboratory experimental data obtained from drivetrain
   diagnostics simulator provides test bed to demonstrate the robustness of
   the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Air quality co-benefits of subnational carbon policies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{988-1002}},
Abstract = {{To mitigate climate change, governments ranging from city to
   multi-national have adopted greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction
   targets. While the location of GHG reductions does not affect their
   climate benefits, it can impact human health benefits associated with
   co-emitted pollutants. Here, an advanced modeling framework is used to
   explore how subnational level GHG targets influence air pollutant
   co-benefits from ground level ozone and fine particulate matter. Two
   carbon policy scenarios are analyzed, each reducing the same total
   amount of GHG emissions in the Northeast US: an economy-wide Cap and
   Trade (CAT) program reducing emissions from all sectors of the economy,
   and a Clean Energy Standard (CES) reducing emissions from the
   electricity sector only. Results suggest that a regional CES policy will
   cost about 10 times more than a CAT policy. Despite having the same
   regional targets in the Northeast, carbon leakage to non-capped regions
   varies between policies. Consequently, a regional CAT policy will result
   in national carbon reductions that are over six times greater than the
   carbon reduced by the CES in 2030. Monetized regional human health
   benefits of the CAT and CES policies are 844\% and 185\% of the costs of
   each policy, respectively. Benefits for both policies are thus estimated
   to exceed their costs in the Northeast US. The estimated value of human
   health co-benefits associated with air pollution reductions for the CES
   scenario is two times that of the CAT scenario.
   Implications: In this research, an advanced modeling framework is used
   to determine the potential impacts of regional carbon policies on air
   pollution co-benefits associated with ground level ozone and fine
   particulate matter. Study results show that spatially heterogeneous GHG
   policies have the potential to create areas of air pollution
   dis-benefit. It is also shown that monetized human health benefits
   within the area covered by policy may be larger than the model estimated
   cost of the policy. These findings are of particular interest both as
   U.S. states work to develop plans to meet state-level carbon emissions
   reduction targets set by the EPA through the Clean Power Plan, and in
   the absence of comprehensive national carbon policy.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of milling energy input, Q(TR) (kJ g(-1)), during ball
   milling and additives such as ultrafine filamentary Ni and graphene
   (reduced graphene oxide), on the occurrence of the solid-state
   mechanochemical reaction and resulting microstructure, were investigated
   for the (3LiBH(4) + TiF3) system. The new phases LiF and Ti are observed
   after injecting the energy input Q(TR) = 72.8 kJ g(-1) (1 h ball
   milling). A mechanical dehydrogenation phenomenon occurs during
   mechano-chemical reaction. The ultrafine filamentary Ni additive does
   not measurably accelerate the rate of mechanical dehydrogenation while
   the rate of mechanical dehydrogenation with graphene is initially slow
   and then dramatically increases up to 5 h ball milling (Q(TR) = 364 kJ
   g(-1)). Thermal desorption of ball milled samples occurs at a very low
   temperature of 60 degrees C. The addition of 5 wt\% filamentary Ni
   mildly reduces the apparent average activation energy for desorption.
   The highest average apparent activation energy of 95.2 +/- 1.9 kJ
   mol(-1) is exhibited by a sample with 5 wt\% graphene milled for 1 h
   which dramatically decreases after 5 h ball milling. The X-ray
   diffraction intensity of the LiF and Ti peaks greatly increases after
   thermal dehydrogenation. The principal gas released during thermal
   dehydrogenation is hydrogen although the 1 h ball milled (Q(TR) = 72.8
   kJ g(-1)) sample shows a very small quantity of diborane gas, B2H6,
   which ceased to be released after 5 h ball milling. It clearly shows
   that the release of B2H6 during thermal dehydrogenation depends on the
   quantity of milling (mechanical) energy injected into the powder
   mixture. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements show exothermic
   peaks for all samples regardless of the milling energy input. The ball
   milled samples release H-2 during long term storage at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-chasing behaviour in on-site construction decision-making can
   result in illogical decisions and, thus, significant project losses.
   Accordingly, the authors conducted a set of experiments in order to
   detect the existence of such behaviour under a range of typical project
   conditions within a set of common situations. Fifty-three project
   leaders participated in the experiments by making choices framed by a
   set of 24 questions. Each question related to a known behavioural
   tendency, included the influence of an external parameter, and contained
   information from which expected values could be derived. Participants
   were well distributed by geography, age and experience. Contrary to the
   common perception that construction decision-makers are relentlessly
   risk-averse, they demonstrated risk-chasing behaviour when the decision
   occurred in over-budget project conditions. Younger participants were
   even more risk chasing in such conditions. Understanding and identifying
   where such behaviour occurs could ultimately lead to the development of
   means of avoiding the resulting losses.}},

Journal = {{DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{52}},
Pages = {{25057-25069}},
Abstract = {{A pilot-scale study investigated the effect of phosphorus addition on a
   drinking water biofilter used to reduce fouling of an ultrafiltration
   membrane. Biofiltration without pre-treatment (BFwp) has been shown to
   be an effective pre-treatment for the removal of natural organic matter
   (NOM) components that cause membrane fouling. However, the river source
   used in this study was found to have low phosphorus concentrations that
   could potentially affect biofilter biomass levels and NOM
   biodegradation. The river water source (Saugeen River located at
   Walkerton, Ontario, Canada) had a high total organic carbon
   (4.34-6.61mg/L) of primarily humic content, variable turbidity, and
   seasonal changes in water temperature (9.7-19.9 degrees C) as measured
   over the study period. Phosphorus was added to the biofilter influent at
   0.01mg P/L, and later at 0.05mg P/L, over a four-month period. Biofilter
   activity, NOM removal, and membrane performance were compared to a
   control system operating under identical conditions but without nutrient
   addition. Filter biomass measured by ATP and fluorescein diacetate
   hydrolysis (overall enzyme activity) was stable over time, with no
   difference between control and phosphorus-amended biofilters. As well,
   phosphorus addition did not improve the removal of NOM fractions,
   especially biopolymers that are important for membrane fouling. There
   was a small initial increase in the removal of dissolved organic carbon
   and humic substances after phosphorus addition, but this effect
   diminished over time. The effluent from each biofilter was used to
   operate an ultrafiltration membrane system using conditions similar to
   full scale. Membrane fouling for each experiment was measured over 1.5d,
   and operating cycles included 30-min permeation followed by
   backwashing/air sparging. Results showed that there was no difference in
   hydraulically reversible or irreversible fouling of membranes fed with
   the effluent from control or phosphorus-amended biofilters. It was found
   that biofilter nutrient feed requirements are likely site specific, and
   affected by factors including biomass and NOM characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In real applications, data continuously evolve over time and change from
   one setting to another. This inspires the development of adaptive
   learning algorithms to deal with this data dynamics. Adaptation
   mechanisms for unsupervised learning have received an increasing amount
   of attention from researchers. This research activity has produced a lot
   of results in tackling some of the challenging problems of the
   adaptation process that are still open. This paper is a brief review of
   adaptation mechanisms in unsupervised learning focusing on approaches
   recently reported in the literature for adaptive clustering and novelty
   detection and discussing some future directions. Although these
   approaches have able to cope with different levels of data
   non-stationarity, there is a crucial need to extend these approaches to
   be able to handle large amount of data in distributed resource-limited
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel semi-supervised dictionary learning and sparse
   representation (SS-DLSR) is proposed. The proposed method benefits from
   the supervisory information by learning the dictionary in a space where
   the dependency between the data and class labels is maximized. This
   maximization is performed using Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion
   (HSIC). On the other hand, the global distribution of the underlying
   manifolds were learned from the unlabeled data by minimizing the
   distances between the unlabeled data and the corresponding nearest
   labeled data in the space of the dictionary learned. The proposed
   SS-DLSR algorithm has closed-form solutions for both the dictionary and
   sparse coefficients, and therefore does not have to learn the two
   iteratively and alternately as is common in the literature of the DLSR.
   This makes the solution for the proposed algorithm very fast. The
   experiments confirm the improvement in classification performance on
   benchmark datasets by including the information from both labeled and
   unlabeled data, particularly when there are many unlabeled data.}},

   Simulation Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2553}},
Pages = {{20-28}},
Abstract = {{Most highway capacity guidelines use two main traffic measures to
   establish the level of service for two-lane highways: average travel
   speed (ATS) and percentage of time spent following (PTSF). In the
   Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), directional ATS is related to volume by
   using a linear expression with a single coefficient for volume in both
   directions (travel and opposing), whereas in other capacity guides such
   as those in Germany, Finland, and Brazil, a nonlinear form of expression
   is used; some of these expressions use different coefficients for travel
   and opposing volumes. In the HCM, directional PTSF is related to volume
   by using an exponential expression. Other models use a slightly
   different exponential form of model with different coefficients. The
   purpose of this research is to use a newly developed and calibrated
   two-lane microsimulation model to investigate the relationship between
   traffic volume and directional ATS and PTSF. New expressions are
   suggested and subsequently compared with those of the HCM and of a
   number of existing European and South American models. The simulation
   results show that, unlike the HCM expression, ATS versus volume has a
   nonlinear convex shape especially at low volume in the travel direction.
   This finding is in accordance with German, Finnish, and Brazilian
   models. A new nonlinear exponential expression is suggested to replace
   the current linear expression for ATS versus volume in the HCM. The HCM
   PTSF model structure, however, was found to be in accordance with
   simulation results. Hence, model coefficients were updated for PTSF
   only.}},

Abstract = {{The limiting impact of interference on the total throughput of large
   wireless networks has long been recognized by practitioners. The
   degrees-of-freedom characterization of interference networks has shown
   that the collapse in scaling without appropriate interference management
   is a fundamental aspect of these networks, but results from information
   theory were generally not applicable to network interference management
   in practice. Recent theoretical results on the capacity-optimality of
   treating interference as noise for large classes of wireless networks
   have led to renewed interest in wireless link scheduling methods that
   enjoy good theoretical guarantees at the same time as having the
   simplicity benefits of single-user encoding and decoding. In this paper,
   we provide a link scheduling method that has the dual benefits of being
   based on the characteristics of real-life RF front-ends used in
   practical wireless networks and at the same time being analytically
   tractable and analyze its performance characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Bonds made with Pd coated pure Ag wires were studied in this work with
   respect to their electrical resistance under high temperature storage at
   200 degrees C. The Pd coated 18 micron diameter Ag wires were ball
   bonded to the Al metallization on testchips attached to ceramic
   substrates. All free-air balls were made in air as Pd coated Ag wire
   does not need protective atmosphere such as forming gas or nitrogen. The
   second bonds were on the Au plated leads of the ceramic substrates.
   Bonded wires were grouped in pairs to form several wire daisy chains on
   each substrate. A setup was developed to automatically switch from daisy
   chain to daisy chain to perform 2-wire resistance measurements. The
   resistance of Ag wires bonded to Al pads was compared to that of Au wire
   bonds. The average resistance value of the Ag daisy chains at 50 degrees
   C was 6.28 Omega, not significantly different from that of Au bonds.
   These values increased approximate to 2 \% and approximate to 8 \% for
   surviving Au bonds and Ag bonds, respectively, after 1000 h at 200
   degrees C. However, more Ag bonds survived than Au bonds. The results
   show that Au bonds exhibit only a low increase of resistance in the
   beginning which then, however, is followed by an abrupt increase to high
   values leading to complete failure. In contrast, the Ag bonds aging show
   a more gradual increase in resistance right from the beginning and are
   less prone to abrupt or complete failure compared to the Au bonds.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of capillary-to-capillary variation on the robustness of a
   fine pitch wire bonding process is studied using an analytical model
   developed with the goal to make predictions with respect to the shape of
   the bonded ball and the capillary tip geometry and tolerances for fine
   pitch ball bonding. The model includes stepwise deformation of the ball
   which is calculated based on concepts such as volume conservation. An
   example case is presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this volume
   conservation model. For the diameter of the example deformed ball, the
   target value is 35 mu m. The wire diameter is 20 mu m, the capillary tip
   dimensions include hole diameter 24.13 mu m, chamfer diameter 29.21 mu
   m, chamfer angle 70 degrees, and face angle 8 degrees. It was found the
   higher the ball height, the smaller the ball height variation in
   percent. A height to diameter ratio of 1/3 is recommended over 1/4 or
   1/5 ratios. The model predicts that the smaller ratios can result in
   relatively large ball height variations. This leads to variations of
   ultrasonic energy transmitted to the bond and therefore can impact bond
   strength and reliability. For the example target diameter of 35 mu m and
   a ball height of 11.8 mu m, the tolerance analysis with the volume
   conservation model predicts a free-air ball diameter of 31.9 mu m and an
   acceptably small ball height variation of +/- 8 \%. The design of fine
   pitch or ultra-fine pitch bonding processes with modern wire materials
   such as Cu or Ag alloy can benefit from the reported model.}},

Abstract = {{A series of nanosized Ni-Al2O3 catalysts for the catalytic methanation
   of CO were prepared by solution combustion of Ni2+ and Al3+ nitrates
   with urea. The main influence of the combustion process on the
   physicochemical and catalytic properties of Ni-Al2O3 catalysts were
   investigated by using the RV/OV ratio of reducing valences from urea to
   oxidizing valences from nitrates in redox systems. With increasing RV/OV
   ratio, more urea molecules coordinate with Ni2+ to form nickel ammine
   and enhance the diffusion of Ni2+ in the precursor solution. During the
   combustion process, the combustion enthalpy and gases increase with
   increasing RV/OV value, operating synergistically to achieve controlled
   physicochemical properties of the obtained catalysts. Especially, when
   RV/OV <= 0.75, the released gases are critical to the formation of a
   high surface area to disperse the NiO nanoparticles, whereas when RV/OV
   <= 0.75, the combustion enthalpy produces a high temperature,
   facilitating NiO migration into the Al2O3 matrix to form the low
   activity precursor NiAl2O4 spinel. The catalyst with RV/OV <= 0.75
   exhibits the maximum nickel surface area and the smallest Ni particle
   size of 62.6 m(2) g(-1) and 10.8 nm, respectively, which result in the
   optimum catalytic activity.}},

   outliers filtered by T-G test from the data are detected and eliminated.
   Applications of the K-Means algorithm which is used to set up the
   driving threshold value for the heavy duty vehicle, and the Baum-Welch
   algorithm which is used to optimize the proposed HHMM model are
   discussed in detail. Simulations under a variety of driving conditions
   are carried out to verify the optimized HHMM model. The simulation
   results show that the proposed model can accurately and effectively
   identify the driving status under a variety of driving conditions.}},

Title = {{Emerging nanomaterials for the application of selenium removal for
   wastewater treatment}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{982-996}},
Abstract = {{Selenium contaminated wastewater derived from global industrial
   activities (i.e. coal and mineral mining, metal smelting, oil extraction
   and refining, and agricultural irrigation) can bioaccumulate in aquatic
   organisms and presents a source of toxicity for many organisms,
   including humans. Selenium represents an extremely difficult contaminant
   to remove from wastewater due to its range of solubility, toxicity, and
   state of matter over different oxidation states. Recently, the
   application of nanomaterials for removing selenium from wastewater has
   received increasing interest from the power generation and industrial
   mining sectors. Several classes of nanomaterials, such as nanoscale
   adsorbents, catalysts and reactants, show promising potential in
   removing selenium in a wide range of oxidation states. This review
   article provides a summary of current selenium removal technologies,
   highlights the gaps in these current technologies and focuses on
   emerging nanomaterials capable of removing selenium oxyanions from
   wastewater to ultra-low micro-gram per litre limits. Recent published
   literature has focused on the modification of different nanomaterials in
   order to achieve high surface adsorbing activity, high reactivity,
   selectivity and sustainable treatment capability in efforts to remove
   selenium oxyanions. The majority of promising nanotechnologies for
   selenium removal are undergoing intense research and development in
   efforts to get the technology into wastewater treatment markets. These
   nanomaterials have the ability to remove selenium contaminants to
   previously unachievable ultra-low levels, while implementing reliable
   and sustainable treatment techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, a cellular version of a recent spot-lighted
   metaheuristic called The Great Salmon Run ( TGSR) algorithm is developed
   for evolving the architecture of Artificial Neural Network ( ANN). The
   main motivation behind the current research is to find out whether the
   proposed metaheuristic algorithm is able to cope with difficulties
   associated with designing an accurate and robust neural black-box
   identifier. To attest the applicability of the proposed method, the
   resulted strategy is applied to a real-life challenging identification
   problem, i. e. identifying the exhaust gas temperature ( T-exh) and
   engine-out hydrocarbon emission ( HCraw) during the coldstart operation
   of an automotive engine. Generally, the coldstart operation is regarded
   as a highly non-linear, uncertain and transient phenomenon which in turn
   can be a very good problem for verifying the authenticity of the
   proposed hybrid identification strategy. Through the conducted
   experiments, it is proved that the proposed identification strategy can
   be used to identify the main operating parameters of coldstart
   phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxidases are ubiquitous enzymes that play an important role in living

   are based on the production of chromophoric substances at the end of the

   can be of serious concern in inhibition studies. A novel
   spectrophotometric assay for peroxidase, based on direct measurement of
   a soluble aniline diazo substrate, is introduced. In addition to the
   routine assays, this method can be used in comprehensive kinetics
   studies. 4-{[}(4-Sulfophenyl)azo]aniline (lambda max - 390 nm, epsilon -
   32 880 M-1 cm(-1) at pH 4.5 to 9) was introduced for routine assay of
   peroxidase. This compound is commercially available and is indexed as a

Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},

Pages = {{833-841}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The main objective of this study is to identify the main
   factors associated with injury severity of vulnerable road users (VRUs)
   involved in accidents at highway railroad grade crossings (HRGCs) using
   data mining techniques.Methods: This article applies an ordered probit
   model, association rules, and classification and regression tree (CART)
   algorithms to the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) HRGC
   accident database for the period 2007-2013 to identify VRU injury
   severity factors at HRGCs.Results: The results show that train speed is
   a key factor influencing injury severity. Further analysis illustrated
   that the presence of illumination does not reduce the severity of
   accidents for high-speed trains. In addition, there is a greater
   propensity toward fatal accidents for elderly road users compared to
   younger individuals. Interestingly, at night, injury accidents involving
   female road users are more severe compared to those involving
   males.Conclusions: The ordered probit model was the primary technique,
   and CART and association rules act as the supporter and identifier of
   interactions between variables. All 3 algorithms' results consistently
   show that the most influential accident factors are train speed, VRU
   age, and gender. The findings of this research could be applied for
   identifying high-risk hotspots and developing cost-effective
   countermeasures targeting VRUs at HRGCs.}},

   Changing Global Transport Costs}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2598}},
Pages = {{46-57}},
Abstract = {{Despite the complex political and economic trade environment, the
   generalized costs of transportation still play an important role in
   determining trade patterns. This paper analyzes how global trade
   patterns would simultaneously change as a result of new global
   transportation costs and for which countries the new patterns of global
   trade would be beneficial or detrimental. A random utility-based
   multiregion input-output model helps quantify the size of the impacts,
   identify the countries and sectors that would gain or lose the most, and
   explain the change in trade patterns that would create these impacts.
   Results suggest that Canada is most susceptible to negative economic
   impacts caused by decreases in global transportation costs, mainly
   because of its important trade relationship with the United States.
   Canada's economy benefits from its proximity to the United States, but
   as transportation costs decrease, this proximity becomes less relevant
   as the United States increasingly trades with more distant countries.
   The United States suffers the same susceptibility to negative economic
   impacts with decreases in global transportation costs, but to a larger
   absolute (smaller relative) extent. However, global transportation cost
   reductions are especially beneficial to Japan, China, and South Korea,
   which absorb much of the trade diverted away from the United States and
   Canada.}},

   showed that all models improved the accuracy of the smartphone-based RSC

Abstract = {{To demonstrate the strategic influence a third party can have on
   negotiations, a formal approach to resolving a complex conflict is
   applied to an important international water resources controversy.
   Specifically, third party intervention is employed within the framework
   of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) to systematically
   investigate the ongoing dispute between Bangladesh and India over the
   regulation of the Ganges River by India at the Farakka Barrage located
   just upstream on the Ganges River in India before it flows into
   Bangladesh. A general system of systems engineering approach to Third
   Party Intervention within the GMCR structure is designed to reflect a
   range of ways in which it can be implemented in practice. Having an
   insightful and powerful tool like Third Party GMCR permits one to
   ascertain how a Third Party can guide a serious conflict to a more
   reasonable resolution which may be mutually beneficial to all concerned
   parties.}},

Abstract = {{A growing understanding of the fundamental role of proteins in diseases
   has advanced the development of quantitative protein assays in the
   medical field. Current techniques for protein analysis include
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), flow cytometry, mass
   spectrometry, and immunohistochemistry. However, many of these
   conventional strategies require specialized training, expensive
   antibodies, or sophisticated equipment, raising assay costs and limiting
   their application to laboratory analysis. Here, we present the
   application of a ``chemical nose{''} type colorimetric gold nanoparticle
   sensor for detection, quantification, and identification of single
   proteins, protein mixtures, and proteins within the complex environment
   of human serum. The unique interactions between a mixture of two
   different gold nanoparticle morphologies (spherical and branched) and
   six separate proteins (bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin,
   immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, lysozyme, and hemoglobin) generated
   distinguishable protein- and concentration-dependent absorption spectra,
   even at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, we show that this
   response is sensitive to the relative abundance of different proteins in
   solution, permitting analysis of protein mixtures. Finally, we
   demonstrate the ability to distinguish human serum samples with and
   without a clinically relevant two-fold increase in immunoglobulin G,
   without the use of expensive reagents or complicated sample processing.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to create reproducible and inexpensive nanofluidic chips is
   essential to the fundamental research and applications of nanofluidics.
   This paper presents a novel and cost-effective method for fabricating a
   single nanochannel or multiple nanochannels in PDMS chips with
   controllable channel size and spacing. Single nanocracks or nanocrack
   arrays, positioned by artificial defects, are first generated on a
   polystyrene surface with controllable size and spacing by a
   solvent-induced method. Two sets of optimal working parameters are
   developed to replicate the nanocracks onto the polymer layers to form
   the nanochannel molds. The nanochannel molds are used to make the
   bi-layer PDMS microchannel-nanochannel chips by simple soft lithography.
   An alignment system is developed for bonding the nanofluidic chips under
   an optical microscope. Using this method, high quality PDMS nanofluidic
   chips with a single nanochannel or multiple nanochannels of sub-100 nm
   width and height and centimeter length can be obtained with high

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle rollover is a serious traffic accident. In order to accurately
   evaluate the possibility of untripped and some special tripped vehicle
   rollovers, and to prevent vehicle rollover under unpredictable
   variations of parameters and harsh driving conditions, a new rollover
   index and an anti-roll control strategy are proposed in this paper.
   Taking deflections of steering and suspension induced by the roll at the
   axles into consideration, a six degrees of freedom dynamic model is
   established, including lateral, yaw, roll, and vertical motions of
   sprung and unsprung masses. From the vehicle dynamics theory, a new
   rollover index is developed to predict vehicle rollover risk under both
   untripped and special tripped situations. This new rollover index is
   validated by Carsim simulations. In addition, an H-infinity controller
   with electro hydraulic brake system is optimised by genetic algorithm to
   improve the anti-rollover performance of the vehicle. The stability and
   robustness of the active rollover prevention control system are analysed
   by some numerical simulations. The results show that the control system
   can improve the critical speed of vehicle rollover obviously, and has a
   good robustness for variations in the number of passengers and longitude
   position of the centre of gravity.}},

Abstract = {{Four different metal oxide nanoparticles, copper oxide (CuO), aluminum
   oxide (Al2O3), nickel oxide (NiO), and titanium dioxide (TiO2), were
   added to poly (2,5-dimethyl aniline) (P25DMA) during synthesis to create
   different polymer nanocomposites. These polymer nanocomposites were
   evaluated as potential sensing materials for six different gas analytes
   (acetaldehyde, acetone, benzene, ethanol, formaldehyde, and methanol).
   It was found that CuO did not incorporate into the P25DMA and only a
   small percentage of Al2O3 was incorporated. However, both NiO and TiO2
   were incorporated into the P25DMA at the same concentration as during
   the synthesis step. Overall, the type of metal oxide significantly
   affected the morphology of the sensing material and the amount of each
   analyte sorbed. For example, P25DMA doped with 5wt\% Al2O3 had high
   selectivity towards ethanol, whereas P25DMA doped with 20wt\% TiO2
   sorbed the most ethanol. However, P25DMA doped with 20wt\% TiO2 also
   sorbed a high amount of formaldehyde, making P25DMA doped with 20wt\%
   TiO2 less selective than P25DMA doped with 5wt\% Al2O3 towards ethanol
   with respect to formaldehyde.}},

Abstract = {{Mutex locks have traditionally been the most common mechanism for
   protecting shared data structures in parallel programs. However, the
   robustness of such locks against process failures has not been studied
   thoroughly. Most (user level) mutex algorithms are designed around the
   assumption that processes are reliable, meaning that a process may not
   fail while executing the lock acquisition and release code, or while
   inside the critical section. If such a failure does occur, then the
   liveness properties of a conventional mutex lock may cease to hold until
   the application or operating system intervenes by cleaning up the
   internal structure of the lock. For example, a process that is
   attempting to acquire an otherwise starvation-free mutex may be blocked
   forever waiting for a failed process to release the critical section.
   Adding to the difficulty, if the failed process recovers and attempts to
   acquire the same mutex again without appropriate cleanup, then the mutex
   may become corrupted to the point where it loses safety, notably the
   mutual exclusion property. We address this challenge by formalizing the
   problem of recoverable mutual exclusion, and proposing several solutions
   that vary both in their assumptions regarding hardware support for
   synchronization, and in their time complexity. Compared to known
   solutions, our algorithms are more robust as they do not restrict where
   or when a process may crash, and provide stricter guarantees in terms of
   time complexity, which we define in terms of remote memory references.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element reliability analysis (FERA) has been used to evaluate the
   reliability of structures. In FERA, approximate methods are commonly
   used to estimate the mean and variance of the structural response, while
   its probability distribution is primarily derived based on the Monte
   Carlo simulation (MCS) method. This paper advances FERA by combining it
   with the multiplicative dimensional reduction method (M-DRM). The
   proposed M-DRM allows fairly accurate estimation of the statistical
   moments, as well as the probability distribution of the structural
   response. The distribution of the response is obtained using fractional
   moments, which are calculated from the M-DRM, along with the maximum
   entropy principle. The variance of the response, based on global
   sensitivity measures, is obtained as a by-product of the analysis. The
   proposed approach is integrated with the OpenSees software and is
   illustrated through examples of nonlinear finite element analyses of
   reinforced concrete and steel frames. The paper shows that the proposed
   approach is an accurate and efficient alternative for FERA.}},

Abstract = {{In the presence of model-plant mismatch, a standard ``two-step{''}
   approach involving repeated identification and optimization steps,
   cannot guarantee convergence to the process optimum. Model parameter
   adaptation can be used for handling model error by correcting for
   mismatch between predicted and measured cost and constraint gradients
   while simultaneously satisfying both identification and optimization
   objectives. However, updating all model parameters at once is often
   impractical due to estimability and increased sensitivity to noise. This
   work presents a procedure for selecting, after each run, a particular
   subset of parameters based on parametric sensitivity of the model output
   and of cost and constraint gradients. The resulting improvements with
   respect to previous run-to-run studies are illustrated using a simulated

Abstract = {{Accurate and fast quantitative analysis of living cells from
   fluorescence microscopy images is useful for evaluations of experimental
   outcomes and cells culture protocols. An algorithm is developed in this
   work to automatically segment and discern apoptotic cells from normal
   cells. A coarse segmentation algorithm is proposed as a pre-filtering
   step that combines a range filter with a marching square method. This
   step provides approximate coordinates of cells' positions in a
   two-dimensional matrix used to store cells' image. With this
   information, the active contours without edges method is applied to
   identify cells' boundaries and subsequently it is possible to extract
   the mean value of intensity within the cellular regions, the variance of
   pixels' intensities in the vicinity of cells' boundaries and the lengths
   of the boundaries. These morphological features are then employed as
   inputs to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is trained to
   distinguish apoptotic from normal viable states of cells. The algorithm
   is shown to be efficient in terms of computational time, quantitative
   analysis and differentiation accuracy, as compared to the use of the
   active contours method without the proposed coarse segmentation step.

Abstract = {{Post-combustion capture is a promising technology-for developing CO2
   neutral power plants. However, to make it economically and technically
   feasible, capture plants must follow the fast and large load changes of
   the power plants without decreasing the overall performance of the
   plant. Dynamic modeling and simulation is therefore needed to evaluate
   the performance of this plant under critical operation. In this work, we
   evaluate the transient response of an absorber and a desorber for step
   changes of key process parameters, e.g. flue gas flow and composition,
   lean and rich CO2 loading, etc. We show the results for the baseline 30
   wt\% MEA and the low energy piperazine (PZ) solutions. This analysis
   reveals that the absorber reaches steady-state faster using MEA compared
   to PZ. This is related to the shift of the mass transfer zone due to
   changes in temperature. The transient operation in the regeneration unit
   is somewhat similar while using both solvents: an initial fast decrease
   of the lean loading is followed by a slow transient period as the system
   approaches steady-state conditions. We show the presence of inverse
   response in the stripper column when the rich loading decreases or the
   feed's temperature reduces using PZ solvent. Thus, we demonstrate that
   the dynamics of the MEA system cannot be extrapolated to other solvents.

Abstract = {{Novel in situ nickel doped 1-D lithium titanate nanofibers
   (Li(4)Ti(5-x)NixO(12), where x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1) have been successfully
   synthesized using a facile electrospinning process. Physical
   characterization reveals that nickel is homogeneously incorporated into
   the lattice of lithium titanate nanofibers (LTONFs) which significantly
   improves their properties yielding outstanding electrochemical
   performance in a lithium ion battery at high power rates and significant
   reduction in the voltage gap between the oxidation and reduction peaks.
   A capacity of 190 mA h g (1) has been obtained at 0.2C for the 10\%
   nickel doped nanofibers (Ni-LTONF10), which is higher than the
   theoretical capacity of pristine lithium titanate (175 mA h g (1)) and
   they also show superior rate capability resulting in 63 mA h g (1)
   obtained at 50C, which is 20 times higher than that of un-doped pristine
   LTONFs and lithium titanate nanoparticles (LTONPs). Finally, a hybrid
   supercapacitor is fabricated using Ni-LTONF10, showing superior energy

Abstract = {{A monolithic compound semiconductor phototransducer optimized for

   thicknesses of the p-type base layers of the diodes were engineered for
   optimal absorption and current matching for an optical input with
   wavelengths centered in the 830 nm to 850 nm range. The device
   architecture allows for improved open-circuit voltage in the individual

   maintaining a complete absorption of the input photons with no need for

Abstract = {{Ensuring correctness and enforcing security are growing concerns given
   the complexity of modern connected devices and safety-critical systems.
   A promising approach is non-intrusive runtime monitoring through
   reconstruction of program execution traces from power consumption
   measurements. This can be used for verification, validation, debugging,
   and security purposes.
   In this paper, we propose a framework for increasing the effectiveness
   of power-based program tracing techniques. These systems determine the
   most likely block of source code that produced an observed power trace
   (CPU power consumption as a function of time). Our framework maximizes
   distinguishability between power traces for different code blocks. To
   this end, we provide a special compiler optimization stage that reorders
   intermediate representation (IR) and determines the reorderings that
   lead to power traces with highest distances between each other, thus
   reducing the probability of misclassification. Our work includes an
   experimental evaluation, using LLVM for an ARM architecture.
   Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our technique.}},

   transistor performance with hole mobilities of up to 3.08 x 10(-3) cm(2)
   V-1 s(-1) for PPQ2T-TT-24 and 5.34 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for
   PPQ2T-TVT-24. The ambient air stability of the organic thin film
   transistors based on these two polymers along with another previously
   reported PQ polymer containing bithiophene (BT) units, PPQ2T-BT-24, was
   studied. It was found that the moisture (H2O) in the ambient air is a
   detrimental component responsible for the degradation of the device
   performance, while oxygen, in contrast, could enhance the carrier
   mobility. Our study showed that the electron donor comonomer unit
   significantly influenced the stability of these polymers towards
   moisture in the stability order of TT > BT >> TVT. It was shown that the
   interaction between H2O and PPQ2T-TT-24 is physisorption and the device
   performance could be fully recovered, while the interaction of H2O with
   two other polymers involved chemical reactions, leading to permanent
   damages to the polymers and only partially recovered device performance
   upon removal of moisture.}},

   surface crack having 200 mu m width and 2 mm depth, the numerical result

Abstract = {{Background: Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increase the risk
   of chronic illness and death. The newest generation of ``wearable{''}
   activity trackers offers potential as a multifaceted intervention to
   help people become more active.
   Objective: To examine the usability and usefulness of wearable activity
   trackers for older adults living with chronic illness.
   Methods: We recruited a purposive sample of 32 participants over the age
   of 50, who had been previously diagnosed with a chronic illness,
   including vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis.
   Participants were between 52 and 84 years of age (mean 64); among the
   study participants, 23 (72\%) were women and the mean body mass index
   was 31 kg/m(2). Participants tested 5 trackers, including a simple
   pedometer (Sportline or Mio) followed by 4 wearable activity trackers
   (Fitbit Zip, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up 24, and Withings Pulse) in random
   order. Selected devices represented the range of wearable products and
   features available on the Canadian market in 2014. Participants wore
   each device for at least 3 days and evaluated it using a questionnaire
   developed from the Technology Acceptance Model. We used focus groups to
   explore participant experiences and a thematic analysis approach to data
   collection and analysis.
   Results: Our study resulted in 4 themes: (1) adoption within a comfort
   zone; (2) self-awareness and goal setting; (3) purposes of data
   tracking; and (4) future of wearable activity trackers as health care
   devices. Prior to enrolling, few participants were aware of wearable
   activity trackers. Most also had been asked by a physician to exercise
   more and cited this as a motivation for testing the devices. None of the
   participants planned to purchase the simple pedometer after the study,
   citing poor accuracy and data loss, whereas 73\% (N=32) planned to
   purchase a wearable activity tracker. Preferences varied but 50\% felt
   they would buy a Fitbit and 42\% felt they would buy a Misfit, Jawbone,
   or Withings. The simple pedometer had a mean acceptance score of 56/95
   compared with 63 for the Withings, 65 for the Misfit and Jawbone, and 68
   for the Fitbit. To improve usability, older users may benefit from
   devices that have better compatibility with personal computers or
   less-expensive Android mobile phones and tablets, and have comprehensive
   paper-based user manuals and apps that interpret user data.
   Conclusions: For older adults living with chronic illness, wearable
   activity trackers are perceived as useful and acceptable. New users may
   need support to both set up the device and learn how to interpret their
   data.}},

Abstract = {{For the development of emission control strategies, activated carbon,
   zeolite, molecular sieves, and a silica gel were tested for adsorption
   of the newer anesthetic gases isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane
   from air. The activated carbon Norit GCA 48 was selected for the best
   performance, and adsorption isotherms at room temperature were developed
   for the three anesthetics. Equilibrium capacities for this carbon were
   in the range of 500 to 1,000 mg g(-1) for these anesthetics at partial
   pressures ranging from 5 to 45 Torr, with the most volatile compound
   (desflurane) showing the least favorable adsorption. Activated carbons
   are therefore suggested for use as effective adsorbents in emission
   control of these anesthetic gases from hospitals.}},

Title = {{Road Section Length Variability on Pavement Management Decision Making
   for Ontario, Canada, Highway Systems}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{87-96}},
Abstract = {{In a pavement management system, the performance evaluation indexes and
   their prediction methods are important aspects for assessing the overall
   pavement condition. Therefore, an accurate location reference system is
   necessary for managing pavement evaluations and maintenance. In this
   regard, the length of the pavement section selected for evaluation may
   also have significant impact on the assessment, irrespective of the type
   of performance indexes. This study investigated the variability in
   pavement performance evaluation and maintenance decisions attributed to
   change in pavement section lengths. It considered rut depth, pavement
   condition index, and international roughness index as performance
   indexes. Data from 27 road segments of Ontario, Canada, with a total
   length of 172.5 km were selected for empirical investigation. The
   distributions of these indexes were compared by grouping various segment
   lengths ranging from 50, 500,1,000, and 10,000 m. The variations of
   performance assessment attributable to changing section length were
   investigated on the basis of their impacts on maintenance decisions. A
   Monte Carlo simulation was carried out by varying section lengths to
   estimate probabilities of the necessity of maintenance works. Results of
   this empirical investigation revealed that most of the longer sections
   were evaluated with low rut depth and the shorter sections were
   evaluated with higher rut depth. Monte Carlo simulation also revealed
   that 50-m sections have a higher probability of maintenance requirement
   than 500-m sections. Although the results are related to the Ontario
   highway system, these methods can also be applied elsewhere with similar
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Hot Spots for Vessel-to-Vessel and Vessel-to-Fixed-Object Accidents
   Along the Great Lakes Seaway}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2549}},
Pages = {{93-100}},
Abstract = {{In the past decade, an average of 20.5 vessel accidents per year have
   been reported along the Great Lakes Seaway (GLS) in Canada and the
   United States, with the vast majority clustered at specific unsafe
   locations or sites along the route. Sites with an unacceptably high
   potential for accidents are referred to as hot spots, and these hot
   spots are prime candidates for safety intervention. Because of the
   random nature of accidents, the identification of hot spots must be
   based on robust site-specific prediction models of accident expectation.
   This paper presents an empirical Bayes prediction model developed for
   the GLS that considers four types of accident scenarios: vessel to
   vessel and vessel to fixed objects, for river and for canal or lock
   sections. Hot spot sites are determined with two risk tolerance
   thresholds: 95th percentile exceedance (high-risk sites) and 85th
   percentile exceedance (moderate risk and high-risk sites). For the 95th
   percentile threshold and vessel-to vessel accidents, five hot spots were
   identified on the 1,600-km length of the GLS studied (excluding lake or
   port areas). Of the designated hot spot sections, 10 km (60.6\%) were
   located along natural river courses and the rest at canals or locks. For
   vessel-to-fixed-objects accidents, all high-risk hot spots were at canal
   or lock sections (15.5 km). Reducing the threshold to the 85th
   percentile resulted in a 7.8\% increase in seaway length that was
   designated as a hot spot. The locations of these hot spot sections along
   the GLS were consistent for both thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents CArb, an arbiter for controlling accesses to the
   shared memory bus in multi-core mixed criticality systems. CArb is a
   requirement-aware arbiter that optimally allocates service to tasks
   based on their requirements. It is also criticality-aware since it
   incorporates criticality as a first-class principle in arbitration
   decisions. CArb supports any number of criticality levels and does not
   impose any restrictions on mapping tasks to processors. Hence, it
   operates in tandem with existing processor scheduling policies. In
   addition, CArb is able to dynamically adapt memory bus arbitration at
   run time to respond to increases in the monitored execution times of
   tasks. Utilizing this adaptation, CArb is able to offset these
   increases; hence, postpones the system need to switch to a degraded
   mode. We prototype CArb, and evaluate it with an avionics case-study
   from Honeywell as well as synthetic experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we address the challenge of incorporating buffer space
   constraints in worst-case latency analysis for priority-aware networks.
   A priority-aware network is a wormhole-switched network-on-chip with
   distinct virtual channels per priority. Prior worst-case latency
   analyses assume that the routers have infinite buffer space allocated to
   the virtual channels. This assumption renders these analyses impractical
   when considering actual deployments. This is because an implementation
   of the priority-aware network imposes buffer constraints on the
   application. These constraints can result in back pressure on the
   communication, which the analyses must incorporate. Consequently, we
   extend a worst-case latency analysis for priority-aware networks to
   include buffer space constraints. We provide the theory for these
   extensions and prove their correctness. We experiment on a large set of
   synthetic benchmarks, and show that we can deploy applications on
   priority-aware networks with virtual channels of sizes as small as two
   flits. In addition, we propose a polynomial time buffer space allocation
   algorithm. This algorithm minimizes the buffer space required at the
   virtual channels while scheduling the application sets on the target
   priority-aware network. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed
   algorithm reduces buffer space requirements in the virtual channels by
   approximately 85\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative to traditional wood framing in residential building
   construction, cold-formed steel (CFS) framing inherits many advantages
   of steel construction. However, if not appropriately designed, CFS
   floors with longer spans and lighter weight are likely to be susceptible
   to annoying vibrations induced by human activity such as walking. The
   fundamental frequency is a critical parameter for floor vibration
   serviceability. In current practice, the floor frequency is evaluated
   based on the simplification of a floor system to a simply-supported
   beam, which results in a considerable disparity in frequencies obtained
   from field tests and evaluation. In this research, based on current
   construction practice, the CFS floor system is modelled as an
   orthotropic plate with edges of joist-ends being partially restrained
   and edges that are parallel to floor joists being either freely or
   simply supported. The deflection of the partially restrained CFS floor
   joist is adopted as the admissible function of the plate in the
   derivation of equations to evaluate the fundamental frequency of the
   equivalent orthotropic plate. Simplified equations and equivalent
   rigidity properties are proposed for CFS floor systems.}},

Pages = {{397-406}},
Abstract = {{The kinetics of microfluidic-based thiolic self-assembled monolayer
   (SAM) formation on the metallic surfaces has been studied through
   numerical simulation. The computational model simultaneously solves the
   equations of thiols' mass transport, a two-dimensional
   diffusion-convection, coupled to the one-dimensional self-assembly on
   the metallic surface. The model is employed in examining the effect of
   input thiol concentration and flow velocity on the kinetics, as well as
   studying the effect of change in microchannel height and thiols' packing
   density. In addition, the SAM kinetics in pressure and
   electrokinetically driven flows are compared to each other.
   Dimensionless groups are used to compare the reaction and fluidic
   phenomena present and explain the trends observed in the numerical
   simulations. Except the concentration, other parameters were observed to
   impose minor impacts on the kinetics. Namely, simulation results
   confirmed the possibility of achieving a 15-min self-assembly period
   versus the conventional 24-h process time. However, due to
   reaction-limited nature of thiols self-assembly use of microfluidics
   cannot help in achieving a considerably faster kinetics. The result of
   the numerical simulation is verified by an analytical model and compared

Abstract = {{Mineral carbonation of Mg-silicates via the indirect-dry route is among
   the most appealing technical approaches for permanent CO2 storage. It
   brings about the possibility of recycling heat released during
   exothermic carbonation and it offers a higher rate of conversion through
   two separate stages: producing of reactive compounds, mainly Mg(OH)(2),
   through solid reactions between Mg-silicates and ammonium sulfates and
   subsequent carbonation of reactive compounds. Milling is essential to
   enhance the solidstate reaction rate and increase the conversion
   percentage. The milling energy, being the major energy consumption of
   the entire carbonation process, needs to be minimized without sacrifice
   of its activation purpose. This study focuses on enhancing the kinetics
   of solid-state magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) thermal extraction from the
   solid-solid reaction of olivine ((Fe, Mg)(2)SiO4) and ammonium sulfate
   ((NH4)(2)SO4), with optimized milling energy input. This process
   constitutes the first stage of Mg(OH)(2) production for indirect CO2
   storage purposes. The mechanical activation of reactants via a
   high-energy magneto ball milling with a controlled energy input is
   achieved. The variation of structural parameters such as the particle
   size, specific surface area (SSA), pore volume, and crystallite size and
   strain are characterized as a function of milling energy input and the
   correlation between structural factors and activation energy of
   extraction is investigated. In addition, the variation in the apparent
   activation energy of solid-state extraction is examined as a function of
   milling energy. The optimal amount of milling energy input for
   increasing the reaction kinetics of MgSO4 extraction is estimated to be
   about 27.6 kJ g(-1) which causes around 34\% reduction in the activation
   energy of MgSO4 solid-state extraction.}},

Abstract = {{A novel robust method for estimating equivalent tunnelling Mohr-Coulomb
   strength parameters in elastic-plastic or elasto-brittle-plastic media
   satisfying Hoek-Brown failure criterion is proposed. Based on the best
   uniform approximation technique, this method consists of explicit and
   closed-form formulae in terms of elementary functions, making the
   estimation of equivalent parameters more convenient than other methods.
   A simple code is provided and a series of benchmark test cases are
   performed for validation. When the tunnel support is accurately known,
   the performance estimates of this method are better than estimates of
   best fitting in an artificial stress range and best fitting in the
   existing range methods, but not as accurate as the performance of
   equating model responses method and that proposed by Jimenez et al.
   However, when the estimation of support pressure is poor, this method is
   the most robust among all methods. In elasto-brittle-plastic rock mass,
   the advantage of robustness of this method is even more obvious.
   Considering both accuracy and robustness, this method can be employed as
   a preferable alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides are one of the major natural disasters that are frequently
   occurring in southwestern China. The main objective of this study is to
   investigate the relationship between failure of landslide and fractal
   dimension using displacement time-series. Taking two slopes in
   southwestern China as examples, we estimate the fractal parameters of
   displacement time-series and analyze the relationship between fractal
   dimension and the stability of the slope during the evolution of
   landslides. The result shows that the fractal dimension increases when a
   landslide undergoes a transition from stability to failure, but
   decreases during the evolution from active to stable. Fractal dimension
   has a critical value of 1.10 in the transition between active and
   stable, which indicates that fractal dimension is an important nonlinear
   parameter in the evaluation of the stability of landslides, although
   more studies and in situ data are required for validation.}},

Title = {{Identifying key trains and their reasonable ratios in high-speed rail

Abstract = {{A key train plays an important role in the rail timetable. The
   unreasonable key trains' layout greatly influences the normal
   train-running order, thus affecting the quality of the high-speed rail
   (HSR) timetable. This article studies the probability produced by train
   paths for overcoming bottlenecks and identifies key trains in the HSR
   timetable by means of predicting the conflicts using triangular fuzzy
   numbered workflow nets, that is, key trains have greater effect on other
   trains and need to pay close attention to them. In addition,
   stimulations results that were performed with the HSR dispatching system
   illustrate the conclusion. Moreover, under certain capacity
   requirements, this article calculates reasonable key trains' ratio for
   different combinations of speed in a HSR timetable. This research
   demonstrates that (1) low-speed (Class B) trains are key trains in the
   HSR timetable and (2) when trains of 350 km/h and 250 km/h run on the
   same line, the key trains (250 km/h) ratio of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR
   should be less than 10\%. Currently, for trains running on the
   Beijing-Shanghai HSR, whose speeds are 300 km/h and 250 km/h, the key
   trains (250 km/h) ratio should be no more than 20\%.}},

Title = {{Estimation of longitudinal speed robust to road conditions for ground
   vehicles}},
Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1120-1146}},
Abstract = {{This article seeks to develop a longitudinal vehicle velocity estimator
   robust to road conditions by employing a tyre model at each corner.
   Combining the lumped LuGre tyre model and the vehicle kinematics, the
   tyres internal deflection state is used to gain an accurate estimation.
   Conventional kinematic-based velocity estimators use acceleration
   measurements, without correction with the tyre forces. However, this
   results in inaccurate velocity estimation because of sensor
   uncertainties which should be handled with another measurement such as
   tyre forces that depend on unknown road friction. The new Kalman-based
   observer in this paper addresses this issue by considering tyre
   nonlinearities with a minimum number of required tyre parameters and the
   road condition as uncertainty. Longitudinal forces obtained by the
   unscented Kalman filter on the wheel dynamics is employed as an
   observation for the Kalman-based velocity estimator at each corner. The
   stability of the proposed time-varying estimator is investigated and its
   performance is examined experimentally in several tests and on different
   road surface frictions. Road experiments and simulation results show the
   accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach in estimating
   longitudinal speed for ground vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{A combustion chamber, burning gaseous kerosene, is simulated to
   investigate the effects of mini-scale flame-holder geometry and its
   position on the combustion performance and the resulting
   nano-particulate soot aerosol, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide
   pollutions. To model the complex process of soot nanoparticle formation
   including the nucleation, coagulation, surface growth, and oxidation, we
   use a two equation soot model to solve the soot mass fraction and soot
   number density transport equations. Considering a detailed chemical
   kinetic consisting of 121 species and 2613 elementary reactions, we
   construct the required flamelets library, i.e. the lookup table, and
   apply the flamelet combustion model, which solves the transport
   equations of mixture fraction and its variance. We take into account the
   turbulence-chemistry interaction using the presumed-shape probability
   density functions PDFs. Applying the two-equation K-epsilon turbulence
   model with round-jet corrections and suitable wall functions, the
   transport equations of turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation
   rate are solved to close the turbulence closure problem. Since it is
   required to impose the effects of radiation for the most important
   radiating species, we include the radiation heat transfer of soot and
   gases assuming the optically thin flame consideration. In this regard,
   the radiation heat transfer is determined locally and only affected by
   the emissions. We evaluate the achieved solutions through our developed
   method comparing with the data documented in an experimental test, i.e.
   a gaseous-kerosene/air turbulent nonpremixed flame. The comparisons are
   provided for the achieved flame structure, i.e., the experimental data
   reported on the distributions of mixture fraction, temperature, and soot
   volume fraction. Next, we consider a disk-type mini-scale flame-holder
   inside the combustion chamber to study its effects on the flow pattern
   of reacting flow and the distributions of temperature, soot volume
   fraction, soot particles diameter, CO, and CO2 mass fractions. Our
   results show that the mounted flame-holder would increase the inside
   temperature while reduce the temperature, soot volume fraction, CO, and
   CO2 mass fractions of the exhaust gases. We also study the geometry and
   position of mini-scale flame-holder numerically in terms of the average
   values of temperature, soot volume fraction, soot particles diameter, CO
   mass fraction, and CO2 mass fraction at the outlet of combustion
   chamber. Our results indicate that increasing the radius of flame holder
   would lead to a reduction in carbonaceous emissions, i.e. black carbon,
   CO, and CO2, and the temperature of exhaust gases. Evidently, a maximum
   temperature increase inside the combustion chamber would augment the
   combustion performance. We also show that mounting the flame holder at
   the lower positions above the fuel nozzle exit would lead to the same
   consequences. The present study provides good informative advices to the
   researchers who investigate pollution in aero-engine combustion
   chambers.}},

Abstract = {{The spectral line based weighted sum of gray gases (SLW) model is
   considered as an advanced model, which can solve the radiative transfer
   equation (RTE) in non-gray participating media by dividing the
   absorption cross section spectrum into a limited number of intervals.
   Each interval is then treated as a gray gas medium, in which the
   attributed RTE should be solved separately. Therefore, the SLW model
   would be computationally more efficient than the other non-gray
   participating media solvers because it is faced with a small number of
   RTE solutions. In this work, we present a novel optimized SLW model and
   applied it to radiation heat transfer calculation in a model furnace.
   The current optimized SLW model with only 3 gray gases can provide
   accuracy close to the line-by-line (LBL) method. This is while the
   classic non optimized SLW model cannot provide the same level of
   accuracy imposing only 3 gray gases. Therefore, we strongly recommend
   the optimized SLW model to calculate the radiation heat transfer in
   non-gray combustion gas mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in spectral emissivity of Usibor(R) 1500P steel during a
   two-step austenitization and in two different heating atmospheres, argon
   and air, are measured in-situ using a near infrared spectrometer and
   ex-situ with a Fourier transform infrared reflectometer. Phase
   transformations of the Al-Si coating and surface oxidation lead to the
   changes in surface phase composition and surface roughness, which in
   turn influences the spectral emissivity. In the first step heating at
   610 degrees C, the abrupt increase of spectral emissivity in argon and
   air is due to the transformation of the Al-Si metallic surface into the
   Al7Fe2Si intermetallic surface and an increase in surface roughness.
   Through the second step heating at 900 degrees C, the progressive
   decrease of spectral emissivity with soak time in argon is caused by the
   surface phase transformation from Al5Fe2 into AlFe with a decrease in
   surface roughness. In contrast, surface oxidization with an increase in
   surface roughness significantly increases the spectral emissivity after
   two minutes soaking in air.}},

Abstract = {{With nanotechnology becoming an increasingly important field in
   contemporary science, there is a growing demand for a better
   understanding of energy exchange on the nanoscale. Techniques, such as
   time-resolved laser-induced incandescence, for example, require accurate
   models of gas-surface interaction to correctly predict nanoparticle
   characteristics. The present work uses molecular dynamics to define the
   thermal accommodation coefficient of various gases on iron surfaces. A
   more in depth analysis examines the scattering distributions from the
   surfaces and examines how well existing scattering kernels and classical
   theories can represent these distributions. The molecular
   dynamics-derived values are also compared to recent experimental
   time-resolved laser-induced incandescence studies aimed at evaluating
   the thermal accommodation coefficient across a range of surface-gas
   combinations.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Highway Bridges}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2550}},
Pages = {{38-45}},
Abstract = {{The primary contributor to the corrosion of bridges in Canada is heavy
   use of de-icing salts, which can lead to severe rebar corrosion and
   girder soffit spalling in reinforced concrete (RC) highway bridges. This
   paper discusses recent challenges faced by authorities in dealing with
   corrosion problems in Canadian highway bridges, and describes typical
   approaches for the assessment and management of these structures. The
   study developed a methodology for evaluating the residual strength of
   spalled RC bridges. The basis for this methodology is a modified area
   concept, which can be used to consider the effects of exposed
   reinforcement at various locations along the girder length. The study
   developed a multi point analysis program, which employs the modified
   area concept, along with graphical spalling surveys and structural
   drawings, to evaluate RC bridge girders. The program was adapted for a
   full bridge analysis and to consider other effects of corrosion, such as
   bar section loss and bond deterioration. A case study bridge was
   evaluated to show that the developed program offers a viable tool for
   the rapid assessment of spalled bridge girders, to facilitate the
   prioritization of rehabilitation projects. The methodology was evaluated
   in a pilot laboratory study, wherein soffit spalling simulated on
   reduced-scale concrete beam specimens and safe and accurate predictions
   of the specimen capacity were obtained using the modified area concept.}},

Title = {{Carbon Management in the Coal Industry}},
Booktitle = {{COAL PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{459-477}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, coal has become the largest contributor to carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emissions in the energy sector. The increasing concern
   regarding global warming has led to the research and development of more
   effective carbon management technologies for different coal-fueled power
   plants. The Kyoto Implementation Act gives countries initiatives and a
   plan to reduce carbon emissions to avoid further global warming and
   disruption of ecosystems around the world. This chapter explores
   different carbon management technologies that organizations implement to
   increase efficiency and decrease emissions. The topics include
   ultra-supercritical pulverized coal combustion, integrated gasification
   combined cycle, oxy-fueled combustion, and fluidized bed combustion.
   However, mitigation of CO2 still largely relies on carbon capture
   methods such as amine scrubbing, Selexol, and Rectisol processes. This
   chapter also discusses recent advances in carbon capture such as the use
   of novel sorbent materials as well as gas separation using membrane
   technology. Sequestration is another major aspect of carbon management.
   The site for sequestration often includes geological storage in
   aquifers, ocean storage, oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery, or
   coal beds for methane recovery. While carbon management comes at a high
   cost, the captured carbon can be recycled for industrial applications.}},

Title = {{The socioecohydrology of rainwater harvesting in India: understanding
   water storage and release dynamics across spatial scales}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2629-2647}},
Abstract = {{Rainwater harvesting (RWH), the small-scale collection and storage of
   runoff for irrigated agriculture, is recognized as a sustainable
   strategy for ensuring food security, especially in monsoonal landscapes
   in the developing world. In south India, these strategies have been used
   for millennia to mitigate problems of water scarcity. However, in the
   past 100 years many traditional RWH systems have fallen into disrepair
   due to increasing dependence on groundwater. This dependence has
   contributed to accelerated decline in groundwater resources, which has
   in turn led to increased efforts at the state and national levels to
   revive older RWH systems. Critical to the success of such efforts is an
   improved understanding of how these ancient systems function in
   contemporary landscapes with extensive groundwater pumping and shifted
   climatic regimes. Knowledge is especially lacking regarding the
   water-exchange dynamics of these RWH tanks at tank and catchment scales,
   and how these exchanges regulate tank performance and catchment water
   balances. Here, we use fine-scale, water-level variation to quantify
   daily fluxes of groundwater, evapotranspiration (ET), and sluice
   outflows in four tanks over the 2013 northeast monsoon season in a tank
   cascade that covers a catchment area of 28 km(2). At the tank scale, our
   results indicate that groundwater recharge and irrigation outflows
   comprise the largest fractions of the tank water budget, with ET
   accounting for only 13-22\% of the outflows. At the scale of the
   cascade, we observe a distinct spatial pattern in groundwater-exchange
   dynamics, with the frequency and magnitude of groundwater inflows
   increasing down the cascade of tanks. The significant magnitude of
   return flows along the tank cascade leads to the most downgradient tank
   in the cascade having an outflow-to-capacity ratio greater than 2. At
   the catchment scale, the presence of tanks in the landscape dramatically
   alters the catchment water balance, with runoff decreasing by nearly
   75\%, and recharge increasing by more than 40\%. Finally, while water
   from the tanks directly satisfies similar to 40\% of the crop water
   requirement across the northeast monsoon season via surface water
   irrigation, a large fraction of the tank water is `wasted', and more
   efficient management of sluice outflows could lead to tanks meeting a
   higher fraction of crop water requirements.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) involve various emerging
   technologies and applications. This paper presents a comprehensive
   review of recent advances on data/information fusion and
   context-awareness referring to ITS. Data/Information fusion is necessary
   to fuse the data from different sensors and thereby extract relevant
   information on the target sources. On the other hand, context-aware
   information processing provides awareness of the driving environments by
   deploying intelligent query processing and smart information
   dissemination. The fusion and context-awareness should help in improving
   ITS operations with better road-awareness service, traffic monitoring,
   vehicle detection as well as development of new methods. This paper is
   centered on data fusion and context aware methodologies developed
   recently in the areas of ITS rather than on their ITS applications. We
   found that the recent progresses in ITS fusion are devoted to the
   potential cooperative approaches providing real-time/dynamic vehicle
   sensing technologies, whereas the recent context awareness techniques
   are deploying service concepts (e.g. location aware service) and
   frameworks. It is believed that the newly developed advanced
   fusion/context-aware techniques are becoming more effective to tackle
   complex traffic scenarios (e.g. traffic intersection) as well as complex
   urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{Structural colors and photoluminescence have been widely used for

   Both negatively-and positively-charged CNC/QD nanohybrids with a high

   prepared. The controllable LBL coating process was characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy and ellipsometry. The rigid structure of
   CNCs leads to nanoporous structured films on poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET) substrates with high transmittance (above 70\%)
   over the entire range of visible light and also resulted in increased
   hydrophilicity (contact angles of similar to 40 degrees). Nanothin films
   on PET substrates showed good flexibility and enhanced stability in both
   water and ethanol. The modified PET films with structural colors from
   thin-film interference and photoluminescence from QDs can be used in

Abstract = {{Two bisthienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-bithiazole based copolymers
   were synthesised via two different direct (hetero)arylation
   polymerization (DHAP) routes. When a bisthienyl DPP and
   5,5'-dibromo-2,2'-bithiazole were used as monomers, the resulting
   polymer PA-1 showed poor solubility, ill-organized chain ordering and
   low performance in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). Surprisingly,
   the synthetic route using a dibrominated bisthienyl DPP and
   2,2'-bithiazole as monomers produced a polymer PB-1 with improved
   solubility, much higher crystallinity and excellent charge transport
   performance in OTFTs. The electron and hole mobilities of up to 0.53
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 0.06 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively, achieved for
   PB-1 are more than one order of magnitude higher than those of PA-1 and
   also better than the mobilities reported for a similar polymer
   synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization. The dramatically
   different carrier mobilities observed for these two polymers are
   accounted for by their different amounts of alpha-beta coupling linkages
   and branched (and lightly cross-linked) structure defects formed in the
   respective synthetic routes. This work also demonstrated for the first
   time that 2,2'-bithiazole is a suitable monomer for the construction of
   conjugated polymers with good electron transport performance via DHAP.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the actuator disk (AD) method is used to simulate the
   wind turbine performance and far-wake behavior. In this work, we
   incorporate the AD method with an axisymmetric full Navier-Stokes
   solver. In other words, the calculated AD load is suitably distributed
   on the disc to impose the aerodynamic forces acting on the blade. One
   important factor among various different factors, which affect the AD
   modeling prediction considerably, is the utilized grid thickness. In
   this work, we first choose the grid thickness recommended by the other
   researches and study the actual thickness of NREL 5MW wind turbine.
   Next, many other configurations are considered in our AD thickness
   modeling including a constant thickness and the actual thickness
   configurations. The latter one has a linear thickness distribution from
   3.54 m at the root to 0.7 m at tip. The wind speed is ranged from 3 to
   11 m/s consistent with the practical tests performed on the NREL 5MW
   wind turbine. We calculate the generated power for all the simulated
   configurations and their percentages of differences. The results show
   that the lowest difference is about 4.5\% for a constant AD thickness of
   0.2 m. Therefore, we conclude that the current AD model predicts results
   very close to the NREL design data. Additionally, this accurate
   prediction is similarly observed in the other ranges of wind turbine
   operational speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Cationic lytic peptides (CLPs) have shown promise in treating bacterial

   cell membranes. In this work, we used a CLP, C6, as a nanocarrier for a
   hydrophobic anticancer agent, ellipticine (EPT). The size of the
   resulting C6-EPT complex was similar to 190 nm. The in vitro studies
   using A549 lung cancer cells showed an enhanced anticancer activity of
   the C6-EPT complex compared to that of C6 or the EPT control. This
   enhancement was found to correlate with the membrane disruption induced
   by C6, which facilitated the entry of EPT into cells. More importantly,
   the C6-EPT complex showed a higher selectivity than that of C6 towards
   cancer cells upon comparison of their cytotoxicities against A549 cells
   and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. The enhanced therapeutic activity was also
   found in in vivo studies using an A549 tumor-bearing BALB/ c nude mice

Abstract = {{In spite of various existing thermometry methods for microfluidic
   applications, it remains challenging to measure the temperature of
   individual droplets in segmented flow since fast moving droplets do not
   allow sufficient exposure time demanded by both fluorescence based
   techniques and resistance temperature detectors. In this contribution,
   we present a microwave thermometry method that is non-intrusive and
   requires minimal external equipment. This technique relies on the
   correlation of fluid temperature with the resonance frequency of a
   microwave sensor that operates at a GHz frequency range. It is a remote
   yet direct sensing technique, eliminating the need for mixing
   fluorescent dyes with the working fluid. We demonstrated that the sensor
   operates reliably over multiple tests and is capable of both heating and
   sensing. It measures temperature to within +/- 1.2 degrees C accuracy
   and can detect the temperature of individual droplets.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge currently faced in measuring visually evoked optical
   changes in different retinal layers using in vivo and non-invasive
   functional optical coherence tomography (fOCT) is the need for pupillary
   dilation drugs to enable reliable measurement of the retinal functional
   responses. However, there are situations where the use of pupillary
   dilation drugs is not suitable in both clinical and animal ophthalmic
   research situations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new
   approach to tracking visually evoked pupillary dynamics, based on the
   use of a fast scanning fOCT system and a novel computerised framework,
   which can then be used to isolate the pure stimulus-evoked functional
   response from the retina imaged using the same system. The proposed
   framework tracks the highly reflective edges of the iris in the
   cross-sectional fOCT tomograms by applying a three-step strategy: (a) a
   noise-compensation reconstruction in order to reduce the effect of
   speckle noise on the pupil edge tracking accuracy; (b) a region-based
   maximum likelihood tracking of the pupil edge and (c) an outlier
   compensation for calculation of the pupil size.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for measuring pressure changes in
   deep-tissue vessels using vector velocity ultrasound data. The large
   penetration depth is ensured by acquiring data using a low frequency
   phased array transducer. Vascular pressure changes are then calculated
   from 2-D angle-independent vector velocity fields using a model based on
   the Navier-Stokes equations. Experimental scans are performed on a
   fabricated flow phantom having a constriction of 36\% at a depth of 100
   mm. Scans are carried out using a phased array transducer connected to
   the experimental scanner, SARUS. 2-D fields of angle-independent vector
   velocities are acquired using directional synthetic aperture vector flow
   imaging. The obtained results are evaluated by comparison to a 3-D
   numerical simulation model with equivalent geometry as the designed
   phantom. The study showed pressure drops across the constricted phantom
   varying from -40 Pa to 15 Pa with a standard deviation of 32\%, and a
   bias of 25\% found relative to the peak simulated pressure drop. This
   preliminary study shows that pressure can be estimated non-invasively to
   a depth that enables cardiac scans, and thereby, the possibility of
   detecting the pressure drops across the mitral valve.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new design of a stacked three-layer flat-panel x-ray
   detector for dual-energy (DE) imaging. Each layer consists of its own
   scintillator of individual thickness and an underlying
   thin-film-transistor-based flat-panel. Three images are obtained
   simultaneously in the detector during the same x-ray exposure, thereby
   eliminating any motion artifacts. The detector operation is two-fold: a
   conventional radiography image can be obtained by combining all three
   layers' images, while a DE subtraction image can be obtained from the
   front and back layers' images, where the middle layer acts as a
   mid-filter that helps achieve spectral separation. We proceed to
   optimize the detector parameters for two sample imaging tasks that could
   particularly benefit from this new detector by obtaining the best
   possible signal to noise ratio per root entrance exposure using
   well-established theoretical models adapted to fit our new design. These
   results are compared to a conventional DE temporal subtraction detector
   and a single-shot DE subtraction detector with a copper mid-filter, both
   of which underwent the same theoretical optimization. The findings are
   then validated using advanced Monte Carlo simulations for all optimized
   detector setups. Given the performance expected from initial results and
   the recent decrease in price for digital x-ray detectors, the simplicity
   of the three-layer stacked imager approach appears promising to usher in
   a new generation of multi-spectral digital x-ray diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to improve visualization of structural information in
   digital radiography without increasing radiation exposures requires
   improved image quality across all spatial frequencies, especially at
   high frequencies. The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) as a function
   of spatial frequency quantifies image quality given by a x-ray detector.
   We present a method of increasing DQE at high spatial frequencies by
   improving the modulation transfer function (MTF) and reducing noise
   aliasing. The Apodized Aperature Pixel (AAP) design uses a detector with
   micro-elements to synthesize desired pixels and provide higher DQE than
   conventional detector designs. A cascaded system analysis (CSA) that
   incorporates x-ray interactions is used for comparison of the
   theoretical MTF, noise power spectrum (NPS), and DQE. Signal and noise
   transfer through the converter material is shown to consist of
   correlated an uncorrelated terms. The AAP design was shown to improve
   the DQE of both material types that have predominantly correlated
   transfer (such as CsI) and predominantly uncorrelated transfer (such as
   Se). Improvement in the MTF by 50\% and the DQE by 100\% at the sampling
   cut-off frequency is obtained when uncorrelated transfer is prevalent
   through the converter material. Optimizing high-frequency DQE results in
   improved image contrast and visualization of small structures and
   fine-detail.}},

Abstract = {{A novel amorphous selenium (a-Se) direct detector with CMOS readout has
   been designed, and relative detector performance investigated. The
   detector features include a 25 mu m pixel pitch, and 1000 mu m thick
   a-Se layer operating at 10V/mu m bias field. A simulated detector DQE
   was determined, and used in comparative calculations of the Relative
   Object Detectability (ROD) family of prewhitening matched-filter (PWMF)
   observer and non-prewhitening matched filter (NPWMF) observer model
   metrics to gauge a-Se detector performance against existing high
   resolution micro-angiographic fluoroscopic (MAF) detectors and a
   standard flat panel detector (FPD). The PWMF-ROD or ROD metric compares
   two x-ray imaging detectors in their relative abilities in imaging a
   given object by taking the integral over spatial frequencies of the
   Fourier transform of the detector DQE weighted by an object function,
   divided by the comparable integral for a different detector. The
   generalized-ROD (G-ROD) metric incorporates clinically relevant
   parameters (focal spot size, magnification, and scatter) to show the
   degradation in imaging performance for detectors that are part of an
   imaging chain. Preliminary ROD calculations using simulated spheres as
   the object predicted superior imaging performance by the a-Se detector
   as compared to existing detectors. New PWMF-G-ROD and NPWMF-G-ROD
   results still indicate better performance by the a-Se detector in an
   imaging chain over all sphere sizes for various focal spot sizes and
   magnifications, although a-Se performance advantages were degraded by
   focal spot blurring. Nevertheless, the a-Se technology has great
   potential to provide breakthrough abilities such as visualization of
   fine details including of neuro-vascular perforator vessels and of small
   vascular devices.}},

Abstract = {{The electroosmotic flow (EOF) velocity in single PDMS nanochannels with
   dimensions as small as 20 nm is investigated systematically by the
   current slope method in this paper. A novel method for the fabrication
   of single nanochannels on PDMS surfaces is developed. The effects of
   channel size, ionic concentration of the electrolyte solution and
   electric field on the EOF velocity in single nanochannels are
   investigated. The results show that the EOF velocity in smaller
   nanochannels with overlapped electric double layers (EDL) is
   proportional to the applied electric field but is smaller than the EOF
   velocity in microchannels under the same applied electric field. The EOF
   velocity in relatively large nanochannels without the overlap of EDLs is
   independent of the channel size and is the same as that in microchannels
   under the same applied electric field. Furthermore, in smaller
   nanochannels with overlapped EDLs, the EOF velocity depends on the ionic
   concentration and also on the channel size. The experimental results
   reported in this paper are valuable for the future studies of

Abstract = {{Metamaterial-based microwave components are among the state-of-the-art
   heater and sensor designs for microfluidic systems. The miniaturization
   and energy-focusing abilities of the metamaterial-based components make
   it possible to adopt microwave components operating at wavelengths in
   the order of 10 cm for microfluidic systems. Microwave systems are
   particularly advantageous for point-of-care and high-throughput
   applications due to their high speed of operation, very low
   instrumentation cost, ability to selectively and internally heat
   specimens, and ability of label-free sensing. In this study, the
   efficiency and behavior of microwave components designed for heating and
   sensing small volumes in the scale of nanoliters are studied. In the
   heating behavior, an optimum passivation layer thickness that depends on
   the permittivity of the chip material is observed. Increasing the
   permittivity of the chip material increases the optimum passivation
   layer thickness. For a typical microfluidic environment that uses
   polydimethylsiloxane as the chip material and a lossy substrate, 37.4\%
   of incoming microwave power is converted to heat within a 3-nL droplet.
   Increasing the permittivity of the chip material increases the heating
   efficiency. The sensing performance of the component shows that a 3-nL
   droplet generates a shift of 330 MHz (11.3\%) in the resonance
   frequency. There is an optimum chip material permittivity that maximizes
   the shift in the resonance frequency. Increasing the passivation layer
   thickness reduces the sensitivity. Results provide a guideline for
   microwave heater and sensor designs in microfluidic platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Local calibration is an important step before a transportation agency
   adopts the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
   Officials' (AASHTO) mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG).
   This paper presents the challenges of and findings from the local
   calibration of flexible pavements in provincial highways under the
   jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). A
   calibration database was developed that involved a hierarchical
   framework of the input parameters required for AASHTOWare Pavement ME
   (the MEPDG software) and the historical field performance data based on
   the MTO's second-generation pavement management system. A regression
   analysis is carried out for preliminary calibration of rutting and
   international roughness index (IRI) models by comparing the predicted
   distress to observed distress. The analysis suggested that whereas the
   MEPDG provided fairly unbiased prediction of the IRI value, it often
   over-predicted the total rutting. Calibrated predicted IRI and rut depth
   are found for Ontario's local conditions from MEPDG distress prediction
   models. A further clustering analysis based on Functional Class and
   geographical zone for the rutting and IRI, respectively, improved the
   precision of the locally calibrated models.}},

Abstract = {{Impact trauma may cause a hematoma, which is the leakage of venous blood
   into surrounding tissues. Large hematomas can be dangerous as they may
   inhibit local blood flow. Hematomas are often diagnosed visually, which
   may be problematic if the hematoma leaks deeper than the visible
   penetration depth. Furthermore, vascular wound healing is often
   monitored at home without the aid of a clinician. We therefore
   investigated the use of near infrared (NIR) reflectance
   photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) to assess vascular damage resulting
   from a hematoma, and monitor the healing process. In this case study,
   the participant experienced internal vascular damage in the form of a
   hematoma. Using a PPGI system with dual-mode temporally coded
   illumination for ambient-agnostic data acquisition and mounted optical
   elements, the tissue was illuminated with a spatially uniform irradiance
   pattern of 850 nm wavelength light for increased tissue penetration and
   high oxy-to-deoxyhemoglobin absorption ratio. Initial and follow-up PPGI
   data collection was performed to assess vascular damage and healing. The
   tissue PPGI sequences were spectrally analyzed, producing spectral maps
   of the tissue area. Experimental results show that spatial differences
   in spectral information can be observed around the damaged area. In
   particular, the damaged site exhibited lower pulsatility than the
   surrounding healthy tissue. This pulsatility was largely restored in the
   follow-up data, suggesting that the tissue had undergone vascular
   healing. These results indicate that hematomas can be assessed and
   monitored in a non-contact visual manner, and suggests that PPGI can be
   used for tissue health assessment, with potential extensions to
   peripheral vascular disease.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous heart rate monitoring can provide important context for
   quantitative clinical assessment in scenarios such as long-term health
   monitoring and disability prevention. Photoplethysmographic imaging
   (PPGI) systems are particularly useful for such monitoring scenarios as
   contact-based devices pose problems related to comfort and mobility.
   Each pixel can be regarded as a virtual PPG sensor, thus enabling
   simultaneous measurements of multiple skin sites. Existing PPGI systems
   analyze temporal PPGI sensor fluctuations related to hemodynamic
   pulsations across a region of interest to extract the blood pulse
   signal. However, due to spatially varying optical properties of the
   skin, the blood pulse signal may not be consistent across all PPGI
   sensors, leading to inaccurate heart rate monitoring. To increase the
   hemodynamic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we propose a novel spectral
   PPGI sensor fusion method for enhanced estimation of the true blood
   pulse signal. Motivated by the observation that PPGI sensors with high
   hemodynamic SNR exhibit a spectral energy peak at the heart rate
   frequency, an entropy-based fusion model was formulated to combine PPGI
   sensors based on the sensors' spectral energy distribution. The optical
   PPGI device comprised a near infrared (NIR) sensitive camera and an 850
   nm LED. Spatially uniform irradiance was achieved by placing optical
   elements along the LED beam, providing consistent illumination across
   the skin area. Dual -mode temporally coded illumination was used to
   negate the temporal effect of ambient illumination. Experimental results
   show that the spectrally weighted PPGI method can accurately and
   consistently extract heart rate information where traditional
   region-based averaging fails.}},

Abstract = {{The development and validation of a high-fidelity dynamics model of an
   electric vehicle is presented. The developed model is comprised of two
   subsystems: i) the vehicle dynamics model, and ii) the electrical
   powertrain subsystem consists of the alternating-current (AC) induction
   motor, the 3-phase pulse width-modulation (PWM) inverter, and the motor
   controllers. At each stage of the development, the developed models are
   verified by studying their simulation results. Also, vehicle testing is
   performed using a reference electric vehicle and experimental powertrain
   data is measured from the vehicle's electrical powertrain controller
   area network (CAN) bus. The experimental motor torque-speed curves are
   used to tune the AC electric motor model parameters. Once the individual
   components are developed and validated, the high-fidelity electric
   vehicle system model is created by assembling the MapleSim vehicle
   dynamics model and the electrical powertrain subsystem. The simulation
   results, such as the vehicle's longitudinal speed and developed motor

Abstract = {{After more than 30 years since the Antilock Braking System (ABS) was
   first introduced, it has become the most important active safety system
   used on passenger cars. However, it is hard to find a precise
   description of ABS, its stability and performance in the literature.
   Most of ABS algorithms currently used are not adaptive to changes of
   road friction conditions. The aim of our work is to provide a new ABS
   algorithm that is adaptive to changes of road conditions. To this end,
   an online parameter estimator is designed to estimate the road
   characteristics and maximum possible deceleration. Then, a driver demand
   regulator is proposed to limit the demanded deceleration to the maximum
   values. In this new strategy, road characteristics are estimated prior
   to the braking, not during the braking which makes it fast and adaptive.
   The proposed ABS algorithm is simulated on an artificial driving track
   and simulation results have been compared to a simple non-adaptive
   6-phase Bosch ABS algorithm as our benchmark that is based on
   deceleration thresholds. Results show a better braking performance and
   more than 30\% of reduction in braking distance.}},

Abstract = {{While graphene and other carbonaceous nanomaterials have shown promise
   in a variety of electrochemical applications, measurement of their
   intrinsic performance is often confounded with effects related to the
   complexities due to diffusion in a porous medium. To by-pass this
   limitation, we use effectively non-porous tiled monolayers of reduced
   graphene oxide as a model platform to study how rates of heterogeneous
   electron transfer evolve as a function of graphene structure/chemistry.
   A variety of electrochemical systems are investigated including the
   standard ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe, several common biomolecular
   redox systems as well as copper electrodeposition. We show that the
   rates of heterogeneous electron transfer can vary by as much as 3 orders
   of magnitude depending on the reduction or annealing conditions used and
   the redox system investigated. Performance changes are linked to
   graphene chemistry, and we show that the graphene oxide reduction
   procedure must be chosen judiciously to maximize the electrochemical
   performance for particular applications. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{The main goal of the current investigation is to evaluate the potential
   of the optimal control techniques to improve the quality of battery
   thermal management (BTM) in electric vehicles (EVs). The BTM is of
   profound importance in EVs, where battery is the sole power source and
   any unexpected change in the battery temperature could dramatically
   affect the vehicle performance and its driving range. As a result, the
   battery temperature should be maintained within a specific range to lead
   to the best vehicle performance. Despite the obvious importance of this
   issue, there exist rare reports in the literature addressing the design
   of optimal controllers for BTM of EVs. Here, the authors intend to apply
   and compare two controllers to solve this problem for an EV: an optimal
   controller designed upon dynamic programming (DP) and a proportional
   integral-derivative (PID) controller. The results indicate that by using
   DP, a less amount of the battery power will be demanded, and therefore,
   the vehicle's driving range can be increased.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of prediction of the total life
   of an engineering structure based on the fatigue crack growth model. The
   life of an engineering component is generally modeled as a combination
   of the time required for a crack to initiate and then the time required
   for crack to propagate till the final fracture. Unfortunately the crack
   initiation size is a vaguely defined parameter. In order to overcome
   this ambiguity it is proposed to model the total life of an engineering
   structure by using the UniGrow fatigue crack growth model with
   assumption of the intrinsic material parameter rho{*} as an initial
   crack size. The method to overcome the small crack problem in fatigue
   crack modeling is presented as well. The proposed model was successfully
   used to predict fatigue lives of misaligned cruciform welded joints
   under a constant amplitude loading. Results from the analysis and
   experiment are in a good agreement.}},

   Comparison with Experimental Results}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROTATING MACHINERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Predictions of the performance of operating wind turbines are
   challenging for many reasons including the unsteadiness of the wind and
   uncertainties in blade aerodynamic behaviour. In the current study an
   extended blade element momentum (BEM) program was developed to compute
   the rotor power of an existing 4.3m diameter turbine and compare
   predictions with reported controlled experimental measurements.
   Beginning with basic blade geometry and the iterative computation of
   aerodynamic properties, the method integrated the BEM analysis into the
   program workflow ensuring that the power production by a blade element
   agreed with its lift and drag data at the same Reynolds number. The
   parametric study using the extended BEM algorithm revealed the close
   association of the power curve behaviour with the aerodynamic
   characteristics of the blade elements, the discretization of the
   aerodynamic span, and the dependence on Reynolds number when the blades
   were stalled. Transition prediction also affected overall performance,
   albeit to a lesser degree. Finally, to capture blade finite area
   effects, the tip loss model was adjusted depending on stall conditions.
   The experimental power curve for the HAWT of the current study was
   closely matched by the extended BEM simulation.}},

Title = {{Recent progress and perspectives on bi-functional oxygen
   electrocatalysts for advanced rechargeable metal-air batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Abstract = {{With continued dependence on carbon-based fuels and rising concerns of
   environmental issues, the development of rechargeable metal-air
   batteries has recently gained tremendous attention. However, due to the
   slow kinetics of electrochemical oxygen reactions, the charge and
   discharge processes of a rechargeable metal-air battery must be
   catalyzed by using bi-functional catalysts that are active towards both
   the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. This review focuses
   on recent developments in bi-functional catalysts and their catalytic
   activity in relation to materials composition, morphology, and crystal
   structure obtained through various synthetic techniques. The discussion
   is divided into sections based on the main types of recent bi-functional
   catalysts such as transition metal-and carbon-based materials, and
   hybrids which consist of the two. The subsections are then divided based
   on the metal substituents, types of dopant, degree of doping, and defect
   densities, discussing the effects of composition. In parallel,
   morphological effects on the catalytic activity, such as unique
   nanostructured design, surface area enhancements, and porosity, are also
   discussed. Currently, bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst research is
   heading in the direction of reducing the loading of precious metals, and
   developing cost-competitive non-precious metal-and carbon-based
   catalysts to enable commercialization of rechargeable metal-air
   batteries for various applications including electric-drive vehicles and
   smart-grid energy storage. To understand the origin of bi-functional
   catalytic activity, future catalyst research should be conducted in
   combination with in situ characterizations, and computational studies,
   which will allow exploitation of active sites to maximize the efficacy
   of bi-functional catalysts.}},

   3,3'-(5H,5'H-{[}2,2'-bithiophenylidene]-5,5'-diylidene)bis(1-dodecylindo

   6,6'-positions (4c-S1), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels further
   decreased. In OTFT devices, these IDTO compounds exhibit unipolar n-type
   semiconductor behavior due to their significantly deeper LUMO and HOMO
   energy levels than those of 3a that shows ambipolar charge transport
   performance. The maximum electron mobilities of 4a-S1, 4b-S1 and 4c-S1
   are in the order of 10(-2) to 10(-1) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which are much
   higher than that of 3a (similar to 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), originating
   from the lower LUMO energy levels and the high isomeric purities of the
   former compounds. Among the three IDTO compounds, 4c-S1 shows the
   highest electron mobility of up to 0.11 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which is likely
   due to its most extended pi-electron delocalization on the LUMO
   wavefunction.}},

Abstract = {{Models on drying of durum wheat pasta and enriched pasta were reviewed
   to identify avenues for improvement according to consumer needs, product
   formulation and processing conditions. This review first summarized the
   fundamental phenomena of pasta drying, mass transfer, heat transfer,
   momentum, chemical changes, shrinkage and crack formation. The basic
   equations of the current models were then presented, along with methods
   for the estimation of pasta transport and thermodynamic properties. The
   experimental validation of these models was also presented and
   highlighted the need for further model validation for drying at high
   temperatures (>-100 degrees C) and for more accurate estimation of the
   pasta diffusion and mass transfer coefficients. This review indicates
   the need for the development of mechanistic models to improve our
   understanding of the mass and heat transfer mechanisms involved in pasta
   drying, and to consider the local changes in pasta transport properties
   and relaxation time for more accurate description of the moisture
   transport near glass transition conditions. The ability of current
   models to describe dried pasta quality according to the consumers
   expectations or to predict the impact of incorporating ingredients high
   in nutritional value on the drying of these enriched pasta was also
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Automated Rehabilitation System: Movement Measurement and Feedback for

Journal = {{HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3-4, SI}},
Pages = {{294-334}},
Abstract = {{In current physical rehabilitation protocols, patients typically perform
   exercises with intermittent feedback or guidance following the initial
   demonstrations from the physiotherapist. Although many patient-centered
   systems have been developed for home rehabilitation, few systems have
   been developed to aid the physiotherapist as well as patients in the
   rehabilitation clinic. This article proposes the Automated
   Rehabilitation System (ARS), a system designed specifically for
   rehabilitation clinics using an iterative design process, developed with
   physiotherapists and patients in a knee and hip replacement clinic. ARS
   consists of body-worn inertial measurement units that continuously
   measure the patient's pose. The measured pose is graphically represented
   as an animation and overlaid with the instructed motion on a visual
   display shown to the patient during exercise performance. ARS allows
   physiotherapists to quantitatively measure patient movement, assess
   recovery progress, and manage and schedule exercise regimens for
   patients. The system requirements and design requirements were derived
   through a focus group with 13 physiotherapists. For patients, ARS
   provides visual feedback and a novel exercise guidance feature to aid
   them while exercising. The patient interface was evaluated in a user
   study with 26 outpatients. The results show that performing the
   exercises with the visual guidance tool improves the quality of exercise
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are widely recognized as a common and largely distributed natural
   hazard with potential for causing loss of life, property damage,
   disruption of the economy and environmental damages. All geographic
   regions of Canada are susceptible to the deleterious impacts of floods.
   Recent flood events in Canada and elsewhere have contributed to the
   common perception that floods and associated damages have been
   increasing in recent years. Given the ubiquitous nature of this hazard,
   a thorough examination of the many complex and interrelated aspects of
   natural and man-made floods in Canada is long overdue. This special
   issue contains 27 papers dealing with a variety of different aspects of
   floods in Canada. The first 16 papers deal with physical aspects of
   floods and include a collection of case study papers that present recent
   flood events in Canada, following a common format to allow readers to
   compare and contrast recent flood events in different regions of Canada.
   The last 11 papers focus on ecological, social and management aspects of
   floods. The papers included in this special issue present topical
   information on flooding and also challenge common perceptions of floods
   and flood processes in Canada.}},

Pages = {{139-150}},
Abstract = {{Flood events in Canada result in larger costs, in terms of property
   damage, than any other natural disaster. Changes in land use, and more
   recently the impacts of climate change, can lead to changes in the flood
   regime. This paper describes research examining changes in the flood
   regime for watersheds across Canada. To distinguish between changes
   resulting from land-use changes and those occurring due to changes in
   climate, the analysis of flood data is conducted only on watersheds that
   are either part of a formal Reference Hydrologic Network (RHN), or which
   exhibit RHN-like characteristics. A total of 280 gauging stations have
   been analyzed for changes to a number of attributes of the flood regime.
   Changes in the magnitude and timing of flood events as well as the
   frequency and duration of high-flow events are examined for all 280
   sites. Using all 280 sites and different groupings of the sites, based
   on timing of floods, drainage area and the RHN designation, changes were
   determined in the annual number of sites at which the flow exceeded the
   25-, 50- and 100-year return period events. An examination of the
   results leads to important insights into the nature of changes that are
   occurring in the flood regimes in Canada. The results have important
   implications for the design of hydraulic infrastructure, flood
   preparedness and the provision of adequate flood protection for
   populations at risk.}},

Abstract = {{Node clustering is a potential approach to improve the scalability of
   networking protocols in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). High
   relative vehicle mobility and frequent network topology changes inflict
   new challenges on maintaining stable clusters. As a result, cluster
   stability is a crucial measure of the efficiency of clustering
   algorithms for VANETs. This paper presents a stochastic analysis of the
   vehicle mobility impact on single-hop cluster stability. A stochastic
   mobility model is adopted to capture the time variations of intervehicle
   distances (distance headways). First, we propose a discrete-time lumped
   Markov chain to model the time variations of a system of distance
   headways. Second, the first passage time analysis is used to derive
   probability distributions of the time periods of the invariant
   cluster-overlap state and cluster membership as measures of cluster
   stability. Third, queueing theory is utilized to model the limiting
   behaviors of the numbers of common and unclustered nodes between
   neighboring clusters. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the

Abstract = {{Here we report modification of thin film composite (TFC) membranes via a
   series of chemical and surface reactions. Initially, the nascent
   polyamide (PA) active layer was prepared by interfacial polymerization
   and composited with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and then reacted with
   cupric chloride dihydrate (CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O). Finally, the
   composited membrane was treated by a reaction with ammonium hydroxide
   (NH4OH) solution. The chemical modifications of the PA active layer
   included the formation of a polyamide-copper-graphene oxide complex
   (PA-Cu2+-GO), whereas, the surface modifications, mineralization,
   include the formation of copper hydroxide {[}Cu(OH)(2)] on the membrane
   surface through a reaction between the residual CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O
   and NH4OH solution. The results of the compositional analysis of
   mineralized membranes showed that the active layer is fully
   cross-linked, with Cu2+ chelated with amide nitrogen and coordinated
   with the carbonyl groups. The membrane performance was evaluated using a
   cross-flow apparatus at 2000 mg L-1 NaCl solution, 25 degrees C and a
   pressure of 15 bar. The mineralized membrane with optimum concentrations
   of copper chloride and ammonium hydroxide of 0.125 molar and 0.1\%,
   respectively, and a reaction time of 1 minute showed a higher pure water
   permeability and solute water flux (44.25, 33.77 L m(-2) h(-1)) compared
   to the pristine TFC membrane (21.36, 20.2 L m(-2) h(-1)) with an
   excellent salt rejection (>= 98.5\%). Moreover, the mineralized
   membranes were found to resist chlorine attack and fouling adsorption
   more than the non-treated TFC membrane.}},

Title = {{Single-step synthesis of graphene quantum dots by femtosecond laser
   ablation of graphene oxide dispersions}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{8863-8877}},
Abstract = {{In the last few years, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have attracted the
   attention of many research groups for their outstanding properties,
   which include low toxicity, chemical stability and photoluminescence.
   One of the challenges of GQD synthesis is finding a single-step, cheap
   and sustainable approach for synthesizing these promising nanomaterials.
   In this study, we demonstrate that femtosecond laser ablation of
   graphene oxide (GO) dispersions could be employed as a facile and
   environmentally friendly synthesis method for GQDs. With the proper
   control of laser ablation parameters, such as ablation time and laser
   power, it is possible to produce GQDs with average sizes of 2-5 nm,
   emitting a blue luminescence at 410 nm. We tested the feasibility of the
   synthesized GQDs as materials for electronic devices by aerosol-jet
   printing of an ink that is a mixture of water dispersion of laser
   synthesized GQDs and silver nanoparticle dispersion, which resulted in
   lower resistivity of the final printed patterns. Preliminary results
   showed that femtosecond laser synthesized GQDs can be mixed with silver
   nanoparticle dispersion to fabricate a hybrid material, which can be
   employed in printing electronic devices by either printing patterns that
   are more conductive and/or reducing costs of the ink by decreasing the
   concentration of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the ink.}},

Title = {{The formation and study of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(norbornene)
   block-copolymers on the surface of titanium-dioxide particles: a novel
   approach towards application of si-ROMP to larger surface modification}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{2751-2758}},
Abstract = {{Ring-opening metathesis polymerization, or ROMP, has been known in the
   world of polymers as a success story. With its discovery in the middle
   of the 20th century, the study and understanding of this reaction led to
   its adoption in a multitude of areas in both academic and industrial
   domains. However, with the general shift towards hybrid materials and
   better material integration, surface-initiated polymerization (SIP) has
   been an area of great interest that ROMP has only tapped into at the
   very end of the 20th century. With this point in mind, we demonstrate
   another pathway towards SIP using the si-ROMP approach to form
   block-copolymers of poly(ethylene-oxide)-poly(norbornene) (PEO-PNB)
   brushes on particles of titania. In this study, particle modification
   was first performed and studied, which was then applied towards coating
   larger, curved tubes to assess their ability for surface modification.
   In the case of particles, each step was analyzed by XPS to ensure that
   the expected elements appeared. TGA was then implemented to determine
   the general grafting density of the PEO chains on the surface, which was
   found to be 2.7 molecules per nm(2). TGA could also determine the degree
   of polymerization (DP) of the polynorbornene chain, which was 12 500.
   Finally, SEM was used to image the final products, both film formation
   using particles, and after use of these particles as a surface coating
   to cover larger surface areas for surface modification. The
   functionalized titania particles are determined to be an interesting
   candidate material for a ``seed{''} layer, which can be used for larger
   surface modification.}},

Title = {{Design and Implementation of Warbler Family of Lightweight Pseudorandom
   Number Generators for Smart Devices}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{With the advent of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things
   (IoT), the security and privacy issues for various smart devices such as
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and wireless sensor nodes are
   receiving increased attention from academia and industry. A number of
   lightweight cryptographic primitives have been proposed to provide
   security services for resource-constrained smart devices. As one of the
   core primitives, a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
   generator (PRNG) plays an important role for lightweight embedded
   applications. The most existing PRNGs proposed for smart devices employ
   true random number generators as a component, which generally incur
   significant power consumption and gate count in hardware. In this
   article, we present Warbler family, a new pseudorandom number generator
   family based on nonlinear feedback shift registers (NLFSRs) with
   desirable randomness properties. The design of the Warbler family is
   based on the combination of modified de Bruijn blocks together with a
   nonlinear feedback Welch-Gong (WG) sequence generator, which enables us
   to precisely characterize the randomness properties and to flexibly
   adjust the security level of the resulting PRNG. Some criteria for
   selecting parameters of the Warbler family are proposed to offer the
   maximum level of security. Two instances of the Warbler family are also
   described, which feature two different security levels and are dedicated
   to EPC C1 Gen2 RFID tags and wireless sensor nodes, respectively. The
   security analysis shows that the proposed instances not only can pass
   the cryptographic statistical tests recommended by the EPC C1 Gen2
   standard and NIST but also are resistant to the cryptanalytic attacks
   such as algebraic attacks, cube attacks, time-memory-data tradeoff
   attacks, Mihaljevie et al.'s attacks, and weak internal state and fault
   injection attacks. Our ASIC implementations using a 65nm CMOS process
   demonstrate that the proposed two lightweight instances of the Warbler
   family can achieve good performance in terms of speed and area and
   provide ideal solutions for securing low-cost smart devices.}},

Title = {{Salient Region Detection Using Self-Guided Statistical Non-Redundancy in
   Natural Images}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{48-60}},
Abstract = {{We propose an effective framework for salient region detection in
   natural images based on the concept of self-guided statistical
   non-redundancy (SGNR). Salient regions are unique, because they have low
   information redundancy within a given image, while the rest of the scene
   may highly be redundant. We first analyze the structural characteristics
   of the image using structured image elements (samples) and classify them
   as being non-redundant or redundant based on textural compactness and
   overall non-redundancy. This guides saliency detection toward regions
   with low information redundancy by considering explicitly high
   information redundancy of samples potentially belonging to the
   background. We then compute the saliency map by determining the
   statistical non-redundancy of each sample using a conditional graph
   model. Experimental results based on publicly available data sets show
   that SGNR provides promising results when compared with existing
   saliency approaches.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient, accurate, and tunable circuit model is presented for
   modeling of the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) series-fed

   flexibility, the mutual coupling between antenna elements is taken into
   account and represented by a fully adjustable model, allowing the design
   parameters to be varied. Development of the circuit model is
   straightforward. Only one or two antenna elements from the array need to
   be simulated with a full-wave solver. Furthermore, the model is
   applicable for antenna arrays with different numbers of elements. The
   circuit model enables efficient iterative design and optimization of
   antenna arrays. Millimeter-wave SIW series-fed DRA array examples are
   used to validate the model. The simulation results using the proposed
   circuit model agree well with the full-wave solver and measurement
   results.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based flexible supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted great
   attention as they enable the realization of next-generation bendable,
   light-weight, and environmentally-friendly portable electronics.
   However, conventional paper-based SCs adopt a sandwich-like structure
   suffering from poor rate performance, slow frequency response and
   difficulty in direct integration with other micro-devices. We report
   here for the first time paper-based all-solid-state flexible planar
   micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):
   poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-CNT/Ag as the electrode material by
   the inkjet printing technique. The as-fabricated paper-based
   all-solid-state flexible MSCs deliver the best rate capability among all
   reported paper-based MSCs/SCs (up to 10 000 mV s(-1)), fast frequency
   response (relaxation time constant iota(0) = 8.5 ms), high volumetric
   specific capacitance (23.6 F cm(-3)) and long cycle stability (92\%
   capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles), which shows a strong
   dependence on the film thickness and the interdigitated spacing between
   neighbouring fingers, respectively. Furthermore, the series and parallel
   connections reveal that the as-prepared paper-based MSCs obey the basic
   theorem of series and parallel connections of capacitors, respectively.
   The combination of the simple fabrication technology and excellent
   performances presented here not only make paper-based all-solid-state
   flexible MSCs an attractive candidate for powering future flexible
   portable electronics, but also provide important references for the
   design and fabrication of other high-performance flexible energy storage
   devices.}},

Title = {{Sintering Bonding Process with Ag Nanoparticle Paste and Joint
   Properties in High Temperature Environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Ag nanoparticle paste is prepared based on the polyol method and
   subsequent concentration by centrifuging. The sintering bonding process
   using Ag nanoparticle paste at different bonding pressures is studied.
   The joint strengths are increased as the bonding pressure increases from
   0 MPa to 7.5 MPa. This is due to the fact that the higher assistant
   bonding pressure is beneficial to the growth of neck size between the
   adjacent particles and forms denser sintered Ag layers. The joint
   strength bonded under 10 MPa is lower than that bonded under 7.5 MPa,
   which may be due to the residue of organic component in the sintered Ag
   layer. The joint properties bonded with Ag nanoparticle paste in high
   temperature environment are evaluated by heat treatments at temperatures
   ranges of 200-350 degrees C for 50 hours. The results show that the
   mechanical properties of joint with Ag nanoparticle paste are better
   than the joint with Pb95Sn5 solder after storage at high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript describes an approach, based on Laban Movement Analysis,
   to generate compact and informative representations of movement to
   facilitate affective movement recognition and generation for robots and
   other artificial embodiments. We hypothesize that Laban Movement
   Analysis, which is a comprehensive and systematic approach for
   describing movement, is an excellent candidate for deriving a
   low-dimensional representation of movement which facilitates affective
   motion modeling. First, we review the dimensions of Laban Movement
   Analysis most relevant for capturing movement expressivity and propose
   an approach to compute an estimate of the Shape and Effort components of
   Laban Movement Analysis using data obtained from motion capture. Within
   a motion capture environment, a professional actor reproduced prescribed
   motions, imbuing them with different emotions. The proposed approach was
   compared with a Laban coding by a certified movement analyst (CMA). The
   results show a strong correlation between results from the automatic
   Laban quantification and the CMA-generated Laban quantification of the
   movements. Based on these results, we describe an approach for the
   automatic generation of affective movements, by adapting pre-defined
   motion paths to overlay affective content. The proposed framework is
   validated through cross-validation and perceptual user studies. The
   proposed approach has great potential for application in fields
   including robotics, interactive art, animation and dance/acting
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicles on the road with some common interests can cooperatively form a
   platoon-based driving pattern, in which a vehicle follows another
   vehicle and maintains a small and nearly constant distance to the
   preceding vehicle. It has been proved that, compared with driving
   individually, such a platoon-based driving pattern can significantly
   improve road capacity and energy efficiency. Moreover, with the emerging
   vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the performance of a platoon in terms
   of road capacity, safety, energy efficiency, etc., can be further
   improved. On the other hand, the physical dynamics of vehicles inside
   the platoon can also affect the performance of a VANET. Such a complex
   system can be considered a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system
   (VCPS), which has attracted significant attention recently. In this
   paper, we present a comprehensive survey on a platoon-based VCPS. We
   first review the related work of a platoon-based VCPS. We then introduce
   two elementary techniques involved in a platoon-based VCPS, i.e., the
   vehicular networking architecture and standards, and traffic dynamics,
   respectively. We further discuss the fundamental issues in a
   platoon-based VCPS, including vehicle platooning/clustering, cooperative
   adaptive cruise control, platoon-based vehicular communications, etc.,
   all of which are characterized by the tightly coupled relationship
   between traffic dynamics and VANET behaviors. Since system verification
   is critical to VCPS development, we also give an overview of VCPS
   simulation tools. Finally, we share our view on some open issues that
   may lead to new research directions.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation and toxicity assay on a three-dimensional
   electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) of organic pollutants were described in

   pollutant and C. vulgaris was applied to assess the toxicity evolution
   during electrocatalytic oxidation for this study. The degradation and
   mineralization rate of CB, and the toxicity of wastewater sample during
   the electro-oxidation were determined meantime under suitable
   experimental conditions. The experimental results indicated that CB,
   oxidized incompletely to CO2 and H2O, was removed prior to total organic
   carbon (TOC), and the bio-toxicity was relevant to the intermediate
   products of CB degradation. The major intermediate products included
   phenol, biphenyl, 1,4-benzoquinone and other small molecular organic
   acids, unequivocally identified by GC/MS and IC. It was essential to
   maintain enough mineralization for toxicity reduction during
   electro-oxidation of organics in water.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent cavitation models for the analysis of two-phase flows in
   diesel injectors with single-and two-fluid modeling approaches have been
   evaluated, including the Saha-Abu-Ramandan-Li (SAL), Schnerr-Sauer (SS),
   and Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) models. The SAL model is a single-fluid
   model, while the other two models have been implemented with both
   single-and two-fluid approaches. Numerical predictions are compared with
   experimental results available in literature, qualitatively with
   experimental images of two-phase flow in an optically accessible nozzle,
   and quantitatively with measured mass flow rates and velocity profiles.
   It is found that at low injection pressure differentials there can be
   considerable discrepancy in the predictions of the vapor distribution
   from the three models considered. This discrepancy is reduced as the
   injection pressure differential is increased. Implementation of the SS
   and ZGB models with single-and two-fluid approaches yields noticeable
   differences in the results because of the relative velocity between the
   two phases, with two-fluid approach providing better agreement with
   experimental results. The performance of the SS and ZGB models
   implemented with the two-fluid approach is comparable with the SAL
   single-fluid model, but with significantly more computational time.
   Overall, the SAL single-fluid model performs comparatively better with
   respect to the other two models.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is presented to describe the electrochemical
   performance of a LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2-LiMn2O4 (NMC-LMO) blended cathode
   obtained from a commercial lithium-ion battery. The model accounts for
   the multiple particle sizes of the active materials in terms of three
   distributions: one for LMO particles, one for NMC primary and one for
   NMC secondary particles which likely are agglomerates of primary
   particles. The good match between the simulated and experimental
   galvanostatic discharge and differential-capacity curves supports the
   assumption that the secondary particles are nonporous under conditions
   where currents of 2C and below are applied. A thermodynamically
   consistent equation for diffusive flux is used to describe transport
   across the active particles. The corresponding thermodynamic factors are
   estimated from the equilibrium potentials of the active materials
   present in the electrode, while the particle size distribution and
   effective electronic conductivities of each component have been directly
   measured. Since the model is able to accurately describe the utilization
   of the various particle sizes and determine the contribution of each
   component at different discharge rates, it can serve as a useful tool
   for customizing the designs and predicting the discharge profiles of
   electrode blends made up of different active materials having a range of
   particle sizes. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

   speaker-independent speech dictionary using a precomputed noise
   dictionary. The proposed method works well with the real world
   nonstationary noise independent to the speaker. The method is evaluated
   using a speech database consists of different speakers showing promising
   enhancement performance by reducing the nonstationary noise together

Abstract = {{This article deals with the challenging problem of segmenting narrowly
   spaced cardiac events (S1 and S2) in noisy phonocardiogram (PCG) signals
   by using a novel application of NMF based on time-scale approach. A
   novel energy-based method is proposed for the segmentation of noisy PCG
   signals in order to detect cardiac events, which could be closely spaced
   and separated by noisy gaps. The method is based on time-scale transform
   as well as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and the segmentation
   problem is formulated using the paradigm of binary statistical
   hypothesis testing. The energy of the Morlet wavelet transform and NMF
   output is employed as a test statistics for segmentation where the
   number of scales are selected based on the preferences calculated along
   the time-scales. The simulation results using real recorded noisy PCG
   data that provide promising performance with high overall accuracy on
   the segmentation of narrowly separated, high noisy signals by our

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Early model-driven engineering (MDE) assumed simple pipeline-like
   scenarios specified by the Model-Driven Architecture approach:
   platform-independent models that describe a software system at a
   high-level of abstraction are transformed stepwise to platform-dependent
   models from which executable source code is generated. Modern
   applications require a shift toward networks of models related in
   various ways, whose synchronization often needs to be incremental and
   bidirectional. This new situation demands new features from
   transformation tools, and a solid semantic foundation to understand and
   classify these features. We address the problem by presenting a taxonomy
   of model synchronization types, organized into a 3D-space. Each point in
   the space refers to a specific synchronization semantics with an
   underlying algebraic model and the respective requirements for the
   change propagation operations and their properties. The taxonomy aims to
   help with identifying and communicating a proper specification for the
   synchronization problem at hand and for the available solutions offered
   by tools. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The propagation of surface waves provides information about the
   properties of materials. Variations in material conditions can be
   inferred from changes in phase velocity and attenuation. These surface
   wave characteristics are successfully used to detect the individual
   surface-breaking cracks in concrete elements, whereas assessment of the
   elements with irregularly distributed defects requires more
   investigation. In this paper, six lab-scale concrete beams, each with a
   different defect volume, are tested using ultrasonic methods to develop
   a global condition assessment methodology for the concrete elements. The
   relationships between the defect volume and the wave
   characteristics-namely, P-wave and R-wave velocities, attenuation
   coefficient, material damping ratio, and the recently proposed
   dispersion index (DI)-are investigated. The signal processing techniques
   in time, frequency, and wavelet domains are used to extract the most
   accurate diagnostic feature. The attenuation coefficient is found as an
   optimum parameter to evaluate the damage in terms of reliability and
   sensitivity, which is followed by the DI and wave velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) has been recognized as an important
   issue for persons exposed to blast. Specifically, this injury has been
   associated with exposure to blast overpressure and more recently
   relatively large negative pressures have been identified as occurring at
   the posterior regions of the brain in experimental and in numerical
   studies of frontal blast exposure. These negative pressures are caused
   by the reflection of the incident bar stress wave from the free surface
   of the skull, and may be intensified due to focusing effects from the
   curvature of the skull. Under certain circumstances, this negative
   pressure is hypothesized to cause cavitation of cerebrospinal fluid
   (CSF) surrounding the brain, potentially resulting in injury to the
   brain. Unfortunately the cavitation pressure of CSF has not been
   directly measured, so the consequence of negative pressures in numerical
   head models exposed to blast cannot be accurately predicted. The
   cavitation pressure of fluids is highly variable, depending on the
   presence of impurities in the fluid and the presence of dissolved
   gasses. In this study, a modified Compressive Split Hopkinson Pressure
   Bar (CSHPB) apparatus incorporating a sealed confinement chamber was
   used to generate negative pressures in distilled water to investigate
   the cavitation properties of water as a surrogate for CSF. The negative
   pressures in the fluid were measured using a pressure transducer
   designed for compression and validated in comparison to the input signal
   on the modified Hopkinson bar apparatus, as well as verified by a
   numerical model of the experiment. The CSHPB apparatus was used to
   generate initial compressive waves ranging from 1.85 to 7.85 MPa to
   produce cavitation in distilled water. The experimental tests were
   simulated with good agreement and used to obtain water peak negative
   pressures ranging from - 1.32 to - 5.64 MPa. Future tests will be
   undertaken to investigate cavitation properties of CSF.}},

Title = {{The application of graphene and its composites in oxygen reduction
   electrocatalysis: a perspective and review of recent progress}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The pressing necessity of a sustainable energy economy renders
   electrochemical energy conversion technologies, such as polymer
   electrolyte fuel cells or metal-air batteries, of paramount importance.
   The implementation of these technologies at scale still faces cost and
   operational durability challenges that stem from the conventionally used
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. While years of
   progress in ORR catalyst research has yielded some very attractive
   material designs, further advances are still required. Graphene entered
   the picture over 10 years ago, and scientists have only recently
   achieved a level of understanding regarding how its specific properties
   can be fine-tuned for electrocatalyst applications. This paper provides
   a critical review of the knowledge generated and progress realized over
   these past years for the development of graphene-based ORR catalysts.
   The first section discusses the application potential of graphene or
   modified graphene as platinum nanoparticle catalyst supports. The second
   section discusses the important role that graphene has played in the
   development of non-precious metal ORR catalysts, and more particularly
   its role in pyrolyzed transition metal-nitrogencarbon complexes or as a
   support for inorganic nanoparticles. Finally the development of
   heteroatom doped graphene species is discussed, as this has been
   demonstrated as an excellent method to fine-tune the physicochemical
   properties and induce catalytic activity. Throughout this paper, clear
   differentiation is made between acidic and alkaline ORR catalysts, and
   some common misconceptions or improper testing practices used throughout
   the literature are revealed. Synthesis strategies and how they pertain
   to the resulting structure and electrochemical performance of graphene
   are discussed. In light of the large body of work done in this area,
   specific strategies are suggested for perpetuating the advancement of
   graphene-based ORR electrocatalysts. With concerted efforts it is one
   day likely that graphene-based catalysts will be a staple of
   electrochemical energy systems.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are keystone components of natural disturbance regimes that
   maintain ecosystem structure and functions, such as the hydrological
   cycle, in many parts of the world. Consequently, critical surface
   freshwater resources can be exposed to post-fire effects disrupting
   their quantity, quality and regularity. Although well studied at the
   local scale, the potential extent of these effects has not been examined
   at the global scale. We take the first step toward a global assessment
   of the wildfire water risk (WWR) by presenting a spatially explicit
   index of exposure. Several variables related to fire activity and water
   availability were identified and normalized for use as exposure
   indicators. Additive aggregation of those indicators was then carried
   out according to their individual weight. The resulting index shows the
   greatest exposure risk in the tropical wet and dry forests. Intermediate
   exposure is indicated in mountain ranges and dry shrublands, whereas the
   lowest index scores are mostly associated with high latitudes. We
   believe that such an approach can provide important insights for water
   security by guiding global freshwater resource preservation.}},

Abstract = {{We study the transmission of a set of correlated sources (U1,...,UK)
   over a Gaussian multiple access relay channel with time asynchronism
   between the encoders. We assume that the maximum possible offset
   d(max)(n) between the transmitters grows without bound as the block
   length n ->infinity, while the relative ratio d(max)(n)/n of the maximum
   possible offset to the block length asymptotically vanishes. For such a
   joint source-channel coding problem and under specific gain conditions,
   we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for reliable
   communications and show that separate source and channel coding achieves
   optimal performance. In particular, we first derive a general outer
   bound on the source entropy content for all channel gains as our main
   result. Then, using Slepian-Wolf source coding combined with the channel
   coding scheme on top of block Markov coding, we show that the thus
   achieved inner bound matches the outer bound. As a corollary, we also
   address the problem of sending a pair of correlated sources over a
   two-user interference channel in the same context.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{669-676}},
Abstract = {{The Stiles-Crawford effect of the first kind is the retina's
   compensative response to loss of luminance efficiency for oblique
   stimulation manifested as the spot-size ratio departure from the perfect
   power coupling for a normal human eye. In a retinitis pigmentosa eye
   (RP), the normal cone photoreceptor morphology is affected due to foveal
   cone loss and disrupted cone mosaic spatial arrangement with reduction
   in directional sensitivity. We show that the flattened Stiles-Crawford
   function (SCF) in a RP eye is due to a different spot-size ratio
   departure profile, that is, for the same loss of luminance efficiency, a
   RP eye has a smaller departure from perfect power coupling compared to a
   normal eye. Again, the difference in spot-size ratio departure increases
   from the centre towards the periphery, having zero value for axial entry
   and maximum value for maximum peripheral entry indicating dispersal of
   photoreceptor alignment which prevents the retina to go for a bigger
   compensative response as it lacks both in number and appropriate cone
   morphology to tackle the loss of luminance efficiency for oblique
   stimulation. The slope of departure profile also testifies to the
   flattened SCF for a RP eye. Moreover, the discrepancy in spot-size ratio
   departure between a normal and a RP eye is shown to have a direct
   bearing on the Stiles-Crawford diminution of visibility.}},

Abstract = {{The slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on platinum
   catalyst is a critical parameter for application in polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we study the effects of sulfur on
   the electrochemical activity and stability of sulfur doped graphene
   supported platinum nanowires (PtNW/SGs). To investigate the influence of
   sulfur, a series of sulfur-doped graphene materials with varying sulfur
   contents ranging from 0.35 to 3.95 at\% are applied as platinum nanowire
   catalyst supports. Based on the physico-chemical characterizations,
   electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations, we find that the amount of sulfur significantly affects
   the electrokinetics of the Pt nanowires. The best ORR kinetics are
   observed for the platinum nanowires supported on graphene with 1.40 at\%
   sulfur, showing a mass activity of 182 mA/mg(Pt) and a specific activity
   of 662 mu A/cm(Pt)(2) at 0.9 V vs. RHE. At this sulfur content,
   well-defined platinum nanowires with diameters in the range of 4-16 nm
   are observed that are beneficial for enhancing ORR kinetics. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Despite the intensive studies of combining silicon (Si) and reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO), the architecture of Si-rGO composites still needs
   to be improved to maintain better electrode structure integrity and
   stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) upon extensive cycling.
   Herein, a conductive and protective network with rGO and CVD-implemented
   carbon is constructed with silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) embedded
   inside for the first time. Compared with the regular Si-rGO composite
   with only Si NPs wrapped by rGO, Si-rGO-C composite successfully
   improves the electrical conductivity and structure stability. In
   addition to the wrapping of rGO on Si NPs, the additional carbon layer
   on the partially exposed Si NPs provides extra protection from fracture
   during volume change and helps form a stable SEI layer. Carbon rods
   between rGO flakes function as conductive bridges, creating an effective
   conductive network on a macroscopic scale. The initial capacity of
   Si-rGO-C composite reaches 1139 mAh g(-1) and 894 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A
   g(-1) and IC respectively, and retains 94\% of its initial capacity
   after 300 cycles at 1C. The electrode is stabilized at 770 mAh g(-1) at

Abstract = {{Auto-correlated laser-induced incandescence (AC-LII) infers the soot
   volume fraction (SVF) of soot particles by comparing the spectral
   incandescence from laser-energized particles to the pyrometrically
   inferred peak soot temperature. This calculation requires detailed
   knowledge of model parameters such as the absorption function of soot,
   which may vary with combustion chemistry, soot age, and the internal
   structure of the soot. This work presents a Bayesian methodology to
   quantify such uncertainties. This technique treats the additional
   ``nuisance{''} model parameters, including the soot absorption function,
   as stochastic variables and incorporates the current state of knowledge
   of these parameters into the inference process through maximum entropy
   priors. While standard AC-LII analysis provides a point estimate of the
   SVF, Bayesian techniques infer the posterior probability density, which
   will allow scientists and engineers to better assess the reliability of
   AC-LII inferred SVFs in the context of environmental regulations and
   competing diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) development seems to be essential
   step on the path to widespread deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) as
   the zero-emission solution for the future of transportation. Because of
   their larger battery pack in comparison to conventional hybrid electic
   vehicles (HEVs), they offer longer electric range which leads to a
   superior fuel economy performance. Advanced energy management systems
   (EMSs) use vehicle trip information to enhance a PHEV's performance. In
   this study, the performance of two optimal control approaches, model
   predictive control (MPC) and adaptive equivalent consumption
   minimization strategy (A-ECMS), for designing an EMS for different
   levels of trip information are compared. The resulting EMSs are
   fine-tuned for the Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid powertrain and their
   performances are evaluated by using a high-fidelity simulation model in
   the Autonomie software. The results of simulation show that both MPC and
   A-ECMS can approximately improve fuel economy up to 10\% compared to the
   baseline Autonomie controller for EPA urban and highway drive cycles.
   Although both EMSs can be implemented in real time, A-ECMS is 15\%
   faster than MPC. Moreover, it is shown that the engine operating points
   are more sensitive to the battery depletion pattern than to different
   driving schedules.}},

   objective of improving the user quality of experience. We first propose
   a framework of Big Data-Driven (BDD) mobile network optimization. We
   then present the characteristics of big data that are collected not only
   from user equipment but also from mobile networks. Moreover, several
   techniques in data collection and analytics are discussed from the
   viewpoint of network optimization. Certain user cases on the application
   of the proposed framework for improving network performance are also
   given in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. With the
   integration of the emerging fifth generation (5G) mobile networks with
   big data analytics, the quality of our daily mobile life is expected to
   be tremendously enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric nanogenerators (NGs) based on vertically aligned InN
   nanowires (NWs) are fabricated, characterized, and evaluated. In these
   NGs, arrays of p-type and intrinsic InN NWs prepared by plasma-assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) demonstrate similar piezoelectric
   properties. The p-type NGs show 160\% more output current and 70\% more
   output power product than the intrinsic NGs. The features driving
   performance enhancement are reduced electrostatic losses due to better
   NW array morphology, improved electromechanical energy conversion
   efficiency due to smaller NW diameters, and the higher impedance of
   intrinsic NGs due to elevated NW surface charge levels. These findings
   highlight the potential of InN based NGs as a power source for
   self-powered systems and the importance of NW morphology and surface
   state in overall NG performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a case study comparing a multi-class transit
   assignment model with its single class counterpart for estimating the
   passenger flows of the Beijing subway network-one of the largest railway
   transit networks in the world. Multi-class traffic assignment has been
   widely considered as a theoretically sound approach to capture the
   inherent variation in users' route choice behavior. However, few
   empirical studies have been devoted to showing the effectiveness of this
   approach in improving the accuracy of the underlying passenger flow
   estimation process. In this research, a passenger classification scheme
   is proposed on the basis of a dataset from a large stated preference
   survey conducted in the City of Beijing, China. Separate generalized
   cost functions are calibrated for different classes of subway users in
   Beijing and applied in a multi-class transit assignment model for
   estimating passenger flows over a subway network. The case study has
   shown that the proposed multi-class approach resulted in significantly
   improved estimation results with an average estimation error of less
   than 15\% on the transfer flows as compared with 30\% for the single
   class model. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is a promising technology to
   support high-rate (e.g., multi-Gbps) multimedia applications because of
   its large available bandwidth. Multipacket reception is one of the
   important capabilities of mmWave networks to capture a few packets
   simultaneously. This capability has the potential to improve medium
   access control layer performance. Because of the severe propagation loss
   in mmWave band, traditional backoff mechanisms in carrier sensing
   multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) designed for narrowband
   systems can result not only in unfairness but also in significant
   throughput reduction. This paper proposes a novel backoff mechanism in
   CSMA/CA by giving a higher transmission probability to the node with a
   transmission failure than that with a transmission success, aiming to
   improve the system throughput. The transmission probability is adjusted
   by changing the contention window size according to the congestion
   status of each node and the whole network. The analysis demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed backoff mechanism on reducing transmission
   collisions and increasing network throughput. Extensive simulations show
   that the proposed backoff mechanism can efficiently utilize network
   resources and significantly improve the network performance on system
   throughput and fairness. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Femtocells enable LTE technology when deployed in large numbers.
   However, every femtocell needs to self-optimize its control parameters
   in response to surrounding dynamic events. This paper focuses on
   self-optimization use cases related to handovers in LTE femtocell
   networks including: handover self-optimization, call admission control
   self-optimization and load balancing self-optimization. These three use
   cases can interact either constructively or destructively. To the best
   of our knowledge, no previous work has addressed the nature of this
   interaction. Therefore, we survey proposed schemes for each one of these
   handover-related self-optimization use cases after which three
   representative schemes have been identified. These schemes are used in
   our interaction study using our in-house MATLAB-written and LIE
   compliant simulation environment. Based on interaction simulation
   results, we recommend a set of guidelines to follow when coordinating
   between these interacting handover-related self-optimization use cases
   in LIE femtocell networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of methods to predict full-scale fire behaviour using
   small-scale test data is of great interest to the fire community. This
   study evaluated the ability of one model, originally developed during
   the European Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF)
   project, to predict heat release rates. Polyurethane foam specimens were
   tested in the furniture calorimeter using both centre and edge ignition
   locations. Input data were obtained using cone calorimeter tests and
   infrared video-based flame area measurements. Two particular issues were
   investigated: how variations in incident heat flux in cone calorimeter
   tests impact heat release rate predictions, and the ability of the model
   to predict results for different foam thicknesses. Heat release rate
   predictions showed good agreement with experimental results,
   particularly during the growth phase of the fire. The model was more
   successful in predicting results for edge ignition tests than for centre
   ignition tests and in predicting results for thinner foams. Results
   indicated that because of sensitivity of the burning behaviour to foam
   specimen geometry and ignition location, a single incident heat flux
   could not be specified for generating input for the CBUF model.
   Potential methods to determine appropriate cone calorimeter input for
   various geometries and ignition locations are discussed. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Graphene nanosheets with heterogeneously doped nitrogen atoms are
   synthesized using a facile one-step method based on extremely rapid
   heating (temperature ramps >= 150 degrees C s(-1)). Raman and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy reveal efficacious nitrogen incorporation
   into the graphitic network. A half-cell testing conducted in alkaline
   media with a rotating disk electrode technique shows that the N-doped
   graphene nanosheets present a very comparable oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) activity to the state-of-the-art commercial 20 wt\% Pt/C catalyst.
   The outstanding catalytic activity of metal-free carbon-based graphene
   nanosheets is ascribed to the opened structure produced by the facile
   one-step synthesis procedure resulting in significantly enhanced active
   site exposure. Density functional theory is used to elucidate the
   electrochemical properties of these nanosheets on the basis of bandgap,
   vertical ionization energies, and adsorption free energies of
   intermediate species (cOOH, O-3, (OH)-O-center dot, and H-center dot)
   formed during the ORR associative mechanism occurring in alkaline media.
   A systematic analysis is conducted by comparing pristine graphene and
   N-doped graphene nanosheets of multiple sizes containing single and all
   together pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic species to determine the
   adequate size of the cluster and the most catalytically active N site to
   perform the ORR. From all possible adsorption sites for the
   intermediates including nitrogen on a larger cluster model with 37 rings
   doped with all types of nitrogen bonding, the adsorption on top of any
   carbon adjacent to a central graphitic nitrogen represents a significant
   reduction in the energy barrier of the ORR electrocatalysis. Theoretical
   calculations of the bond strengths of all possible species show that the

Title = {{Applying the Water Footprint and dynamic Structural Decomposition
   Analysis on the growing water use in China lduring 1997-2007}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},

Abstract = {{China has experienced rapid economic development during the recent
   years. In the meantime, the total water use in China has greatly
   increased, causing considerably severe water shortage. To quantify how
   the social-economic development drives the change of water use is of
   great importance for Chinese government. This study aims to
   quantitatively investigate the determinants of the growing water use in
   China during 1997-2007. China's water usages in 1997-2007 are indicated
   by the Internal Water Footprint (IWF), External Water Footprint (EWF),
   and Exported Virtual Water (ExVW) using an input-output based WF
   analysis. A dynamic Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) model is
   employed to decompose the changes in the total WFs (TWF) into five
   social-economic determinants. The dynamic SDA model, which uses a
   nonlinear path function to simulate the real paths followed by
   determinants, is a further development of a path-based SDA algorithm. To
   validate the dynamic SDA, a comparison study is carried out against the
   commonly used mean decomposition model. The results from the WF analysis
   show that, during 1997-2007, the increase of China's water use is
   dominated by the ExVW, which increases significantly due to the
   expansion of exports. While the changes in the IWF and EWF tend to help
   mitigating the water pressure. The dynamic decomposition results
   indicate that the consumption level is the dominant factor of China's
   water use growth, and the changes in water-saving technology and final
   demand pattern contribute largely to offsetting the water use growth.
   The model comparison shows that the dynamic SDA model is more advanced
   in obtaining reliable results and addressing the static issue of
   traditional SDA models. This study provides a robust framework for
   understanding the water use situation from the social-economic
   perspectives, which benefits sustainable water management. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The communication delay of train control services has a great impact on
   the track utilization and speed profile of high-speed trains. This paper
   undertakes stochastic delay analysis of train control services over a
   high-speed railway fading channel using stochastic network calculus. The
   mobility model of high-speed railway communications system is formulated
   as a semi-Markov process. Accordingly, the instantaneous data rate of
   the wireless channel is characterized by a semi-Markov modulated
   process, which takes into account the channel variations due to both
   large-and small-scale fading effects. The stochastic service curve of
   high-speed railway communications system is derived based on the
   semi-Markov modulated process. Based on the analytical approach of
   stochastic network calculus, the stochastic upper delay bounds of train
   control services are derived with both the moment generating function
   method and the complementary cumulative distribution function method.
   The analytical results of the two methods are compared and validated by
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are promising options for
   future transportation. Having two sources of energy enables them to
   offer better fuel economy and fewer emissions. Significant research has
   been done to take advantage of future route information to enhance
   vehicle performance. In this paper, an ecological adaptive cruise
   controller (Eco-ACC) is used to improve both fuel economy and safety of
   the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid. Recently, an emerging trend in the
   research has been to improve the adaptive cruise controller. However,
   the majority of research to date has focused on driving safety, and only
   rare reports in the literature substantiate the applicability of such
   systems for PHEVs. Here, we demonstrate that using an Eco-ACC system can
   simultaneously improve total energy costs and vehicle safety. The
   developed controller is equipped with an onboard sensor that captures
   upcoming trip data to optimally adjust the speed of PHEVs. The nonlinear
   model predictive control technique (NMPC) is used to optimally control
   vehicle speed. To prepare the NMPC controller for real-time
   applications, a fast and efficient control-oriented model is developed.
   The authenticity of the model is validated using a high-fidelity
   Autonomie-based model. To evaluate the designed controller, the global
   optimum solution for cruise control problem is found using Pontryagin's
   minimum principle (PMP). To explore the efficacy of the controller, PID
   and linear MPC controllers are also applied to the same problem.
   Simulations are conducted for different driving scenarios such as
   driving over a hill and car following. These simulations demonstrate
   that NMPC improves the total energy cost up to 19\%.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of smart grid permits different system participants
   (e.g., distributed generations and loads) to interact in a rational and
   independent behavior to improve the distribution system (DS)
   performance. Each participant is recognized as a selfish decision maker
   that selects actions that improve its own payoff leading to conflicts
   with others. Therefore, further investigations are required to improve
   the decision making process outcomes. In this paper, a decentralized
   cooperative algorithm is developed to manage the multiparticipants DS
   operation. The proposed algorithm has been developed based on a
   correlated equilibrium game-theoretic approach. The outcomes of the
   proposed algorithm were compared with the traditional existing ``best
   response{''} (BR) game-theoretic approach, which was utilized in similar
   multiparticipants DSs that converge to Nash equilibrium. The proposed
   algorithm is tested with two different case studies that were selected
   by the DS operator. The proposed algorithm was verified using a modified
   IEEE 123-bus test feeder. The test results showed a superior system
   performance compared with traditional BR techniques.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Intensive research is being directed at microgrids because of their
   numerous benefits, such as their ability to enhance the reliability of a
   power system and reduce its environmental impact. Past research has
   focused on microgrids that have predefined boundaries. However, a
   recently suggested methodology enables the determination of fictitious
   boundaries that divide existing bulky grids into smaller microgrids,
   thereby facilitating the use of a smart grid paradigm in large-scale
   systems. These boundaries are fixed and do not change with the power
   system operating conditions. In this paper, we propose a new microgrid
   concept that incorporates flexible fictitious boundaries: ``dynamic
   microgrids.{''} The proposed method is based on the allocation and
   coordination of agents in order to achieve boundary mobility. The
   stochastic behavior of loads and renewable-based generators are
   considered, and a novel model that represents wind, solar, and load
   power based on historical data has been developed. The PG\&E 69-bus
   system has been used for testing and validating the proposed concept.
   Compared with the fixed boundary microgrids, our results show the
   superior effectiveness of the dynamic microgrid concept for addressing
   the self-adequacy of microgrids in the presence of stochastically
   varying loads and generation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel long-term renewable energy (RE) planning

   determine economic and technically feasible RE solutions, considering
   the current operating structures, electricity pricing systems, subsidy
   frameworks, and project funding alternatives under which RE can be
   deployed in RCs. The proposed model is implemented in a case study for
   the Kasabonika Lake First Nation community in northern Ontario. The case

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the theoretical development of dynamic
   equations for undamped gyroelastic beams which are dynamic systems with
   continuous inertia, elasticity, and gyricity. Assuming unrestricted or
   large attitude changes for the axes of the gyros and utilizing
   generalized Hooke's law, Duleau torsion theory, and Timoshenko bending
   theory, the energy expressions and equations of motion for the
   gyroelastic beams in three-dimensional space are derived. The
   so-obtained comprehensive gyroelastic beam model is compared against
   earlier gyroelastic beam models developed using Euler-Bernoulli beam
   models and is used to study the dynamics of gyroelastic beams through
   numerical examples. It is shown that there are significant differences
   between the developed unrestricted Timoshenko gyroelastic beam model and
   the previously derived zero-order restricted Euler-Bernoulli gyroelastic
   beam models. These differences are more pronounced in the short beam and
   transverse gyricity cases. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Skeleton-based discrepancy feedback for automated realignment of
   industrial assemblies}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{147-161}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Automated and timely detection, characterization, and quantification of
   fabrication discrepancies and errors are fundamental problems in
   construction engineering. Despite the fact that the precision of
   manufacturing machines is continually improving, there are inevitable
   discrepancies between the designed and built assemblies because of
   construction realities. Such non-compliant assemblies should be detected
   early, and the required corrective actions should be planned
   accordingly. This paper presents an algorithm for automated
   quantification of discrepancies for components of assemblies. Rather
   than using dense point clouds, the geometric skeleton (wireframe) of
   assemblies is extracted for further manipulation, once the as-built
   status is captured using the appropriate method. The extracted
   skeletons, which abstractly represent the designed and built states, are
   registered using a constrained iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm.
   In order to identify the points making up each straight segment, the
   skeletons are clustered, and a straight line is fit to each resulting
   cluster. The corresponding segments in both states are then compared and
   investigated for quantifying the incurred discrepancy in the form of a
   rigid transformation. Experimental results show that the accuracy and
   speed of the new framework are superior to a previously developed method
   (3D sliding cube). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Statistical Analysis of the Effectiveness of Management Programs in
   Improving Construction Labor Productivity on Large Industrial Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this research effort is to identify the effectiveness of
   a particular set of important management programs in improving
   construction labor productivity. These programs were previously defined
   through industry experts and research consensus as having significant
   impact on project cost, schedule, safety, scope, and quality
   performance, but their relationship to labor productivity was not known.
   Through statistical analyses of the database maintained by the
   Construction Industry Institute's Benchmarking and Metrics Committee,
   headquartered in Austin, Texas, United States, the research presented in
   this article examined whether projects with high levels of
   implementation of programs related to front-end planning, materials
   management, automation and integration of information systems, team
   building, constructability, and safety, experienced better labor
   productivity among the mechanical, electrical, concrete, and structural
   steel trades compared to projects with low levels of implementation. The
   result showed that the majority of the investigated management programs
   were statistically significantly correlated to better construction labor
   productivity, and the significance was different among various craft
   trades. The paper's major contribution to the overall body of knowledge
   is that it comprehensively quantifies the potential relationship of
   implementing project management programs to labor productivity on large
   industrial projects. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{295-301}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of splashing accompanying the impact of molten 800 nm
   diameter gold droplets on silicon, gold coated silicon, gold coated
   glass and polished solid gold surfaces has been studied. A novel method
   based on laser induced forward transfer has been developed to generate
   single submicron molten gold droplets. Splashing morphology has been
   characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Focused Ion
   Beam (FIB) techniques. It is found that the splashing of submicron gold
   droplets upon impact is enhanced by high droplet impact energy achieved
   by reducing the droplet flight distance and that an air layer resulting
   in a bubble becomes trapped under the impacting droplets even when the
   size of the droplet is less than one micron. Our results show that,
   under these conditions, heat transfer between the submicron droplet and
   the solid substrate is more important than surface roughness and surface
   tension in the evolution of splashing. A theoretical model has been
   developed to simulate the splashing characteristics of submicron gold
   droplets during impact. Both the experimental data and the analytical
   model show that splashing is enhanced by high heat transfer rates to the
   surface.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic and hydro-climatic drivers on
   estrogen legacies and trajectories}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{19-28}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Intensification of concentrated animal feeding operations combined with
   the use of tile drains in agricultural fields has resulted in
   land-applied manure being a significant source of hormones to the
   environment. Currently, no model exists to simulate hormone fluxes from
   tile drains under field conditions. Therefore, we developed the Hormone
   Export and Recovery Dynamics (HERD) model, which incorporates
   hydro-climatic, biogeochemical, and anthropogenic drivers that affect
   hormone fate and transport. We validated HERD using known input
   (rainfall; lagoon effluent irrigation) and response data (tile drain
   flow; 17,8-estradiol and estrone fluxes) from the 2009 growing season,
   13 years after land-application activities began at a tile-drained field
   in Indiana. We used HERD to better understand the (1) decision-making
   process underlying effluent irrigation activities; (2) contribution of
   macropore flow to estrogen transport; (3) potential for long-term
   applications to result in the development of legacy estrogen sources
   within the soil profile; and (4) potential recovery trajectory of
   estrogen transport following the cessation of animal waste applications.
   HERD adequately predicted irrigation events based on lagoon storage
   limits. Simple threshold exceedance logic for macropore flow activation
   accounted for similar to 87\% of the observed estrogen loads.
   Application history was found to be important, as not accounting for 18
   years of application led to a severe underestimation of the observed
   estrogen loads; however, accounting for application history led to a
   much closer match between modeled and observed fluxes. Simulated
   trajectories after cessation of applications indicated that estrogens
   may continue to leach for several decades, which has important
   implications for mitigating horrnone concentrations in receiving water
   bodies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Results from a Full-Scale Study on the Condition Assessment of Pendulum
   Tuned Mass Dampers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pendulum tuned mass dampers (PTMDs) are one of the most popular
   vibration control devices in use today for flexible towers, bridges, and
   buildings. Their most attractive feature is the design simplicity; the
   natural period can be controlled simply by adjusting the suspended
   length and viscous dampers can be easily integrated into the design.
   While this simplicity has resulted in their widespread adoption, the
   installed performance of PTMDs has not been investigated in much detail.
   This paper presents a methodology for conducting condition assessment of
   in-service PTMDs. Results from a full-scale study of a PTMD-equipped
   structure is used as a test bed to demonstrate the approach. The
   condition of an in-service PTMD is assessed using two criteria: the
   frequency and damping tuning ratios, and equivalent damping provided by
   the PTMD. These criteria are estimated while the PTMD is in service,
   without arresting the PTMD motion, using an extended Kalman filter.
   Practical considerations typical in full-scale structures arising from
   model reduction, measurements at limited degrees of freedom, and limited
   modes of interest are addressed in this assessment framework. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are important for applications
   related to both microgrids and electric vehicles. If BESS are used as
   the main energy source, then it is required to include adequate
   procedures for the estimation of critical variables such as the State of
   Charge (SoC) and the State of Health (SoH) in the design of Battery
   Management Systems (BMS). Furthermore, in applications where batteries
   are exposed to high charge and discharge rates it is also desirable to
   estimate the State of Maximum Power Available (SoMPA). In this regard,
   this paper presents a novel approach to the estimation of SoMPA in
   Lithium-Ion batteries. This method formulates an optimisation problem
   for the battery power based on a non-linear dynamic model, where the
   resulting solutions are functions of the SoC. In the battery model, the
   polarisation resistance is modelled using fuzzy rules that are function
   of both SoC and the discharge (charge) current. Particle filtering
   algorithms are used as an online estimation technique, mainly because
   these algorithms allow approximating the probability density functions
   of the SoC and SoMPA even in the case of non-Gaussian sources of
   uncertainty. The proposed method for SoMPA estimation is validated using
   the experimental data obtained from an experimental setup designed for
   charging and discharging the Lithium-Ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current work combines electron backscattered diffraction and
   Schmid's law numerical analysis to study the micro-mechanisms
   responsible for transgranular fracture in magnesium AZ61 subjected to a
   triaxial stress field operating at the vicinity of a notch. It is argued
   that the susceptibility of an individual grain to transgranular cracking
   depends strongly on its orientation relative to the stress condition.
   Grains in which the stress field creates high shear stresses on their
   \{1 0 (1) over bar 1\} twinning systems are more susceptible to
   transgranular fracture. The primary \{1 0 (1) over bar 1\} twinning mode
   was determined to follow a Schmid-type behavior in most of the studied
   grains. An inspection of the misorientation boundaries between the
   parent and twinned segments reveals the role of \{1 0 (1) over bar
   1\}-\{1 0 (1) over bar 2\} double twinning, which essentially involves
   the rotation of 1 (2) over bar 1 0/37.5 degrees relative to the parent,
   on the formation of transgranular micro-cracks. This twinning mode
   intensifies the shear stresses resolved on the basal slip systems,
   leading to early shear localization and transgranular void/crack
   initiation. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Image segmentation via multi-scale stochastic regional texture
   appearance models}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{23-36}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An ongoing challenge in the area of image segmentation is in dealing
   with scenes exhibiting complex textural characteristics. While many
   approaches have been proposed to tackle this particular challenge, a
   related topic of interest that has not been fully explored for dealing
   with this challenge is stochastic texture models, particularly for
   characterizing textural characteristics within regions of varying sizes
   and shapes. Therefore, this paper presents a novel method for image
   segmentation based on the concept of multi-scale stochastic regional
   texture appearance models. In the proposed method, a multi-scale
   representation of the image is constructed using an iterative bilateral
   scale space decomposition. Local texture features are then extracted via
   image patches and random projections to generate stochastic texture
   features. A texton dictionary is built from the stochastic features, and
   used to represent the global texture appearance model. Based on this
   global texture appearance model, a regional texture appearance model can
   then be obtained based on the texton occurrence probability given a
   region within an image. Finally, a stochastic region merging algorithm
   that allows the computation of complex features is presented to perform
   image segmentation based on proposed regional texture appearance model.
   Experimental results using the BDSD300 segmentation dataset showed that
   the proposed method achieves a Probabilistic Rand Index (PRI) of 0.83
   and an F-measure of 0.77@(0.92, 0.68), and provides improved handling of
   color and luminance variation, as well as strong segmentation
   performance for images with highly textured regions when compared to a
   number of previous methods. These results suggest that the proposed
   stochastic regional texture appearance model is better suited for
   handling the texture variations of natural scenes, leading to more
   accurate segmentations, particularly in situations characterized by
   complex textural characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Innovative computational modeling of multiaxial fatigue analysis for
   notched components}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{134-145}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most of the notched components for ground vehicles experience complex
   multiaxial loadings, where principal stresses rotate and change
   non-proportionally their magnitudes during a loading cycle. Furthermore,
   many vehicle components contain notches and geometrical irregularities
   because of design requirements. These geometric discontinuities cause
   significant stress concentrations. Multiaxial loads result in complex
   stress and strain responses at notch areas and can induce a fatigue
   failure even without any warning of noticeable plastic deformation.
   Unfortunately, the combination of multiaxial loading paths and complex
   geometries of mechanical components is unavoidable in practice and
   experiments performing durability test for ground vehicles are often not
   feasible because of time and cost considerations.
   Therefore, an innovative computational fatigue analysis methodology has
   been proposed here for multiaxial fatigue life analysis of notched
   components under design process using analytical and numerical methods.
   The proposed multiaxial fatigue analysis methodology consists of an
   elastic-plastic stress-strain model and a multiaxial fatigue damage
   parameter. Computed results of the proposed methodology are compared to
   sets of experimental published data to verify the prediction capability
   of the elastic-plastic stress-strain model and the fatigue damage
   parameter. A comparison of analysis results and experimental data shows
   that the multiaxial elastic-plastic stress-strain model correlates well
   with experimental strain data for SAE 1070 steel notched bars subjected
   to complex non-proportional load paths. The proposed fatigue damage
   parameter correlates well with fatigue data of 1045 steel and Inconel
   718 tubular specimens under proportional and non-proportional loadings.
   Finally the complete analysis methodology incorporating both the
   elastic-plastic stress-strain model and the multiaxial fatigue damage
   parameter is found to be in a good agreement with experimental data of
   SAE 1045 steel notched shafts subjected to proportional and
   non-proportional loadings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   measuring extensional and shear deformation in rock}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{54-66}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Distributed Brillouin sensing systems (DBSs) have growing applications
   in engineering and are attracting attention in the field of underground
   structures, including mining. The capability for continuous measurements
   of strain over large distances makes DBSs a promising monitoring
   approach for understanding deformation field evolution within a rock
   mass, particularly when the sensor is installed away from excavation
   damaged zone (EDZ). A purpose-built fiber optic sensing cable, a vital
   component of DBSs, was assessed in laboratory conditions.
   A test program was performed to observe DBSs response to various
   perturbations including strain and joint movements, including opening
   and shearing of joints. These tests included assessment of the
   strain-free cable response and the application of extensional and
   lateral displacement to various sensing cable lengths (strained
   lengths), from 1 m down to 1 cm. Furthermore, tests were done to
   evaluate the time-dependent behavior of the cable and to observe the
   effect of strain transfer using a soft host material (e.g. a soft grout)
   under lateral displacement.
   The noise level of the DBSs range was +/- 77 mu epsilon, determined
   through repeated measurements on an unstrained cable. Stretching test
   results showed a clear linear correlation between applied strain and
   Brillouin frequency shift change for all strained lengths above half the
   spatial resolution of the DBSs. However, for strained lengths shorter
   than half the spatial resolution, no strain response was measurable and
   this is due to the applied internal signal processing of the DBSs to
   detect peak Brillouin gain spectrum and noise level. The stability with
   time of the measurements was excellent for test periods up to 15 h.
   Lateral displacement test results showed a less consistent response
   compared to tension tests for a given applied displacement. Although the
   Brillouin frequency shift change is correlated linearly with the applied
   displacement in tension, it shows a parabolic variation with lateral
   displacement. Moreover, the registered frequency response (correlated
   with strain) of the system decreased significantly when the sensing
   cable was embedded in a sand-filled tube compared with direct cable
   displacement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   cracks. The results indicate that the duplex grades of stainless steel
   perform slightly better than do the austenitic grades. All the six

   with a heterogeneous surface of silica and PDMS was prepared by
   spreading a premixed PDMS solution on the 3D structured SCCs and curing
   the solution in-situ. Although the SCCs had a light blue color, the
   obtained composite of SCC and PDMS, due to the close effective
   refractive indexes of the materials, was colorless and transparent; the
   UV-vis spectra indicated a negligible effect of the added SCC on the
   transmittance of the PDMS sheet (1\% reduction). Interestingly, the
   transparent composite sheet became translucent under stress and became
   clear again when relaxed. It was found that the wrinkles formed on the
   surface under stress were responsible for the optical change; and, the
   formation of the wrinkles was ascribed to the rigid nature of the SCC
   layer embedded in PDMS. We had applied this SCC/PDMS composite as a
   substrate to support a thin gold film of nanoscale thickness and found
   that the embedded SCC layer worked well as a transitional interface for
   bonding materials of mismatched mechanical properties. The incorporation
   of SCC layer significantly suppressed the crack generation and
   propagation of the gold film. The results demonstrated a potential
   approach for fabricating compliant and crackfree metallic films on
   polymeric substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effect of deposition temperature on the growth of
   nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) films deposited by 13.56 MHz plasma
   enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with in-situ hydrogen (H)
   passivation. A high crystalline volume fraction (X-C) of 80\% was found
   in the similar to 100 nm nc-Si film deposited at 260 degrees C with 99\%
   H-2 diluted SiH4 at intermediate RF power between the power-limited and
   precursor-limited regimes. Based on these optimized deposition
   conditions, 300-400 nm nc-Si films deposited at 75-260 degrees C also
   showed a high X-C of 82-85\%, an intrinsic-like dark-conductivity
   (sigma(dark)) of similar to 10(-6) S/cm, and even a low mean oxygen
   content (C-O) of 10(17)-10(18) at./cm(3). Although material properties
   were similar, deposition temperature appeared to change the qualitative
   structure of the nanocrystalline grains. The preferred grain orientation
   changed from < 111 > to < 220 > as the deposition temperature was
   increased from 75 to 260 degrees C due to enhanced surface diffusion of
   deposition precursors. This reflected in more compact and lateral
   columnar growth of nc-Si films with increasing deposition temperature.
   We successfully demonstrated high field-effect hole and electron
   mobilities of 33.8 and 225 cm(2)/Vs, respectively, in top-gate thin-film
   transistors (TFTs) employing the similar to 100 nm nc-Si channel layer
   deposited at 260 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen reduction reaction, ORR, performances of graphene-supported
   palladium (Pd) and palladium alloys (Pd3X: X = Ag, Co and Fe) catalysts
   with highly dispersed catalyst particles are investigated in acidic and

   nanosheet, GNS, supported Pd based catalysts are fabricated without
   surfactant through the impregnation of Pd and 2nd metal precursors on
   GNS, leading to small and uniformly dispersed nanoparticles, even when
   high metal loading of up to 60 wt.\% are deposited on supports. The
   ab-initio density functional theory, DFT, calculations, which are based
   on the d-band center theory, have been applied to correlate with the
   results of the OR performances obtained by half-cell tests.
   Additionally, the cohesive energy, E-coh, and dissolution potential,
   U-m, for the Pd nanoparticles have been calculated to understand
   thermodynamic stability. To elucidate the d-band center shift, the Pd
   3d(5/2) core-level binding energies for Pd/GNS, Pd3Ag/GNS, Pd3Fe/GNS and
   Pd3Co/GNS have been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,

   good ORR activity under acidic and alkaline conditions, suggesting it

Abstract = {{The polished commercial zinc foil as the current collector and thiourea
   (TU) as the electrolyte additive are studied systematically to improve
   the performance of LiMn2O4/Zn aqueous battery. The results show that the
   coulombic efficiency and the cycling performance are significantly
   improved by using the polished zinc foil as the anode current collector.
   Moreover, the TU addition increases the cycling performance of
   LiMn2O4/Zn battery and decreases the float charge current density of the
   battery at room as well as high temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests confirm that there is nearly no
   effect of TU in the electrolyte on the crystal structure of LiMn2O4
   electrode. However, the addition of TU has an indirect effect on the
   morphology. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and deposition dissolution
   measurement demonstrate that TU is stable on the cathode electrode and
   it is able to adsorb to the surface of the zinc anode current collector.
   As such, the deposition dissolution efficiency and energy efficiency are
   improved, which also can be attributed to faster deposition dissolution
   and smaller self-discharge process of zinc. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Field-theoretic simulation (FTS) offers an efficient means of predicting
   the equilibrium behavior of high-molecular-weight structured polymers,

   version (MC-FTS), where the composition field fluctuates while the
   pressure field follows the mean-field approximation. We are able to
   control the UV divergence by introducing a new effective Flory-Huggins
   interaction parameter, chi(e), thereby permitting MC-FTS for molecular
   weights extending down to values characteristic of experiment. Results
   for the disordered-state structure function, the layer spacing and
   compressibility of the ordered lamellar phase, and the position of the
   order disorder transition (ODT) show excellent agreement with recent

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal (PDLC) composites long have been a
   focus of study for their unique electro-optical properties which have
   resulted in various applications such as switchable (transparent or
   translucent) windows. These composites are manufactured using desirable
   ``bottom-up{''} techniques, such as phase separation of a
   liquid-crystal-polymer mixture, which enable production of PDLC films at
   very large scales. LC domains within PDLCs are typically spheroidal, as
   opposed to rectangular for an LCD panel, and thus exhibit substantially
   different behavior in the presence of an external field. The fundamental
   difference between spheroidal and rectangular nematic domains is that
   the former results in the presence of nanoscale orientational defects in
   LC order while the latter does not. Progress in the development and
   optimization of PDLC electro-optical properties has progressed at a
   relatively slow pace due to this increased complexity. In this work,
   continuum simulations are performed in order to capture the complex
   formation and electric field-driven switching dynamics of approximations
   of PDLC domains. Using a simplified elliptic cylinder (microcapillary)
   geometry as an approximation of spheroidal PDLC domains, the effects of
   geometry (aspect ratio), surface anchoring, and external field strength
   are studied through the use of the Landau-de Gennes model of the nematic
   LC phase.}},

Abstract = {{Energy hubs that incorporate a variety of energy generation and energy
   transformation technologies can be used to provide the energy storage
   needed to enable the efficient operation of a `smart energy network'.
   When these hubs are combined as a network and allowed to exchange
   energy, they create efficiency advantages in both financial and
   environmental performance. Further, the interconnectedness of the energy
   network design provides an added layer of reliability. In this paper, a
   complex network of energy hubs is modeled and optimized under different
   scenarios to examine both the financial viability and potential
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Two case studies consisting of
   two and three energy hubs within a network are considered. The modeling
   Scenarios vary according to the consideration of distributed energy
   systems and energy interaction between energy hubs. In the case of a
   network of two energy hubs, there is no significant economic or
   emissions benefit with only a 0.5\% reduction in total cost and 3\%
   reduction in CO2 emission. In the case of a network of three energy
   hubs, there is a significant economic benefit ranging from 11\% to 29\%,
   and 11\% emission reduction benefit, as well as a 13\% reduction in
   natural gas consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Synthesis and characterization of bio-polyols through the oxypropylation
   of bark and alkaline extracts of bark}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Bark and alkaline extracts of bark were oxypropylated to produce
   bio-polyols. It was found that bark had a much higher yield (79\%) than
   the alkaline extracts (32\%). Solvent extraction and thermo-gravimetric
   analysis showed that the homopolymer helped reduce viscosity and that
   the co-polymer showed evidence of grafting. As a result, the bark
   derived bio-polyols had a very low viscosity, especially compared to
   reported values for other types of biomass that produced prohibitively
   highly viscous liquids. GPC analysis showed that high molecular weight
   compounds from bark were made highly soluble by the grafting of PO
   chains. This resulted in a molecular weight average of 6800 Da for the
   oxypropylated bark, and 7100 Da for the alkaline extract of bark. The
   hydroxyl value and high concentration of secondary alcohols in the
   bio-polyols was consistent with typical commercial polyols used for
   rigid foam formulations. Finally, when foamed, the oxypropylated
   bark-based foam showed superior compressive behavior to previous work
   done on liquefied bark-based PUFs and a control foam. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{9105-9116}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{An enhanced grey clustering analysis method based on accumulation
   sequences using grey relational analysis (AGRA) is put forward for
   specifying hierarchies of clusters in panel data. The clustering method
   can handle panel data containing N samples, each of which has m time
   series of indicators for which the observations for a given time series
   can be measured at different times than other series and contain
   different numbers of data points compared to other series. The overall
   clustering approach, which is called the Mean-AGRA clustering method,
   contains three main parts: a sequence of transformations of each
   separate time series: appropriate pairwise comparisons of the grey
   relational degree of an AGRA model for each pair of samples, across all
   samples as well as appropriate combinations thereafter, for three
   specific types of grey relational degrees; clustering all samples
   according to their AGRA degrees. To demonstrate how this new clustering
   method can be utilized in practice, it is applied to panel data
   consisting of 12 natural environmental indicators and 8 societal time
   series (m = 20) for 30 provinces (N = 30) in mainland China. The
   findings clarify how, for example, the provinces in China can be
   meaningfully categorized according to topography into two main groups
   consisting of plateaus and plains. The new method can handle different
   lengths of time series within a sample and across samples, which is
   useful when values occur at different times when comparing any two
   series. Moreover, the new clustering method avoids the problem of
   combining two samples having a limited degree of similarity, which
   exists in the traditional method. Consequently, the AGRA model and
   Mean-AGRA clustering method have expanded the scope of application of
   grey relational and clustering analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ablation of silver (Ag) nanoparticles in the direction of laser
   polarization is achieved by utilizing femtosecond laser irradiation in
   air at laser fluence ranging from similar to 2 mJ/cm(2) to similar to 14

   plasmon induced localized electric field enhancement. Scanning electron
   microscopy observations of the irradiated particles in different gases
   and at different pressures indicate that the ablation is further
   enhanced by oxygen in the air. This may be due to the external heating
   via the reactions of its dissociation product, atomic oxygen, with the
   surface of Ag particles, while the ablated Ag is not oxidized. Further
   experimental observations show that the ablated material re-deposits
   near the irradiated particles and results in the extension of the
   particles in laser polarization direction, facilitating the

   Multilayered Conditional Random Field Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{3-D ultrasound imaging offers unique opportunities in the field of non
   destructive testing that cannot be easily found in A-mode and B-mode
   images. To acquire a 3-D ultrasound image without a mechanically moving
   transducer, a 2-D array can be used. The row column technique is
   preferred over a fully addressed 2-D array as it requires a
   significantly lower number of interconnections. Recent advances in 3-D
   row-column ultrasound imaging systems were largely focused on sensor
   design. However, these imaging systems face three intrinsic challenges
   that cannot be addressed by improving sensor design alone: speckle
   noise, sparsity of data in the imaged volume, and the spatially
   dependent point spread function of the imaging system. In this paper, we
   propose a compensated row-column ultrasound image reconstruction system
   using Fisher-Tippett multilayered conditional random field model. Tests
   carried out on both simulated and real row-column ultrasound images show
   the effectiveness of our proposed system as opposed to other published
   systems. Visual assessment of the results show our proposed system's
   potential at preserving detail and reducing speckle. Quantitative
   analysis shows that our proposed system outperforms previously published
   systems when evaluated with metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio,
   Coefficient of Correlation, and Effective Number of Looks. These results
   show the potential of our proposed system as an effective tool for
   enhancing 3-D row-column imaging.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Deposition of colloidal-and nano-scale particles on surfaces is critical
   to numerous natural and engineered environmental, health, and industrial
   applications ranging from drinking water treatment to semi-conductor
   manufacturing. Nano-scale surface roughness-induced hydrodynamic impacts
   on particle deposition were evaluated in the absence of an energy
   barrier to deposition in a parallel plate system. A non-linear,
   non-monotonic relationship between deposition surface roughness and
   particle deposition flux was observed and a critical roughness size
   associated with minimum deposition flux or ``sag effect{''} was
   identified. This effect was more significant for nanoparticles (<1 mu m)
   than for colloids and was numerically simulated using a
   Convective-Diffusion model and experimentally validated. Inclusion of
   flow field and hydrodynamic retardation effects explained particle
   deposition profiles better than when only the
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) force was considered. This work
   provides 1) a first comprehensive framework for describing the
   hydrodynamic impacts of nano-scale surface roughness on particle
   deposition by unifying hydrodynamic forces (using the most current
   approaches for describing flow field profiles and hydrodynamic
   retardation effects) with appropriately modified expressions for DLVO
   interaction energies, and gravity forces in one model and 2) a
   foundation for further describing the impacts of more complicated scales
   of deposition surface roughness on particle deposition.}},

   direct extension of weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) in the

   multiple B-scans collected from a small area of a SD-OCT volumetric
   image, and then denoises and averages them together to obtain a high
   signal-to-noise ratio B-scan. The results show that the image quality
   metrics obtained by denoising and averaging only five nearby B-scans
   with MWNNM method is considerably better than those of the average image
   obtained by registering and averaging 40 azimuthally repeated B-scans.}},

Abstract = {{Most drug delivery systems have been developed for efficient delivery to
   tumor sites via targeting and on-demand strategies, but the carriers
   rarely execute synergistic therapeutic actions. In this work, C8, a
   cationic, pH-triggered anticancer peptide, is developed by incorporating
   histidine-mediated pH-sensitivity, amphipathic helix, and amino acid
   pairing self-assembly design. We designed C8 to function as a
   pH-responsive nanostructure whose cytotoxicity can be switched on and
   off by its self-assembly: Noncytotoxic beta-sheet fibers at high pH with
   neutral histidines, and positively charged monomers with membrane lytic
   activity at low pH. The selective activity of C8, tested for three
   different cancer cell lines and two noncancerous cell lines, is shown.
   Based on liposome leakage assays and multiscale computer simulations,
   its physical mechanisms of pore-forming action and selectivity are
   proposed, which originate from differences in the lipid composition of
   the cellular membrane and changes in hydrogen bonding. C8 is then
   investigated for its potential as a drug carrier. C8 forms a nanocomplex
   with ellipticine, a nonselective model anticancer drug. It selectively
   targets cancer cells in a pH-responsive manner, demonstrating enhanced
   efficacy and selectivity. This study provides a novel powerful strategy
   for the design and development of multifunctional self-assembling
   peptides for therapeutic and drug delivery applications.}},

Abstract = {{A WC-12\%Co coating was thermally sprayed on a 52100 steel substrate and
   subsequently friction stir processing (FSP) was performed on this layer.
   The wear resistance and hardness was compared before and after FSP.
   Optical and SEM revealed that FSP intermixes the sprayed layer with the
   substrate, reduces porosity, and enhances both hardness and wear
   performances. 3D profilometry mapping was conducted to evaluate the wear
   track depth and its morphology. Refined grain structures and a
   martensitic structure with retained austenite are promoted by the FSP
   treatment. This leads to formation of new intermetallic and carbides
   which were detected by X-ray diffraction, thus accounting for the
   increased hardness and improved wear resistance. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Although nanowire (NW) alignment has been previously investigated,
   minimizing limitations such as process complexity and NW breakage, as
   well as quantifying the quality of alignment, have not been sufficiently
   addressed. A simple, low cost, large-area, and versatile alignment
   method is reported that is applicable for NWs either grown on a
   substrate or synthesized in solution. Metal and semiconductor NWs with
   average lengths of up to 16 mu m are aligned through the stretching of
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films, which compared to other stretching
   methods results in superior alignment because of the large stretching
   ratio of PVA. Poly{[}oxy(methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)] is employed as
   lubricant to prevent NW breakage. To quantify NW alignment, a simple and
   effective image processing method is presented. The alignment process
   results in an order parameter (S) of NW alignment as high as 0.97.}},

Title = {{Improving robustness against electrode shift of high density EMG for
   myoelectric control through common spatial patterns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most prosthetic myoelectric control studies have
   concentrated on low density (less than 16 electrodes, LD)
   electromyography (EMG) signals, due to its better clinical applicability
   and low computation complexity compared with high density (more than 16
   electrodes, HD) EMG signals. Since HD EMG electrodes have been developed
   more conveniently to wear with respect to the previous versions
   recently, HD EMG signals become an alternative for myoelectric
   prostheses. The electrode shift, which may occur during repositioning or
   donning/doffing of the prosthetic socket, is one of the main reasons for
   degradation in classification accuracy (CA).
   Methods: HD EMG signals acquired from the forearm of the subjects were
   used for pattern recognition-based myoelectric control in this study.
   Multiclass common spatial patterns (CSP) with two types of schemes,
   namely one versus one (CSP-OvO) and one versus rest (CSP-OvR), were used
   for feature extraction to improve the robustness against electrode shift
   for myoelectric control. Shift transversal (ST1 and ST2) and
   longitudinal (SL1 and SL2) to the direction of the muscle fibers were
   taken into consideration. We tested nine intact-limb subjects for eleven
   hand and wrist motions. The CSP features (CSP-OvO and CSP-OvR) were
   compared with three commonly used features, namely time-domain (TD)
   features, time-domain autoregressive (TDAR) features and variogram
   (Variog) features.
   Results: Compared with the TD features, the CSP features significantly
   improved the CA over 10 \% in all shift configurations (ST1, ST2, SL1
   and SL2). Compared with the TDAR features, a. the CSP-OvO feature
   significantly improved the average CA over 5 \% in all shift
   configurations; b. the CSP-OvR feature significantly improved the
   average CA in shift configurations ST1, SL1 and SL2. Compared with the
   Variog features, the CSP features significantly improved the average CA
   in longitudinal shift configurations (SL1 and SL2).
   Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the CSP features significantly
   improved the robustness against electrode shift for myoelectric control
   with respect to the commonly used features.}},

Abstract = {{The supporting infrastructure and communications technologies for
   vehicular networking contexts are heterogeneous by nature. Large
   coverage access networks, such as 3G/4G, co-exist with wireless local
   area networks and dedicated short-range communications. In such a
   scenario, we investigate the seamless provision of mobile Internet
   access and general IP services over the heterogeneous network, in
   particular for loosely coupling architectures. We propose a hybrid
   global mobility scheme that allows for the ongoing IP sessions to be
   transferred across dissimilar radio access networks that may belong to
   different administrative domains. In order to achieve the global
   mobility, our scheme combines host-and network-based mobility. The
   solution focuses on urban vehicular scenarios and enables seamless
   communications for in-vehicle networks, passengers with mobile devices,
   and users of public transportation commuting along the system. By means
   of analytical evaluations and simulations of realistic urban vehicular
   scenarios, we show that our hybrid scheme can achieve seamless IP
   communications for mobile Internet access over the heterogeneous
   vehicular network.}},

Title = {{Calibration of catalyst temperature in automotive engines over coldstart

Abstract = {{The main scope of the current study is to develop a systematic
   stochastic model to capture the undesired uncertainty and random noises
   on the key parameters affecting the catalyst temperature over the
   coldstart operation of automotive engine systems. In the recent years, a
   number of articles have been published which aim at the modeling and
   analysis of automotive engines' behavior during coldstart operations by
   using regression modeling methods. Regarding highly nonlinear and
   uncertain nature of the coldstart operation, calibration of the engine
   system's variables, for instance the catalyst temperature, is deemed to
   be an intricate task, and it is unlikely to develop an exact
   physics-based nonlinear model. This encourages automotive engineers to
   take advantage of knowledge-based modeling tools and regression
   approaches. However, there exist rare reports which propose an efficient
   tool for coping with the uncertainty associated with the collected
   database. Here, the authors introduce a random noise to experimentally
   derived data and simulate an uncertain database as a representative of
   the engine system's behavior over coldstart operations. Then, by using a
   Gaussian process regression machine (GPRM), a reliable model is used for
   the sake of analysis of the engine's behavior. The simulation results
   attest the efficacy of GPRM for the considered case study. The research
   outcomes confirm that it is possible to develop a practical calibration
   tool which can be reliably used for modeling the catalyst temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The public key cryptography (PKC) is essential for securing many
   applications in smart grid. For the secure use of the PKC, certificate
   revocation schemes tailored to smart grid applications should be
   adopted. However, little work has been done to study certificate
   revocation in smart grid. In this paper, we first explain different
   motivations that necessitate revoking certificates in smart grid. We
   also identify the applications that can be secured by PKC and thus need
   certificate revocation. Then, we explain existing certificate revocation
   schemes and define several metrics to assess them. Based on this
   assessment, we identify the applications that are proper for each scheme
   and discuss how the schemes can be modified to fully satisfy the
   requirements of its potential applications. Finally, we study
   certificate revocation in pseudonymous public key infrastructure (PPKI),
   where a large number of certified public/private keys are assigned for
   each node to preserve privacy. We target vehicles-to-grid communications
   as a potential application. Certificate revocation in this application
   is a challenge because of the large number of certificates. We discuss
   an efficient certificate revocation scheme for PPKI, named compressed
   certificate revocation lists (CRLs). Our analytical results demonstrate
   that one revocation scheme cannot satisfy the over-head/security
   requirements of all smart grid applications. Rather, different schemes
   should be employed for different applications. Moreover, we used
   simulations to measure the overhead of the schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Predictability of revenue and costs to both operators and users is
   critical for payment schemes. We study the issue of the design of
   payment schemes in networks with bandwidth sharing. The model we
   consider is a processor sharing system that is accessed by various
   classes of users with different processing requirements or file sizes.
   The users are charged according to a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism
   because of its efficiency and fairness when logarithmic utility
   functions are involved. Subject to a given mean revenue for the
   operator, we study whether it is preferable for a user to pay upon
   arrival, depending on the congestion level, or whether the user should
   opt to pay at the end. This leads to a study of the volatility of
   payment schemes and we show that opting for prepayment is preferable
   from a user point of view. The analysis yields new results on the
   asymptotic behavior of conditional response times for processor sharing
   systems and connections to associated orthogonal polynomials.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidative stability of flaxseed-enriched lasagna during thermal
   processing was quantified using the Rancimat method. Lasagna was
   processed at high temperatures (120 and 180C) and oxidation was assessed
   from the electric conductivity of a water solution dissolving volatile
   secondary oxidation products. The oxidative stability of the lasagna was
   defined as the time to increase the conductivity by 5 mu S/cm. The
   oxidative stability of the lasagna was higher than pure flaxseed oil,
   showing the protective effect of the lasagna matrix against the
   development or diffusion of oxidation products. Rolling the lasagna
   multiple times in the sheeter and reducing the processing temperature
   increased resistance to oxidation. The oxidative stability of the
   lasagna was independent of the extraction of flaxseed oil prior to
   enrichment. For both flaxseed enrichment levels (10 and 20\%), the
   oxidative stability at 120C was approximately 10 times longer than the
   time required to dry lasagna at this temperature.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{450-465}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for assessing the robustness of an equilibrium in
   conflict resolution is presented. Roughly, an equilibrium is robust if
   it is resilient, or resistant to deviation. Robustness assessment is
   based on a new concept called Level of Freedom, which evaluates the
   relative freedom of a decision maker to escape an equilibrium.
   Resolutions of a conflict can be affected by changes in decision makers'
   preferences, which may destabilize an equilibrium, causing the conflict
   to evolve. Hence, a conflict may become long-term and thereby continue
   to evolve, even after reaching an equilibrium. The new robustness
   measure is used to rank equilibria based on robustness, to facilitate
   distinguishing equilibria that are relatively sustainable. An absolutely
   robust equilibrium is a special case in which the level of freedom is at
   an absolute minimum for each individual stability definition.}},

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4, SI}},

Abstract = {{This article explores a recently introduced novel technique called the
   nested monitoring trail (m-trail) method in all-optical mesh networks
   for failure localization of any shared risk link group (SRLG) with up to
   d undirected links. The nested m-trail method decomposes each network
   topology that is at least d-connected into virtual cycles and trails, in
   which sets of m-trails that traverse through a common monitoring node
   (MN) can be obtained. The nested m-trails are used in the monitoring
   burst (m-burst) framework, in which the MN can localize any SRLG failure
   by inspecting the optical bursts traversing through it. An integer
   linear program (ILP) and a heuristic are proposed for the network
   decomposition, which are further verified by numerical experiments. We
   show that the proposed method significantly reduces the required fault
   localization latency compared with the existing methods. Finally, we
   demonstrate that nested mtrails can also be used in adaptive probing to
   find SRLG faults in all-optical networks. The nested m-trail based
   probing method needs a significantly reduced number of sequential
   probes. Thus, the method overcomes one of the important hurdles to
   deploy adaptive probing in alloptical networks: the large number of
   sequential probes needed to localize SRLG faults. (c) 2015 Wiley

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{10008-10028}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hillslope runoff theory is based largely on the differentiation between
   infiltration excess overland flow, saturation excess overland flow, and
   subsurface stormflow. Here we explore to what extent a 2-D
   friction-based overland flow model is useful for predicting
   hillslope-scale subsurface stormflow, posited here as phenomenologically
   the same as infiltration excess at depth. We compare our results to a
   3-D variably saturated Darcy-Richards subsurface solver for individual
   rainfall runoff events. We use field data from the well-studied Panola
   Mountain Experimental hillslope in Georgia USA. Our results show that
   the two models are largely indistinguishable in terms of their ability
   to simulate the hillslope hydrograph magnitude and timing for a range of
   slopes and rainfall depths. Furthermore, we find that the descriptive
   ability of the overland flow model is comparable to the variably
   saturated subsurface flow model in terms of its ability to represent the
   spatial distribution of subsurface stormflow and infiltration across the
   soil-bedrock interface. More importantly, these results imply that the
   physics of infiltration excess subsurface stormflow at the soil-bedrock
   interface is similar to infiltration excess overland flow at the soil
   surface, in terms of detention storage, loss along the lower boundary,
   and threshold-like activation at the larger hillslope scale. Given the
   phenomenological similarity of overland flow and subsurface stormflow
   and the fact that overland flow model predictions are considerably
   faster to run (particularly as slope and rainfall depth increase), these
   findings imply that new forms of hillslope-scale subsurface storm runoff
   predictions may be possible with the knowledge of bedrock permeability
   and limited soil information. Finally, this work suggests that the role
   of soil mantle vis-a-vis subsurface stormflow is mainly as a filter that
   delays the development of patches of saturation along the bedrock
   surface. Our model results show that simple realizations of soil based
   on a few soil depth measurements can possibly be enough to characterize
   this filtering effect.}},

Abstract = {{Product life-cycle design is a pathway from concept to research and
   development, from manufacturing to marketing and distribution. In the
   current approach to product design two objectives are broadly of
   stakeholders' and customers' interest: product specification and price.
   Sustainable product design, however, requires that environmental,
   energy, and safety issues, among others, be addressed. This paper
   introduces a new methodology employing three sustainability indices
   related to environment, energy and safety for a variety of applications
   including product design. The indices can be used individually or
   together, and it is possible to add other metrics depending on the
   nature of products and processes. To test the indices, blends of a
   typical gasoline as a product design case study were investigated.
   Gasoline blends are good examples of sustainable product design.
   Different gasoline blend products were modeled by Aspen HYSYS in order
   to estimate the octane numbers. New sustainability indices involving
   metrics such as octane number, mileage loss, potential environmental
   impacts, and safety risk were then applied on the blends and compared to
   fuel economy using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to
   select the best product. The range of each metric varies from one to
   another depending on the nature of the metrics, applications,
   regulations etc.; however, AHP is used for ranking purposes in the range
   of 0-100\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of wheat straw and other agricultural byproduct fibres in
   polymer composite materials offers many economic and environmental
   benefits. Wheat straw has been recently commercialized as a new filler
   for polypropylene thermoplastic composites in automotive applications.
   However, to expand its application in the automotive industry and other
   sectors where highly-engineered materials are needed, a systematic
   database and reliable composite property models are needed. For this
   purpose, this research aims to develop a product design approach based
   on mixture design methodologies and inverse optimization for wheat straw
   polypropylene (WS-PP) composites for the automotive industry. The
   approach follows hierarchical steps starting from consumer needs and
   ending with specific end-products. Relevant information obtained
   systematically from historical data is used to design experiments and
   develop response surface models of composite properties as a function of
   a composite's component proportion. The response surface models are used
   to simulate and optimize the composition formulation of the composite,
   which meets the targeted product specifications. The last step of the
   proposed methodology is to optimize the composite ingredients to
   maximize wheat straw utilization in the final composite while minimizing
   the overall material cost. A case study is presented for the design of
   wheat straw polypropylene/ impact copolymer polypropylene (WS-PP/ICP)
   composite for the automotive industry.}},

Abstract = {{Thorough understanding of H-2 electrochemical oxidation helps optimize
   SOFC anode design and improve its performance. However, controversies
   still exist regarding H-2 electrochemical oxidation. Due to their
   well-defined 2-D structure, Ni/YSZ pattern anodes are ideally suited for
   reaction kinetic studies. In this study, a systematic study was
   performed to determine conditions for the stabilization of Ni/YSZ
   pattern anode performance. Moreover, a comprehensive and reliable
   dataset of H-2 electrochemical oxidation was obtained under stable test
   conditions. We found that stabilization of Ni/YSZ pattern anode
   performance relies on temperature and Ni thickness. Polarization
   resistance (R-p) depends on temperature, overpotential, H-2 partial
   pressure, and TPB length, and it increases with decreasing any of these
   parameters. R-p also depends on H2O content. When the pH(2)O is between
   3000 Pa (3\% of the total gases) and 30 000-40 000 Pa (30-40\% of the
   total gases), R-p decreases with increasing H2O content. However, R-p is
   less affected with further increasing H2O content. Charge transfer
   reactions coupled with H2O-related processes contribute to the
   rate-limiting steps for H-2 electro-oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{With water quality deteriorating globally, identification of novel
   adsorbents for removal of chloroaromatic compounds for wastewater
   treatment is of growing interest. Classic xerogels produced by drying
   sol-gels of tetraalkoxy silanes, such as tetramethoxy orthosilane (TMOS)
   or tetraethoxy orthosilane (TEOS), carry a negative surface charge in
   water when the pH is higher than the Point of Zero Charge (PZC). This
   feature was employed in this study to load divalent metal cations on the
   surfaces of these materials to facilitate chlorophenol (CP) adsorption.
   Although classic xerogels do not show a high affinity for the adsorption
   of chlorophenols such as 2-chlorophenol (2CP) in aqueous media, TEOS
   xerogels loaded with the cations Ni2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ showed 225, 249,
   and 306\% increases, respectively, in the adsorption of 2CP compared to
   the unloaded TEOS xerogel. Adsorption of the divalent cations on the
   xerogels exhibited the order of Zn2+>Cd2+>Ni2+, with maximum adsorption
   capacities (Q degrees) of 15.9 and 13 mg/g for Zn2+ on TEOS and TMOS
   xerogels, respectively. Using TEOS xerogels loaded with Zn2+ (TEOS-Zn),
   adsorption of 2CP, 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
   (TCP) in aqueous media was studied. The adsorption was found to be
   spontaneous and obeyed pseudo-second order kinetics, suggesting a
   chemisorption mechanism between CP and TEOS-Zn. The equilibrium
   isothermal adsorption data were most closely fitted with a Langmuir
   equation resulting in Q degrees values of 13.9, 9.17, and 8.5 mg/g for
   2CP, DCP, and TCP, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The current study deals with two-dimensional unsteady incompressible MHD
   water-based nanofluid flow over a convectively heated stretching sheet
   by considering Buongiorno's model. A uniform magnetic field is applied
   in the direction normal to the stretching sheet. It is assumed that the
   lower surface of the sheet is heated by convection by a nanofluid at
   temperature T-f, which generates the heat transfer coefficient, h(f).
   Uniform temperature and nanofluid volume fraction are assumed at the
   sheet's surface and the flux of the nanoparticle is taken to be zero.
   The assumption of zero nanoparticle flux at the sheet's surface makes
   the model physically more realistic. The effects of the uniform heat
   source-sink are included in the energy equation. With the help of
   similarity transformations, the partial differential equations of
   momentum, energy, and nanoparticle concentration are reduced to a system
   of nonlinear ordinary differential equations along with the transformed
   boundary conditions. The derived equations are solved with the help of
   the quasi-qinearization technique. The model is solved by considering
   the realistic values for the Lewis number, thermophoresis, and Brownian
   motion parameters. The objective of the current study is (i) to provide
   an efficient numerical technique for solving the boundary layer flow
   model and (ii) introduction of zero nanoparticle flux on the
   convectively heated stretching surface. The current study also focuses
   on the physical relevance and accurate trends of the boundary layer
   profiles, which are adequate in the laminar boundary layer theory. The
   dependence of the nanoparticle volume fraction and other pertinent
   parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature, shear stress, and
   heat transfer rates over the stretching surface are presented in the
   form of profiles.}},

Abstract = {{A highly efficient millimeter-wave (mmW)/Terahertz (THz) dielectric
   antenna is proposed. The proposed suspended tapered antenna {[}made of
   high resistivity silicon (Si)] is fabricated in a new mmW/THz integrated

   process makes the tapered antenna with deep reactive ion etching of the
   Si layer of the SOG platform, wherein a part of the glass substrate
   below the antenna tapered section is etched. The glass substrate below
   the antenna is etched in hydrofluoric acid (HF 49\%) before bonding to
   the Si wafer. The antenna is designed to radiate both E-x - and
   E-y-polarizations over the frequency band of 110-130 GHz and features
   additional advantages including highly linear polarization,
   high-directivity, integrability, and low-cost fabrication. Numerical and
   experimental results are presented to validate the high-performance
   proposed antenna. Experiments show gains of 17.5 dBi at 115 GHz and 18.3
   dBi at 128 GHz for E-x(11) - and E-y(11) -modes excitations,

Abstract = {{Node clustering is a potential solution to minimize the control
   signaling overhead of routing protocols in vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs). High relative vehicle mobility and frequent network topology
   changes induce instability to node clusters. Node cluster instability
   inflicts new challenges in maintaining a long route between network
   nodes, thus increasing the routing overhead. As a result, cluster
   instability, which is foisted by vehicle mobility, is a crucial issue
   for cluster-based routing in VANETs. This paper presents a stochastic
   analysis of the impact of cluster instability on generic routing
   overhead. A stochastic cluster instability-model is adopted to capture
   the time variations of the cluster structure in terms of the cluster
   membership change rate and the cluster-overlap state change rate. First,
   we derive the probability distribution of the intracluster routing
   overhead using the cluster membership change rate. Second, the
   intercluster routing overhead is modeled as a rooted tree, with the tree
   nodes representing the value of the overhead and the tree edges weighted
   by the probability of a cluster-overlap state change. Numerical results
   are presented to evaluate the proposed models, which demonstrate a close
   agreement between analytical and simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Water-soluble polymers of acrylamide (AAm) and acrylic acid (AAc) have
   significant potential in enhanced oil recovery, as well as in other
   specialty applications. To improve the shear strength of the polymer, a
   third comonomer, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS), can
   be added to the pre-polymerization mixture. Copolymerization kinetics of
   AAm/AAc are well studied, but little is known about the other comonomer
   pairs (AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc). Hence, reactivity ratios for AMPS/AAm and
   AMPS/AAc copolymerization must be established first. A key aspect in the
   estimation of reliable reactivity ratios is design of experiments, which
   minimizes the number of experiments and provides increased information
   content (resulting in more precise parameter estimates). However, design
   of experiments is hardly ever used during copolymerization parameter
   estimation schemes. In the current work, copolymerization experiments
   for both AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc are designed using two optimal techniques
   (Tidwell-Mortimer and the error-in-variables-model (EVM)). From these
   optimally designed experiments, accurate reactivity ratio estimates are
   determined for AMPS/AAm (r(AMPS) = 0.18, r(AAm) = 0.85) and AMPS/AAc
   (r(AMPS) = 0.19, r(AAc) = 0.86).}},

Abstract = {{In the Sultanate of Oman, oil and natural gas related activities have
   the most important shares of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)
   and are also the primary cause of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within
   the country. In this study, the CO2 inventory for Oman was developed
   over the last forty two years (from 1972 to 2013) in accordance with the
   IPCC reference approach. The results indicated that over the years, the
   amount of crude oil and natural gas produced and locally consumed in
   Oman have drastically increased. As a result, CO2 GHG emissions
   resulting from the consumption of crude oil and natural gas in Oman have
   also greatly increased. This study aims to assist Oman in monitoring its
   progress in the reduction of CO2 emissions. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Influence of an Inorganic Inter layer on Exciton Separation in Hybrid

Abstract = {{It has been shown that in hybrid polymer-inorganic photovoltaic devices
   not all the photogenerated excitons dissociate at the interface
   immediately, but can instead exist temporarily as bound charge pairs
   (BCPs). Many of these BCPs do not contribute to the photocurrent, as
   their long lifetime as a bound species promotes various charge carrier
   recombination channels. Fast and efficient dissociation of BCPs is
   therefore considered a key challenge in improving the performance of
   polymer-inorganic cells. Here we investigate the influence of an
   inorganic energy cascading Nb2O5 interlayer on the charge carrier
   recombination channels in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)-TiO2
   and PbSe colloidal quantum dot TiO2 photovoltaic devices. We demonstrate
   that the additional Nb2O5 film leads to a suppression of BCP formation
   at the heterojunction of the P3HT cells and also a reduction in the
   nongeminate recombination mechanisms in both types of cells.
   Furthermore, we provide evidence that the reduction in nongeminate
   recombination in the P3HT-TiO2 devices is due in part to the passivation
   of deep midgap trap states in the TiO2, which prevents trap-assisted
   Shockley Read Hall recombination. Consequently a significant increase in
   both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current was
   achieved, in particular for P3HT-based solar cells, where the power
   conversion efficiency increased by 39\%.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of bottlebrush block polymers into a lamellar phase
   was investigated using a combination of experiment and self-consistent
   field theory (SCFT). Nine diblock bottlebrush polymers were synthesized
   with atadic polypropylene side chains (block A) and polystyrene side
   chains (block B) attached to poly(norbornene) backbones of various
   contour lengths, L, and the resulting lamellar structures were analyzed
   using small-angle X-ray scattering. The scaling of the lamellar period,
   d(0) similar to L-gamma, exhibited an increasing exponent from gamma
   approximate to 0.3 at small L to gamma approximate to 0.9 at large L.
   The small exponents occurred for starlike molecules where the size of
   the side chains is comparable to L, while the larger exponents occurred
   for the more brushlike molecules where the side chains extend radially
   outward from the backbone. The bottlebrushes were then modeled using
   flexible side chains of types A and B attached to a semiflexible
   backbone with an adjustable persistence length, xi(b). The resulting
   SCFT predictions for d(0) showed remarkable quantitative agreement with
   the experimental data, where xi(b) was similar to the radius of the
   bottlebrushes. The theory was then used to examine the
   joint-distribution functions for the position and orientation of
   different segments along the backbone. This revealed a bilayer
   arrangement of the bottlebrushes in the lamellar phase, with a high
   degree of backbone orientation at the A/B interfaces that almost
   completely vanished near the center of the domains. This finding clearly
   refutes the prevailing interpretation that the large scaling exponent
   gamma is a result of highly extended backbone conformations.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate signal-source and signal-reflector target localization tasks
   via mobile sensory units and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), including
   those for environmental monitoring via sensory UAVs, require precise
   knowledge of specific signal propagation properties of the environment,
   which are permittivity and path loss coefficients for the
   electromagnetic signal case. Thus, accurate estimation of these
   coefficients has significant importance for the accuracy of location
   estimates. In this paper, we propose a geometric cooperative technique
   to instantaneously estimate such coefficients, with details provided for
   received signal strength (RSS) and time-of-flight (TOF)-based range
   sensors. The proposed technique is integrated to a recursive least
   squares (RLS)-based adaptive localization scheme and an adaptive motion
   control law, to construct adaptive target localization and adaptive
   target tracking algorithms, respectively, that are robust to
   uncertainties in aforementioned environmental signal propagation
   coefficients. The efficiency of the proposed adaptive localization and
   tracking techniques are both mathematically analysed and verified via
   simulation experiments.}},

   Alignment in a Smartphone}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4, SI}},

Abstract = {{Future wireless embedded devices will be increasingly powerful,
   supporting many more applications including one of the most crucial,
   security. Although many embedded devices offer resistance to bus probing
   attacks due to their compact size and high levels of integration,
   susceptibility to attacks on their electromagnetic side channel must be
   analyzed. This side channel is often quite complex to analyze due to the
   complexities of the embedded device including operating system,
   interrupts, and so forth. This article presents a new methodology for
   analyzing a complex system's vulnerability to the EM side channel. The
   methodology proposes a sliding window phase-only correlation method for
   aligning electromagnetic emanations from a complex smartphone running
   native code utilizing an on-chip cache. Unlike previous research,
   experimental results demonstrate that data written to on-chip cache
   within an advanced 312MHz 0.13um processor executing AES can be attacked
   utilizing this new methodology. Furthermore, for the first time, it has
   been shown that the point of side-channel attack is not a spike of
   increased EM but an area of low EM amplitude, unlike what is noted in
   previous findings. This research is important for advancing side-channel
   analysis understanding in complex embedded processors and ensuring
   secure implementations in future embedded ubiquitous devices.}},

Title = {{Runtime Monitoring of Cyber-Physical Systems Under Timing and Memory
   Constraints}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The goal of runtime monitoring is to inspect the well-being of a system
   by employing a monitor process that reads the state of the system during
   execution and evaluates a set of properties expressed in some
   specification language. The main challenge in runtime monitoring is
   dealing with the costs imposed in terms of resource utilization. In the
   context of cyber-physical systems, it is crucial for a software
   monitoring solution to be time predictable to improve scheduling, as
   well as support composition of monitoring solutions with an overall
   predictable behavior. Moreover, a small memory footprint is often
   required in components of cyber-physical systems, especially in deeply
   embedded systems. In this article, we propose a novel control-theoretic
   software monitoring solution for coordinating time predictability and
   memory utilization in runtime monitoring of systems that interact with
   the physical world. The controllers attempt to reduce monitoring jitter
   and maximize memory utilization while simultaneously ensuring the
   soundness of evaluation of properties. For systems where multiple
   properties are required to be monitored simultaneously, we construct a
   buffer sharing mechanism in which controllers dynamically share the
   memory space to negate the effect of bursts of environment actions, thus
   reducing jitter due to transient high loads.
   To validate our design choices, we present three case studies: (1) a
   Bluetooth mobile payment system, which shows a sporadic rate of events
   during peak hours; (2) a laser beam stabilizer for target tracking, and
   (3) a monitoring system for air/fuel ratio in a car engine exhaust and
   the CAM inlet position in the engine's cylinders. The experimental
   results of the case studies demonstrate up to 40\% improvement in time
   predictability of the monitoring solution when compared to a basic
   event-triggered approach. Moreover, memory utilization reaches an
   average of 90\% when using our dynamic buffer resizing mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for regrowth of nitrifying microorganisms was monitored in
   2 full-scale chloraminated drinking water distribution systems in
   Ontario, Canada, over a 9-month period. Quantitative PCR was used to
   measure amoA genes from ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and
   ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and these values were compared with
   water quality parameters that can influence nitrifier survival and
   growth, including total chlorine, ammonia, temperature, pH, and organic
   carbon. Although there were no severe nitrification episodes, AOB and
   AOA were frequently detected at low concentrations in samples collected
   from both distribution systems. A culture-based presence-absence test
   confirmed the presence of viable nitrifiers. AOB were usually present in
   similar or greater numbers than AOA in both systems. As well, AOB showed
   higher regrowth potential compared with AOA in both systems.
   Statistically significant correlations were measured between several
   water quality parameters of relevance to nitrification. Total chlorine
   was negatively correlated with both nitrifiers and heterotrophic plate
   count (HPC) bacteria, and ammonia levels were positively correlated with
   nitrifiers. Of particular importance was the strong correlation between
   HPC and AOB, which reinforced the usefulness of HPC as an operational
   parameter to measure general microbiological conditions in distribution
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Shared protection, such as failure-dependent protection (FDP), is well
   recognized for its outstanding capacity efficiency in all-optical mesh
   networks, at the expense of lengthy restoration time due to multihop
   signaling mechanisms for failure localization, notification, and device
   configuration. This paper investigates a novel monitoring trail
   (m-trail) scenario, called Global Neighborhood Failure Localization
   (G-NFL), that aims to enable any shared protection scheme, including
   FDP, for achieving all-optical and ultra-fast failure restoration. We
   first define the neighborhood of a node, which is a set of links whose
   failure states should be known to the node in restoration of the
   corresponding working lightpaths (W-LPs). By assuming every node can
   obtain the on-off status of traversing m-trails and W-LPs via lambda
   monitoring, the proposed G-NFL problem routes a set of m-trails such
   that each node can localize any failure in its neighborhood. Bound
   analysis is performed on the minimum bandwidth required for m-trails
   under the proposed G-NFL problem. Then, a simple yet efficient heuristic
   approach is presented. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the
   proposed G-NFL scenario under a number of different definitions of nodal
   neighborhood that concern the extent of dependency between the
   monitoring plane and data plane. The effect of reusing the spare
   capacity by FDP for supporting m-trails is examined. We conclude that
   the proposed G-NFL scenario enables a general shared protection scheme,
   toward signaling-free and ultra-fast failure restoration like p-Cycle,
   while achieving optimal capacity efficiency as FDP.}},

Abstract = {{With trillions of machines connecting to mobile communication networks
   to provide a wide variety of applications, supporting a massive number
   of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications devices has been considered
   an essential requirement for mobile operators. Meanwhile, cyber security
   is of paramount importance in M2M as all applications involving M2M
   cannot be widely accepted without security guarantees. In this article
   we focus on the standardization activities of 3GPP, especially
   group-based security for large-scale M2M communications in 3GPP
   networks. We first introduce the main components of the machine-type
   communication (MTC) security architecture. Then we discuss several major
   challenges for group-oriented secure M2M communications in 3GPP systems,
   i.e. authentication signalling congestion and overload, and group
   message protection. Specifically, we identify the performance issues of
   authentication signalling congestion and overload in no/low mobility
   scenarios, and propose three group access authentication and key
   agreement protocols. Moreover, several 3GPP candidate solutions for
   group message protection are introduced. Finally, we present key issues
   and research directions related to group-based secure M2M
   communications, including security, privacy, and efficiency in mobility
   scenarios of MTC, and flexible and efficient group key management.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This papers deals with the design of an efficient intelligent tool for
   automotive engine coldstart monitoring applications. The real-time
   identification and control of engine coldstart operations have been
   proven to be very formidable tasks. This refers to the highly nonlinear
   and transient behavior of the engine system over coldstart operations.
   As the catalyst temperature is not sufficiently high, the amount of
   tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions is remarkable over this period. The
   researchers of systems sciences have investigated the development of
   soft sensors which are needed to monitor the catalyst temperature for
   enabling effective coldstart controllers to reduce the emissions.
   However, most of the conducted researches have focused on using
   complicated statistical models as well as gradient-based neural networks
   for the considered problem. This raises several problems regarding the
   generalization and computational efficiency of the proposed models. In
   this paper, the authors propose a novel computationally efficient method
   based on the integration of accelerated kernels and Tikhonov regularized
   extreme learning machine for the online monitoring of the catalyst
   temperature over the coldstart period for a given engine. Based on the
   results of comparative simulations, the authors demonstrate that the
   proposed soft sensor can be very effective for automotive coldstart
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model using the commercial finite element method software
   package DEFORM 2D was developed and validated to model extrusion of
   AA3xxx aluminum alloys rods. Using a simple approach based on the
   initial grain size and material flow during extrusion, the deformed
   grain thickness during and after extrusion could be predicted with good
   accuracy. The model predicted deformed grain thickness, which, in
   conjunction with knowledge of the subgrain size during deformation, was
   used to predict the occurrence of the creation of a different
   microstructure near the surface of the extrudate as compared to the
   centre. The model predicts with good accuracy the deformed grain
   thickness and how it varies spatially both through the diameter of the
   extruded rod and along its length. The model predicts that the deformed
   grain thickness decreases dramatically from the center to the surface of
   the extrudate and how this is impacted by the extrusion ratio. Applying
   a cutoff value of the subgrain size, allows the prediction of the
   critical radius beyond which a more granular microstructure occurs at
   the surface. Optical microscopy and orientation imaging microscopy of
   the extruded AA3xxx rods were used to validate the model predictions of
   the deformed grain structure, both in terms of the grain thickness and
   the critical radius, beyond which the microstructure becomes more
   granular close to the rod surface. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{Fusion (TM) casting is a unique Direct Chill continuous casting process
   whereby two different alloys can be cast simultaneously, producing a
   laminated ingot for rolling into clad sheet metal such as AA3003/AA4045
   brazing sheet. Better understanding of the wetting and interface
   formation process during Fusion (TM) casting is required to further
   improve process yields and also explore use of other alloy systems for
   new applications. In this research, AA3003-core/AA4045-clad ingots were
   cast using a well-instrumented lab-scale Fusion (TM) casting system.
   As-cast Fusion (TM) interfaces were examined metallurgically and by
   mechanical testing. Computational fluid dynamic analyses of the Fusion
   (TM) casts were also performed. It was shown that the liquid AA4045-clad
   alloy was able to successfully wet and create an oxide-free,
   metallurgical, and mechanically sound interface with the lightly
   oxidized AA3003-core shell material. Based on the results of this study,
   it is proposed that the bond formation process at the alloys interface
   during casting is a result of discrete penetration of AA4045 liquid at
   defects in the preexisting AA3003 oxide, dissolution of underlying
   AA3003 by liquid AA4045, and subsequent bridging between penetration
   sites. Spot exudation on the AA3003 chill cast surface due to remelting
   and inverse segregation may also improve the wetting and bonding
   process. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel single-port multi-pole resonant sensor array
   fabricated on a novel Frame-Flex flexible substrate for a wearable
   epidermal ethanol sensor system, in which individual sensors carrying
   different functional polymers are brought together to share the same
   electrical input and output, and their resonance behavior along with
   inter-resonator coupling are captured through the single reflected array
   response curve (S-11). The coupling-matrix readout extraction (CMRE)
   technique is then further proposed to determine, from the S-11 response,
   the changes in the diagonal-coupling coefficient, Delta M-ii, which are
   used to identify different chemical analytes as the coupling signature.
   Two sensor arrays implementing different functional polymer sets-one
   with siloxane-based polymers and the other with crystalline-based
   polymers-are fabricated and tested under two selected mechanical loading
   conditions. The CMRE technique is then employed to obtain the coupling
   signatures of ethanol, methanol, acetone, and benzene on the arrays. It
   is successfully shown that the array response analyzed through the CMRE
   technique can clearly distinguish the presence of ethanol from other
   chemical interferents. For complicated mixtures of ethanol and other
   unwanted analytes, the distinctive coupling signatures obtained by CMRE
   can be used as a reliable data source fed to post-readout multi-variant
   analysis for pattern recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Path following controllers make the output of a control system approach

   In this paper, we present a method for path following control design
   applicable to framed curves generated by splines in the workspace of
   kinematically redundant mechanical systems. The class of admissible
   paths includes self-intersecting curves. Kinematic redundancies are
   resolved by designing controllers that solve a suitably defined
   constrained quadratic optimization problem. By employing partial
   feedback linearization, the proposed path following controllers have a
   clear physical meaning. The approach is experimentally verified on a
   four-degree-of-freedom (four-DOF) manipulator with a combination of

Abstract = {{With the need for improvements in the performance of rechargeable
   batteries has come the necessity to better characterize cell electrodes
   and their component materials. Electron microscopy has been shown to
   reveal many important features of microstructure that are becoming
   increasingly important for understanding the behavior of the components
   during the many charge/discharge cycles required in modern applications.
   The aim of this paper is to present an overview of how the full suite of
   techniques available using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   scanning transmission electron microscopy was applied to the case of
   materials for the positive electrode in nickel metal hydride
   rechargeable battery electrodes. Embedding and sectioning of
   battery-grade powders with an ultramicrotome was used to produce
   specimens that could be readily characterized by TEM. Complete
   electrodes were embedded after drying, and also after dehydration from
   the original wet state, for examination by optical microscopy and using
   focused ion beam techniques. Results of these studies are summarized to
   illustrate the significance of the microstructural information obtained.}},

Title = {{A New Protection Scheme Considering Fault Ride Through Requirements for

Abstract = {{New grid codes impose fault ride through (FRT) requirements on large
   doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind parks connected to
   transmission systems in order to reduce the loss of huge generation
   power due to temporary faults. Recently, the focus is set toward the
   development of different wind turbine technologies to enhance the FRT
   capability of wind parks with no consideration for transmission system
   protection schemes. This paper proposes a new communication-based dual
   time-current-voltage (Dual-TCV) tripping characteristic for directional
   overcurrent relays (DOCRs) that considers the FRT capability of wind
   parks by taking fast fault isolation actions in transmission systems.
   The protection coordination problem is formulated and solved to
   determine the optimal relay tripping settings. The proposed approach is
   tested on the IEEE 24-bus transmission system with up to eight
   DFIG-based wind parks. The outcome of this study reveals that protection
   schemes based on DOCRs governed by the proposed Dual-TCV tripping
   characteristic ensures fast fault isolations that significantly enhances
   the FRT operation of wind parks in adherence to grid code requirements.
   The transient analysis verifies the superior performance of the proposed
   protection approach in enhancing the FRT operation of wind parks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a digitally assisted analog/radio frequency
   predistorter (ARFPD) and a linear small-signal-assisted parameter
   identification algorithm suitable for the linearization of power
   amplifiers driven with wideband and carrier aggregated communication
   signals. It starts by describing the newly proposed
   finite-impulse-response assisted envelope memory polynomial (FIR-EMP)
   model which allows for reduction of hardware implementation complexity
   while maintaining good linearization capacity and low power overhead.
   Furthermore, a linear two-step small-signal-assisted parameter
   identification algorithm is devised to estimate the parameters of the
   two main blocks of the FIR-EMP model. Measurement results obtained by
   using the FIR-EMP predistorter demonstrate its excellent linearization
   capacity when used to compensate for distortion exhibited by gallium
   nitride Doherty power amplifiers driven by digitally modulated signals
   with a bandwidth up to 80 MHz. This confirms the potential of ARFPD as a
   very promising candidate for the linearization of small cell base
   stations power amplifiers while simultaneously reducing the power
   overhead compared to the popular digital predistortion technique.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum fluctuations of the vacuum are both a surprising and fundamental
   phenomenon of nature. Understood as virtual photons, they still have a
   very real impact, for instance, in the Casimir effects and the lifetimes
   of atoms. Engineering vacuum fluctuations is therefore becoming
   increasingly important to emerging technologies. Here, we shape vacuum
   fluctuations using a superconducting circuit analogue of a mirror,
   creating regions in space where they are suppressed. Moving an
   artificial atom through these regions and measuring the spontaneous
   emission lifetime of the atom provides us with the spectral density of
   the vacuum fluctuations. Using the paradigm of waveguide quantum
   electrodynamics, we significantly improve over previous studies of the
   interaction of an atom with its mirror image, observing a spectral
   density as low as 0.02 quanta, a factor of 50 below the mirrorless
   result. This demonstrates that we can hide the atom from the vacuum,
   even though it is exposed in free space.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47-48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With computation models playing an ever increasing role in the
   advancement of science, it is important that researchers understand what
   it means to model something; recognize the implications of the
   conceptual, mathematical and algorithmic steps of model construction;
   and comprehend what models can and cannot do. Here, we use examples to
   show that models can serve a wide variety of roles, including hypothesis
   testing, generating new insights, deepening understanding, suggesting
   and interpreting experiments, tracing chains of causation, doing
   sensitivity analyses, integrating knowledge, and inspiring new
   approaches. We show that models can bring together information of
   different kinds and do so across a range of length scales, as they do in
   multi-scale, multi-faceted embryogenesis models, some of which connect
   gene expression, the cytoskeleton, cell properties, tissue mechanics,
   morphogenetic movements and phenotypes. Models cannot replace
   experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in
   a given situation. But they can demonstrate whether or not a proposed
   mechanism is sufficient to produce an observed phenomenon. Although the
   examples in this article are taken primarily from the field of embryo
   mechanics, most of the arguments and discussion are applicable to any
   form of computational modelling. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Small interfering RNA (siRNA) shows great therapeutic potential due to
   its ability to regulate gene expression in a highly selective manner,
   but this application has been limited by effective delivery, partly
   because of the low nuclease resistance of siRNA in the presence of
   serum, and inefficient cellular uptake. We previously reported a library
   of cell-penetrating and amino acid-pairing peptides that facilitate
   effective siRNA delivery to mammalian cells without causing
   cytotoxicity, but they are unstable within serum-containing medium.
   Here, we investigated the possibility of conjugating the peptide with
   diethylene glycol to improve its serum stability without compromising
   its gene-regulation capability. One of the most promising peptides,
   C6M1, was conjugated with diethylene glycol, and its incorporated siRNA
   complexes had excellent serum stability and highly efficient cellular
   uptake with negligible cytotoxicity. The gene-silencing ability of
   diethylene glycol conjugated-peptide/siRNA complexes was comparable to
   that of non-conjugated peptide/siRNA at both mRNA and protein levels.
   Our data demonstrate that conjugating peptides with diethylene glycol is
   a promising method for improving siRNA delivery by improving its serum
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the potential utility of using near fiber (NF)
   jiggle as an assessment of neuromuscular transmission stability in
   healthy older subjects using decomposition-based quantitative
   electromyography (DQEMG).
   Methods: The tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles
   were tested in 9 older men (77 +/- 5 years) and 9 young male control
   subjects (23 +/- 0.3 years). Simultaneous surface and needle-detected
   electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected during voluntary
   contractions, and then analyzed using DQEMG. Motor unit potential (MUP)
   and NF MUP parameters were analyzed.
   Results: NF jiggle was significantly increased for both the TA and VM in
   the old age group relative to the younger controls (P < 0.05). NF jiggle
   was significantly higher in the TA compared to VM (P < 0.05). For TA, NF
   jiggle was negatively correlated with MUNE, and positively correlated
   with S-MUP amplitude, NF count, MUP duration, MUP peak-to-peak voltage,
   and MUP area (P < 0.05). For VM, NF jiggle was positively correlated
   with NF count and MUP area (P < 0.05), and no significant correlations
   were found between NF jiggle and S-MUP amplitude, MUP duration, or MUP
   peak-to-peak voltage (MUNE was not calculated for VM, so no correlation
   could be made).
   Conclusions: Healthy aging is associated with neuromuscular transmission
   instability (increased NF jiggle) and MU remodeling, which can be
   measured using DQEMG.
   Significance: NF jiggle derived from DQEMG can be a useful method of
   identifying neuromuscular dysfunction at various stages of MU remodeling
   and aging. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical

Title = {{Sustained Attention in Auditory and Visual Monitoring Tasks: Evaluation
   of the Administration of a Rest Break or Exogenous Vibrotactile Signals}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Performance and mental workload were observed for the
   administration of a rest break or exogenous vibrotactile signals in
   auditory and visual monitoring tasks.
   Background: Sustained attention is mentally demanding. Techniques are
   required to improve observer performance in vigilance tasks.
   Method: Participants (N = 150) monitored an auditory or a visual display
   for changes in signal duration in a 40-min watch. During the watch,
   participants were administered a rest break or exogenous vibrotactile
   signals.
   Results: Detection accuracy was significantly greater in the auditory
   than in the visual modality. A short rest break restored detection
   accuracy in both sensory modalities following deterioration in
   performance. Participants experienced significantly lower mental
   workload when monitoring auditory than visual signals, and a rest break
   significantly reduced mental workload in both sensory modalities.
   Exogenous vibrotactile signals had no beneficial effects on performance,
   or mental workload.
   Conclusion: A rest break can restore performance in auditory and visual
   vigilance tasks. Although sensory differences in vigilance tasks have
   been studied, this study is the initial effort to investigate the
   effects of a rest break countermeasure in both auditory and visual
   vigilance tasks, and it is also the initial effort to explore the
   effects of the intervention of a rest break on the perceived mental
   workload of auditory and visual vigilance tasks. Further research is
   warranted to determine exact characteristics of effective exogenous
   vibrotactile signals in vigilance tasks.
   Application: Potential applications of this research include procedures
   for decreasing the temporal decline in observer performance and the high
   mental workload imposed by vigilance tasks.}},

   the original data based on their locations in the feature space, and an

   ``localized manifolds{''}) and can overcome the difficulty of learning a
   single global manifold due to the complexity and nonlinearity of
   hyperspectral data. Two state-of-the-art feature extraction methods are
   used to implement localized manifolds. Experimental results show that
   classification accuracy is improved using both localized manifold

Abstract = {{Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in various industrial
   applications. A spectrum synch (SS) technique is proposed in this paper
   for early IM defect detection using electric current signals; fault
   detection in this paper will focus on defects in rolling element
   bearings and rotor bars, which together account for more than half of
   IMimperfections. In bearing fault detection, the proposed SS technique
   will highlight the peakedness of the fault frequency components
   distributed over several fault- related local bands. These bands are
   synchronized to form a fault information spectrum to accentuate fault
   features. A central kurtosis indicator is proposed to extract
   representative features from the fault information spectrum and
   formulates a fault index for incipient IM fault diagnosis. The
   effectiveness of the developed SS technique is demonstrated on IM with
   broken rotor bars and IM with damaged bearing. Test results show that
   the developed SS technique can detect incipient IM faults effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks are expected to significantly improve traffic
   safety and transportation efficiency while providing a comfortable
   driving experience. However, available communication, storage, and
   computation resources of the connected vehicles are not well utilized to
   meet the service requirements of intelligent transportation systems.
   Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is a promising approach that makes use
   of the advantages of cloud computing and applies them to vehicular
   networks. In this paper, we propose an optimal computation resource
   allocation scheme to maximize the total long-term-expected reward of the
   VCC system. The system reward is derived by taking into account both the
   income and cost of the VCC system as well as the variability feature of
   available resources. Then, the optimization problem is formulated as an
   infinite horizon semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the defined
   state space, action space, reward model, and transition probability
   distribution of the VCC system. We utilize the iteration algorithm to
   develop the optimal scheme that describes which action has to be taken
   under a certain state. Numerical results demonstrate that the
   significant performance gain can be obtained by the SMDP-based scheme
   within the acceptable complexity.}},

   Characteristics and Slipping Risks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pedestrian safety on parking lots and sidewalks is a main concern under
   adverse winter conditions because of the reduced friction level caused
   by snow and ice contaminations. Although there is an intuitive
   understanding that the risk of slipping is related to the friction level
   of a pavement surface affected by snow and ice, there is limited
   knowledge on the underlying relationship and how friction level is
   affected by various factors such as contaminant type and amount,
   pavement type, and other factors. Knowledge of this relationship with
   the contaminant types, coefficient of friction, and risk of slipping is
   essential for establishing cost-effective level of service policy and
   standards for winter maintenance of these transportation facilities.
   This paper summarizes the results of a field study investigating the
   friction characteristics and associated slipping risk levels of
   different contaminant pavement surfaces under a variety of weather
   conditions. A large number of field tests were conducted on three common
   pavement structures-asphalt concrete, interlocked brick, and Portland
   cement concrete-with a variety of surface contaminants such as unplowed
   snow, plowed snow, slush, and ice. It was found that pavement surfaces
   of major contaminant types have distinctive ranges of friction and
   slipping risk levels, and they could be inferred from each other,
   suggesting the feasibility of establishing a friction-based service
   standard. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase/lysophosphatidic add
   acyltransferase (AGPAT/LPAAT) family is a group of homologous
   acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferases. We performed
   studies to better understand the subcellular localization, activity, and
   in vivo function of AGPAT4/LPAAT delta, which we found is expressed in
   multiple mouse brain regions. Endogenous brain AGPAT4 and AGPAT4
   overexpressed in HEK293 or Sf9 insect cells localizes to mitochondria
   and is resident on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Further
   fractionation showed that AGPAT4 is present specifically in the
   mitochondria and not in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane (i.e. MAM). Lysates from Sf9 cells infected with
   baculoviral Agpat4 were tested with eight lysophospholipid species but
   showed an increased activity only with lysophosphatidic acid as an acyl
   acceptor. Analysis of Sf9 phospholipid species, however, indicated a
   significant 72\% increase in phosphatidylinositol (PI) content. We
   examined the content of major phospholipid species in brains of
   Agpat4(-/-) mice and found also a >50\% decrease in total levels of PI
   relative to wildtype mice, as well as significant decreases in
   phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but no
   significant differences in phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol,
   cardiolipin, or phosphatidic acid (PA). A compensatory upregulation of
   Agpats 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 may help to explain the lack of difference in
   PA. Our findings indicate that AGPAT4 is a mitochondrial AGPAT/LPAAT
   that specifically supports synthesis of brain PI, PC, and PE. This
   understanding may help to explain apparent redundancies in the
   AGPAT/LPAAT family. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of recyclable adsorbents comprising of cellulose
   nanocrystals and alginate (CNC-ALG) with superior adsorption capacity
   was developed. Sustainable nanomaterials like cellulose nanocrystals
   derived from pulp fibres and cellulosic biomass are ideal systems to
   remove contaminants in our water systems. Their use will reduce our
   dependence on adsorbents, such as activated carbon that contribute to
   greenhouse gases production. Adsorption characteristics of CNC-ALG
   hydrogel beads were evaluated using batch adsorption studies of
   methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution. The influence of various
   parameters, such as contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial dye
   concentration, pH, temperature, ionic strength, crosslinking time and
   bead size on the MB adsorption were investigated. Thermodynamic analyses
   confirmed that the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic. The
   kinetics and mechanism of adsorption were best described by a
   pseudo-second order kinetic model and intra-particle diffusion model.
   Equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the Langmuir adsorption
   isotherm yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 256.41 mg/g, which is
   comparable to activated carbon. We demonstrated that after five
   adsorption-desorption cycles, the removal efficiency of MB remained at
   similar to 97 \%, and the CNC-ALG hydrogel beads are effective
   adsorbents for the removal of organic dyes from wastewaters.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers mostly focus on the role of suspension system
   characteristics on vehicle dynamics. However tire characteristics are
   also influential on the vehicle dynamics behavior. In this paper, the
   effects of tire vertical stiffness on the ride, handling,

   analytically investigated. Furthermore, a method for determining the
   optimum vertical stiffness of tires is presented. For these purposes,
   first an appropriate mathematical criterion for the ride, handling,
   accelerating/braking performance, and fuel consumption is developed.
   Next, to achieve the optimum tire characteristic, a performance index,
   which contains all of the above-mentioned criteria, is defined and
   optimized. In the proposed performance index, the tire vertical
   stiffness is a design variable and its optimization provides a
   compromise among ride, handling, accelerating/braking performance, and
   fuel consumption of the vehicle. Last, the analytical optimization
   results are confirmed by performing precise numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are vulnerable to different kinds of
   denial-of-Service attacks. One such common and easy-to-launch attack is
   physical or link layer jamming, where an adversary emits constant,
   high-amplitude noises disrupting the communication among nodes. An
   intelligent solution is to collaboratively map the jammed region and
   avoiding traffic through the jammed area. Wood et al. propose such a
   jammed area mapping (J.A.M) protocol. However, the protocol has the
   problem of broadcast storm inside the jammed area. In this letter, a
   technique is presented that finds the nodes inside the jammed area
   without extensive flooding, thus reducing the traffic inside the jammed
   region substantially, while retaining the basic operation of J.A.M
   around the boundary. The solution relies on the localization services
   present in WSN and exploits this prepared knowledge of neighborhood for
   deducing the entire area from the perimeter. The result is a reliable
   and low-traffic version of J.A.M protocol. Simulation results show that
   the overall traffic involved in mapping can be reduced by 20\%-25\%
   using this approach.}},

Title = {{Comparative life cycle assessment of power-to-gas generation of hydrogen
   with a dynamic emissions factor for fuel cell vehicles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{62-73}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Power-to-gas, an excellent energy storage technology, is also useful for
   the role it can play in producing hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles. The
   replacement of the existing transportation infrastructure and the end of
   society's reliance on carbon-based fuels is dependent on the development
   of efficient, cleaner technologies as well as `smart energy networks'.
   One of the most touted technological advances is the replacement of
   internal combustion engines with `green' hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
   Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles do not emit any greenhouse gases or other
   emissions as such do not directly contribute to climate change or urban
   air pollution during their operation. With green hydrogen as the fuel,
   the emissions from the fuel production become dependent not on the
   vehicle type or electrolyzer technology, but on the sources of
   electricity being used to generate the hydrogen. In this study, the
   authors examine the use of electrolytic hydrogen to power vehicles and
   compare this with its internal combustion counterpoint. In this analysis
   a dynamic electrical grid emissions factor, based on the total grid mix
   of energy generation technologies at any given time, is determined. In
   this case study, the province of Ontario, Canada is used. Unique to this
   work is that the simulation of the generation of hydrogen is via
   electrolysis under different control strategies; the strategies
   considered, specifically, are continuous electrolyzer operation, price
   threshold operation, or operation based on an emission factor threshold
   based on the mix of energy generation technologies feeding the grid at
   any given hour. With the introduction of new policy tools to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon taxes and cap-andtrade, the
   monetization of emissions provides an even greater incentive for
   industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, it is
   illustrated that by using the dynamic emissions factor to control the

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel haptic-enabled magnetic micromanipulation
   platform with promising potential for extensive biological and
   biomedical applications. This platform consists of two separated basic
   sites: 1) the slave site that uses a controlled magnetic field for
   manipulating a ferromagnetic microdevice and 2) the master site that
   uses a haptic-enabled device for the position and the force
   communication between the human operator and the microdevice. Due to the
   size restriction of the microdevice, attaching force sensors to the
   microdevice is impractical. Thus, to preserve a high feeling of a
   microdomain environment for the human operator, the applied force/torque
   from the environment to the microdevice is estimated with a novel
   off-board force sensing mechanism. This force sensing mechanism uses the
   produced magnetic flux information and the real position of the
   microdevice to estimate the environmental force applied to the
   microdevice. A scaled force-position teleoperation scheme is employed
   for this haptic application to scale down the macrodomain position for
   microdomain application and scale up the microdomain force for
   macrodomain sensing of the human operator. Conducting several
   experiments in different conditions, precise motion tracking with high
   accurate force transfer to human operator has been reported, RMS of
   position tracking errors of 0.2 mm with 1.27-mu N accuracy force sensing
   for single-axis motion.}},

Abstract = {{Size spectrum of biological particles directly affects nutrient cycling
   and energy flow distribution of marine ecosystems. Fast and accurate
   detection of the size and distribution of marine phytoplankton plays a
   very important role for in-depth study of physiological characteristics
   of marine phytoplankton community structure and function. In this paper,
   a novel detection method and system of size spectrum of microalgae cells
   on a microfluidic chip is presented. In this device, a microfluidic
   resistance pulse sensor (RPS) technology is adopted to determine the
   particle size of microalgae cells; chlorophyll fluorescence intensity is
   used to judge if a particle is a live microalgae cell or not. Inside a
   waterproof case, the system mainly comprises a microfluidic chip
   platform, a sample acquisition module, an optoelectronic detection unit,
   and a module performing data acquisition, data processing and system
   control. To demonstrate the performance of the developed system,
   experiments were conducted with three species of microalgae cells
   (Isochrysis galbana, Dunaliella sauna and Tetraselmis chui), typical
   phytoplankton cells in marine environments, as samples. Comparison
   experiments between the developed detection system and a commercial flow
   cytometer were conducted. The results demonstrate that the developed
   system is reliable and accurate. The limit of detection of microalgae
   cell size is 3 tun for the current device and can be improved in the
   future. The presented microfluidic system provides a very promising
   method of size spectrum detection of microalgae cells with the
   advantages such as fast detection, small size and easy operation. It has
   a great potential for in-situ underwater detection of micro
   phytoplanktons pending further product development. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Industrial manipulators have multidisciplinary applications. The use of
   industrial manipulators has increased rapidly, and they are more refined
   in many applications due to advances such as fast response time, high
   precision, high speed motions and a high level of performance. Most
   industrial manipulators are position controlled; usually vision and
   force sensors are not integrated in most commercial industrial robots.
   Therefore in order to use industrial manipulators for delicate tasks,
   the addition of force and vision sensing mechanisms is required to
   successfully automate these tasks, and to enable robots to avoid high
   contact forces while working in applications that require contact with
   environments. In this paper, an optical tracking device and a force
   torque sensor were integrated into a position controlled industrial
   manipulator to operate in unknown inclined planes. In addition, two
   types of controllers are presented to control the interaction force. The
   control techniques are admittance control and fuzzy logic control. The
   results show the capability of the presented controllers to successfully
   monitor the interaction force while tracking the position of a passive
   marker moved by a human operator. The force error using the admittance
   controller is found to be in the range of +/- 0.75 N. The fuzzy logic
   controller on the other hand produces less overshoot relative to the
   admittance controller, but a higher error of +/- 1.5 N.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial robots are widely used in manufacturing and automation
   environments. Many applications require a physical contact between the
   robot end-effector and the surrounding environment. Therefore, position
   and force control are needed. Controlling a robot can be successfully
   achieved by obtaining an accurate dynamic model of the robot. In this
   paper, the dynamic model of a four degree of freedom (DOF) SCARA robot
   is derived using MapleSim(A (R)) software. Furthermore, MapleSim will
   not only be used to find the dynamic model of the robot, but also to
   control the interaction force between the robot and its working
   environment. To verify the derived model, an impedance controller with
   specified mass, damping, and stiffness is implemented to control the
   interaction force. In addition, MapleSim is successfully used to
   validate the control algorithm. The results show that the system is not
   stable if the virtual mass gain is much larger than the summation of the
   masses of links three and four. The use of MapleSim in robotic
   application is relatively new and is an ongoing research. This paper
   concludes that the robot's performance can be evaluated virtually using
   MapleSim before assigning the robot in real-world tasks.}},

Abstract = {{A novel monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor
   receptor 2 (HER2), i.e., pertuzumab (Perjeta (R)) developed by
   Genentech, has been verified to be effective in treating metastatic
   HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. The fact that the presence of the Fc
   region of the anti-HER2 is uncritical for growth inhibition of tumor
   cells suggests the potential biological activity of the associated
   antibody fragments. In the present study, we report functional
   expression of anti-HER2his-scFv, a single-chain variable fragment (scFv)
   derived from pertuzumab, in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and its
   purification. Biological activity of the soluble scFv produced in this
   manner was characterized using immunofluorescent staining,
   immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assay. The effect
   of anti-HER2his-scFv on HER2 dimerization was also assessed by tyrosine
   kinase assay. It was observed that the purified scFv had a high
   specificity and affinity to HER2 receptors expressed on the surface of
   tumor cells with a selective cytotoxic effect on HER2-overexpressing
   SK-OV-3 cells. In addition, anti-HER2his-scFy was able to suppress
   phosphorylation of HER2 in the presence of heregulin. The results
   suggest that anti-HER2his-scFv can be a potential candidate for various
   therapeutic and diagnosis applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A new methodology for assessing the effectiveness of carbon capture and
   storage (CCS) that does explicitly consider the detailed operation of
   the target electricity system is proposed. The electricity system
   simulation consists of three phases, each one using a modified version
   of an economic dispatch problem that seeks to maximize the producers'
   and consumers' surplus while satisfying the technical constraints of the
   system. The economic dispatch is formulated as a dynamic mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming problem and implemented in general algebraic
   modelling system (GAMS). The generating unit with CCS is designed and
   simulated using Aspen Plus (R). In the first case study, the operation
   of the IEEE RTS `96 (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
   One-Area Reliability Test System1996) is simulated with greenhouse gas
   (GHG) regulation implemented in the form of CO2 permits that generators
   need to acquire for every unit of CO2 that it is emitted. In the second
   case study, CCS is added at one of the buses and the operation of the
   modified IEEE RTS `96 is again simulated with and without GHG
   regulation. The results suggest that the detailed operation of the
   target electricity system should be considered in future assessments of
   CCS and a general procedure for undertaking this for any GHG mitigation
   option is proposed. Future work will use the novel methodology for
   assessing the effectiveness of generating units with flexible CO2
   capture. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the development of a multibody foot-ground contact
   model consisting of spherical volumetric models for the surfaces of the
   foot. The developed model is two-dimensional and consists of two
   segments, the hind-foot, mid-foot, and fore-foot as one rigid body and
   the phalanges collectively as the second rigid body. The model has four
   degrees of freedom: ankle and , foot orientation, and
   metatarsal-phalangeal joint angle. Three different types of contact
   elements are targeted: Kelvin-Voigt, linear volumetric, and
   hyper-volumetric. The models are kinematically driven at the ankle and
   the metatarsal joints, and simulated horizontal and vertical ground
   reaction forces as well as center of pressure location are compared
   against experimental quantities acquired from barefoot measurements
   during a human gait cycle. Parameter identification is performed for
   finding optimal contact parameters and locations of the contact
   elements. The hyper-volumetric foot-ground contact model was found to be
   a suitable choice for foot/ground interaction modeling within human gait
   simulations; this model showed 75 \% and 62 \% improvement on the
   matching quality over the point contact and linear volumetric models,
   respectively.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the impact of graphene sheet size on the electrical
   conductivity of interconnected graphene foam polymer composite is
   thoroughly investigated. Graphene oxide solution is produced from small
   flake graphite (SFG) (2-15 mu m) and large flake graphite (LFG) (>100 mu
   m), respectively. Each solution is used to produce three-dimensional GO
   foam, which is subsequently heat-treated to produce reduced graphene
   oxide (RGO) foam. The RGO foams are then infiltrated with
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) to produce graphene-PDMS (G-PDMS)
   composites. The in-plane electrical conductivity of the G-PDMS composite
   (0.4 wt\%) from LFG reaches similar to 3.2 S/m, which is more than two
   orders of magnitude greater than that of G-PDMS (1.9 wt\%, 1.4 x 10(-2)
   S/m) from SFG. This value is also four orders of magnitude higher than
   that of the G-PDMS composite prepared from mechanical mixing of 4 wt\%
   RGO powder made from SFG with PDMS (4.2 x 10(-5) S/m). The though-plane
   electrical conductivity followed the same trend for SFG and LFG. This
   reveals that the interconnected graphene foam supplies more efficient
   paths for electron transfer inside the polymer than conventional
   graphene powder and the use of large sized graphene sheets can
   significantly improve the electrical properties of G-PDMS. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Contrast is a fundamental attribute of images that plays an important
   role in human visual perception of image quality. With numerous
   approaches proposed to enhance image contrast, much less work has been
   dedicated to automatic quality assessment of contrast changed images.
   Existing approaches rely on global statistics to estimate contrast
   quality. Here we propose a novel local patch-based objective quality
   assessment method using an adaptive representation of local patch
   structure, which allows us to decompose any image patch into its mean
   intensity, signal strength and signal structure components and then
   evaluate their perceptual distortions in different ways. A unique
   feature that differentiates the proposed method from previous contrast
   quality models is the capability to produce a local contrast quality
   map, which predicts local quality variations over space and may be
   employed to guide contrast enhancement algorithms. Validations based on
   four publicly available databases show that the proposed patch-based
   contrast quality index (PCQI) method provides accurate predictions on
   the human perception of contrast variations.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to address the potential air quality impact of a
   proposed expansion of the Miller Braeside quarry in Ontario, Canada. The
   main focus of this assessment is on the potential impacts of the total
   suspended particulates (TSP) emissions. The CALPUFF dispersion modeling
   system was utilized to assess the maximum ground level concentrations of
   TSP emitted from the proposed quarry site. The emissions for 4 days in
   the year 2013 were examined, where each day represented a different
   season. The results of the dispersion models were evaluated against the
   TSP concentration limits set by the Ontario Ministry of Environment
   (MOE). All simulated 1-h average TSP concentrations were found to
   significantly exceed Ontario's 1-h TSP limit. Similarly, the simulated
   24-h average TSP concentrations on the days representing the winter,
   summer, and autumn seasons were found to be well above Ontario's 24-h
   TSP limit. Potential regions nearby the quarry that may be affected by
   adverse TSP emissions were determined to generally be within the most
   concentrated region of the TSP plume trajectories. Since the quarry is
   situated in close proximity to many residential areas, expansion of the
   Miller Braeside quarry is not recommended as its high TSP concentration
   levels will pose as a severe hazard to human health.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{128-142}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive variable amplitude (VA) fatigue testing program and
   analysis was performed to address a number of concerns raised regarding
   the use of impact treatments for the fatigue enhancement of welds in the
   high and ultra-high cycle (up to 100 million cycles) domains. A total of
   67 fatigue tests were conducted on two different welded joints
   representing load-carrying and non-load carrying welds in steel
   structures. Two different VA loading spectrums, generated using traffic
   data and influence lines for highway bridge girders, were used. The
   effects of load cycles with high stress ratios (R>0.4) and large tensile
   overloads (greater than the yield strength) were studied. The test
   results were then used to evaluate a number of previously proposed
   recommendations for the fatigue design of impact treated welds. The
   nominal, structural, and effective notch stress approaches were
   considered. Finite element (FE) analysis was performed to determine the
   structural and effective notch stresses. A statistical analysis of the
   fatigue test results was conducted and characteristic S-N curves with
   slope, m = 5 are proposed for the fatigue design of treated welds under
   VA loading in the high cycle domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study two local feedback equivalence problems for a nonlinear

   designing controllers that locally stabilize the smaller set relative to
   the larger set. The second, more restrictive, result additionally
   imposes that the transversal dynamics to the larger set be linear and

   stabilize the larger submanifold. This is illustrated by sufficient
   conditions under which these normal forms can be used to locally solve a

Abstract = {{In this work, silane crosslinking of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) was
   studied. PLA was grafted with vinyl trimethoxysilane (VTMO) via melt
   mixing in an internal mixer, followed by a crosslinking reaction in hot
   water for different times. The effect of simultaneous hydrolytic
   degradation in hot water (70 degrees C) during crosslinking was
   monitored. Silane grafting of PLA was characterized using mixing torque
   and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The results revealed
   that by increasing the silane (0-7 wt\%) and peroxide (0-0.5 wt\%)
   contents, the degree of grafting was increased. A peak corresponding to
   higher molecular weight in GPC chromatograms appeared in comparison to
   pure PLA due to the grafting reaction. Gel content, swelling test, GPC
   and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to monitor gel
   structure and concurrent hydrolytic degradation. Results confirmed that
   the occurrence of hydrolytic degradation during crosslinking and gel
   content of some samples tended to zero over 10 hr of immersion in hot
   water. The effect of hydrolytic degradation was not significant up to 10
   hr and a tight gel structure was obtained. However, at longer
   crosslinking times, hydrolytic degradation was the dominant mechanism
   that leads to network defects.}},

Title = {{Reduced order modeling of a short-residence time gasifier}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{222-232}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{State-of-the-art gasifiers require rapid mixing of fuel, steam and
   oxygen to achieve high carbon conversion within a short residence time.
   This allows reduction of the gasifier's volume and the associated
   capital costs. CanmetENERGY of Natural Resources Canada has a
   pilot-scale gasifier that can convert solid fuels to syngas in less than
   1 s. This study describes the development of a reduced order model (ROM)
   for CanmetENERGY's entrained flow short-residence time gasifier. The
   model consists of a reactor network that represents the gasifier using a
   set of chemical reactors that are aimed to capture distinct flow zones
   of the system. The layout of chemical reactors proposed in this work is
   based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the gasifier
   that accounted for the detailed gas and particle flows. The ROM
   implements sub-models for the simulation of drying, devolatilization,
   chemical reactions, viscous fluid-solid interactions, pollutant
   formation and heat transfer through the wall of the reactor. The
   predictions obtained by the ROM are in reasonable agreement with the CFD
   simulation data for axial temperature, heat flux, conversion and
   composition. Having established the flow pattern for a given gasifier
   and range of operating conditions, the proposed ROM is computationally
   efficient since it only requires 2.5 min to converge whereas CFD
   simulations require 7-10 days. This attractive feature enables
   integration of the gasifier ROM to process simulators for further
   development of integrated gasification combined cycle power plants. (C)

Title = {{Probabilistic generating capacity adequacy evaluation: Research roadmap}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{83-93}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Evaluation of the adequacy of generating capacity is one of the main
   planning challenges within the field of power system. With respect to
   the evaluation of power system reliability, a variety of criteria and
   techniques have been developed and utilized by numerous utilities over a
   number of decades. Of these, deterministic and probabilistic techniques
   are the ones widely used for the evaluation of generating capacity
   adequacy. Nowadays, modern power systems have emphasized the need for
   probabilistic techniques to address the challenges that power system
   undergone and ensure generation adequacy where the applicability of
   deterministic techniques is no longer valid.
   The goal of this roadmap research paper is to provide a comprehensive
   and adequate overview of commonly used probabilistic techniques for
   generating system adequacy assessment: analytical, non-sequential, and
   sequential Monte Carlo simulation. The literature review presented in
   this paper, which includes theories, methodologies, analyses, and
   discussions, aims to provide useful information to planners or
   developers who endeavor to assess the reliability of existing power
   generation systems and plan for future generating capacity additions.
   Moreover, a valuable background review assembled from different sources
   is expected to serve students and researchers who are interested in
   studying in this area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   austenitization in argon and air atmospheres}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Variations in spectral emissivity of Usibor (R) 1500P steel during a
   two-step austenitization and in two different heating atmospheres, argon
   and air, are measured in-situ using a near infrared spectrometer and
   ex-situ with a Fourier transform infrared reflectometer. Phase
   transformations of the Al-Si coating and surface oxidation lead to the
   changes in surface phase composition and surface roughness, which in
   turn influence the spectral emissivity. In the first step heating at 610
   degrees C, the abrupt increase of spectral emissivity in argon and air
   is due to the transformation of the Al-Si metallic surface into the
   Al7Fe2Si intermetallic surface and an increase in surface roughness.
   Through the second step heating at 900 degrees C, the progressive
   decrease of spectral emissivity with soak time in argon is caused by the
   surface phase transformation from Al5Fe2 into AlFe with a decrease in
   surface roughness. In contrast, surface oxidization with an increase in
   surface roughness significantly increases the spectral emissivity after
   two minutes soaking in air. Linear relationships between the spectral
   emissivity at 15 mu m and surface roughness are established for the
   aluminum metallic surface and the Al-Fe-Si intermetallic surface, and
   the latter result demonstrates a strong dependency of spectral
   emissivity on surface roughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   with application to chemical kinetics}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Sequential Bayesian Monte Carlo Model Discrimination (SBMCMD) framework
   has been previously proposed by the authors for the purpose of
   determining the underlying mechanisms of a system such as a chemical
   reaction (Masoumi et al., 2013). SBMCMD relies on sampling from the
   model parameters distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC,
   methods. Effective tuning of MCMC methods, when applying to some
   nonlinear models, can be tedious and challenging. This limits using
   SBMCMD in many practical applications. The aim of this paper is to
   address this limitation and facilitate exploiting of the proposed
   framework with regards to nonlinear structured models. This is achieved
   by using adaptive random-walk Metropolis-Hasting method for sampling
   from the models parameter. This method is an adaptive MCMC algorithm
   that takes care of adjusting its parameters automatically.
   Two implementations of the adaptive SBMCMD framework have been presented
   and applied to case studies. Results of two implementations have been
   compared, and the effect of preliminary data has been discussed. (C)

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4673-4685}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Color-to-gray (C2G) image conversion is the process of transforming a
   color image into a grayscale one. Despite its wide usage in real-world
   applications, little work has been dedicated to compare the performance
   of C2G conversion algorithms. Subjective evaluation is reliable but is
   also inconvenient and time consuming. Here, we make one of the first
   attempts to develop an objective quality model that automatically
   predicts the perceived quality of C2G converted images. Inspired by the
   philosophy of the structural similarity index, we propose a C2G
   structural similarity (C2G-SSIM) index, which evaluates the luminance,
   contrast, and structure similarities between the reference color image
   and the C2G converted image. The three components are then combined
   depending on image type to yield an overall quality measure.
   Experimental results show that the proposed C2G-SSIM index has close
   agreement with subjective rankings and significantly outperforms
   existing objective quality metrics for C2G conversion. To explore the
   potentials of C2G-SSIM, we further demonstrate its use in two
   applications: 1) automatic parameter tuning for C2G conversion
   algorithms and 2) adaptive fusion of C2G converted images.}},

Abstract = {{Two welding consumables suitable for joining X80 linepipe steel are
   compared in terms of weld metal microstructures, hardness, impact
   toughness, and tensile properties. The chemical compositions of the
   consumables were similar, where one of the consumables had a rich wire
   chemistry containing higher C, Ni, Ti alloying additions compared to a
   lean one. Beads on plate welding were performed using the gas metal arc
   welding (GMAW) process set to achieve the same heat input of 0.66 kJ/mm.
   The results revealed that for both wires the weld metal microstructure
   was mainly consist of acicular ferrite. The consumable with richer
   chemistry (C, Ni and Ti) exhibited higher strength and hardness due to
   its finer final weld metal microstructure; however, Charpy impact tests
   results revealed the lean chemistry wire had higher toughness at low
   temperature. Since both weld metals exhibited similar acicular ferrite
   structures, the lower toughness of the richer chemistry weld was
   attributed to the presence of titanium inclusions which may provide
   crack initiation sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum key distribution (QKD) has the potential to improve
   communications security by offering cryptographic keys whose security
   relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics. The use of a
   trusted quantum receiver on an orbiting satellite is the most practical
   near-term solution to the challenge of achieving long-distance
   (global-scale) QKD, currently limited to a few hundred kilometers on the
   ground. This scenario presents unique challenges, such as high photon
   losses and restricted classical data transmission and processing power
   due to the limitations of a typical satellite platform. Here we
   demonstrate the feasibility of such a system by implementing a QKD
   protocol, with optical transmission and full post-processing, in the
   high-loss regime using minimized computing hardware at the receiver.
   Employing weak coherent pulses with decoy states, we demonstrate the
   production of secure key bits at up to 56.5 dB of photon loss. We
   further illustrate the feasibility of a satellite uplink by generating a
   secure key while experimentally emulating the varying losses predicted
   for realistic low-Earth-orbit satellite passes at 600 km altitude. With
   a 76 MHz source and including finite-size analysis, we extract 3374 bits
   of a secure key from the best pass. We also illustrate the potential
   benefit of combining multiple passes together: while one suboptimal
   ``upper-quartile{''} pass produces no finite-sized key with our source,
   the combination of three such passes allows us to extract 165 bits of a
   secure key. Alternatively, we find that by increasing the signal rate to
   300 MHz it would be possible to extract 21 570 bits of a secure
   finite-sized key in just a single upper-quartile pass.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the problem of stability analysis of
   neutral-type neural networks with mixed random time-varying delays.
   Firstly, by using a novel and resultful mathematical approach and
   considering the sufficient information of neuron activation functions,
   improved delay-dependent stability results are formulated in terms of
   linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Secondly, in order to obtain less
   conservative delay-dependent stability criteria, an augmented novel
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that contains triple and
   quadruple-integral terms is constructed. Moreover, our derivation makes
   full use of the idea of second-order convex combination and the property
   of quadratic convex function, which plays a key role in reducing further
   the conservatism of conditions. Finally, four numerical examples are
   presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the
   theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate very efficient and bright quantum dot light-emitting
   devices (QDLEDs) with the use of a phosphorescent sensitizer and a
   thermal annealing step. Utilizing CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots with
   560 nm emission peak, bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinatoN,C2)
   picolinatoiridium as a sensitizer, and thermal annealing at 50 degrees C
   for 30 min, green-emitting QDLEDs with a maximum current efficiency of
   23.9 cd/A, a power efficiency of 31 lm/W, and a brightness of 65 000
   cd/m(2) are demonstrated. The high efficiency and brightness are
   attributed to annealing-induced enhancements in both the Forster
   resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from the phosphorescent energy
   donor to the QD acceptor and hole transport across the device. The FRET
   enhancement is attributed to annealing-induced diffusion of the
   phosphorescent material molecules from the sensitizer layer into the QD
   layer, which results in a shorter donor-acceptor distance. We also find,
   quite interestingly, that FRET to a QD acceptor is strongly influenced
   by the QD size, and is generally less efficient to QDs with larger sizes
   despite their narrower bandgaps.}},

Abstract = {{Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute of many therapeutic
   proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Nucleotide-sugar
   precursors supplemented to growth medium to affect the substrate supply
   chain of glycosylation has yielded promising but varied results for
   affecting glycosylation. Glucosamine (GlcN), a precursor for
   N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), is a major component of mammalian glycans.
   The supplementation of GlcN to CHO cells stably-expressing a chimeric
   heavy-chain monoclonal antibody, EG2-hFc, reduces the complexity of
   glycans to favour G0 glycoforms, while also negatively impacting cell
   growth. Although several researchers have examined the supplementation
   of glucosamine, no clear explanation of its impact on cell growth has
   been forthcoming. In this work, the glucosamine metabolism is examined.
   We identified the acetylation of GlcN to produce GlcNAc to be the most
   likely cause for the negative impact on growth due to the depletion of
   intracellular acetyl-CoA pools in the cytosol. By supplementing GlcNAc
   in lieu of GlcN to CHO cells producing EG2-hFc, we achieve the same
   shift in glycan complexity with marginal impacts on the cell growth and
   protein production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon capture has been recognized as an attractive alternative to
   reduce CO2 emissions. The most feasible technology that can be developed
   at a commercial-scale in a short-term period is CO2 capture by
   absorption since it is an end-pipe technology that can be installed in
   existing coal-based power plants and will not require retrofit of the
   power plant. The most studied CO2 capture process is absorption using
   monoethanolamine (MEA) and represents the benchmark solvent because of
   the favorable properties it has shown such as fast kinetics, high
   absorption capacity, good solubility in water, and low price. On the
   other hand, this solvent is susceptible to thermal and chemical
   degradation, and it is also corrosive. Nevertheless, the main drawback
   of this solvent is the energy consumption needed for solvent recovery
   (almost >90\% of the plants operating cost). Ionic liquids (IL) are new
   alternative solvents for CO2 capture. Experimental results have shown
   that IL feature chemical and thermal stability, and good CO2 absorption
   capacity. In this work, a theoretical IL is used as physical solvent for
   developing a new flow-sheet of a CO2 capture plant. A techno-economic
   analysis was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed
   design. The results show that the IL-based plant features lower energy
   demand compared to a traditional MEA-based plant. Moreover, the dynamic
   analysis performed in this study provides insight on the degree of
   nonlinearity and the dynamics of the process, which are essential tools
   to design suitable control schemes. The results show that the plant can
   accommodate perturbations in the flue gas flow rate up to +/- 10\% while
   meeting CO2 recovery and purity targets.}},

Title = {{Efficient method for probabilistic finite element analysis with
   application to reinforced concrete slabs}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{85-101}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, probabilistic finite element analysis (FEA) is applied
   using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and the multiplicative
   dimensional reduction method (M-DRM). M-DRM is proposed for stochastic
   PEA of large scale and/or complex problems, as it provides the
   probability distribution of the structural response, apart the
   statistical moments, and requires fairly small computational time. MCS
   and M-DRM results are compared, indicating that both are in a good
   agreement. In addition, sensitivity analysis is also performed using the
   M-DRM, which does not require any extra analytical effort. The
   probabilistic FEA is applied with the use of the ABAQUS software, where
   the development of the PEA model and the updating of each input random
   variable for the required simulations, are both implemented with the use
   of the Python programing language. Two previously tested reinforced
   concrete flat slabs, with and without shear reinforcement, are examined.
   The concrete damaged plasticity model is used for the modeling of the
   concrete, which is offered in ABAQUS. The results of the deterministic
   FEA simulation show reasonable response compared to the behavior of the
   test specimens in terms of ultimate load, deflection and cracking
   propagation. For the probabilistic analysis, only the material
   uncertainty is taken into account, in order to examine the accuracy and
   efficiency of the proposed M-DRM framework and the contribution of the
   material uncertainty to the output response. Finally, design codes (ACI
   318-11 and EC2 2004) for punching shear and the critical shear crack
   theory (CSCT 2008, 2009) are examined, considering the same input
   uncertainties. Useful outcomes are presented indicating the predictive
   capability of the proposed probabilistic PEA for future studies. (C)

Abstract = {{Several pi-conjugated compounds based on diketopyrrolopyrrole and
   trithiophene substituted with different end groups (alkyl, alkyloxy, and
   alkylthio) were designed and synthesized for investigation of the
   material properties and photodetector performance brought by subtle
   changes in the end groups. Among all, compound 4 with hexylthio groups
   exhibits the most red-shifted absorption, strongest molecular stacking,
   highest mobility, and ideal film morphology. These unique properties
   make it a promising material for use in small-molecule photodetectors.
   Photodetector SMPD-4 based on compound 4 exhibits broad response from
   300 to 900 nm and a high specific detectivity (D{*}) of 1.3 x 10(13)
   Jones at 650 nm under -0.1 V. This result is among the best values
   reported for solution-processed small-molecule photodetectors and even
   in the same order of conventional silicon photodetector. The molecular
   structure-material property-device performance relationships are
   established with these compounds. This work suggests that end-group

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxides loaded with tin antimony alloy (RGO-SnSb)
   nanocomposites were synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction and the
   subsequent thermal reduction treatments. Transmission electron
   microscope images confirm that SnSb nanoparticles with an average size
   of about 20-30 run are uniformly dispersed on the RGO surfaces. When
   they were used as anodes for rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries,
   these as-synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposite anodes delivered a high
   initial reversible capacity of 407 mAh g(-1), stable cyclic retention
   for more than 80 cycles and excellent cycle stability at ultra high
   charge/discharge rates up to 30C. The significantly improved performance
   of the synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposites as Na-ion battery anodes can
   be attributed to the synergetic effects of RGO based flexible framework
   and the nanoscale dimension of the SnSb alloy particles (<30 nm).
   Nanosized intermetallic SnSb compounds can exhibit improved structural
   stability and conductivity during charge and discharge reactions
   compared to the corresponding individuals (Sn and Sb particles). In the
   meantime, RGO sheets can tightly anchor SnSb alloy particles on the
   surfaces, which can not only effectively suppress the agglomeration of
   SnSb particles but also maintain excellent electronic conduction.
   Furthermore, the mechanical flexibility of the RGO phase can accommodate
   the volume expansion and contraction of SnSb particles during the
   prolonged cycling, therefore, improve the electrode integrity
   mechanically and electronically. All of these contribute to the
   electrochemical performance improvements of the RGO-SnSb
   nanocomposite-based electrodes in rechargeable Na-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Metal carbonyl homopolymers (PFpPs) are hydrophobic but able to
   self-assemble in water into uniform and stable colloids. Hydrodynamic
   radius (R-h) of the colloids varies from 42 to 77 nm depending on
   preparation conditions. Light scattering, TEM, and AFM analyses of the
   colloids indicate that the colloids have a vesicular morphology with
   membrane thickness of ca. 3.0-4.0 nm. This thin membrane is, however,
   relatively rigid compared to conventional polymersomes. FT-IR and NMR
   analyses indicate that water-carbonyl interactions (WCI) is a motif
   responsible for the self-assembly and colloidal stability. By using
   nanoprecipitation encapsulation technique, PFpP vesicles can enclose
   hydrophilic molecules with extremely high encapsulation efficiency (EE)
   and loading capacity (LC). This work opens up a new research topic on
   hydration driven self-assembly and resolves a long-standing challenge of
   low EE and LC for the encapsulation of hydrophilic molecule via
   nanoprecipitation using amphiphilic molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Biomechanical-based deformable image registration is conducted on the
   head and neck region. Patient specific 3D finite element models
   consisting of parotid glands (PG), submandibular glands (SG), tumor,
   vertebrae (VB), mandible, and external body are used to register
   pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MR images to model the dose response
   using image data of five patients. The images are registered using
   combinations of vertebrae and mandible alignments, and surface
   projection of the external body as boundary conditions. In addition, the
   dose response is simulated by applying a new loading technique in the
   form of a dose-induced shrinkage using the dose-volume relationship. The
   dose-induced load is applied as dose-induced shrinkage of the tumor and
   four salivary glands. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) is
   calculated for the four salivary glands, and tumor to calculate the
   volume overlap of the structures after deformable registration. A
   substantial improvement in the registration is found by including the
   dose-induced shrinkage. The greatest registration improvement is found
   in the four glands where the average DSC increases from 0.53, 0.55,
   0.32, and 0.37 to 0.68, 0.68, 0.51, and 0.49 in the left PG, right PG,

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Fabrication of nanoscale and microscale machines and devices is one of
   the goals of nanotechnology. For this purpose, different materials,
   methods, and devices should be developed. Among them, various types of
   miniaturized sensors are required to build the nanoscale and microscale
   systems. In this research, we introduce a new nanoscale sensing
   material, silver nanosheets, for applications such as nanoscale and
   microscale gas flow sensors. The silver nanosheets were synthesized
   through the reduction of silver ions by ascorbic acid in the presence of
   poly(methacrylic acid) as a capping agent, followed by the growth of
   silver in the shape of hexagonal and triangular nanoplates, and
   self-assembly and nanojoining of these structural blocks. At the end of
   this process, the synthesized nanosheets were floated on the solution.
   Then, their electrical and thermal stability was demonstrated at 120
   degrees C, and their atmospheric corrosion resistance was clarified at
   the same temperature range by thermogravimetric analysis. We employed
   the silver nanosheets in fabricating airflow sensors by scooping out the
   nanosheets by means of a sensor substrate, drying them at room
   temperature, and then annealing them at 300 degrees C for one hour. The
   fabricated sensors were tested for their ability to measure airflow in
   the range of 1 to 5 ml min(-1), which resulted in a linear response to
   the airflow with a response and recovery time around 2 s. Moreover,
   continuous dynamic testing demonstrated that the response of the sensors
   was stable and hence the sensors can be used for a long time without
   detectable drift in their response.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the concentration and removal of mercury (II) from
   wastewater by polymer-enhanced ultrafiltration (PEUF) using
   polyvinylamine as the mercury-binding polymer. A mercury removal as high
   as 99\% was obtained, which was otherwise impossible to achieve with
   conventional ultrafiltration. Over the feed mercury concentration range
   tested (0-50 ppm), the PVAm dosage used did not affect the mercury
   rejection considerably, while water flux was reduced significantly at a
   higher dosage of PVAm. A flux vs pressure relationship typical of
   ultrafiltration of macromolecular solutes was observed because of the
   amine polymer used to bind mercury, and the limiting flux appeared to
   follow the gel layer formation model. The fouled membrane surface was
   cleaned periodically with dilute hydrochloric acid to recover the
   membrane permeability. Mercury removal with the PEUF was also tested
   with a simulated chlor-alkali wastewater that contained mercury and
   other chemicals (i.e., sodium chloride and sulfate), and the
   accompanying compounds in the feed solution were shown to influence the
   performance of PEUF for mercury removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{N doped graphenes (NGs) are believed to be promising materials for
   constructing novel hybrid composites with desirable functionalities and
   applications in many fields. Therefore, a better understanding of the
   NGs holds the key to a better performance of the hybrid properties. A
   facile and low-cost preparation of NGs supported hollow PdCu alloy
   nanocubes (H-PdCu) catalysts were introduced in this paper. To increase
   the stability and efficiency of the catalysts, a two-step strategy was
   employed, which included the preparation of NGs and the synthesis of
   hollow PdCu alloy nanocube catalysts. A series of NGs using melamine,
   polypyrrole (ppy) and polyaniline (PANI) as nitrogen source,
   respectively. The influence of the different N species (pyridinic N,
   pyrrolic N and graphite N) on the morphologies and corresponding
   electrical properties of H-PdCu nanoparticles were studied. The results
   indicate that NGs are successfully synthesized, and hollow PdCu alloy
   nanocubes are well-dispersed on the surface of them with a relatively
   narrow particle size distribution. Electrochemical characterizations
   reveal that the H-PdCu/melamine-NG catalyst has excellent catalytic
   activity and stability toward alcohols oxidation in alkaline
   electrolyte, which can serve as promising anode catalysts in direct
   alcohols fuel cells (DAFCs). Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{The economics of the microelectronics industries depend on the operating
   policies adopted in the plant. Non-optimal strategies may result in
   undesired plant performance leading to economic loss or environmental
   and safety hazards. Model-plant mismatch, actuator constraints and
   sporadic sensor data can potentially drive the process far from the true
   optimum. The focus of the current work is to address these issues for
   the thin film deposition process. The evolution of the thin film can be
   modeled employing nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)
   embedded with lattice-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to
   describe the multiscale nature of the process. Since the KMC simulations
   are computationally prohibitive for online applications, in this paper,
   a closed-form model is developed based on the data collected from the
   multiscale model. The identified closed-form model can be used for
   online control and optimization applications in the presence of
   model-plant mismatch. The robust performance is quantified by estimates
   of the distribution of the controlled variables employing power series
   expansion (PSE) under model parameter uncertainty. Uncertainties are
   accounted for in one parameter of the KMC model and in the control
   actions. To show the applicability of the identified model, the model is
   embedded within a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework to
   predict estimates of the control actions that comply with the process
   control objectives. The shrinking horizon NMPC algorithm is adopted to
   minimize the roughness of the thin film while satisfying the constraints
   on the applied substrate temperature at each time interval and film
   thickness at the end of the deposition process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Experimental Validation of a Mechanistic Multibody Model of a Vertical
   Piano Action}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The validity and accuracy of a high-fidelity mechanistic multibody model
   of a vertical piano action mechanism is examined experimentally and
   through simulation. An overview of the theoretical and computational
   framework of this previously presented model is given first. A
   dynamically realistic benchtop prototype mechanism was constructed and
   driven by a mechanical actuator pressing the key. For simulations, a
   parameterization based on geometric and dynamic component properties and
   configuration is used; initial conditions are established by a virtual
   regulation that mimics a piano technician's procedure. The motion of
   each component is obtained experimentally by high-speed imaging and
   automated tracking. Simulated response is shown to accurately represent
   that of the real action for two different (pressed) key inputs using a
   single fixed parameterization. Various specialized model features are
   separately evaluated. Proper simulated dynamic behavior supports the
   accuracy of the friction representation; this is especially so for
   softer key inputs which demand a more actively controlled playing
   technique. The accuracy of the contact model is confirmed by the proper
   timing and function of the mechanism, as the relationship between
   components is strongly dependent on the state of compression of the
   interface between them. The value of including three flexible components
   is weighed against their significant computational cost. Compared to a
   rigid fixed ground point target, hammer impact on a compliant string
   reduces impact force, contact duration, and postimpact hammer velocity
   to improve accuracy. Flexibility of the back-check wire and hammer shank
   also strongly affects postimpact behavior of the mechanism. The
   sophisticated balance pivot model is seen to be valuable in creating a
   realistic key response, with compression of felt balance punching and
   lift-off of the key, very important for achieving the proper key-hammer
   relationship. Finally, two components unique to the vertical
   mechanism-the bridle strap and butt spring-are shown to be essential in
   controlling the hammer for detached key inputs, where the key is
   released before it has reached the front punching. Accurate postimpact
   response is important for proper simulation of repeated notes, as well
   as the ``feel{''} of the action. In general, the results reported can be
   considered as a validation of the method for constructing and
   parameterizing a dynamically accurate multibody model of a specific
   prototype mechanism or system including compliant contacts and
   flexibility of some components, as well as ad hoc components to cover
   unusual dynamic behavior.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multicore processors are being extensively used by real-time systems,
   mainly because of their demand for increased computing power. However,
   multicore processors have shared resources that affect the
   predictability of real-time systems, which is the key to correctly
   estimate the worst-case execution time of tasks. One of the main factors
   for unpredictability in a multicore processor is the cache memory
   hierarchy. Recently, many research works have proposed different
   techniques to deal with caches in multicore processors in the context of
   real-time systems. Nevertheless, a review and categorization of these
   techniques is still an open topic and would be very useful for the
   real-time community. In this article, we present a survey of cache
   management techniques for real-time embedded systems, from the first
   studies of the field in 1990 up to the latest research published in
   2014. We categorize the main research works and provide a detailed
   comparison in terms of similarities and differences. We also identify
   key challenges and discuss future research directions.}},

Title = {{Ventral striatal gamma oscillations are highly variable from trial to

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The human and rodent ventral striatal local field potentials show
   striking oscillations in the gamma band (similar to 40-100 Hz), which
   have been linked to aspects of behaviour such as reward anticipation and
   delivery, movement initiation, learning from feedback, and
   decision-making. These oscillations show a rich temporal organization,
   whose relationship with behavioural variables is not well understood.
   Here, we show that, in rats performing a conditioned approach task,
   low-gamma and high-gamma oscillations during an immobile reward
   anticipation epoch were largely insensitive to outcome value, even
   though rats distinguished behaviourally between different outcomes, and
   single units encoded outcome value. Behaviour was highly stereotyped,
   yet we observed large variability from trial to trial in the occurrence
   and timing of these oscillations. Furthermore, higher-order features
   such as high-gamma power leading low-gamma power, and phase-amplitude
   coupling to lower-frequency bands, were only marginally modulated by
   outcome value. Moreover, these patterns closely resembled those found
   during off-task rest periods in which no rewards could be earned. These
   observations suggest a new interpretation of ventral striatal gamma
   oscillations as reflecting a default or resting state, with only minor
   and highly variable modulation by specific task-related variables.}},

Title = {{The role of geometric characterization in supporting structural steel
   reuse decisions}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{120-130}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reuse of structural steel can be more attractive than recycling in many
   cases, if associated costs and risks are lowered, and if externalities
   are considered. Geometric characterization is demonstrated in this
   article to have a key role to play in the decision process for each case
   of potential steel reuse, because it is necessary for identifying
   unknown in situ member sizes and assembly geometries, and for
   quantifying uncertainty when assessing the reliability of a structure.
   Without automation of this analysis, it is speculated that such a
   detailed decision making process would not be feasible. The key role of
   geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article through a
   series of remote, 3D imaging experiments and reliability analyses. The
   reliability analysis demonstrated that automated geometric
   identification using an algorithm developed for the current study
   results in a 56\% reduction in capacity when compared to similar new
   steel members. Alternatively, more manual methods of remote geometry
   detection resulted in only a 2\% reduction in capacity. It is concluded
   that semi-automated geometric characterization has the potential to
   support increased steel reuse through reduced identification costs and
   improved reliability. A new set of methods and an understanding of their
   utility in making reuse more attractive through reduced costs and
   improved reliability is thus contributed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This research reports an improved conjugation process for immobilization
   of antibodies on carboxyl ended self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The
   kinetics of antibody/SAM binding in microfluidic heterogeneous
   immunoassays has been studied through numerical simulation and
   experiments. Through numerical simulations, the mass transport of
   reacting species, namely, antibodies and crosslinking reagent, is
   related to the available surface concentration of carboxyl ended SAMs in
   a microchannel. In the bulk flow, the mass transport equation (diffusion
   and convection) is coupled to the surface reaction between the
   antibodies and SAM. The model developed is employed to study the effect
   of the flow rate, conjugating reagents concentration, and height of the
   microchannel. Dimensionless groups, such as the Damkohler number, are
   used to compare the reaction and fluidic phenomena present and justify
   the kinetic trends observed. Based on the model predictions, the
   conventional conjugation protocol is modified to increase the yield of
   conjugation reaction. A quartz crystal microbalance device is
   implemented to examine the resulting surface density of antibodies. As a
   result, an increase in surface density from 321 ng/cm(2), in the
   conventional protocol, to 617 ng/cm(2) in the modified protocol is
   observed, which is quite promising for (bio-) sensing applications. (C)

   with semi-empirical correlations}},
Journal = {{FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{130-141}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Experimental measurements of flame drag, flame tilt and flame length,
   which were obtained for 2 m diameter Jet A fires in crosswinds of 3-10
   m/s and described in Part I of this paper, were compared to values
   predicted using published semi-empirical correlations. Results were
   shown to be influenced in part by differences in the method used to
   measure flame geometry and in the boundary conditions between different
   experiments. Flame tilt values were predicted most successfully by
   correlations involving a combination of the Froude number U-2/gD and the
   non-dimensionalized heat release rate Q{*}. Values estimated using
   similar correlations for flame drag and flame length were less
   successful, indicating gaps in the relevant physics modeled by those
   correlations. Fuel vapor density played an important role in determining
   the extent of flame drag. At high wind speeds, the horizontal momentum
   of the wind dominated over buoyancy effects in producing flame drag,
   physical effects not necessarily captured in the existing correlations.
   Flame length appeared to be governed by factors such as fuel vapor
   density and heat of combustion of the fuel, as well as wind speed and
   fuel burning rate. The restriction in air entrainment under conditions
   of large flame drag greatly increased flame length, particularly at high
   wind speeds, and should also be considered in future correlations. (C)

Abstract = {{A new plasmonic waveguide for deep-subwavelength field localization at
   the terahertz (THz) range of frequency is proposed. GaAs with optimum
   doping level is used as the plasmonic material. The waveguide structure
   is a narrow slot in a thin GaAs film on top of the quartz substrate. The
   waveguide characteristics are analyzed, and its dimensions are optimized
   to minimize the losses. It is shown that the mode size of the proposed
   waveguide is less than lambda/16 by lambda/16. The proposed plasmonic
   waveguide can be a platform for numerous THz plasmonic-based integrated
   devices, such as integrated sensors and imagers. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the information theoretic performance of
   parallel relaying in free-space optical (FSO) communications over
   Gamma-Gamma fading channels. We consider an intensity
   modulation/direct-detection (IM/DD) FSO system with a single relay and a
   line-of-sight link between the source and the destination. Considering
   both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying, we develop
   performance characterizations of each relaying mode in terms of outage
   probability, diversity gain, coding gain, and diversity-multiplexing
   tradeoff (DMT). Our results demonstrate that parallel relaying improves
   the performance of FSO systems by bringing diversity advantages. In
   addition, both relaying modes achieve the same DMT and diversity gain
   while their coding gains can be different depending on underlying
   channels' characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of lossy joint source-channel coding in a
   single-user energy harvesting communication system with causal energy
   arrivals and the energy storage unit may have leakage. In particular, we
   investigate the achievable distortion in the transmission of a single
   source via an energy harvesting transmitter over a point-to-point
   channel. We consider an adaptive joint source-channel coding system,
   where the length of channel codewords varies based on the available
   battery charge. We first establish a lower bound on the achievable
   distortion. Then, as necessary conditions for local optimality, we
   obtain two coupled equations that determine the mismatch ratio between
   channel symbols and source symbols as well as the transmission power,
   both as functions of the battery charge. As examples of continuous and
   discrete sources, we consider Gaussian and binary sources respectively.
   For the Gaussian case, we obtain a closed-form expression for the
   mismatch factor in terms of the LambertW function, and show that an
   increasing transmission power policy results in a decreasing mismatch
   factor policy and vice versa. Finally, we numerically compare the
   performance of the adaptive mismatch factor scheme to the case of a
   constant mismatch factor.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a detailed mathematical analysis of the impact of
   integer time offsets on the performance of OFDM systems. Although a
   number of approximate expressions for the probability of error in OFDM
   systems with integer time offset can be found in the literature, to the
   best of our knowledge, this work is the first that provides exact
   expressions. In particular, we derive exact closed-form expressions for
   the bit error rate (BER) and the symbol error rate (SER) of BPSK, QPSK,
   and 16-QAM modulation for transmission over both AWGN and Rayleigh
   fading channels. The effect of the fractional carrier frequency offset
   (CFO) is taken into consideration in the derivations. This makes the
   derived expressions more useful in evaluating the probability of error
   for OFDM systems with CFO only, especially in cases like 16-QAM
   modulation for transmission over Rayleigh fading channels where exact
   closed-form expressions are not available. For OFDM systems with a large
   number of subcarriers, an approximate method for evaluating the BER/SER
   is given. Finally, numerical results are included to demonstrate the
   exactness of the derived expressions and the accuracy of the approximate
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The water-LiBr absorption machine was analyzed with the purpose of
   identifying the endogenous, exogenous, avoidable and unavoidable
   fractions of the exergy destruction. The latter was observed to be
   largely of endogenous nature, with the desorber and absorber being the
   major contributors. When the difference between the absorption and
   condensation temperatures was raised, both the first and second law
   efficiencies degraded. Furthermore, the absorber endogenous avoidable
   irreversibility was much larger than that at the desorber when the
   absorption temperature was lower than the condensation temperature, and
   the situation reversed when the absorption temperature became higher
   than the condensation temperature. The same trends were observed in
   terms of the exogenous avoidable exergy destruction. However, the
   endogenous unavoidable exergy destruction at the absorber was initially
   smaller than that at the desorber, and the two components equally
   contributed to the total endogenous unavoidable irreversibility when the
   absorption temperature became higher than the condensation temperature.

Abstract = {{Two microstructure defects formed in the twin roll cast AZ31 strips were
   investigated: inverse and centreline segregations. A two-dimensional
   finite element thermal-fluid-stress model was employed to study the
   thermomechanical response of the AZ31 strip during twin roll casting
   process. The results showed that the key parameter for centreline
   segregation is the mushy zone thickness at centreline. For inverse
   segregation, the interaction between the yy peak stress at the
   centreline in the mushy zone and the solidified shell on the roll
   surface is the determinant parameter. The modelling results suggested
   increasing the setback distance decreases the risk of both defects.
   Moreover, scaling up the caster reduces the propensity to inverse
   segregation but appears to have a minor effect for centreline
   segregation formation.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{In electron beam lithography, poor resist adhesion to a substrate may
   lead to resist structure detachment upon development. One popular method
   to promote resist adhesion is to modify the substrate surface. In this
   study, the authors will show that a
   poly(methylmethacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) {[}P(MMA-co-MAA)] monolayer
   ``brush{''} can be grafted onto a silicon substrate using thermal
   annealing that leads to chemical bonding of the P(MMA-co-MAA) copolymer
   to the hydroxyl group-terminated substrate, followed by acetic acid wash
   to remove the bulk, unbonded copolymer. The monolayer brush has a
   thickness of 12 nm. The authors will show that it can greatly improve
   the adhesion of positive resist, the ZEP-520A, and negative resist
   polystyrene to bare silicon surfaces, which led to high resolution
   patterning without resist detachment upon development. The improvement
   was more dramatic when patterning dense sub-100nm period grating
   structures. But the improvement was negligible for an aluminum
   substrate, because, even without the brush layer, resist adhesion to
   aluminum is found already to be strong enough to prevent resist
   structure peeling off. The current simple and low cost method could be
   very useful when resist adhesion to the substrate for a given developer
   is weak. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{In order to develop functional nanostructures with controllable size,
   composition, morphology, and interface, a series of dopamine (DA)
   modified polypyrrole (PPy) nanostructures that have tunable electrical
   conductivity and improved water dispersibility are prepared. The DA-PPy
   nanostructures exhibit various morphologies, including nanosphere,
   nanofiber, nanorod, and nanoflake; and all of these nanostructures can
   be achieved by simply varying the DA/Py reacting mole ratio.
   Furthermore, the potential application of each as-fabricated DA-PPy,
   which depend on their tunable electrical properties, are explored. In
   particular, DA-PPy resulting from a 0.032 dopamine/pyrrole(DA/Py) mole
   ratio demonstrate superior capacitance for supercapacitors; at DA/Py =
   0.064, DA-PPy can be implemented as a co-filler into the epoxy network
   to prepare hybrid electrically conductive adhesives and DA-PPy
   synthesized from 0.64 DA/Py mole ratio reveals impressive
   electromagnetic microwave absorption ability that can be used for
   electromagnetic interference shielding applications. Due to the
   synergetic effects of DA and electrically conductive polymer PPy, this
   one-step procedure represents a promising protocol to control the
   syntheses and properties of nanomaterials for applications in advanced
   electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Usage of reduced order models (ROMs) and reactor networks are becoming
   widely accepted tools for the modeling of complex reactors, such as
   entrained-flow gasifiers. The approximations made in a ROM reduce the
   required computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamic
   (CFD) models; however; the capabilities of the model in predicting the
   outputs for a range of operating conditions in the gasification unit
   face challenges. The following contribution presents a comparison
   between a ROM and the corresponding CFD model of a short-residence-time
   gasifier under different operating conditions and kinetic parameters.
   Although the framework of the proposed ROM was fixed and developed on
   the basis of CFD simulations generated at a base-case condition, the
   results showed reasonable agreement between the two models in predicting
   syngas composition, carbon conversion, and temperature profile in the
   gasification system. Sensitivity analysis of the inputs of the ROM
   (including test condition and reactor network parameters) has also been
   performed. This analysis has shown that the recirculation ratio and
   oxygen flow rate have a greater effect on the outputs compared to model
   geometry and kinetic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated combining pretreatment of waste activated sludge
   with anaerobic digestion in a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor.
   Preliminary tests revealed that a hydrogen peroxide and ultrasound
   pretreatment resulted in a chemical oxygen demand solubilization of 40\%
   when a dose of 50 gH(2)O(2)/kgTS and sonication for 60 min were
   employed. Raw and pretreated waste activated sludge were fed to an
   anaerobic membrane bioreactor to determine if this increase in
   solubilization affected the biodegradability of the sludge. It was
   observed that pretreatment increased the extent to which the sludge was
   digested and hence it was concluded that the combined action of
   ultrasound and peroxide increased the biodegradable fraction of the
   sludge, while reducing the bioreactor and waste stream solids
   concentration. At a constant flux of 2.75 L/m(2)/hour, the transmembrane
   pressure and the fouling rate remained low and relatively constant over
   the course of operation, despite reduced mass flow of solids. The
   performance of the membrane was attributed to the fouling minimizing
   protocol that consisted of regular maintenance cleaning, a relaxed mode
   of operation, and continuous gas sparging. (c) 2015 American Institute

Abstract = {{The microbiological shelf life of carbonated beer can be extended after
   being processed by pulsed electric fields (PEFs). Being a nonthermal
   preservation method, the freshlike taste and the original nutritional
   value are better retained than with conventional thermal pasteurization
   (TP). Brewery regulations in Canada do not necessitate the TP of
   carbonated beer; hence, PEF processing finds a potential application in
   the beer industry. This paper investigates the applicability of the PEF
   processing to carbonated beer, particularly through a sealed and
   pressurized processing chamber. However, due to the inevitable flow of
   current during the PEF processing, metal ions will be released from the
   electrodes. The presence of these ions in PEF-processed beer accelerates
   its aging and may affect the organoleptic stability. Hence, we further
   evaluate the metal ions released during the PEF processing and their
   consequent effect, if any, on the taste and the shelf life. It has been
   found that the released amounts of iron ions are observed to be within
   the acceptable levels for consumable liquid foods. Untrained
   participants from the public preferred the PEF-processed beer when
   compared with thermally pasteurized beer. Trained panelists reported a
   metallic feeling in the PEF-processed beer corresponding to the presence
   of metal ions that was detected analytically.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical-assisted waterflooding is injection of specialty chemical(s)
   along with water to enhance the productivity through a series of
   mechanisms. There are several mechanisms responsible for increased
   ultimate recovery of such a process compared to the traditional
   waterflooding process including in-situ emulsification of oil,
   conformance control and treatment of adverse mobility ratio, reduction
   of Interfacial Tension (IFT) between the in-situ oil and the injecting
   phase, and wettability modification to facilitate recovery of oil by
   enhanced relative permeability values. Although chemical-assisted
   waterflooding has been applied since the early 20th century, it has not
   been until recently that applicability of this process has been tested
   for recovery of heavy oil using preliminary macro-scale as well as
   pore-scale studies. A new chemical technology (i.e. IPC Technology as
   referred in this paper) has been developed. A proprietary mixture of
   surfactants is used in several techniques associated with surface
   extraction as well as in-situ recovery of heavy oil and bitumen. This
   formulation of solvents and surfactants is reusable, low foaming,
   non-flammable, not acutely toxic and non-carcinogenic. A systematic
   study, based on a series of coreflood tests, was designed and conducted
   to assess efficacy of IPC in the ultimate recovery of different types of
   oils by use of IPC-assisted waterflooding. Effects of IPC on IFT between
   oil and IPC solutions at different brine salinities/hardnesses and IPC
   concentrations were determined. Compatibility of IPC with different
   brine hardnesses and salinities was determined. IPC technology was
   particularly effective in recovering heavy oil. The performance of IPC
   as an additive during waterflood at elevated temperature for recovery of
   heavy oil was also investigated. For this particular purpose, thermal
   stability tests were conducted to determine the threshold temperature
   below which the formulation is thermally stable. When production
   performance of IPC-assisted waterflood was compared with alkali flooding
   and a commercial surfactant, IPC gave superior ultimate recovery. (C)

Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{660-670}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we evaluate the poroelastic stress modifications induced
   surrounding a fully-penetrating vertical injection well in a porous
   layer confined with impermeable seal rocks. The objective is to attain a
   better insight of fracture initiation during injection operations.
   Various stress regimes are assessed, incorporating the stiffness of the
   surrounding rocks. To facilitate analytical description of a fully
   coupled behavior within the reservoir, the stiffness of surrounding
   rocks is described by Winkler model simplifying the response of the seal
   rocks in the direction perpendicular to the reservoir plane. A
   comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the
   qualitative effects of rock-fluid characteristic parameters on the
   behavior of the reservoir formation near the wellbore. Results offer a
   novel insight into geomechanics of injection, providing information on
   fracture planes induced in various stress fields.
   The poroelastic response of a confined porous layer is found to be
   independent of seal rock stiffness in lower permeabilities (<0.05
   Darcy). However, in unconsolidated hydrocarbon reservoirs where
   permeability is typically higher, seal rock stiffness is proven to have
   a notable impact on the near-wellbore geomechanical response during
   injection. It is the ratio of the overburden stiffness parameter to
   reservoir's bulk modulus that dictates the geomechanical response of the
   injection layer: once the ratio approaches unity, practically no shear
   stress is induced; for ratios exceeding unity, deviatoric stresses
   gradually increase; and in case of ratios bellow unity, reservoir
   formation can behave in a complicated manner depending on the initial
   stress regime, where reorientation of the minimum principal stress
   occurs from horizontal to vertical plane. Fracture reorientation is
   concluded to be a result of an increase in reservoir's bulk modulus
   during prolonged injection cycles. Sensitivity analyses reveal an
   enhanced state of limiting shear resistance in case of: higher
   anisotropy, higher elastic moduli, lower permeability, and a higher
   degree of soil-fluid coupling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   hours at a temperature of 160 degrees C, and an increase in resistance
   was noted during this time. Of all the composite solders that were
   studied, La2O3 and SiC reinforced SAC solders exhibited the smallest
   resistances after current aging. However, the rate of change in the
   resistance at room temperature was lower for the SiC-reinforced SAC
   solder. The SAC and Graphene reinforced SAC solder bumps completely
   failed within 15 - 20 min of these tests. The SiC nanoparticles were
   reported to possibly entrap the SAC atoms better than other
   nanoparticles with a lower rate of EM.}},

Abstract = {{SAC 305 solder bump with 800 mu m diameter were produced and soldered to
   a custom substrate with Cu lines as leads that allow for resistance
   measurement during current aging. The measured joint resistance values
   (leads plus solder bump) before aging are 7.7 +/- 1.8 m Omega and 11.8
   +/- 2.8 m Omega at room temperature and 160 degrees C, respectively. In
   general, the resistance of the solder joint increases instantly by about
   1 m Omega, when subjected to a 2.2 A aging current at 160 degrees C. The
   increase is gradual in the following hours of aging and more drastic as
   it approaches the final failure. Four stages are identified in the
   resistance signal curve and compared with observations from cross
   sections. The stages are IMC growth, crack formation and propagation,
   intermittent crack healing-forming, and final failure resulting in an
   open connection at the cathode. Recently a periodical drop and rise
   behavior was reported for the resistance signal. This behavior is
   reproduced and attributed to the intermittent crack healing-forming
   stage. The healing events observed are faster than the sampling time.
   Possibly, as current is concentrated when bypassing interfacial cracks,
   local melting occurs partially filling cracks before resolidifying.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a design methodology for multioctave planar
   push-pull power amplifiers (PPPAs) to tackle the challenges associated
   with the integration of planar balanced to unbalanced transformers
   (baluns) with packaged transistors characterized by significant
   parasitics. This methodology relies on carefully selecting the balun's
   placement and adding external matching networks to separately control
   the odd-and even-mode impedances presented to the power amplifier (PA)
   to ensure high-efficiency operation over a broad range of frequencies.
   Proper second harmonic impedances are obtained by placing the balun in
   close proximity to the transistors' terminals and repurposing the
   packaged transistors' leads into a coupled-line with a high coupling
   coefficient. Furthermore, adequate odd-mode terminations are realized
   using broadband matching networks at the unbalanced side of the baluns.
   Following this methodology, an 85-W PPPA was designed using
   off-the-shelf packaged gallium-nitride high electron-mobility
   transistors. The fabricated PA demonstrated drain efficiency and output
   power above 45\% and 46.5 dBm, respectively, over the frequency band
   spanning from 0.45 to 1.95 GHz. Furthermore, the fabricated PA was
   successfully linearized using digital predistortion when driven with
   single-and multi-band modulated signals. Overall, the fabricated PA had
   the best reported power, efficiency, bandwidth, and second harmonic
   rejection combination for a multi-octave PPPA designed with input and
   output baluns using packaged off-the-shelf transistors.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this paper is to provide a statistical
   relationship between traffic conflicts estimated from microsimulation
   and observed crashes in order to evaluate safety performance, in
   particular the effect of countermeasures. A secondary objective is to
   assess the effect of conflict risk tolerance and number of simulation
   runs on the estimates of countermeasure effects so obtained. Conflicts
   were simulated for a sample of signalized intersections from Toronto,
   Canada, using VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation and several
   crash-conflict relationships were obtained. A separate sample of treated
   intersections from Toronto was used to compare countermeasure effects
   from the integrated crash-conflict expression to a conventional, but
   rigorous crash-based Empirical Bayes before-and-after analysis that was
   already done, with the results published, for the same sites and
   treatment. The countermeasure considered for this investigation involved
   changing the left turn signal operation for the treated intersection
   sample from permissive to protected-permissive. The results support the
   view that countermeasure effects can be estimated reliably from
   conflicts derived from microsimulation, and more so when a suitable
   number of simulation runs and conflict tolerance thresholds are used in
   the crash-conflict relationship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wafer probing is a core inspection process to detect defects in a wafer
   prior to packaging. Since probe card requires over a million touchdowns
   on wafers, service life of the probe needle is a critical factor in
   probe card design. For the prediction of service life, fatigue life
   estimation model should be developed first through fatigue testing with
   actual probe needles. However, standard fatigue test method cannot be
   adopted due the complexity in the mounting method and the geometry of
   probe needles. In this paper; a new fatigue test method for vertical
   probe needle with floating mount technology is proposed. By applying the
   method to the fatigue tests with actual probe needles, a stress-lift
   estimation model is developed as a probe card design reference. The

   The first stage decision variables (unit commitment) are determined
   using a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming formulation, whereas
   the second stage variables (optimal power flow) are refined using a
   nonlinear programming formulation. This novel approach was tested on a
   modified CIGRE test system under different configurations comparing the

Abstract = {{Smart grid, as the next generation of power grid characterized by
   ``two-way{''} communications, has been paid great attention to realizing
   green, reliable, and efficient electricity delivery for our future
   lives. In order to support the two-way communications in smart grid, a
   large number of smart meters (SMs) should be deployed to customers to
   report their near real-time data to control center for monitoring
   purpose. However, this kind of real-time report could disclose users'
   privacy, bringing down the users' willingness to participate in smart
   grid. In order to address the challenge, in this paper, by considering
   the lifetime of SMs as exponential distribution, we propose a diverse
   grouping-based aggregation protocol with error detection (DG-APED),
   which employs differential privacy technique into grouping-based private
   stream aggregation for secure smart grid communications. DG-APED can not
   only achieve privacy-preserving aggregation, but also perform error
   detection efficiently when some SMs are malfunctioning. Detailed
   security analysis shows that DG-APED can guarantee the security and
   privacy requirements of smart grid communications. In addition,
   extensive performance evaluation also verifies the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed DG-APED.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Of the numerous types of distributed generators (DGs), synchronous DGs
   represent the most substantial contribution to fault currents and,
   consequently, have the greatest effect on the operation of the
   protection system. On the other hand, many types of DGs require power
   electronic (PE) interfaces at the points where they connect to the grid,
   which are normally left idle during fault conditions. This paper
   presents a novel idea for employing the PE interfaces of inverter-based
   DGs (IBDGs) as a means of managing the fault current contribution of
   synchronous DGs through the modification of the IBDG current phase angle
   during fault conditions. This operation enables synchronous DGs and
   IBDGs to be kept connected to the system during fault conditions but
   with their contribution to the current having no effect on the magnitude
   of the fault current. Constraints related to DG locations and capacities
   are thus relieved. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that
   larger-capacity IBDGs are more effective for managing the fault current
   contribution of synchronous DGs, which means that for systems that
   include synchronous DGs, the availability of more numerous IBDGs would
   be beneficial.}},

Title = {{Generate floor response spectra: Part 1. Direct spectra-to-spectra
   method}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{525-546}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A direct spectra-to-spectra method is developed for generating floor
   response spectra (FRS), which are used as input for seismic design and
   assessment of secondary systems in nuclear facilities. Only ground
   response spectra (GRS) and basic modal information of primary
   structures, including natural frequencies, modal damping, participation
   factors, and mode shapes, which can be readily obtained from a modal
   analysis, are needed. In tuning cases, when equipment is resonant with
   the primary structure, the concept of t-response spectrum (tRS) is
   proposed, and statistical relationships between tRS and GRS developed in
   the companion paper are employed to determine FRS. Furthermore, a new
   modal combination rule (called FRS-CQC), which considers the correlation
   between modal responses of a structure and correlation between responses
   of equipment and its supporting structure, is derived based on random
   vibration theory. Numerical examples of a typical service building in
   nuclear power plants indicate that results from the proposed method
   agree extremely well with the numerically ``exact{''} FRS obtained from
   a large number of sets of time history analyses. It is observed that FRS
   from time history analyses have large variabilities, particularly in
   tuning cases. Numerical examples demonstrate that the modal combination
   rules have a significantly effect on the accuracy of FRS by the direct
   spectra-to-spectra method. The proposed direct spectra-to-spectra
   method, which avoids the deficiencies of time history methods, is of
   excellent accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity; it is convenient to
   implement in practice for generating FRS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},

Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{547-560}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{When generating floor response spectra (FRS) using the direct
   spectra-to-spectra method developed in the companion paper, probability
   distribution oft-response spectrum (tRS), which deals with
   equipment-structure resonance or tuning, corresponding to a specified
   ground response spectrum (GRS) is required.
   In this paper, simulation results using a large number of horizontal and
   vertical ground motions are employed to establish statistical
   relationships between tRS and GRS. It is observed that the influence of
   site conditions on horizontal statistical relationships is negligible,
   whereas the effect of site conditions on vertical statistical
   relationships cannot be ignored. Considering the influence of site
   conditions, horizontal statistical relationship suitable for all site
   conditions and vertical statistical relationships suitable for hard
   sites and soft sites, respectively, are established. The horizontal and
   vertical statistical relationships are suitable to estimate tRS for
   design spectra in USNRC R.G. 1.60 and NUREG/CR-0098, Uniform Hazard
   Spectra (UHS) in Western North America (WNA), or any GRS falling inside
   the valid coverage of the statistical relationship.
   For UHS with significant high frequency spectral accelerations, such as
   UHS in Central and Eastern North America (CENA), an amplification ratio
   method is proposed to estimate tRS.
   Numerical examples demonstrate that the statistical relationships and
   the amplification ratio method are acceptable to estimate tRS for given
   GRS and to generate FRS using the direct method in different practical
   situations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Assimilation of SMOS soil moisture over the Great Lakes basin}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{163-175}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The launch of European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) satellite has opened up the new opportunities for land data
   assimilation. In this work, the one-dimensional version of the Ensemble
   Kalman filter (1D-EnKF) is applied to assimilate SMOS soil moisture
   retrievals (2010-2013) into a land surface-hydrological model,
   Modelisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie (MESH), over the Great
   Lakes basin. A priori rescaling on the retrievals is performed by
   matching their cumulative distribution function (CDF) to the model
   surface soil moisture's CDF. The SMOS retrievals, the open-loop soil
   moisture (no assimilation) and the assimilation estimates are validated
   against point-scale in situ measurements, respectively, in terms of the
   daily time series correlation coefficient (skill R). The skill for SMOS
   retrievals typically decreases with increased canopy density. In
   contrast, the open-loop model typically provides higher soil moisture
   skill R for forest surfaces than for crop surfaces. The skill
   improvement Delta RA-M, defined as the skill for the assimilation soil
   moisture product minus the skill for the open-loop estimates, for both
   surface and root-zone soil moisture typically increases as the SMOS
   observation skill and decreases with increased open-loop skill, showing
   a strong linear relation to Delta RS-M, defined as the SMOS observation
   skill minus the open-loop surface soil moisture skill. Every time the
   SMOS skill is greater than or equal to the open-loop surface soil
   moisture skill, the assimilation is typically able to significantly
   improve the model soil moisture skill. The crop-dominated grids
   typically experience the largest Delta RA-M if the assimilated SMOS
   retrievals also come from crop surfaces (note that a model grid cell and
   the SMOS node mapped onto the grid are not exactly matched in space),
   consistent with a high satellite observation skill and a low open-loop
   skill, while Delta RA-M is usually weak or even negative for the
   forest-dominated grids when the SMOS retrievals also from forest
   surfaces are assimilated, due to the presence of a low observation skill
   and a high open-loop skill. The dependence of Delta RA-S, referred to as
   the skill for the surface soil moisture assimilation product minus the
   SMOS observation skill, upon the open-loop skill and the satellite
   observation skill is opposite to that for Delta RA-M. Overall our R
   metric of skill and the anomaly R metric as used in previous studies
   provide a consistent explanation for the vegetation modulation of the
   assimilation. This work offers further insight into the impact of the
   open-loop skill and the satellite observation skill on the assimilation.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a process management framework for multisensory data
   fusion for the purpose of tracking the progress of construction
   activity. The developed framework facilitates the required type of data
   fusion at any given point in the construction progress, reliably and
   efficiently. Data are acquired from high-frequency automated
   technologies such as three-dimensional (3D) imaging and ultrawideband
   (UWB) positioning, in addition to foreman reports, schedule information,
   and other information sources. The results of validation through a
   detailed field implementation project show that the developed framework
   for fusing volumetric, positioning, and project control data can
   successfully address the challenges associated with fusing multisensory
   data by tracking activities rather than objects, a feature that offers
   superior capability, efficiency, and accuracy over the length of the
   project. Other contributions of this research include the development of
   fusion processes that are performed at higher levels of data fusion
   instead of traditional low-level fusion algorithms, thus supporting
   decision-making processes and a number of automated construction
   management applications, such as construction progress tracking,
   earned-value estimation, and schedule updating. (c) 2014 American

Title = {{Shear Stress and Hydrodynamic Recovery over Bedforms of Different
   Lengths in a Straight Channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pools and riffles are common morphological features in rivers that are
   frequently used but poorly specified analogs in restoration design.
   Here, straight two-dimensional (2D) bedforms are conceptualized as
   perturbations and flow recovery is measured in a laboratory flume with
   an array of ultrasonic Doppler velocity profilers (UDVPs). The
   objectives are to (1) assess the variation of skin friction, turbulent
   stresses, and total stress; (2) assess the role of topographical
   feedback on flow recovery; and (3) compare flow recovery in isolated and
   bedforms in series. The results show that the total shear stress and
   near-bed turbulence greatly exceed the skin friction in decelerating
   flow and the pool and that hydrodynamic recovery tends to occur at
   length scales similar to geophysical scales despite potential negative
   feedback from the bed. Repeating short bedforms can push the flow to a
   more turbulent and laterally concentrated equilibrium condition.
   Implications for sediment entrainment thresholds, existing models of
   riffle-pool hydrodynamics, and the stability of constructed riffle pools
   are discussed. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Practical-Size Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims at providing a fast near-optimum solution to the
   multimode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) in
   large-scale projects, with and without resource-leveling constraints.
   The MRCPSP problem is known to be nondeterministic polynomial-time hard
   (NP-hard) and has been solved using various exact, heuristic, and
   metaheuristic procedures. In this paper, constraint programming (CP) is
   used as an advanced mathematical optimization technique that suits
   scheduling problems. The IBM ILOG modeling software and its CPLEX-CP
   solver engine have been used to develop a CP optimization model for the
   MRCPSP problem. Unlike many metaheuristic methods in literature, the CP
   model is fast and provides a near-optimum solution to the MRCPSP for
   projects with hundreds of activities within minutes. The paper compares
   the CP results with two case studies from the literature to prove the
   practicality and usefulness of the CP approach to both researchers and
   practitioners. One case study was used as the basis for creating larger
   projects with up to 2,000 activities. The results reported in this paper
   can be used as a benchmark for other researchers to compare and improve.
   This research contributes to developing a practical decision support
   system for resolving real-life constraints in projects. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Material waste from the production of autoclaved aerated concrete, a
   porous material, should be considered as a valuable byproduct for use as
   a filler material for the rubber industry. Natural rubber (NR)
   composites filled with different loading (over the range of 0-60 phr) of
   autoclaved aerated concrete waste (AACW) as a new eco-friendly material
   were produced using two roll mills and then were studied for their cure
   characteristics, mechanical and aging properties, and morphology, and
   also compared with commercial fillers, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and
   silica (SiO2). In most cases, the cure characteristics and mechanical
   and aging properties of the SiO2-filled NR composites were significantly
   better than those of the AACW- and CaCO3-filled NR composites. However,
   these properties for AACW-filled composites appeared to be higher than
   CaCO3-filled composites. The reason for this could be due to a larger
   surface area which is both porous and of an irregular shape of the AACW
   filler used. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the
   morphology of the rubber filled with SiO2 was finer and more homogenous
   compared with the rubber filled with AACW or CaCO3. Overall results
   revealed that the reinforcement ability of AACW-filled NR composites was
   generally better when compared with CaCO3-filled NR composites;
   therefore, AACW can be used effectively as a cheaper filler for
   production of rubber products where end-use properties of a rubber
   product is specifically required. (c) 2014 Society of Plastics Engineer}},

Title = {{Submodularity and greedy algorithms in sensor scheduling for linear
   dynamical systems}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{282-288}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on sensor scheduling for state estimation, which
   consists of a network of noisy sensors and a discrete-time linear system
   with process noise. As an energy constraint, only a subset of sensors
   can take a measurement at each time step. These measurements are fused
   into a common state estimate using a Kalman filter and the goal is to
   schedule the sensors to minimize the estimation error at a terminal
   time. A simple approach is to greedily choose sensors at each time step
   to minimize the estimation error at the next time step. Recent work has
   shown that this greedy algorithm outperforms other well known
   approaches. Results have been established to show that the estimation
   error is a submodular function of the sensor schedule; submodular
   functions have a diminishing returns property that ensures the greedy
   algorithm yields near optimal performance.
   As a negative result, we show that most commonly-used estimation error
   metrics are not, in general, submodular functions. This disproves an
   established result. We then provide sufficient conditions on the system
   for which the estimation error is a submodular function of the sensor
   schedule, and thus the greedy algorithm yields performance guarantees.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of competitive intelligence (CI)
   techniques for construction contractor selection process, as part of the

   industry lags behind in adopting this methodology. The use of CI for
   contract management is an important development in light of the
   realization on the part of major construction contractors that the
   diffuse nature of the information and lack of robust analysis create
   numerous uncertainties during the decision-making processes. The
   findings of this paper show that Cl has the potential to improve the
   process for assessing and selecting contractors, through supporting an
   unbiased and auditable decision making process. A case-study on using Cl

Abstract = {{This paper presents several methods for reducing the number of bit

   asymptotic arithmetic complexity compared to Bernstein's 3-way algorithm
   is introduced. This new algorithm uses three multiplications of
   one-third size polynomials over the binary field and one multiplication
   of one-third size polynomials over the finite field with four elements.
   Unlike Bernstein's algorithm, which has a linear delay complexity with
   respect to input size, the delay complexity of the new algorithm is
   logarithmic. The number of bit operations for the multiplication of
   polynomials over the finite field with four elements is also computed.

Abstract = {{In order to synthesize manganese borohydride, Mn(BH4)(2),
   mechano-chemical activation synthesis (MCAS) of the (2LiBH(4) + MnCl2)
   powder mixture was carried out by ball milling in a magneto ball mill.
   Both X-ray diffraction and TEM selected area electron diffraction
   patterns (SAEDPs) clearly confirm the presence of the Mn(BH4)(2) and
   LiCl phases in the synthesized nanocomposite. No other phases were
   detected. Bright field high-resolution TEM imaging of the synthesized
   composite powder particles reveals the presence of nanograins consistent
   with LiCl and Mn(BH4)(2) within the powder particles. Their respective
   grain sizes, estimated as the equivalent circle diameters (ECD) from the
   high-resolution TEM micrographs with the corrected sample standard
   deviations, are within the range of 14.1 +/- 3.7 nm and 10.0 +/- 2.9 nm
   for LiCl and Mn(BH4)(2), respectively.
   The XRD patterns of the thermally dehydrogenated (Mn(BH4)(2) + 2LiCl)
   nanocomposite do not exhibit any Bragg diffraction peaks belonging to
   either crystalline Mn or B. In contrast, the SAED patterns and EDS
   elemental maps provide strong evidence that both Mn and B exist in the
   dehydrogenated powder as crystalline phases alpha-Mn and beta-B,
   respectively. The results show that the lack of XRD Bragg diffraction
   peaks is insufficient evidence that the Mn and B elemental products of
   Mn(BH4)(2) thermolysis can be classified as being amorphous. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Rapid detection of pathogens is crucial to minimize adverse health
   impacts of nosocomial, foodborne, and water-borne diseases. Gold
   nanoparticles are extremely successful at detecting pathogens due to
   their ability to provide a simple and rapid color change when their
   environment is altered. Here, we review general strategies of
   implementing gold nanoparticles in calorimetric biosensors. First, we
   highlight how gold nanoparticles have improved conventional genomic
   analysis methods by lowering detection limits while reducing assay
   times. Then, we focus on emerging point-of-care technologies that aim at
   pathogen detection using simpler assays. These advances will facilitate
   the implementation of gold nanoparticle-based biosensors in diverse
   environments throughout the world and help prevent the spread of
   infectious diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a bifurcation analysis of steady states in a multistage
   agitated contactor (MAC) was conducted for typical gas-liquid processes.
   A cascade of stirred tank reactors with a backflow was used to model the
   reactive flow in the MAC, and second-order reaction kinetics was
   employed to represent typical gas-liquid processes. In the developed
   model, the effect of temperature on gas solubility was taken into
   account. The multiplicity behaviour of steady states in such a reactor
   was investigated using a continuation method. Nonlinearity behaviours
   such as limit points and Hopf points were detected under various process
   parameters investigated in this work. A stability analysis was also
   conducted to determine whether the multiple steady state solutions
   observed were stable. The results suggested that a medium adiabatic
   temperature rise and small temperature difference are preferred to avoid
   system instability in operating such reactors.}},

   theory of asymptotics of singular diffusions can be applied and we use
   this theory to develop a new figure of merit which we call a stability
   margin. The stability margin provides easily computable bounds on the
   acceptable noise levels for which stability is guaranteed. Through
   simulation, we show that such a sufficient bound provides a realistic

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{323-332}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The impact of solids residence time (SRT) on phosphate adsorption to
   hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) floc when striving for ultra-low P
   concentrations was characterized and an equilibrium model that describes
   the adsorption of P onto HFO floc of different ages was developed. The
   results showed that fresh HFO had a higher adsorption capacity in
   comparison to aged (2.8, 7.4, 10.8 and 22.8 days) HFO and contributed
   substantially to P removal at steady state. P adsorption onto HFO solids
   was determined to be best described by the Freundlich isotherm. P
   desorption from HFO solids was negligible supporting the hypothesis that
   chemisorption is the mechanism of P adsorption on HFO solids. A model
   that included the contribution of different classes of HFO solids (i.e.
   High, Low or Old, containing high concentration, low concentration or no
   active surface sites, respectively) to adsorption onto HFO from a
   sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system was found to adequately describe P
   adsorption onto FIFO solids of different ages. From the model it was
   determined that the fractions of High and Low HFO decreased with SRT
   while the fraction of Old HFO increased with SRT. The transformation of
   High HFO to Low HFO did not limit the overall production of Old HFO and
   the fresh HFO solids contributed more to P removal at steady state than
   the aged solids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models which predict
   hydroxyl radical rate constants (k(oH)) for a wide range of emerging
   micropollutants are a cost effective approach to assess the
   susceptibility of these contaminants to advanced oxidation processes
   (AOPs). A QSPR model for the prediction of k(oH) of emerging
   micropollutants from their physico-chemical properties was developed
   with special attention to model validation, applicability domain and
   mechanistic interpretation. In this study, 118 emerging micropollutants
   including those experimentally determined by the author and data
   collected from the literature, were randomly divided into the training
   set (n = 89) and validation set (n = 29). 951 DRAGON molecular
   descriptors were calculated for model development. The QSPR model was
   calibrated by applying forward multiple linear regression to the
   training set. As a result, 7 DRAGON descriptors were found to be
   important in predicting the k(oH) values which related to the
   electronegativity, polarizability, and double bonds, etc. of the
   compounds. With outliers identified and removed, the final model fits
   the training set very well and shows good robustness and internal
   predictivity. The model was then externally validated with the
   validation set showing good predictive power. The applicability domain
   of the model was also assessed using the Williams plot approach.
   Overall, the developed QSPR model provides a valuable tool for an
   initial assessment of the susceptibility of micropollutants to AOPs. (C)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents probabilistic coordination of distributed energy
   resources (DERs) operation in an islanded microgrid with consideration
   of the associated uncertainties. In doing so, a comprehensive stochastic
   mathematical model is developed which incorporates a set of valid
   probabilistic scenarios for the uncertainties of load and intermittency
   in wind and solar generation sources. The uncertainty is addressed
   through a combination of a stochastic optimization model and additional
   reserve requirements. The model also includes hourly interruption costs
   for a variety of customer types as a means of determining the optimal
   probabilistic interruptible load whose reliability-based value is low
   enough to enable it to be shed if necessary. A case study is carried out
   using a benchmark microgrid; numerical results demonstrate that
   coordinated operation of DERs brings notable benefits in terms of
   expected operation costs and system security. This probabilistic
   coordination further reduces the consequences of the expected power
   dispatch of controllable generators and hourly unserved power. Crown

Abstract = {{Self assembled cauliflower-like AgCl/ZnO hierarchical nanostructures
   were successfully synthesized using template-free chemical method. The
   as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction
   (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
   (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL). The characterization results revealed
   the formation of hierarchical AgCl/ZnO nanostructures with
   cauliflower-like morphology from the self assembly of 1D-nanorods. The
   photocatalytic activity of these hierarchical nanostructures was
   evaluated by the degradation of malachite green (MG) dye under visible
   light. As compared to other AgCl/ZnO nanostructures and bare ZnO,
   cauliflower like AgCl/ZnO hierarchical nanostructures (i.e., 30\%
   AgCl/ZnO) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity upto 85\% in 150 min
   for the degradation of MG dye under visible light. Furthermore, the
   efficiency of 30\% AgCl/ZnO was also investigated for the degradation of
   simulated dyebath effluent under solar light. A terephthalic
   acid-photoluminescence technique was used to detect (OH)-O-center dot
   radicals present in the photocatalytic process. LC-MS technique was also
   employed to identify the major intermediates in the photodegradation
   process of MG dye and the reaction pathway based on them was proposed.

Abstract = {{A microfluidic chip for DNA extraction by using solid phase extraction
   method was demonstrated in this paper. The microfluidic chip features
   three PDMS layers with microchannels, and a silica bead well with a thin
   PCTE membrane sandwiched between two PDMS layers. The height difference
   between the microchannels in the top PDMS layer and the bottom PDMS
   layer generates a gravity-based pressure difference to transport the
   regent and washing buffer solutions. Since the DNA extraction process
   based on solid phase extraction involves multiple sequential steps
   (i.e., loading, washing, and elution), an automated electromagnetically
   controlled valve-array was designed and used to control the flow
   sequence of the required reagents and washing buffer. It was
   demonstrated that by using this chip and HindIII-digested k-phage DNA as
   the sample, the DNA extraction process can be completed within 15 min
   and the DNA extraction efficiency is approximately 50\%. Such a simple
   and automatic microfluidic chip system eliminates many complicated
   hardware and human intervention, and can perform the DNA extraction with
   relatively high efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lifetime of a phosphorescent organic light-emitting device (PhOLED)
   may range over several orders of magnitude depending on the choice of
   the phosphorescent emitter guest material and its concentration. This
   behavior, we find, results primarily from different rates of
   exicton-polaron-induced aggregation (EPIA) of the host material due to
   exciton-polaron interactions. We investigate the influence of singlet
   versus triplet excitons in the EPIA of host materials and the
   degradation of PhOLEDs. The results show that there is a correlation
   between device electroluminescence degradation and the concentration of
   singlet excitons on the host during electrical driving. In contrast, we
   find no particular correlation between device degradation rate and the
   concentration of triplet excitons. The results therefore reveal that
   singlet excitons play the leading role causing the EPIA of host
   materials and device degradation by this mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Thin film composite membranes comprising of a polyamide (PA) and
   polydopamine (PD) were prepared and studied for dehydration of ethylene
   glycol. The chemical composition, surface hydrophilicity and sorption
   uptake of permeant in the active skin layer of the membranes were
   characterized, and the effects of the number and sequence of the PD and
   PA sublayers in the membrane skin on the pervaporation performance were
   studied, It was shown that using 1 or 2 PD sublayers as a surface layer
   (i.e., on top of PA) or a transition layer between PA and the substrate
   would increase both permeation flux and selectivity for dehydration of
   ethylene glycol. Since inorganic salts are often present in spent glycol
   solutions in practical applications, the influence of inorganic salt in
   the feed on ethylene glycol dehydration was also studied using NaCl as a
   representative salt The presence of NaCl in the feed solution enhanced
   the separation factor, while the permeation flux was reduced. Unlike
   pervaporative separation of binary water/ethylene glycol solutions where
   the separation factor was reduced at a higher temperature, the
   separation factor increased with an increase in temperature when NaCl
   was present in the feed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Manganese dioxide/carbon nanocomposites with partially graphitized
   hierarchical porous structure have been designed and synthesized. A high
   specific capacitance of 412 F g(-1) and excellent rate capability of

   at a high scan rate of 100 mV s(-1), a specific capacitance of 251 F

   Moreover, a long cycling stability with initial capacitance retention of
   similar to 88\% is obtained after over 4000 cycles at a current density
   of 1.0 A g(-1). This work presents an efficient electrode materials

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{696-714}},

Abstract = {{For each barrel of bitumen produced in Canada's oil sands industry,
   approximately 0.5-2.5 barrels of freshwater must be withdrawn from local
   waterways to aid in the processing of the mined ore. This equates to
   approximately 2.9 million barrels of freshwater per day. Upon the mining
   and extraction of bitumen from oil sands ore, a number of contaminants
   are solubilized and concentrated in oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW), prompting several environmental and process-related concerns.
   Among these contaminants is a very broad family of saturated aliphatic
   and alicyclic carboxylic acids known collectively as naphthenic acids
   (NAs), which have shown to be both corrosive toward process equipment
   and acutely toxic toward a number of aquatic organisms. In an effort to
   improve the recyclability and/or reduce the acute toxicity of OSPW,
   several methods have been investigated for the removal or degradation of
   NAs. These include, but are not limited to, advanced oxidation,
   biodegradation, coagulation/flocculation, membrane filtration, and
   adsorption. This review describes the recent developments in these
   technologies for use in OSPW remediation. Some of the major advances in
   the field involve the design and optimization of new technologies that
   reduce costs, operate more efficiently, and allow for greater
   throughput. Much of the current research is directed toward
   investigating combinatorial remediation techniques, such as advanced
   oxidation/biodegradation, biodegradation/adsorption and
   flocculation/membrane filtration, to achieve more comprehensive NA
   removal and/or improve the efficiency and sustainability of the process.

   electrode-sheet surface toward the bulk material. In Zn coated steel,
   heat was generated and localised at the faying interface and uniformly

   the presence of oxide at faying interface provides inhomogeneous current
   flow and violent heat generation in the Zn coated steel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a vehicle-to-grid reactive power support (V2GQ)
   strategy for optimal coordinated voltage regulation in distribution
   networks with high distributed generation (DG) penetration. The proposed
   algorithm employs plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), DG, and on-load tap
   changer (OLTC) to satisfy PEV charging demand and grid voltage
   requirements with relaxed tap operation, and minimum DG active power
   curtailment. The voltage regulation problem is formulated as a nonlinear
   programming and consists of three consecutive stages, in which
   successive stages apply the outputs of their preceding stages as
   constraints. The first stage aims to maximize the energy delivered to
   PEVs to assure PEV owner satisfactions. The second stage maximizes the
   DG extracted active power. Third stage minimizes the voltage deviation
   from its nominal value utilizing the available PEV and DG reactive
   powers. The main implicit objective of the third stage problem is
   relaxing the OLTC tap operation. In addition, the conventional OLTC
   control is replaced by a proposed centralized controller that utilizes
   the output of the third stage to set its tap position. Real-time
   simulations are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed optimal coordinated algorithm on a typical distribution network
   using OPAL-RT real-time simulator (RTS) in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Cathode potential and O-2 supply methods were investigated to improve
   H2O2 synthesis in an electrochemical cell, and optimal cathode
   conditions were applied for microbial electrochemical cells (MECs).
   Using aqueous O-2 for the cathode significantly improved current
   density, but H2O2 conversion efficiency was negligible at 0.3-12\%.
   Current density decreased for passive O-2 diffusion to the cathode, but
   H2O2 conversion efficiency increased by 65\%. An MEC equipped with a gas
   diffusion cathode was operated with acetate medium and domestic
   wastewater, which presented relatively high H2O2 conversion efficiency
   from 36\% to 47\%, although cathode overpotential was fluctuated. Due to
   different current densities, the maximum H2O2 production rate was 141 mg
   H2O2/L-h in the MEC fed with acetate medium, but it became low at 6 mg
   H2O2/L-h in the MEC fed with the wastewater. Our study clearly indicates
   that improving anodic current density and mitigating membrane fouling
   would be key parameters for large-scale H2O2-MECs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective quality assessment of distorted stereoscopic images is a
   challenging problem, especially when the distortions in the left and
   right views are asymmetric. Existing studies suggest that simply
   averaging the quality of the left and right views well predicts the
   quality of symmetrically distorted stereoscopic images, but generates
   substantial prediction bias when applied to asymmetrically distorted
   stereoscopic images. In this paper, we first build a database that
   contains both single-view and symmetrically and asymmetrically distorted
   stereoscopic images. We then carry out a subjective test, where we find
   that the quality prediction bias of the asymmetrically distorted images
   could lean toward opposite directions (overestimate or underestimate),
   depending on the distortion types and levels. Our subjective test also
   suggests that eye dominance effect does not have strong impact on the
   visual quality decisions of stereoscopic images. Furthermore, we develop
   an information content and divisive normalization-based pooling scheme
   that improves upon structural similarity in estimating the quality of
   single-view images. Finally, we propose a binocular rivalry-inspired
   multi-scale model to predict the quality of stereoscopic images from
   that of the single-view images. Our results show that the proposed
   model, without explicitly identifying image distortion types,
   successfully eliminates the prediction bias, leading to significantly
   improved quality prediction of the stereoscopic images.(1)}},

Abstract = {{Multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) is considered an effective quality
   enhancement technique widely adopted in consumer electronics, but little
   work has been dedicated to the perceptual quality assessment of
   multi-exposure fused images. In this paper, we first build an MEF
   database and carry out a subjective user study to evaluate the quality
   of images generated by different MEF algorithms. There are several
   useful findings. First, considerable agreement has been observed among
   human subjects on the quality of MEF images. Second, no single
   state-of-the-art MEF algorithm produces the best quality for all test
   images. Third, the existing objective quality models for general image
   fusion are very limited in predicting perceived quality of MEF images.
   Motivated by the lack of appropriate objective models, we propose a
   novel objective image quality assessment (IQA) algorithm for MEF images
   based on the principle of the structural similarity approach and a novel
   measure of patch structural consistency. Our experimental results on the
   subjective database show that the proposed model well correlates with
   subjective judgments and significantly outperforms the existing IQA
   models for general image fusion. Finally, we demonstrate the potential
   application of the proposed model by automatically tuning the parameters
   of MEF algorithms.(1)}},

Abstract = {{A novel synthesis containing microwave-assisted HCl etching reaction and
   precipitating reaction is employed to prepare hierarchical hollow
   SnO2@TiO2 nanocapsules for anode materials of Li-ion batteries. The
   intrinsic hollow nanostructure can shorten the lengths for both ionic
   and electronic transport, enlarge the electrode surface areas, and
   improving accommodation of the anode volume change during Li
   insertion/extraction cycling. The hybrid multi-elements in this material
   allow the volume change to take place in a stepwise manner during
   electrochemical cycling. In particular, the coating of TiO2 onto SnO2
   can enhance the electronic conductivity of hollow SnO2 electrode. As a
   result, the as-prepared SnO2@TiO2 nanocapsule electrode exhibits a
   stably reversible capacity of 770 mA hg(-1) at 1C, and the capacity
   retention can keep over 96.1\% after 200 cycles even at high current
   rates. This approach may shed light on a new avenue for the fast
   synthesis of hierarchical hollow nanocapsule functional materials for
   energy storage, catalyst and other new applications.}},

Abstract = {{Developing high-capacity electrode materials is critical to enhance the
   energy-density of lithium-ion batteries. Here, a new graphene
   nanoplatelets-supported SiOx-disordered carbon composite (SiOx-C/GNPs)
   is fabricated by a Stober-type process and high-temperature treatment.
   When used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, SiOx-C/GNPs exhibits
   excellent cycle stability and rate capability even under deep charge
   discharge cycling. A stable reversible capacity of about 630 mAh g(-1)
   (calculated on the total mass of the composite) can be achieved at a
   current density of 100 mA g(-1) and the capacity retention is nearly
   100\% after 250 cycles. Additionally, the plateau voltages of lithium
   extraction for the composite are only slightly higher than those for the
   commercial graphite, which ensures the high energy density of the
   assembled batteries. The superior electrochemical performance of this
   novel material is due to its unique features: excellent electronic
   conductivity, short transportation length for both lithium ions and
   electrons, elastomeric space to accommodate volume changes upon Li
   insertion/extraction and robust connection between SiOx and GNPs. Crown

Abstract = {{Hexagonal molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) multilayers were grown by

   p-type-dominant ambipolar behaviors, which are attributed to the
   formation of Se vacancies generated at the decomposition temperature
   (650 degrees C) after the CVD growth for 10 min. Our MoSe2 TFT with a
   reasonably high field-effect mobility (10 cm(2)/V.s) exhibits a high
   photoresponsivity (93.7 A/W) and a fast photoresponse time (tau(rise)
   similar to 0.4 s) under the illumination of light, which demonstrates

Abstract = {{A comprehensive methane cracking reaction pathway was investigated by
   performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition to
   the sequential dissociation reaction, i.e. CH4 -> CHx +(4 - x)H -> C +
   2H(2), a more sophisticated surface reaction network was studied, i.e.
   CHx + C -> CHx-1 + CH. The results show that CHx dehydrogenation is
   promoted with a low energy barrier through bimolecular reaction and
   provide an alternative kinetic favorable route for methane cracking.
   This study also demonstrates that the production of gas phase C-2
   hydrocarbon species, e.g. C2H2 and C2H4, in methane cracking reaction is
   unlikely due to the high barrier energy of C2H3 formation and their
   strong adsorption energy on Ni (1 1 1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Cellulose membrane has been widely used for bioseparation and blood
   purification but suffers from fouling issue and insufficient
   biocompatibility. Surface grafting of zwitterions onto membrane surface
   can effectively alleviate this issue. Current grafting methods are
   mostly based on free radical polymerizations and have limitations of
   multi step process, the requirement of inert atmosphere and inevitable
   flux decline. Herein we put forward a simple method for cellulose
   membrane (CM) zwitter-ionization. The modification was carried out via a
   one-step method based on the alkoxysilane condensation reaction using
   three silane coupling agents including
   (3-carboxypropylbetaine-propyl)-tri-methoxysilanc (CPPT),
   (3-sulfopropylbetaine-propyl)-trimethoxysilane (SPPT), and
   (3-sulfobutylbetaine-propyl)-trimethoxysilane (SBPT). Membrane surfaces
   were characterized by ATR-FTIR, XPS, SEM, water contact angle (WCA) and
   streaming potential. Membrane mechanical performance, pore size and its
   distributions were measured. The antifouling property, hemocompatibility
   and cytocompatibility of the membranes were evaluated by protein
   adsorption, platelet adhesion, cell attachment and MTT assay
   experiments. The results show that sulfobetaines and carboxybetaines
   were successfully grafted on the CM surface. The obtained
   zwitterions-grafted membranes show excellent resistance to protein
   adhesion, platelet adhesion and cell attachment. More importantly, the
   biocompatibility of the CM membrane was retained. 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Monte Carlo-based noise compensation in coil intensity corrected
   endorectal MRI}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer
   found in males making early diagnosis important. Magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) has been useful in visualizing and localizing tumor
   candidates and with the use of endorectal coils (ERC), the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. The coils introduce
   intensity inhomogeneities and the surface coil intensity correction
   built into MRI scanners is used to reduce these inhomogeneities.
   However, the correction typically performed at the MRI scanner level
   leads to noise amplification and noise level variations.
   Methods: In this study, we introduce a new Monte Carlo-based noise
   compensation approach for coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI which
   allows for effective noise compensation and preservation of details
   within the prostate. The approach accounts for the ERC SNR profile via a
   spatially-adaptive noise model for correcting non-stationary noise
   variations. Such a method is useful particularly for improving the image
   quality of coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the
   MRI scanner level and when the original raw data is not available.
   Results: SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) analysis in patient
   experiments demonstrate an average improvement of 11.7 and 11.2 dB
   respectively over uncorrected endorectal MRI, and provides strong
   performance when compared to existing approaches.
   Discussion: Experimental results using both phantom and patient data
   showed that ACER provided strong performance in terms of SNR, CNR, edge
   preservation, subjective scoring when compared to a number of existing
   approaches.
   Conclusions: A new noise compensation method was developed for the
   purpose of improving the quality of coil intensity corrected endorectal
   MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level. We illustrate that
   promising noise compensation performance can be achieved for the
   proposed approach, which is particularly important for processing coil
   intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner
   level and when the original raw data is not available.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEGMA), an inert polymer was
   grafted onto an anion exchange adsorbent for the exclusion of relatively
   larger hepatitis B virus-like particles (HB-VLPs) from the anion
   exchange ligand (Q) and at the same time this process allowed the
   selective adsorption of smaller size Escherichia coil host cell proteins
   (HCPs). The chain lengths of the POEGMA grafted were modulated by
   varying the amount of monomers used in the polymer grafting. The
   purification factor and yield of the HB-VLPs obtained from the
   flow-through of negative chromatography were 2.3 and 66.0 3.1\%,
   respectively, when shorter chain length of POEGMA (SQ) was grafted.
   Adsorbent grafted with longer chain of POEGMA (LQ) excluded some HCPs
   that are larger in size together with the HB-VLPs, reducing the purity
   of the recovered HB-VLPs. Further heat-treatment of the flow-through
   pool from SQ followed by centrifugation increased the purity of heat
   stable HB-VLPs to 87.5 1.1\%. Heat-treatment of the flow through sample
   resulted in thermal denaturation and aggregation of HCPs, while the heat
   stable HB-VLPs still remained intact as observed under a transmission
   electron microscope. The performance of the negative chromatography
   together with heat treatment in the purification of HB-VLPs is far
   better than the reported bind-and-elute techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a well known sampling and sample
   preparation technique used for a wide variety of analytical
   applications. As there are various complex processes taking place at the
   time of extraction that influence the parameters of optimum extraction,
   a mathematical model and computational simulation describing the SPME
   process is required for experimentalists to understand and implement the
   technique without performing multiple costly and time-consuming
   experiments in the laboratory. In this study, a mechanistic mathematical
   model for the processes occurring in SPME extraction of analyte(s) from
   an aqueous sample medium is presented. The proposed mechanistic model
   was validated with previously reported experimental data from three
   different sources. Several key factors that affect the extraction
   kinetics, such as sample agitation, fiber coating thickness, and
   presence of a binding matrix component, are discussed. More
   interestingly, for the first time, shorter or longer equilibrium times
   in the presence of a binding matrix component were explained with the
   help of an asymptotic analysis. Parameters that contribute to the
   variation of the equilibrium times are discussed, with the assumption
   that one binding matrix component is present in a static sample.
   Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model captures the
   phenomena occurring in SPME, leading to a clearer understanding of this
   process. Therefore, the currently presented model can be used to
   identify optimum experimental parameters without the need to perform a
   large number of experiments in the laboratory.}},

Title = {{A model-based approach to predict muscle synergies using optimization:
   application to feedback control}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new model-based method to define muscle synergies.
   Unlike the conventional factorization approach, which extracts synergies
   from electromyographic data, the proposed method employs a biomechanical
   model and formally defines the synergies as the solution of an optimal
   control problem. As a result, the number of required synergies is
   directly related to the dimensions of the operational space. The
   estimated synergies are posture dependent, which correlate well with the
   results of standard factorization methods. Two examples are used to
   showcase this method: a two-dimensional forearm model, and a
   three-dimensional driver arm model. It has been shown here that the
   synergies need to be task-specific (i.e., they are defined for the
   specific operational spaces: the elbow angle and the steering wheel
   angle in the two systems). This functional definition of synergies
   results in a low-dimensional control space, in which every force in the
   operational space is accurately created by a unique combination of
   synergies. As such, there is no need for extra criteria (e.g.,
   minimizing effort) in the process of motion control. This approach is
   motivated by the need for fast and bio-plausible feedback control of
   musculoskeletal systems, and can have important implications in
   engineering, motor control, and biomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Photoplethysmography (PPG) devices are widely used for monitoring
   cardiovascular function. However, these devices require skin contact,
   which restricts their use to at-rest short-term monitoring.
   Photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) has been recently proposed as a
   non-contact monitoring alternative by measuring blood pulse signals
   across a spatial region of interest. Existing systems operate in
   reflectance mode, many of which are limited to short-distance monitoring
   and are prone to temporal changes in ambient illumination. This paper is
   the first study to investigate the feasibility of long-distance
   non-contact cardiovascular monitoring at the supermeter level using
   transmittance PPGI. For this purpose, a novel PPGI system was designed
   at the hardware and software level. Temporally coded illumination (TCI)
   is proposed for ambient correction, and a signal processing pipeline is
   proposed for PPGI signal extraction. Experimental results show that the
   processing steps yielded a substantially more pulsatile PPGI signal than
   the raw acquired signal, resulting in statistically significant
   increases in correlation to ground-truth PPG in both short- (p subset
   of{[}<0.0001, 0.006]) and long-distance (p subset of {[}<0.0001, 0.053])
   monitoring. The results support the hypothesis that long-distance heart
   rate monitoring is feasible using transmittance PPGI, allowing for new
   possibilities of monitoring cardiovascular function in a non-contact
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the numerous studies on the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of
   alkylthiols on gold, the mechanisms involved, especially the nature and
   influence of the thiol-gold interface are still under debate. In this
   work the adsorption of aminothiols on Au(111) surfaces has been studied
   by using surface IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well
   as by density functional theory (DFT) modeling. Two aminothiols were
   used, cysteamine (CEA) and mercaptoundecylamine (MUAM), which contain
   two and eleven carbon atoms, respectively. By combining experimental and
   theoretical methods, it was possible to draw a molecular picture of the
   thiol-gold interface. The long-chain aminothiol produced better ordered
   SAMs, but, interestingly, the XPS data showed different sulfur binding
   environments depending on the alkyl chain length; an additional peak at
   low binding energy was observed upon CEA adsorption, which indicates the
   presence of sulfur in a different environment. DFT modeling showed that
   the positions of the sulfur atoms in the SAMs on gold with similar unit
   cells {[}(2 root 3x 2 root 3)R30 degrees] depended on the length of the
   alkyl chain. Short-chain alkylthiol SAMs were adsorbed more strongly
   than long-chain thiol SAMs and were shown to induce surface
   reconstruction by extracting atoms from the surface, possibly forming
   adatom/vacancy combinations that lead to the additional XPS peak. In the
   case of short alkylthiols, the thiol-gold interface governs the layer,
   CEA adsorbs strongly, and the mechanism is closer to single-molecule
   adsorption than self-assembly, whereas for long chains, interactions
   between alkyl chains drive the system to self-assembly, leading to a
   higher level of SAM organization and restricting the influence of the
   sulfur-gold interface.}},

Abstract = {{The surface of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer was hydrophilized
   by poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) using Surface Initiated Atomic Transfer
   Radical Polymerization (Si-ATRP). The ATRP initiator chosen was
   ((Chloromethyl) phenylethyl) trichlorosilane, which was immobilized on
   the surface of the PDMS through a simple but innovative method of drop
   coating, in contrast to the commonly used vapor deposition and
   solution-immersion methods. Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier
   Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
   were employed to examine surface properties of modified PDMS and
   confirmed presence of the PAAc chains covalently bonded to the PDMS
   surface. Physical properties and topography of the modified sample were
   characterized by water contact angle measurement and Atomic Force
   Microscopy. It is shown that the drop-coating of the silane initiator
   for ATRP modification with PAAc can result in good surface
   hydrophilization while causing minimum damage to the PDMS preserving its
   desired optical transparency. The resultant hydrophilic PDMS is stable
   in air and has film lubrication behavior in aqueous conditions and may
   be used in the development of advanced microfluidic devices and sensors
   where both surface hydrophilicity and bulk transparency are desired. (C)

Abstract = {{As an important development of medical instrumentation, minimally
   invasive therapeutic operations have been recently introduced. The
   foremost element of minimally invasive techniques is navigating a
   micro-device through human body, especially inside blood vessels. A
   remote actuation over the micro-device is normally provided by
   electromagnetic actuators. In most applications, a control scheme is
   also required to initiate the actuation force, the magnetic propulsion,
   such that at every time step, the micro-device moves towards or along a
   given path. This paper contributes in development of the electromagnetic
   system model mostly used in magnetic navigation systems to be
   representable in control affine form. Next, a multi-input multi-output
   (MIMO) trajectory tracking controller is designed to conduct the
   auto-navigation of the device along a given path. This method is a
   generalised version of a semi-global nonlinear output regulation'
   introduced for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Finally, the
   proposed scheme is examined for an iron particle moving in a fluidic
   environment. The simulation results show fast decay in deviation of the
   particle position from the reference path under some assumptions. This
   shows that the proposed scheme can be offered for medical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the water vapor transmission and waterproofing
   performance of a silane-based penetrating sealer (PS), two cementitious
   coatings (CC1 and CC2), and a polymeric coating (PC). The sealer and
   coating products were applied on 100-mm concrete cubes. In total,
   fifteen concrete cubes including the control specimens were prepared.
   The treated concrete cubes were tested to determine the ability of the
   selected products to improve waterproofing and to transmit water vapor.
   The correlation between water vapor transmission and waterproofing
   performance was also examined. Experimental results revealed that the
   cementitious coating CC2 had the lowest degree of water vapor
   transmission but the highest degree of waterproofing performance. In
   contrast, the highest degree of water vapor transmission but the lowest
   degree of waterproofing performance were observed for the cementitious
   coating CC1. The penetrating sealer PS provided greater water vapor
   transmission but lower waterproofing ability than the polymeric coating
   PC and the cementitious coating CC2. The best-performing coating with
   regard to water vapor transmission and waterproofing was the polymeric
   coating PC. Furthermore, the water vapor transmission and waterproofing
   performance of the sealer and coating systems were strongly correlated;
   this suggests that one of these two properties can be predicted by
   testing the other.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Whiplash injuries can occur in automotive crashes and may
   cause long-term health issues such as neck pain, headache, and visual
   and auditory disturbance. Evidence suggests that nonneutral head posture
   can significantly increase the potential for injury in a given impact
   scenario, but epidemiological and experimental data are limited and do
   not provide a quantitative assessment of the increased potential for
   injury. Although there have been some attempts to evaluate this
   important issue using finite element models, none to date have
   successfully addressed this complex problem.Methods: An existing
   detailed finite element neck model was evaluated in nonneutral positions
   and limitations were identified, including musculature implementation
   and attachment, upper cervical spine kinematics in axial rotation,
   prediction of ligament failure, and the need for repositioning the model
   while incorporating initial tissue strains. The model was enhanced to
   address these issues and an iterative procedure was used to determine
   the upper cervical spine ligament laxities. The neck model was
   revalidated using neutral position impacts and compared to an
   out-of-position cadaver experiment in the literature. The effects of
   nonneutral position (axial head rotation) coupled with muscle activation
   were studied at varying impact levels.Results: The laxities for the
   ligaments of the upper cervical spine were determined using 4 load cases
   and resulted in improved response and predicted failure loads relative
   to experimental data. The predicted head response from the model was
   similar to an experimental head-turned bench-top rear impact experiment.
   The parametric study identified specific ligaments with increased
   distractions due to an initial head-turned posture and the effect of
   active musculature leading to reduced ligament distractions.Conclusions:
   The incorporation of ligament laxity in the upper cervical spine was
   essential to predict range of motion and traumatic response,
   particularly for repositioning of the neck model prior to impact. The
   results of this study identify a higher potential for injury in
   out-of-position rear collisions and identified at-risk locations based
   on ligament distractions. The model predicted higher potential for
   injury by as much as 50\% based on ligament distraction for the
   out-of-position posture and reduced potential for injury with muscle
   activation. Importantly, this study demonstrated that the location of
   injury or pain depends on the initial occupant posture, so that both the
   location of injury and kinematic threshold may vary when considering
   common head positions while driving.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the characteristics of biosolids of a pilot-scale
   anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating municipal wastewater. The
   production of total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) was comparable
   to that reported for the extended aeration system at solids residence
   time (SRT) longer than 40 days. The yields of TS and VS were reduced as
   SRT increased from 40 to 100 days and increased with the addition of 26
   mg/L of FeCl3. The AnMBR destroyed 60-82\% of the VS loading in feed
   wastewater and hence it was concluded the biosolids met the requirements
   for vector attraction reduction for land application. The concentrations
   of volatile suspended solids and total suspended solids in the sludge
   were less than those reported after anaerobic digestion of conventional
   primary and secondary sludge mixtures, and hence dewatering of the waste
   stream may be required for some applications. The nutrient content in
   terms of total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus was similar to
   that of anaerobically digested municipal sludges. The dewaterability of
   the biosolids was poorer than that reported for sludges from aerobic
   treatment and anaerobically digested sludges. Dewaterability was
   improved by addition of FeCl3 and reduced SRT. The biosolids met
   standards for land application with regards to the concentration of
   heavy metals but would need further treatment to meet Class B pathogen
   indicator criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Bionanohybrids, combining biocompatible natural polymers with inorganic
   materials, have aroused interest because of their structural,
   functional, and environmental advantages. In this work, we report on the
   stabilization of CdS@ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) using
   carboxylated cellulose nanocrytals (CNCs) as nanocarrieers in aqueous
   phase. The high colloidal stability was achieved with sufficient
   negative charge on CNC surface and the coordination of Cd2+ to
   carboxylate groups. This coordination allows the in-situ nucleation and
   growth of QDs on CNC surface. The influences of QD to CNC ratio, pH and
   ZnS coating on colloidal stability and photoluminescence property of
   CNC/QD nanohybirds were also studied. The results showed that products
   obtained atpH 8 with a CdS to CNC weight ratio of 0.19 and a ZnS/CdS
   molar ratio of 1.5 possessed excellent colloidal stability and highest
   photoluminescence intensity. By anchoring QDs on rigid bionanotemplates,
   CNC/CdS@ZnS exhibited long-term colloidal and optical stability. Using
   biocompatible CNC as nanocarriers, the products have been demonstrated
   to exhibit low cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells and can serve as
   promising red-emitting fluorescent bioimaging probes.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term creep behavior of wheat straw composites made with either
   polypropylene homopolymer or impact-modified copolymer was studied at
   elevated temperatures (50-90 degrees C). Various mineral fillers were
   tried to enhance creep resistance in the composite materials among which
   wollastonite was found to be the most effective one. All formulations
   exhibited higher creep deformations at higher temperatures where the
   effect of temperature was more pronounced for composites containing the
   impact-modified copolymer as the matrix. Short-term creep was
   successfully modeled using a three-parameter power law and Burgers
   model, and the dependence of the power law model parameters on
   temperature was evaluated to quantify temperature dependence of creep
   behavior. Long-term creep at 50 degrees C was predicted based on the
   short-term data using the time-temperature superposition (TTS)
   principle, the power law model, and the Burgers model, and the results
   were compared with actual long-term data. While TTS was found to be the
   best method to accurately extrapolate short-term data, the failure of
   the two other methods was found to be related to the time scale of the
   deformation in short-term creep tests. The results of this study will
   provide a basis for the design of natural fiber thermoplastic composites
   to be used in under the hood applications in auto industry.}},

Abstract = {{The rarefaction effects on the catalytic decomposition of NH3 in
   ruthenium-coated planar microchannels is numerically simulated in the
   Knudsen number range 0.015-0.03. A colocated finite-volume method is
   used to solve the governing equations. A concentration jump model
   derived from the kinetic theory of gases is employed to account for the
   concentration discontinuity at the reactive walls. A detailed surface
   reaction mechanism for ammonia decomposition on ruthenium along with a
   multi-component species diffusion model are used to study the effects of
   concentration jump coupled with velocity slip and temperature jump on
   the walls. The velocity-slip, temperature-jump and concentration-jump
   boundary conditions have miscellaneous effects on flow, temperature and
   species concentration fields. The results suggest that the velocity-slip
   boundary condition only slightly influences the species distribution at
   the edge of the Knudsen layer as well as inside the channel, while the
   temperature-jump boundary condition affects the heat and mass transfer
   characteristics the most. The concentration-jump effect, on the other
   hand, can counter balance the temperature jump effects in some cases.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of power asymmetry is incorporated into the framework of the
   Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) and then applied to a water
   pollution dispute in China in order to show how it can provide strategic
   insights into courses of action. In a new definition of power asymmetry,
   one of the decision makers (DMs) in a conflict can influence the
   preferences of other DMs by taking advantage of additional options
   reflecting the particular DM's more powerful position. The more powerful
   DM may have three different kinds of power: direct positive, direct
   negative, or indirect. It is useful to analyze a model of a conflict
   without power asymmetry, and then to analyze a power-asymmetric model.
   As demonstrated by analysis of the water quality controversy that took
   place at the border separating the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu and
   Zhejiang, this novel conflict resolution methodology can be readily
   applied to real-world strategic conflicts to gain an enhanced
   understanding of the effects of asymmetric power.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{557-567}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbines operate within an environment of varying wind direction
   and magnitude leading to misalignment or yaw between the wind and the
   turbine rotor. Many control techniques have been applied to small
   horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) to prevent significant yaw loads,
   but in reality, most of the time the rotor is under some yaw load which
   may be significant. A blade element of a HAWT rotor under yaw loading is
   similar to a sinusoidally pitching airfoil. Here a miniaturized pitching
   S822 airfoil with a reduced frequency k of 0.025 at a Reynolds number
   (Re = 10(5)) is considered where the maximum dynamic angle of attack is
   equal to the static angle where the maximum lift to drag ratio occurs.
   These dynamic results obtained with laser Doppler anemometry (LDA),
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) and a numerical simulation with the
   Transition SST method are compared to a constant wind-loaded blade
   element. Since direct load measurement for dynamic miniaturized models
   in wind tunnels is very challenging, the non-intrusive PIV control
   volume analysis approach has been applied for load determination. Unlike
   the rotor in an ideal unidirectional freestream flow, a rotor under yaw
   loads, as presented here, experiences significant unbalanced loading in
   one cycle and a non-uniform wake. Results may be used to predict the
   cyclical range of loads a blade element experiences in yaw conditions
   and effects on the downstream rotor wake.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents both numerical and experimental results regarding
   the effects of pollution on the flashover performance of glass
   suspension-type insulators. The finite element method (FEM) was used for
   simulating polluted insulators both at power frequency and at lightning
   impulse voltages. Partially conductive epoxy resin with graphite powder
   was used for modeling pollution on the insulators, which enabled the
   measurement of the electrical potentials on the polluted insulators.
   Numerical studies demonstrated the variations in the field distributions
   caused by the location and severity of the pollution as well as by the
   type of voltage applied. The simulations, which were verified to a
   degree through measurement, showed that pollution conductivities greater
   than 10(-6) S/m and 10(-3) S/m alter field distributions for power
   frequency and lightning impulse voltages, respectively. Unlike the
   results obtained for partially polluted insulators, the voltage
   distribution was almost linear for fully polluted insulators.
   Experimental studies revealed that the location of the partial pollution
   plays an important role in flashover performance for lightning impulse
   voltages but has a negligible effect for power frequency voltages.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Silicon has the potential to revolutionize the energy storage capacities
   of lithium-ion batteries to meet the ever increasing power demands of
   next generation technologies. To avoid the operational stability
   problems of silicon-based anodes, we propose synergistic physicochemical
   alteration of electrode structures during their design. This capitalizes
   on covalent interaction of Si nanoparticles with sulfur-doped graphene
   and with cyclized polyacrylonitrile to provide a robust
   nanoarchitecture. This hierarchical structure stabilized the solid
   electrolyte interphase leading to superior reversible capacity of over
   1,000 mAhg(-1) for 2,275 cycles at 2 Ag-1. Furthermore, the
   nanoarchitectured design lowered the contact of the electrolyte to the
   electrode leading to not only high coulombic efficiency of 99.9\% but
   also maintaining high stability even with high electrode loading
   associated with 3.4 mAh cm(-2). The excellent performance combined with
   the simplistic, scalable and non-hazardous approach render the process
   as a very promising candidate for Li-ion battery technology.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum communication holds the promise of creating disruptive
   technologies that will play an essential role in future communication
   networks. For example, the study of quantum communication complexity has
   shown that quantum communication allows exponential reductions in the
   information that must be transmitted to solve distributed computational
   tasks. Recently, protocols that realize this advantage using optical
   implementations have been proposed. Here we report a proof-of-concept
   experimental demonstration of a quantum fingerprinting system that is
   capable of transmitting less information than the best-known classical
   protocol. Our implementation is based on a modified version of a
   commercial quantum key distribution system using off-the-shelf optical
   components over telecom wavelengths, and is practical for messages as
   large as 100 Mbits, even in the presence of experimental imperfections.
   Our results provide a first step in the development of experimental
   quantum communication complexity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{203-215}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Energy harvesting from coherent fluid structures is a current research
   topic due to its application in the design of small self-powered sensors
   for underwater applications. The impact of a vortex dipole with a
   deformable cantilevered plate at the plate tip is herein studied
   numerically using a strongly coupled staggered fluid-structure
   interaction algorithm. Three dipole Reynolds numbers, Re=500, 1500, and
   3000, are investigated for constant plate properties. As the dipole
   approaches the plate, positive vorticity is produced on the impact face,
   while negative vorticity is generated at the tip of the plate. Upon
   impact, the dipole splits into two, and two secondary dipoles are
   formed. The circulation and, therefore, the trajectories of these
   dipoles depend on both the Reynolds number and the elasticity of the
   plate, and these secondary dipoles may return for subsequent impacts.
   While the maximum deflection of the plate does not depend significantly
   on Reynolds number, the plate response due to subsequent impacts of
   secondary dipoles does vary with Reynolds number. These results
   elucidate the strong interdependency between plate deformation and
   vortex dynamics, as well as the effect of Reynolds number on both. (c)

Abstract = {{Instream channel restoration is a common practice in river engineering
   that presents a challenge for research. One research gap is the
   development of monitoring techniques that allow for testable predictions
   of sediment transport and supply. Here we use Radio Frequency
   Identification (RFID) transponders to compare the short-term (1-year)
   sediment transport response to flood events in a restored and a control
   reach. The field site is Wilket Creek, an enlarged creek in a fully
   urbanized catchment without stormwater management control in Toronto,
   Ontario. The responses to three flooding periods, each of which are at
   or above the design bankfull discharge, are described. Key results are
   that (i) particle mobility is lower in the restored reach for all three
   periods; (ii) full mobility occurs in the control reach during the first
   two floods while partial mobility occurs in the restored reach; and
   (iii) the constructed morphology exerted a controlling influence on
   particle entrainment, with higher mobility in the pools. Log-transformed
   travel distances exhibit normal distributions when grouped by particle
   size class, which allows a statistical comparison with power law and
   other predictive travel-distance relations. Results show that three
   bedload transport conditions can occur, with partial mobility associated
   with a mild relation between particle size and travel distance and full
   mobility associated with either a flat or steep relation depending on
   the degree of integration of particles in the bed. Recommendations on
   seeding strategy and sample sizes are made to improve the precision of
   the results by minimizing confidence intervals for mobility and travel
   distances. Even in a short term study, the RFID sediment tracking
   technique allows a process-based assessment of stream restoration
   outcomes that can be used to justify the instream intervention and plan
   future attempts to stabilize and enhance the system.}},

Title = {{Comparison of spatial filters and features for the detection and

   individuals and stroke patients}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The possibility of detecting movement-related cortical
   potentials (MRCPs) at the single trial level has been explored for
   closing the motor control loop with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for
   neurorehabilitation. A distinct feature of MRCPs is that the movement
   kinetic information is encoded in the brain potential prior to the onset
   of the movement, which makes it possible to timely drive external
   devices to provide sensory feedback according to the efferent activity
   from the brain. The aim of this study was to compare methods for the
   detection (different spatial filters) and classification (features
   extracted from various domains) of MRCPs from continuous
   electroencephalography recordings from executed and imagined movements
   from healthy subjects (n = 24) and attempted movements from stroke
   patients (n = 6) to optimize the performance of MRCP-based BCIs for
   neurorehabilitation. Approach. The MRCPs from four cue-based tasks were
   detected with a template matching approach and a set of spatial filters,
   and classified with a linear support vector machine using the
   combination of temporal, spectral, timescale, or entropy-based features.
   Main results. The best spatial filter (large Laplacian spatial filter
   (LLSF)) resulted in a true positive rate of 82 +/- 9\%, 78 +/- 12\% and
   72 +/- 9\% (with detections occurring similar to 200 ms before the onset
   of the movement) for executed, imagined and attempted movements (stroke
   patients). The best feature combination (temporal and spectral) led to
   pairwise classification of 73 +/- 9\%, 64 +/- 10\% and 80 +/- 12\%. When
   the detection was combined with classification, 60 +/- 10\%, 49 +/- 10\%
   and 58 +/- 10\% of the movements were both correctly detected and
   classified for executed, imagined and attempted movements. A similar
   performance for detection and classification was obtained with optimized
   spatial filtering. Significance. A simple setup with an LLSF is useful
   for detecting cued movements while the combination of features from the
   time and frequency domain can optimize the decoding of kinetic
   information from MRCPs; this may be used in neuromodulatory BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue process near notches and cracks is governed by highly
   concentrated strains and stresses in the notch/crack tip region.
   Therefore, the fatigue crack growth can be subsequently considered as a
   process of successive crack increments resulting from material damage
   occurring in this region.
   The assumption mentioned above was used in order to model the fatigue
   crack growth based on the analysis of elastic-plastic crack tip stresses
   and strains. The fatigue crack growth was predicted by simulating the
   stress-strain response in the material volume adjacent to the crack tip
   and estimating the accumulated fatigue damage in a manner similar to
   fatigue analyses of stationary notches. The fatigue crack growth was
   regarded as a process of successive crack re-initiations in the crack
   tip region. The fatigue crack growth driving force was derived on the
   basis of the local stresses and strains at the crack tip using the
   Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) fatigue damage parameter: D = sigma(max).Delta
   epsilon/2. It was found that the fatigue crack growth was controlled by
   a two parameter driving force derived in the form of power law
   expression Delta kappa = Delta(K1-pKmaxp). The two parameter driving
   force enabled to predict the effect of the mean stress on the fatigue
   crack growth rate including the influence of the applied compressive
   stress and tensile overloads, the overload effect and the effect of the
   crack tip internal (residual) stress resulted from the reversed cyclic
   plasticity.
   Experimental fatigue crack growth data set obtained for the aluminum
   alloy (2324 T7) was used for the verification of the methodology. The
   method can also be used to predict fatigue lives of notched and welded
   components where both stages of the fatigue process called as the
   fatigue crack initiation and propagation are important. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of channel selection for
   interference mitigation in opportunistic spectrum access networks using
   a stochastic game-theoretic approach. The studied network is distributed
   and dynamic, where each user only has its individual information, and no
   information exchange is available among users. Moreover, each user is
   considered to be dynamically active due to its specific data service
   requirement. Specifically, a user randomly becomes active and then
   competes for the wireless channel to transmit for a random duration. To
   capture such dynamic interactions among users, a dynamic interference
   graph is defined, and based on this, the interference mitigation problem
   is formulated as a graphical stochastic game. It is proved to be an
   exact potential game, in which the existence of the Nash equilibrium
   (NE) is guaranteed. Then, the performance bounds of the NE are
   theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, we design a fully distributed and
   online algorithm based on stochastic learning for the
   interference-mitigation channel selection, which is proved to converge
   to the NE of the formulated game. Finally, we conduct simulations to
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for interference
   mitigation and throughput improvement in the distributed and dynamic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which supports low-cost communications, has
   been applied in a variety of wireless networks. Developing accurate
   analytical models for the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control (MAC)
   protocol is critical for the design and performance evaluation of such
   networks. Periodic traffic is a common traffic pattern generated in many
   practical application scenarios, for which most existing analytical
   models assuming either saturated or random network traffic patterns
   become inapplicable. In this paper, we develop an accurate and scalable
   analytical model to analyze the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol with the
   periodic traffic. Our model can accurately capture the protocol
   stochastic behavior in each period in scenarios such as with or without
   retransmissions and with single clear channel assessment (CCA) or double
   CCAs. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed model
   by both transient and aggregate performance evaluations, and the results
   show that the model captures MAC behavior with periodic traffic
   accurately. We also discuss about extending the proposed model to
   account for heterogeneous scenarios and the hidden node problem.}},

Abstract = {{Millimeter wave (mm Wave) communication is a promising solution for
   future fifth generation (5G) cellular networks to offer extremely high
   capacity. Because of the propagation characteristics of mmWave band, 5G
   users with high mobility in metropolitan areas could suffer frequent
   link outages resulting in challenges on video quality provisioning. In
   this paper, a playout buffer is used to regulate and maintain the video
   playout quality. We formulate the problem of using dynamically allocated
   bandwidth to charge the buffer as a Markov decision process (MDP),
   aiming to maximize video playout quality for all the users moving in the
   whole coverage area. Dynamic programming is adopted to solve the MDP
   problem with state aggregation considering the characteristics of mmWave
   network. Numerical results demonstrate that the resultant optimal policy
   of the MDP model can effectively maintain video playout quality for
   high-mobility users with intermittent mmWave connection.}},

Abstract = {{A twin screw extruder was used for continuous modification of

   incorporated in the PP backbone to modify its rheological properties.
   Benzophenones (BPH) as photoinitiator and trimethylolpropane triacrylate
   (TMPTA) as coagent were utilized during PP photomodification. Radiation
   was carried out after mixing in the extruder on solid stretched strands
   with similar to 0.3 mm thickness. The effects of photoinitiator
   concentration, radiation time, and coagent presence were studied via a
   replicated two-level full factorial design of experiments. It was shown
   that photomodification of PP can be done continuously. Formation of LCBs
   in the experimental runs was confirmed via rheological measurements. Gel
   content of the samples was also measured. It was found that LCBs can be
   formed in PP with and without TMPTA at certain processing conditions.
   The amount of gel in the samples prepared with TMPTA was higher;
   however, the gel content could be controlled by manipulating BPH
   concentration and radiation time. (C) 2015 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Abstract = {{Acoustophoresis is a powerful yet gentle technique for manipulating
   cells and particles that has quickly earned a place in the lab-on-a-chip
   toolkit. However, traditional construction techniques for
   acoustophoretic resonators have typically required prohibitively
   expensive and laborious processing methods. Here, we propose a highly
   cost-effective and cleanroom-free construction technique for transversal
   acoustophoretic resonators. Channels with two different widths of 750
   and 300 mu m were constructed using a simple glass and polyimide
   sandwiching technique. Half and full wavelength resonators were then
   established using 1 and 5 MHz ultrasound respectively and polystyrene
   beads were successfully manipulated in both types of resonators. This

Abstract = {{In this study, the hydromagnetic Blasius flow of power-law nanofluids is
   investigated numerically. A convectively heated impermeable vertical
   plate is used and a constant transverse magnetic field is applied at the
   plate surface. The characteristics of water-based non-Newtonian
   nanofluids are explored using a non-Newtonian power-law model. A
   Buongiorno model is employed to include the effects of Brownian motion
   and thermophoresis in the study. The governing mass, momentum, thermal
   energy, and nanoparticle concentration equations are transformed into
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations which are solved using a
   spectral relaxation method. The effects of nanofluid parameters
   (0Nb,Nt0.5), power index 0.5n1.5, generalized Prandtl (5Pr8), and
   Schmidt (0.5Sc2) numbers on dimensionless velocity, temperature,
   concentration, skin friction, local Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers are
   explored. It is found that pseudoplastic nanofluids have higher skin
   friction and lower heat and mass transfer rates than dilatant

   using suitable transformations before being solved numerically. The
   effects of the controlling parameters on the dimension-less velocity,
   temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, and the local Nusselt and

   temperature, and concentration increase with mass transfer velocity for
   both the vertical plate and cone. Further, the velocity reduces whilst
   the temperature and concentration increase with increasing buoyancy
   ratio parameter for all three types of nanofluids in the case of both
   geometries. The local Nusselt and the local Sherwood numbers are found
   to be higher for dilatant nanofluids than pseudoplastic nanofluids and

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the task scheduling and path planning problem for a
   team of cooperating vehicles performing autonomous deliveries in urban
   environments. The cooperating team comprises two vehicles with
   complementary capabilities, a truck restricted to travel along a street
   network, and a quadrotor micro-aerial vehicle of capacity one that can
   be deployed from the truck to perform deliveries. The problem is
   formulated as an optimal path planning problem on a graph and the goal
   is to find the shortest cooperative route enabling the quadrotor to
   deliver items at all requested locations. The problem is shown to be
   NP-hard. A solution is then proposed using a novel reduction to the
   Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem, for which well-established
   heuristic solvers exist. The heterogeneous delivery problem contains as
   a special case the problem of scheduling deliveries from multiple static
   warehouses. We propose two additional algorithms, based on enumeration
   and a reduction to the traveling salesman problem, for this special
   case. Simulation results compare the performance of the presented
   algorithms and demonstrate examples of delivery route computations over
   real urban street maps.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{70-81}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a multivariable robust estimator that predicts the
   controlled outputs in a thin film growth process for online
   applications. The evolution of the epitaxial growth process on a
   substrate is modeled based on a multiscale approach, coupling a
   continuum gas phase model and a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model that
   describes the evolution of the thin film surface. In the estimator, the
   issue of computationally intensive KMC simulations is circumvented by
   developing reduced-order models that are identified offline based on
   data obtained from the multiscale model. This approach significantly
   reduced the simulation time over KMC and makes the online control and
   optimization feasible. The estimator evaluates the surface roughness and
   growth rate based on the substrate temperature and the bulk precursor
   mole fraction during the growth process. To provide robust estimations,
   the estimator is designed to evaluate the upper and lower bounds on the
   outputs under model parameter uncertainties. To assess the uncertainty
   propagation into the system's outputs, power series expansion (PSE) is
   employed in the presence of distributional parametric uncertainties. The
   sensitivities of the outputs with respect to the uncertain parameters
   are assessed offline at different substrate temperatures and bulk
   precursor mole fractions. Accordingly, upper and lower bounds on the
   outputs are determined at a specific confidence level and employed to
   identify a reduced-order model for online applications. To assess the
   efficiency of the estimator, proportional integral (PI) controllers are
   coupled with the estimator to control surface roughness and growth rate
   while manipulating the substrate temperature and the bulk precursor mole
   fraction, respectively. The robust control of the process under
   parameter uncertainties is investigated using the bounds estimated on
   the controlled outputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fine-grained Al-Mg/Al3Ti nanocomposite was fabricated by friction stir
   processing (FSP) of an aluminum-magnesium (AA5052) alloy with pre-placed
   titanium powder in the stirred zone. Microstructural evolutions and
   formation of intermetallic phases were analyzed by optical and electron
   microscopic techniques across the thickness section of the processed
   sheets. The microstructure of the nanocomposite consisted of a
   fine-grained aluminum matrix (1.5 mu m), un-reacted titanium particles
   (<40 gm) and reinforcement particles of Al3Ti (<100 nm) and Mg2Si (<100
   nm). Detailed microstructural analysis indicated solid-state interfacial
   reactions between the aluminum matrix and micro-sized titanium particles
   to form Al3Ti intermetallic phase. The hard inclusions were then
   fractured and re-distributed in the metal matrix by the severe
   thermo-mechanical conditions imposed by FSP. Evaluation of mechanical
   properties by hardness measurement and uniaxial tensile test determined
   significant enhancement in the mechanical strength (by 2.5 order of
   magnetite) with a high ductility (similar to 22\%). Based on a
   dislocation-based model analysis, it was suggested that the strength
   enhancement was governed by grain refinement and the presence of hard
   inclusions (4 <(vol\%)under bar>) in the metal matrix. Fractographic
   studies also showed a ductile-brittle fracture mode for the
   nanocomposite compared with fully ductile rupture of the annealed alloy
   as well as the FSPed specimen without pre-placing titanium particles.

Abstract = {{An evaluation of the acoustic and surface characteristics of different
   Canadian pavement types was carried out in 2013 at the test track of the
   Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology at the University of
   Waterloo. Noise testing was performed to determine the coefficient of
   noise absorption on cored samples and noise emissions in the field using
   the close proximity and the on-board sound intensity methods. Wearing
   course characteristics were evaluated with field testing, including
   visual condition surveys, evaluation of frictional properties with the
   British Pendulum tester, mean texture depth measurements, and surface
   profile and roughness evaluation with a walking profiler. As of the time
   of testing, the noise testing results indicate comparable acoustic
   properties in both flexible and rigid pavement sections, despite
   differences in the initial pavement materials, mixes, and surface
   finishing. With increasing pavement age, the amount of noise emissions
   increases as the pavement surface is worn down. Comparable friction
   values are also observed in all pavement sections, in line with the
   noise testing results. However, this is largely based on the initial
   construction values. Surface distresses are also not uniformly
   distributed: they are more severe in the oldest sections and more
   frequent in the loaded lane, which carries the heaviest traffic loads.}},

   and the direction of electrophoretic motion of oil droplets depend on
   the surfactant concentration and on if the droplet is in negatively
   charged SDS solutions or in positively charged
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solutions. The absolute value
   of the electrophoretic mobility increases with increased surfactant
   concentration before the surfactant concentration reaches to the CMC. It
   was also found that there are two vortices around the oil droplet under
   the applied electric field. The size of the vortices changes with the
   surfactant and with the electric field. The vortices around the droplet
   directly affect the drag of the flow field to the droplet motion and
   should be considered in the studies of electrophoretic mobility of oil
   droplets. The existence of the vortices will also influence the
   determination and the interpretation of the zeta potential of the oil
   droplets based on the measured mobility data.}},

Abstract = {{A novel real-time pose estimation system is presented for solving the
   visual simultaneous localization and mapping problem using a rigid set
   of central cameras arranged such that there is no overlap in their

   a spherical coordinate update is formulated which isolates system
   parameters dependent on global scale, allowing the shape parameters of
   the system to converge despite the scale remaining uncertain.
   Furthermore, an initialization scheme is proposed from which the
   optimization will converge accurately using only the measurements from
   the cameras at the first time step. The algorithm is implemented and
   verified in experiments with a camera cluster constructed using multiple
   perspective cameras mounted on a multirotor aerial vehicle and augmented
   with tracking markers to collect high-precision ground-truth motion
   measurements from an optical indoor positioning system. The accuracy and
   performance of the proposed pose estimation system are confirmed for
   various motion profiles in both indoor and challenging outdoor

Abstract = {{We study the impact of the limited capacity of back-haul links on
   downlink user scheduling in a heterogeneous network comprising macro
   base stations and small cells. Assuming a tree topology of the backhaul
   network, we formulate a backhaul-aware global a-fair time-domain user
   scheduling problem and study it under three different scenarios of
   backhaul limitations. For the scenario where the backhaul links are not
   the bottleneck, we derive closed-form scheduling solutions to the
   scheduling problem under certain assumptions. For the scenario where the
   backhaul links between the macro base station and the small cells are
   the bottleneck, we show that the global a-fair user scheduling problem
   can be decomposed into a set of independent local a-fair user scheduling
   problems. However, unlike the previous case, a local scheduler in this
   case is not of a unique type but can be of one of three types, depending
   on the available backhaul capacity. We completely characterize these
   three types and also propose a simple heuristic for optimal a-fair
   scheduling. When the link between the macro base station and the core
   network is a potential bottleneck, we show how each base station can
   still perform a local scheduling as in the previous case as long as
   there is amaster problem that allocates feasible virtual backhaul
   capacities to each BS. However, computing the optimal virtual capacities
   is complex and expensive in terms of the amount and frequency of
   information exchanges. For this scenario, we propose
   realization-agnostic heuristic schemes that are simple to implement and
   perform quite well.}},

Abstract = {{Appropriate implementation of multimicrogrid systems in distribution
   networks is dependent on the development of new planning methodologies
   that take into account the special operational characteristics of
   microgrids. This paper proposes a new algorithm for optimum shunt
   capacitor placement in multimicrogrid systems with consideration of
   islanded mode of operation. The cost function of the proposed
   optimization technique consists of three terms in the planning process:
   1) the cost of power and energy losses when multimicrogrid systems
   operate in normal grid-connected mode; 2) the cost of capital
   investments of the installed shunt capacitors; and 3) the customers'
   cost of interruption when microgrids fail to operate in islanded mode
   due to shortage of reactive power and/or voltage violations. Appropriate
   power flow and probabilistic models for distributed and renewable energy
   resources (DER) and loads have been incorporated in the optimization
   problem to provide proper representation for microgrids during both
   grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. A genetic algorithm (GA)
   has been utilized to solve the problem and several case studies have
   been conducted to validate the proposed capacitor placement methodology.
   The results show that the new methodology can facilitate successful
   deployment of microgrids in distribution networks.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of allocating a capital budget to solar panels
   and storage to maximize the expected revenue in the context of a
   large-scale solar farm participating in an energy market. This problem
   is complex due to many factors. To begin with, solar energy production
   is stochastic, with a high peak-to-average ratio, thus the access link
   is typically provisioned at less than peak capacity, leading to the
   potential waste of energy due to curtailment. The use of storage
   prevents power curtailment, but the allocation of capital to storage
   reduces the amount of energy produced. Moreover, energy storage devices
   are imperfect. A solar farm owner is thus faced with two problems: 1)
   deciding the level of power commitment and 2) the operation of storage
   to meet this commitment. We formulate two problems corresponding to two
   different power commitment approaches, an optimal one and a practical
   one, and show that the two problems are convex, allowing efficient
   solutions. Numerical examples show that our practical power commitment
   approach is close to optimal and also provide several other engineering
   insights.}},

   variance-based global sensitivity analysis is preformed to screen
   significant error components of the system kinematic error model. The

Abstract = {{In today's information systems, the availability of massive amounts of
   data necessitates the development of fast and accurate algorithms to
   summarize these data and represent them in a succinct format. One
   crucial problem in big data analytics is the selection of representative
   instances from large and massively distributed data, which is formally
   known as the Column Subset Selection problem. The solution to this
   problem enables data analysts to understand the insights of the data and
   explore its hidden structure. The selected instances can also be used
   for data preprocessing tasks such as learning a low-dimensional
   embedding of the data points or computing a low-rank approximation of
   the corresponding matrix. This paper presents a fast and accurate greedy
   algorithm for large-scale column subset selection. The algorithm
   minimizes an objective function, which measures the reconstruction error
   of the data matrix based on the subset of selected columns. The paper
   first presents a centralized greedy algorithm for column subset
   selection, which depends on a novel recursive formula for calculating
   the reconstruction error of the data matrix. The paper then presents a
   MapReduce algorithm, which selects a few representative columns from a
   matrix whose columns are massively distributed across several commodity
   machines. The algorithm first learns a concise representation of all
   columns using random projection, and it then solves a generalized column
   subset selection problem at each machine in which a subset of columns
   are selected from the sub-matrix on that machine such that the
   reconstruction error of the concise representation is minimized. The
   paper demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm through an empirical evaluation on benchmark data sets.}},

Abstract = {{We formulate a coordinated path following problem for N unicycle mobile
   robots as an instance of a nested set stabilization problem.
   Stabilization of the first set corresponds to driving the unicycles to
   their assigned paths. Stabilization of the second set, a subset of the
   first, corresponds to meeting the coordination specification. The first
   set is stabilized, for initial conditions sufficiently close to the set,
   in a decentralized manner using feedback linearization. For general
   coordination tasks we utilize feedback linearization to stabilize the
   nested set in a centralized manner, again, for initial conditions
   sufficiently close to the second set. In the special case in which
   coordination entails making the unicycles maintain a formation along
   their paths, we employ a semi-distributed control law under less
   restrictive communication assumptions. Experimental results are
   provided. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a new definition of typicality based on the
   weak{*} topology that is applicable to Polish alphabets (which includes
   R-n). This notion is a generalization of strong typicality in the sense
   that it degenerates to strong typicality in the finite alphabet case,
   and can also be applied to mixed and continuous distributions.
   Furthermore, it is strong enough to prove a Markov lemma, and thus can
   be used to directly prove a more general class of results than entropy
   (or weak) typicality. We provide two example applications of this
   technique. First, using the Markov Lemma, we directly prove a coding
   result for Gel'fand-Pinsker channels with an average input constraint
   for a large class of alphabets and channels without first proving a
   finite alphabet result and then resorting to delicate quantization
   arguments. This class of alphabets includes, for example, real and
   complex inputs subject to a peak amplitude restriction. While this large
   class does not directly allow for Gaussian distributions with average
   power constraints, it is shown to be straightforward to recover this
   case by considering a sequence of truncated Gaussian distributions. As a
   second example, we consider a problem of coordinated actions (i.e.,
   empirical distributions) for a two node network, where we derive
   necessary and sufficient conditions for a given desired coordination.}},

Abstract = {{Induction motors (IMs) are widely used in various domestic and
   industrial applications. A reliable IM health condition monitoring
   system is very useful to detect IM fault at its incipient stage to
   prevent performance degradation of IMs and their driven equipment. An
   enhanced bispectrum (EB) technique with auxiliary frequency (AF)
   injection (EB-AF) is proposed in this paper to conduct incipient IM
   fault detection. The AFs are injected into the electric current signals
   to enhance fault characteristic frequency components. The EB technique
   transforms the traditional 2-D bispectrum with massive features into a
   one-scale spectral representation to facilitate feature extraction for
   IM defect detection. The effectiveness of the developed EB-AF technique
   is examined by IM bearing fault detection with different speed and load
   conditions. Test results show that the developed EB-AF technique can
   reveal fault features effectively for initial IM fault detection.}},

Title = {{Laminar separation bubble development on an airfoil emitting tonal noise}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{780}},
Pages = {{167-191}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The subject of this experimental study is the feedback effects due to
   tonal noise emission in a laminar separation bubble (LSB) formed on the
   suction side of an airfoil in low Reynolds number flows. Experiments
   were performed on a NACA 0012 airfoil for a range of chord-based
   Reynolds numbers 0.65 x 10(5) <= Re-c <= 4.5 x 10(5) at angle of attack
   alpha = 2 degrees, where laminar boundary layer separation is
   encountered on both sides of the airfoil. Simultaneous time-resolved,
   two-component particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, unsteady
   surface pressure and far-field acoustic pressure measurements were
   employed to characterize flow development and acoustic emissions.
   Amplification of disturbances in separated shear layers on both the
   suction and pressure sides of the airfoil leads to shear layer roll-up
   and shedding of vortices from separation bubbles. When the vortices do
   not break up upstream of the trailing edge, the passage of these
   structures over the trailing edge generates tonal noise. Acoustic
   feedback between the trailing edge noise source and the upstream
   separation bubble narrows the frequency band of amplified disturbances,
   effectively locking onto a particular frequency. Acoustic excitation
   further results in notable changes to the overall separation bubble
   characteristics. Roll-up vortices forming on the pressure side, where
   the bubble is located closer to the trailing edge, are shown to define
   the characteristic frequency of pressure fluctuations, thereby affecting
   the disturbance spectrum on the suction side. However, when the bubble
   on the pressure side is suppressed via boundary layer tripping, a weaker
   feedback effect is also observed on the suction side. The results give a
   detailed quantitative description of the observed phenomenon and provide
   a new outlook on the role of coherent structures in separation bubble
   dynamics and trailing edge noise generation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a model-based scheme for the online
   optimization of coldstart hydrocarbon emission control strategy of an
   automotive spark-ignited engine during its idle operating conditions.
   First, the existing model-based control schemes to reduce the coldstart
   emissions are reviewed and classified. Then, the proposed scheme and the
   related control-oriented engine model validated by experimental data are
   introduced. At the heart of the suggested scheme, there is a new optimal
   control problem formulation for the coldstart that can be solved rapidly
   using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. This formulation is based on a
   redefined objective function with weighted terms for the coldstart key
   variables, that is, the engine-out hydrocarbon emission and the exhaust
   gas temperature. The weighting numbers for these dominant factors in the
   redefined objective function are tuned such that the optimum solution
   becomes close to the minimum of the cumulative tailpipe hydrocarbon
   emissions. The use of the redefined objective function reduces
   significantly the computational efforts, resulting in an order of
   magnitude faster convergence rate than solving the original coldstart
   hydrocarbon emission minimization problem with a complex form. This
   important property is demonstrated with some simulation results based on
   the above-mentioned engine model. This feature makes the new formulation
   a good fit to the proposed scheme, where measured or estimated state
   variables of the engine model can be fed back to the control unit to
   re-calculate online the input profiles, such as the spark timing and the
   air/fuel ratio. Through online modification of the pre-determined input
   trajectories obtained from off-line calculations, the control
   performance degradation in practice due to the plant/model mismatch,
   which is equivalent to a significant increase of the tailpipe
   hydrocarbon emissions, can be reduced considerably.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the ever-growing expectation of ubiquitous connectivity and
   the widespread adoption of IEEE 802.11 networks, it is not only highly
   demanded but also entirely possible for in-motion vehicles to establish
   convenient Internet access to roadside WiFi access points (APs) than
   ever before, which is referred to as Drive-Thru Internet. The
   performance of Drive-Thru Internet, however, would suffer from the high
   vehicle mobility, severe channel contentions, and instinct issues of the
   IEEE 802.11 MAC as it was originally designed for static scenarios. As
   an effort to address these problems, in this paper, we develop a unified
   analytical framework to evaluate the performance of Drive-Thru Internet,
   which can accommodate various vehicular traffic flow states, and to be
   compatible with IEEE 802.11a/b/g networks with a distributed
   coordination function (DCF). We first develop the mathematical analysis
   to evaluate the mean saturated throughput of vehicles and the
   transmitted data volume of a vehicle per drive-thru. We show that the
   throughput performance of Drive-Thru Internet can be enhanced by
   selecting an optimal transmission region within an AP's coverage for the
   coordinated medium sharing of all vehicles. We then develop a spatial
   access control management approach accordingly, which ensures the
   airtime fairness for medium sharing and boosts the throughput
   performance of Drive-Thru Internet in a practical, efficient, and
   distributed manner. Simulation results show that our optimal access
   control management approach can efficiently work in IEEE 802.11b and
   802.11g networks. The maximal transmitted data volume per drive-thru can
   be enhanced by 113.1\% and 59.5\% for IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g
   networks with a DCF, respectively, compared with the normal IEEE 802.11
   medium access with a DCF.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of dynamic systems is important for satisfactory
   performance, safety and reliability. The study becomes more difficult
   when the system is nonlinear and when the ever present uncertainties in
   the components are considered. Herein a new approach is presented that
   uses time-domain information: It invokes design of experiments based on
   the uncertainty within the system, computer simulation of the dynamics
   to generate a matrix of discrete time responses that presents the
   variability of the response, and finally, singular value decomposition
   to separate out parameter information from time information. The
   variability in the elements in the first few left singular vectors
   predicts any instability that might occur over the complete life-time of
   the system. The key to the approach is the introduction of random
   variables and subsequent co-variance operations. A real-world example

Abstract = {{A well-known operator of sequences over finite field is the derivative,
   which is used to investigate the complexity of sequences in game theory,
   communication theory and cryptography. According to the operator, a
   corresponding complexity of the sequence is called (the first) depth,
   which also contributes to another two definitions (the second and third
   depths) by using polynomial factor and high order difference,
   respectively. For a sequence of period over (a finite field with
   elements and characteristic ), the three depths are the same as its
   linear complexity if . This paper focuses on sequence s of period with
   infinite third depth. For cyclic-left-shift-difference operator on , we
   generally depict circulant matrix structure of the operator for all and
   determine its rank. Furthermore, our results show that the interleaving
   technique really works with difference operator on producing sequences
   with good correlation property and long period, which are constructed
   from 2-level autocorrelation sequences of period except -sequences. The
   method is lightweight since the computation complexity is and only the
   XOR logical operator is used. In addition, ultimate period of a sequence
   is investigated systematically. Some upper bounds on the ultimate period
   and a formula to determine the least ultimate period are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of the formability in multistage forming process is
   very challenging due to the dynamic shift of limiting strain during the
   different stages depending on the tooling geometry and selection of the
   process parameters. Hence, in the present work, a mathematical framework
   is proposed for the estimation of stress based and polar effective
   plastic strain-forming limit diagram (sigma- and PEPS-FLD) using the
   Barlat-89 anisotropic plasticity theory in conjunction with three
   different hardening laws such as Hollomon, Swift, and modified Voce
   equation. Two-stage stretch forming setup had been designed and
   fabricated to first prestrain in an in-plane stretch forming setup, and,
   subsequently, limiting dome height (LDH) testing was carried out on the
   prestrained blanks in the second stage to evaluate the formability. The
   finite element (FE) analysis of these two-stage forming process was
   carried out in LS-DYNA for automotive grade dual-phase (DP) and
   interstitial-free (IF) steels, and the sigma-FLD and PEPS-FLD were used
   as damage model to predict failure. The predicted forming behaviors,
   such as LDH, thinning development, and the load progression, were
   validated with the experimental results. It was found that the LDH in
   the second stage decreased with increase in the prestrain amount, and
   both the sigma-FLD and PEPS-FLD could be able to predict the formability
   considering the deformation histories in the present multistage forming
   process with complex strain path.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of polymer and asphalt content in polymer modified asphalt
   mixture is the aim of road engineers and designers. The purpose of this
   study is to characterize Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) mixture's properties
   containing waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which is a type of
   polymer material. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was designated as a
   new method to measure mixture properties at different PET content and
   asphalt binder value. To fabricate the mixture fresh 80/100 penetration
   grade asphalt binder with different percentages (5-7\% by weight of
   aggregate particles) was utilized. Different amounts of PET were used
   from 0\% to 1\% by weight of aggregate particles. Marshall Stability and
   Flow test was performed on the mixtures. Specific gravity and volumetric
   properties of mixtures were obtained. RSM was used to analyze Marshall
   and volumetric properties of unmodified and PET modified asphalt
   mixtures. Models were produced to fit the experimental results. As shown
   in this study suggested models were successfully fitted to the
   experimental results. Based on the results achieved amounts of 5.88\% of
   asphalt content and 0.18\% of PET were found to be the optimal values.

Abstract = {{Hot deformation behavior of Mg-9Li-3Al-2Sr-2Y alloy was studied via hot
   compression tests in the temperature range of 423-573 K with different
   strain rates ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 s(-1) using the Gleeble (R) 3500
   thermal-mechanical simulation testing system at the University of
   Waterloo. A number of constitutive equation models including the Ludwik,
   Zener-Hollomon and modified Hensel-Spittel models were used to evaluate
   the correct material parameters for this alloy and assessed in terms of
   their ability to accurately predict the constitutive behavior. The
   analysis of the experimental data by the three constitutive models
   resulted in an excellent description of the flow curves. The results
   showed that the Ludwik and Zener-Hollomon models lead to a good
   agreement between the calculated and measured flow stresses during work
   softening. Whereas, the modified Hensel-Spittel equation was able to
   describe the entire deformation process for the deformation temperatures
   studied. The developed models were then applied to predict the stress
   strain behavior of this alloy under different thermomechanical behavior
   paths and showed good accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{36-42}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Binarization is one of the key initial steps in image analysis and
   system understanding. Different types of document degradations make the
   binarization a very challenging task. This paper proposes a statistical
   framework for binarizing degraded document images based on the concept
   of conditional random fields (CRFs). The CRFs are discriminative
   graphical models which model conditional distribution and are used in
   structural classifications. The distribution of binarized images given
   the degraded ones is modelled with respect to a set of informative
   features extracted for all sites of the document image. The recent
   marginal based learning method {[}5] is used for the estimation of
   parameters of the model. The proposed graphical framework enables the
   depending labelling of all the sites of image despite the independent
   pixel-by-pixel binarization of other methods. The performance of our
   system is evaluated on different document image datasets and is compared
   with several well-known binarization methods. Experimental results show
   comparable performance with respect to other state-of-the-art methods.

   different deposition patterns of TiO2 particles on coplanar electrodes

   integrated with the results of SG systems security threat analysis to
   produce a comprehensive, integrated SG SSTM. The SG SSTM in this paper
   helps better depict and understand the vulnerabilities exploited by
   attackers to compromise the components and communication links of the

Abstract = {{This study examined the photocatalytic oxidation of natural organic
   matter (NOM) as a method to mitigate membrane fouling in drinking water
   treatment. ZnO and TiO2 photocatalysts were tested in concentrations
   ranging from 0.05 g L-1 to 0.5 g L-1. Fluorescence peaks were used as
   the primary method to characterize the degradation of three specific NOM
   components - fulvic acid-like humic substances, humic acid-like humic
   substances, and protein-like substances during photocatalytic oxidation.
   Fluorescence peaks and Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection
   (LC-OCD) analysis indicated that higher NOM degradation was obtained by
   photocatalytic oxidation with ZnO than with TiO2. Treatment of the feed
   water by ZnO photocatalytic oxidation was successful in reducing
   considerably the extent of hydraulically reversible and irreversible
   membrane fouling during ultrafiltration (UF) compared to feed water
   treatment with TiO2. Fouling during UF of water subjected to
   photocatalytic oxidation appeared to be caused by low molecular weight
   constituents of NOM generated during photocatalytic oxidation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Tone mapping operators (TMOs) aim to compress high dynamic range (HDR)
   images to low dynamic range (LDR) ones so as to visualize HDR images on
   standard displays. Most existing TMOs were demonstrated on specific
   examples without being thoroughly evaluated using well-designed and
   subject-validated image quality assessment models. A recently proposed
   tone mapped image quality index (TMQI) made one of the first attempts on
   objective quality assessment of tone mapped images. Here, we propose a
   substantially different approach to design TMO. Instead of using any
   predefined systematic computational structure for tone mapping (such as
   analytic image transformations and/or explicit contrast/edge
   enhancement), we directly navigate in the space of all images, searching
   for the image that optimizes an improved TMQI. In particular, we first
   improve the two building blocks in TMQI-structural fidelity and
   statistical naturalness components-leading to a TMQI-II metric. We then
   propose an iterative algorithm that alternatively improves the
   structural fidelity and statistical naturalness of the resulting image.
   Numerical and subjective experiments demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm consistently produces better quality tone mapped images even
   when the initial images of the iteration are created by the most
   competitive TMOs. Meanwhile, these results also validate the superiority
   of TMQI-II over TMQI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an online coordination approach for plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles (PHEVs) charging in smart hybrid AC/DC distribution
   systems. The goal of the proposed method is to optimally charge the
   PHEVs in order to maximize the PHEV owners' satisfaction without
   violating the network constraints. The charging costs, which represent
   the PHEV owners' satisfaction in this work, are based on real-time
   pricing. The proposed approach includes consideration of PHEV owners'
   requirements, PHEV batteries' characteristics, and hybrid distribution
   system limitations. Moreover, a sliding window concept is introduced to
   facilitate managing the PHEV charging and the system interlinking
   converters in realtime. A 38-bus test system has been modified to
   include DC links and. used to validate the developed online charging
   scheme. The test results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Droop control is a key strategy for operating islanded microgrid

   droop parameters for islanded microgrids with wind generation in order
   to minimize the overall island generation costs in the absence of a

   adopted to reflect the special features and operational characteristics
   of droop controlled islanded microgrid systems. The proposed problem
   formulation considers the power flow constraints, voltage and frequency

   constraints. Numerical case studies have been carried out to show the

Abstract = {{In the presence of model-plant mismatch, the set of parameter estimates

   accurately predict the gradients of the optimization problem. Hence, a
   ``two-step{''} approach involving an identification followed by an

   true process optimum. In our recent work,(1) we proposed a new
   identification procedure that progressively corrects the model for
   structural error such that the updated set of parameter estimates
   simultaneously satisfies both identification and optimization objectives
   with a guaranteed convergence to the true optimum. In this paper, we
   expanded our previous methodology in two directions: first, a new model
   correction based on a higher order approximation of model is proposed,
   and second, the effect of model uncertainties is considered explicitly
   by formulating a robust optimization problem at each iteration. The
   resulting improvements are then illustrated using a simulated study of
   fed-batch penicillin production process.}},

Abstract = {{Parameters for an electrochemistry-based Lithium-ion battery model are
   estimated using the homotopy optimization approach. A high-fidelity
   model of the battery is presented based on chemical and electrical
   phenomena. Equations expressing the conservation of species and charge
   for the solid and electrolyte phases are combined with the kinetics of
   the electrodes to obtain a system of differential-algebraic equations
   (DAEs) governing the dynamic behavior of the battery. The presence of
   algebraic constraints in the governing dynamic equations makes the
   optimization problem challenging: a simulation is performed in each
   iteration of the optimization procedure to evaluate the objective
   function, and the initial conditions must be updated to satisfy the
   constraints as the parameter values change. The e-embedding method is
   employed to convert the original DAEs into a singularly perturbed system
   of ordinary differential equations, which are then used to simulate the
   system efficiently. The proposed numerical procedure demonstrates
   excellent performance in the estimation of parameters for the
   Lithium-ion battery model, compared to direct methods that are either
   unstable or incapable of converging. The obtained results and estimated
   parameters demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed simulation approach
   and homotopy optimization procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, a laser processing protocol for heat treatment of
   micro-scale printed graphene patterns is developed, and the results are
   compared with the counterpart results obtained by the conventional heat
   treatment process carried out in a furnace. A continuous-wave Erbium
   fiber laser is used to enhance electrical properties of the aerosol-jet
   printed graphene patterns through removing solvents and a stabilizer
   polymer. The laser power and the process speed are optimized to
   effectively treat the printed patterns without compromising the quality
   of the graphene flakes. Furthermore, a heat transfer model is developed
   and its results are utilized to optimize the laser treatment process. It
   is found that the laser heat treatment process with a laser speed of
   0.03 mm s(-1), a laser beam diameter similar to 50 mu m, and a laser
   power of 10 W results in pure graphene patterns with no excessive
   components. The ratio of D to G bands (I-D/I-G) in Raman graph of the
   laser treated pure graphene, which is an indicator of the level of the
   active defects in graphene structures, is 0.52. The laser treated pure
   graphene structures also have a C/O ratio and an electrical resistivity
   of similar to 4.5 and 0.022 Omega cm, respectively. These values are
   fairly comparable with the results of samples treated in a furnace. The
   results suggest that the laser processing has the capability of removing
   stabilizer polymers and solvents through a localized moving heat source,
   which is preferable for flexible electronics with low working
   temperature substrates.}},

Abstract = {{A highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst that consists
   of cobalt oxide nanocrystals (Co3O4 NC) decorated on the surface of
   N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) is introduced as effective electrode
   material for electrically rechargeable zinc-air batteries. This active
   hybrid catalyst is synthesized by a facile surfactant-assisted method to
   produce Co3O4 NC that are then decorated on the surface of N-CNT through
   hydrophobic attraction. Confirmed by half-cell testing, Co3O4 NC/N-CNT
   demonstrates superior oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalytic
   activities and has a superior electrochemical stability compared to Pt/C
   and Ir/C. Furthermore, rechargeable zinc-air battery testing of Co3O4
   NC/N-CNT reveals superior galvanodynamic charge and discharge voltages
   with a significantly extended cycle life of over 100 h, which suggests
   its potential as a replacement for precious-metal-based catalysts for
   electric vehicles and grid energy storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to improve the quantitative determination of
   dopant concentration in semiconductor nanowire (NW) arrays using
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). SIMS measurements were used to
   determine Be dopant concentrations in a Be-doped GaAs thin film and NW
   arrays of various pitches that were dry-etched from the same film. A
   comparison of these measurements revealed a factor of 3 to 12
   difference, depending on the NW array pitch, between the secondary Be
   ion yields of the film and the NW arrays, despite being identically
   doped. This was due to matrix effects and ion beam mixing of Be from the
   NWs into the surrounding benzocyclobutene that was used to fill the
   space between the NWs. This indicates the need for etched NWs to be used
   as doping standards instead of 2D films when evaluating NWs of unknown
   doping by SIMS. Using the etched NWs as doping standards, NW arrays of
   various pitches grown by the vapour-liquid-solid mechanism were
   characterized by SIMS to yield valuable insights into doping mechanisms.

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in highly deformable smart materials have lead to
   increasing interest in small-scale energy harvesting research for
   powering low consumption electronic devices. One such recent
   experimental study by Goushcha et al. explored energy harvesting from a
   passing vortex ring by a cantilevered smart material plate oriented
   parallel to and offset from the path of the ring in an otherwise
   quiescent fluid. The present study focuses on modeling this experimental
   study using potential flow to facilitate optimization of the energy
   extraction from the passing ring to raise the energy harvesting
   potential of the device. The problem is modeled in two-dimensions with
   the vortex ring represented as a pair of counter-rotating free vortices.
   Vortex pair parameters are determined to match the convection speed of
   the ring in the experiments, as well as the imposed pressure loading on
   the plate. The plate is approximated as a Kirchhoff-Love plate and
   represented as a finite length vortex sheet in the fluid domain. The
   analytical model matches experimental measurements, including the tip
   displacement, the integrated force along the entire plate length as a
   function of vortex ring position, and the pressure along the plate. The
   potential flow solution is employed in a parametric study of the
   governing dimensionless parameters in an effort to guide the selection
   of plate properties for optimal energy harvesting performance. Results
   of the study indicate an optimal set of plate properties for a given
   vortex ring configuration, in which the time-scale of vortex advection
   matches that of the plate vibration. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   equilibrium of the complex-valued neural networks are also established
   by using a delay differential inequality. These results are easy to
   apply to the study of the complex-valued neural networks whether their
   activation functions are explicitly expressed by separating their real

   given to highlight the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study reports novel kinds of high tensile strength alkaline
   anion-exchange membranes composed of imidazolium-functionalized anion
   exchange polymer electrolytes. The membranes were prepared by a combined
   thermal and chemical cross-linking of poly (vinyl alcohol) and poly
   (3-methyl-1-vinylimidazolium chloride)-co-(1-vinylpyrrolidone)
   (PMVIC-co-VP). Characterizations by AC impedance technique, mechanical
   property, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), along with the water uptake,
   alkaline resistance and oxidation stability were carried out on the
   membranes consisting of different PVA/PVA-PMVIC-co-VP mass ratios to
   evaluate their applicability in alkaline fuel cells. The membrane in a
   mass ratio of 1: 0.4 exhibited high tensile stress at break in the range
   of 59.3 similar to 76.6 MPa, and the elongation at break around 9.2
   similar to 14.9\%, depending on the annealing temperature from 130
   similar to 190 degrees C. The OH- conductivity of the membranes was
   found to be increased with increasing annealing temperature and mass
   ratio, and reached high up to 1.7 x 10(-2) S cm(-1). Besides, the
   membranes showed perfect oxidation stability in 30\% H2O2 for 250 hours
   with no obvious weight loss was observed. XPS analysis indicated that
   some degradation occurred when the membrane was exposed to 8 M KOH at 85
   degrees C for 312 h, but no lessened OH- conductivity was detected. SEM
   pictures revealed an ordered microvoid structure with pore size ca. 100
   similar to 150 nm uniformly dispersed on the membrane surface, which
   imparted the PVA/PVA-PMVIC-co-VP membrane with good OH- conductivity.

Abstract = {{Nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped mesoporous carbons (NSMCs) have been
   fabricated through a facile template-mediated pyrolyzing method using
   poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) as sources of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C),
   ferrous sulfate(FeSO4 7H(2)O) as both precursor of sulfur (S) and
   activation reagent along with nanoscaled silica as sacrificial supports.
   The composition, morphology, and microstructure of the products are
   characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
   nitrogen sorption analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It
   reveals that these NSMCs possess a BET surface area over 1064 m(2)g(-1)
   and abundant mesoporous structure with pore size ranged from 4 to 20 nm.
   The atomic percentages of N and S functionalities are found to be 4.00
   at.\% N and 0.83 at.\% S, indication of successful incorporation of both
   nitrogenand sulfur into carbon network. Benefiting from the
   aforementioned characteristics, these NSMCs show perfect supercapacitive
   performances, which have been demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and
   constant-current charge/discharge cycling techniques. In 0.5 M H2SO4
   electrolyte, the specific capacitance (SC) of the as-prepared NSMCs
   electrode can reach 280 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Even at a
   high rate capability of 100 A/g, the NSMCs electrode still shows the SC
   value as high as 232 F/g, retaining 83\% of that at 1 A/g. Also, the
   electrode exhibits excellent charge/discharge cycling stability, and no
   measurable capacitance losses is observed even after 5000 cycles, making
   them potentially promising for high-performance energy storage devices.

Abstract = {{The vulcanization of natural rubber (NR)-blended
   acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was carried out with a phenolic
   curing agent by a melt-mixing process. The NR compound was first
   prepared before blending with ABS. The effects of the phenolic curative
   contents (10, 15, and 20 phr) and blend proportions (NR/ABS ratio=50 :
   50, 60 : 40, and 70 : 30) on the mechanical, dynamic, thermal, and
   morphological properties of the vulcanized NR/ABS blends were
   investigated. The tensile strength and hardness of the blends increased
   with increasing ABS content, whereas the elongation at break decreased.
   The strength property resulting from the thermoplastic component and the
   vulcanized NR was an essential component for improving the elasticity of
   the blends. These blends showed a greater elastic response than the neat
   ABS. The thermal stability of the blends increased with increasing ABS
   component. Scanning electron micrographs of the blends showed a
   two-phase morphology system. The vulcanized 60 : 40 NR/ABS blend with
   15-phr phenolic resin showed a uniform styrene-co-acrylonitrile phase
   dispersed in the vulcanized NR phase; it provided better dispersion
   between the NR and ABS phases, and this resulted in superior elastic
   properties. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015,

Abstract = {{Hierarchically designed structures with architectural features that span
   across multiple length scales are found in numerous hard biomaterials,
   like bone, wood, and glass sponge skeletons, as well as manmade
   structures, like the Eiffel Tower. It has been hypothesized that their
   mechanical robustness and damage tolerance stem from sophisticated
   ordering within the constituents, but the specific role of hierarchy
   remains to be fully described and understood. We apply the principles of
   hierarchical design to create structural metamaterials from three
   material systems: (i) polymer, (ii) hollow ceramic, and (iii)
   ceramic-polymer composites that are patterned into self-similar unit
   cells in a fractal-like geometry. In situ nanomechanical experiments
   revealed (i) a nearly theoretical scaling of structural strength and
   stiffness with relative density, which outperforms existing
   nonhierarchical nanolattices; (ii) recoverability, with hollow alumina
   samples recovering up to 98\% of their original height after compression
   to >= 50\% strain; (iii) suppression of brittle failure and structural
   instabilities in hollow ceramic hierarchical nanolattices; and (iv) a
   range of deformation mechanisms that can be tuned by changing the
   slenderness ratios of the beams. Additional levels of hierarchy beyond a
   second order did not increase the strength or stiffness, which suggests
   the existence of an optimal degree of hierarchy to amplify resilience.
   We developed a computational model that captures local stress
   distributions within the nanolattices under compression and explains
   some of the underlying deformation mechanisms as well as validates the
   measured effective stiffness to be interpreted as a metamaterial
   property.}},
