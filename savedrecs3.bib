Abstract = {{To meet the growing demand for potable water, desalinated water is
   becoming a significant component of the overall water supply. As a
   result, there is an increased need to understand how the addition of
   desalinated water within aging water distribution systems impacts water
   quality and the ability to deliver safe drinking water when unlined cast
   iron pipes and cement mortar-lined cast iron pipes are both present in
   the distribution systems. In this paper, we studied the relationship of
   turbidity, total iron content, and the effects of pH, alkalinity, and
   hardness on the dissolved silica. Then, we presented the mathematical
   and pilot-scale empirical development and quantification of three
   nonlinear regression models and used pH, alkalinity, total hardness,
   temperature, and hydraulic retention time as water quality variables.
   The dependent variables were the total iron concentration, the increase
   in turbidity, and the concentration of dissolved silica. Based on the
   three models, which use a genetic algorithm, an integrated solution for
   simultaneously minimizing the release of iron, the increase of
   turbidity, and the dissolved silica content was presented. This solution
   provides an economical and efficientmethod for water plants to identify
   specific water quality parameters that require adjustment to maintain an
   acceptable water quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the output regulation problem for a class of
   regular first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE)
   systems. A state feedback and an error feedback regulator are considered
   to force the output of the hyperbolic PDE plant to track a periodic
   reference trajectory generated by a neutrally stable exosystem. A new
   explanation is given to extend the results in the literature to solve
   the regulation problem associated with the first-order hyperbolic PDE
   systems. Moreover, in order to provide the closed-loop stability
   condition for the solvability of the regulator problems, the design of
   stabilising feedback gain and its dual problem design of stabilising
   output injection gain are considered in this paper. This paper develops
   an easy method to obtain an adjustable stabilising feedback gain and
   stabilising output injection gain with the aid of the operator Riccati

Abstract = {{The porous nanofiber Co doped Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-delta (PrBaMnO) is
   successfully synthesized through electrospinning technology and served

   composite catalyst consisting of 50 wt\% perovskite catalyst and 50 wt\%
   carbon black (CB) is investigated in alkaline solution. Comparing to the
   PrBaMnO parent perovskite, remarkable enhancement of ORR and OER
   performance are achieved on Pr0.5Ba0.5MnCo0.2O3-delta with respect to
   decreased overpotential and increased current density. A maximum current
   density of 19.4 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 1.95 V (versus. RHE) on Co
   doped Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-delta electrospun nanofiber/CB composite catalyst
   in OER. In addition, a preferable four electron transfer pathway is
   demonstrated in the ORR process. All the electrochemical test results

Abstract = {{Local descriptors have been one of the most intensively examined
   mechanisms of image analysis. In this paper, we propose a new chain
   code-based local descriptor. Unlike many other descriptors existing in
   the literature, this descriptor is based on string values, which are
   obtained when starting from a particular point of the image and
   searching for extrema in a given neighborhood and memorizing a path
   being traversed through the consequent pixels of the image. We
   demonstrate that this approach is efficient and helps us preserve both
   local and global properties of the object. To compare the words we apply
   the Levenshtein distance. Moreover, four similarity measures
   (correlation, histogram intersection, chi-square, and Hellinger) are
   used to compare the histograms of words in the process of
   classification.}},

Abstract = {{mm-Wave communications and massive MIMO are two promising technologies
   to increase the capacity and coverage of future cellular networks.
   Channel sparsity, where there exist only few propagation paths enabling
   signal transmission to and reception from mobile users, is a key
   property of mm-Wave channels. In this paper, we consider the downlink
   transmission over a sparse massive MIMO channel and propose a novel path
   selection algorithm to maximize sum rate. We introduce a bipartite
   graph, which connects angle of departure (AoD) to users in the
   beam-space domain. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed

Abstract = {{Solar photovoltaic systems are becoming increasingly popular as
   industries try to decrease their carbon footprint. This paper presents a
   generic optimization framework and examines a case study where a flat
   rooftop located in Edmonton, Alberta is investigated for the
   installation of a photovoltaic array. The objectives of this study are
   to maximize power generation while minimizing the system cost. This case
   study represents a proposed generic framework that fulfills this
   optimization problem. Solar power generation per month is forecasted
   using historical generation data. Panels can be installed at different
   tilt angles and varying inter-row spacing in order to achieve the
   optimal design. Designing an effective layout is important when
   installing solar panels, as the increased shade coverage or the wide
   variation from the normal angle of the sun can result in a loss of
   energy generation. The capital cost and payback period for the
   investment are also important factors when determining whether or not a
   photovoltaic system layout (inter-row spacing, tilt angle, etc.) is
   considered optimal. Analytic hierarchy process is used to weigh the
   decision factors and determine the optimal layout.}},

Abstract = {{Linked Open Data (LOD) consists of numerous data stores that are highly
   interconnected. LOD stores use Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a
   data representation format. A graph-based nature of RDF brings an
   opportunity to develop new approaches for accumulating data from
   multiple sources characterized by different levels of confidence in
   them.
   Recently, a participatory learning mechanism has been extended to cope
   with RDF. It is an attractive way of integrating new pieces of
   information with already known ones. Further, it has been recognized
   that pieces of information describing entities can have a disjunctive or
   conjunctive form.
   This paper uses an RDF-based participatory learning process to aggregate
   information obtained from multiple data stores. This process provides
   mechanisms that determine overall certainty in combined data based on
   levels of confidence in already known pieces of information and new
   ones. The behavior of such a process used for integrating information
   equipped with different levels of uncertainty is presented, and a simple
   case study is included.}},

   reasoning with granules and multi-level granular structures give to our
   approach an added value when dealing with a large number of evidence and

   understanding of how granules of hypotheses approximate a class of
   dangerous hypotheses, with clear benefits when analysts have to take
   decision on classifying a group of hypotheses or setting a proper level

Abstract = {{Ambient backscatter, a new communication technology, can permit
   battery-free devices to communicate with other devices through
   reflecting the ambient radio frequency signals. One challenge for
   ambient backscatter communication system is to recover the backscattered
   information bits hidden in the received signals. Existing solutions are
   mainly based on energy detector and thus provide poor performance at low
   signal noise ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, a detection algorithm
   based on statistical covariances is suggested in this paper.
   Specifically, we calculate the distributions of two covariance-based
   statistics, design the detection rule, and then derive the closed-form
   expressions for detection probability and bit error rate (BER). It is
   found that our proposed algorithm outperforms the energy detector at low
   SNR regions. Finally, the simulation results are provided to corroborate
   our theoretical studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new medium access control (MAC) protocol for low
   power sensor devices, suitable for IoT systems. IEEE 802.15.4 standard
   is suitable for low power wireless personal area network (WPAN) but it
   does not satisfy the data rate and reliability requirements for IoT
   systems in a 5G wireless network. We have observed that unnecessary
   packet drop takes place due to beacon superframe broadcasting during
   data transmission and it is the primary reason for the standard's
   data-rate and reliability shortfall. This problem represents a scenario
   where data transmission takes place with the lack of available time for
   data transmission in that superframe duration. To overcome this lacuna,
   we incorporate backoff freezing mechanism, where the backoff counter
   freezes whenever the available time for data transmission is
   insufficient in that superframe duration. A novel sleep protocol is
   designed to reduce power consumption in idle states too. The proposed
   MAC protocol is modeled using a 3-dimensional Markov chain for
   analytical performance evaluation. Analytical results are verified with
   the simulation run in ns-2.35. Proposed MAC with sleep protocol
   significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Under the real-time electricity pricing environment in smart grid,
   building owners are faced with the indoor temperature control problem to
   minimize the daily electricity cost. Taking the heating scenario as an
   example, an intuitive strategy is to maintain the building's indoor
   temperature always at the lower bound of the predetermined comfort
   range. However, this strategy may not always achieve the lowest
   electricity bill, especially with the significant fluctuation of
   electricity prices. On the other hand, the cost minimization problem can
   be optimally solved one day ahead in a temporally-coupled manner, but
   the challenge lies in that the building owner needs to acquire the
   accurate information of electricity prices and outdoor temperatures of
   the next day, which may not be available. In this paper, we equivalently
   decouple the cost minimization problem into subproblems at each hour.
   Each subproblem can be temporally decoupled and optimally solved, only
   requiring the next-hour electricity price. Besides, the
   temporally-decoupled algorithm explicitly indicates when to take
   advantage of preheating/cooling for electricity cost reduction. It is
   demonstrated with the real data that our proposed algorithm could result
   in considerable economic savings compared with the intuitive strategy,
   paving the way towards practically applicable cost-effective smart

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the experience of the authors in quantitatively
   assessing the development process of an Eastern European software SME
   (Small or Medium Size Enterprise). The company produces a very
   successful workflow and documentation tool, features about 30 full time
   developers and has a customer base of about 40 major organizations. It
   has hired the authors as consultants to address quality and productivity
   issues raised by the upper management and customers. The adopted
   approach is based on systemic analysis, and starts with a comprehensive
   GQM session with the top managers of the company, to fully define the
   scope of work, and progresses analysing the documentation, interviewing
   the manager and the lead developers, and quantitatively analysing the
   issue tracking system in place. Specific attention is placed in
   identifying ``schismogenesis{''}, situations that may lead to
   unresolvable conflicts. The approach has been proven successful in
   providing a result in short forecasted timeframe, and systemic analysis
   has been effective in spotting the most critical situations present in
   the company. The result has been a set of prioritized recommendations,
   centered first in eliminating the schismogenetic situations and then
   ranging from adopting a more quantitative process control, to streamline
   the activities, to organize a line of product.}},

   conventional modular multilevel converter (MMC), HMC requires less

Abstract = {{In this paper, a robust decentralized controller is designed for

   systems of a generator in an islanded microgrid with multiple

   this paper includes multiple local droop controllers, as well as robust
   decentralized controller that are designed and optimized independently
   by using the mu-synthesis technique. These controllers account for the
   dynamic coupling among the areas of the islanded microgrid without any
   communication links required among the local controllers. Moreover,
   these controllers are designed to be robust to the variations of
   different parameters of the microgrid, and hence improve the voltage and

Abstract = {{Unbalanced voltage has adverse effects on power electronic interfacing
   converters (IFCs) operation such as output power oscillations, DC link
   voltage oscillations and peak current increase. These adverse effects
   can be aggregated in parallel IFCs with common DC and AC link, which are
   commonly used to connect AC and DC subsystems in hybrid AC/DC microgrid
   or to interface high-power distributed generations/storage elements to
   AC subsystem. In this paper, two novel control strategies for parallel
   IFCs operation under unbalanced voltage are proposed, which are focusing
   on active power oscillation cancellation and sharing of collective peak
   current of parallel IFCs among IFCs considering their power ratings. In
   the first proposed control strategy, IFCs' power coefficient factors are
   controlled for cancellation of active power oscillation and collective
   peak current sharing of parallel IFCs. In the second proposed control
   strategy, IFCs' peak currents are controlled for controlling targets. In
   this paper, individual and parallel IFCs' peak currents are thoroughly
   studied, and their relationship with active power oscillation
   cancellation are analyzed. Based on analysis, it is proven that
   collective peak current of parallel IFCs is constant under zero active
   power oscillation in the fixed average active powers output. Both
   proposed control strategies ensure the peak currents of individual IFCs
   to be approximately in-phase with collective peak current of parallel
   IFCs, which provide minimum peak currents summation of IFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage control strategy has been observed as being more advantageous
   than current control strategy for microgrid applications where
   grid-connected and standalone operation of grid-supporting inverters are
   desired. Voltage control, however, limits the ability to directly
   control the inverter current. As a result, the fault ride-through or the
   low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability becomes more challenging to
   address. This paper develops a method for addressing this challenge by
   adding an auxiliary controller to the main voltage control system to
   enable the inverter to ride through the grid faults and inject a
   balanced current with controlled real and reactive components. Moreover,
   soft transition into the fault and out from the fault is achieved by the
   proposed controller. Derivations, partial stability analysis and
   detailed simulation results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating current has been the major concern for the implementing of
   paralleled converters. Extensive studies have been conducted in reducing
   the circulating current with different modulation strategies. However
   existing methods are either suffering from poor performances or too
   complicated for implementation. This paper proposes an interleaved
   carrier phase-shift (ICPS) PWM to reduce the peak value of the high
   frequency common mode circulating current (HF-CMCC). The proposed method
   can be used in the system with arbitrary number of VSCs, which makes the
   method very suitable for modular design. In addition, the ICPS PWM is
   very simple for implementation. Theoretical analysis is presented in
   this paper to explain the effectiveness of ICPS PWM on CMCC peak value
   reduction. The proposed method has been verified and compared with the
   interleaved SPWM (ISPWM) in simulation and experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Switching patterns are described for balancing the voltages of series
   connected Li-ion polymer batteries using non-dissipative cascaded
   modular power electronics. A balancing circuit is connected to two
   battery cells and consists of an asymmetrical half-bridge and a high
   frequency transformer. This reduces the number of switches and diodes to
   an average of one per battery. A balancing circuit or module can balance
   the voltage of two batteries by using two magnetically coupled windings
   connected to the centre tap of the two batteries: intra-bridge voltage
   balancing. Each module is coupled to adjacent modules by connecting
   transformer windings. Two fundamental control methods are described for
   transferring electrical charge between the batteries in adjacent
   modules: inter-bridge voltage balancing. Both control methods,
   ``2-switch flyback control{''} and ``phase-shifted control{''}, assume
   that each module determines its own switching pattern by monitoring the
   dc voltages in each of its adjacent modules. The relative merits of both
   controllers are described. Simulated and experimental results are
   presented for both controllers to validate the charge transfer methods
   used.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional monitoring systems for transmission and distribution (T\&D)
   networks are only installed in substations, so there is no real-time and
   accurate power information available for on-site power quality
   monitoring and equipment maintenance. This issue increases the fault
   risk in T\&D networks, and degrades the reliability and quality of power
   supply. Moreover, it is often difficult and time-consuming to assess the
   monitoring devices installed in plants and industries. This situation
   has caused engineers severe inconvenience in determining the source of
   harmonic disturbances. This study proposes a contactless remote method
   to determine voltage harmonic distortion. The proposed algorithm is
   based on electric field measurement. The simulation results show that
   the proposed algorithm, involving the use of only three electric field
   sensors with the known arrangement geometries of transmission systems,
   can achieve an accurate harmonic distortion determination.}},

Abstract = {{The electric vehicle (EV), a promising technique to reduce
   transportation emissions, is one of the most important household
   appliances for demand response. Under the real-time pricing environment
   in smart grid, EV owners are faced with the EV charging scheduling
   problem to minimize electricity cost. Existing works focused on offline
   solutions or Markov decision processes which require full or statistical
   priori knowledge of future real-time prices (RTPs). This may not be
   practical as it is difficult to predict future RTPs especially for long
   horizons. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal online algorithm via
   primal-dual approach, requiring very little priori knowledge, i.e., the
   upper bound of future RTPs. The competitive ratio of the online
   algorithm is derived. It is demonstrated with real price data from
   Ameren Corporation that our proposed online algorithm can result in
   considerable economic savings, compared with existing schemes which only
   consider RTPs.}},

Abstract = {{With the high demand for renewable energy sources such as wind turbines,
   the future distribution systems and/or microgrids will face more
   challenges in energy management, due to the intermittency of renewable
   power generation. By buffering such uncertain power supplies, community
   energy storage (CES) systems can provide dispatchable capacities and are
   effective tools to harness renewable power in a community. However, the
   dispatch of a CES system is complicated due to the randomness in its
   state-of-charge (SoC) and thus, the randomness in dispatchable
   capacities. In order to address this problem, a stochastic model of a
   CES system with wind power generation is reported in this paper. The
   power generation of each wind turbine is modelled using a Markov
   modulated rate process (MMRP), while the CES system is modelled as a
   queueing system with heterogeneous sources and constant output. Based on
   a diffusion approximation of the queue length, a closed-form
   representation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the SoC
   of CES system can be derived. The analytical model is validated by a
   case study based on the wind power generation data obtained from the
   Changling Wind Farm in Jilin Province of Northeast China.}},

Abstract = {{The derivative based prediction (DBP) is an algorithm for reducing the
   number of messages needed to transfer the data samples from a wireless
   sensor node to a sink, in real-time. The algorithm computes a linear fit
   over the time series and sends only the updates of the linear model to
   the sink, when needed. This paper presents two extensions of the
   original algorithm that further decrease the number of data packets sent
   to the sink. The first variant, called delayed DBP, computes the slope
   of the linear fit using data points in front of and after the model
   reference point, as opposed to the basic DBP, which uses the reference
   point itself. The second extension, DBP with look-ahead, is based on the
   Delayed DBP but uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict several
   points from the future for the slope computation. All three algorithms
   have been implemented and simulated on a temperature time series. DBP
   reduced the number of required transmissions to transfer the entire
   dataset to 4.4 \%, Delayed DBP to 2.6 \% while introducing 7.5 minutes
   of delay and DBP with look ahead to 4 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is a technique to help power
   companies monitor and analyze residential energy usage. Aggregated power
   load measurements are disaggregated into individual appliance loads by
   examining the appliance-specific power consumption characteristics. This
   data can then be used to modify consumer behaviors via detailed billing
   data and/or demand-pricing tariffs. A number of advances in the field
   have been reported in the past two decades, many of which apply machine
   learning algorithms. However, these algorithms only assign one label to
   an example, which is a poor match to the NIALM problem, meaning
   elaborate encodings or classifier ensembles are needed for NIALM. A more
   elegant solution would be to use algorithms that assign multiple labels
   to a single example. These multi-label classification algorithms have
   received very little attention in this field to date. We conduct an
   experimental investigation of four multi-label classification algorithms
   for nonintrusive monitoring, and find that they are superior to all
   prior reported results on a real-world household dataset.}},

Abstract = {{General partial differential equations, which can describe any complex
   functions, may be solved by an adapted method of the similarity analysis
   that models polynomial data relations of discrete observations. The
   proposed new differential polynomial networks define and substitute for
   a selective form of the general partial differential equation using
   fraction derivative units to model an unknown system or pattern.
   Convergent series of relative derivative substitution terms, produced in
   all network layers, describe the partial derivative changes of some
   combinations of input variables to generalize elementary polynomial data
   relations. The general differential equation is decomposed into
   polynomial network backward structure, which defines simple and
   composite sum derivative terms in respect of previous layers variables.
   The proposed method enables to form more complex and varied derivative
   selective series models than standard soft-computing techniques. The
   sigmoidal function, commonly employed as an activation function in
   artificial neurons, may improve the abilities of the polynomial networks
   and substituting derivative terms to approximate complicated periodic
   multi-variable or time-series functions in a system model.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a new approach to the problem of face
   classification, which relies on the linguistic description of the facial
   features. In this method, face descriptors are represented through the
   Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and formalized as information granules.
   Moreover, neural networks are used to construct efficient classifiers.
   Furthermore, with usage of AHP we realize a transition from the
   linguistic description of the facial features to the vectors of numbers
   that are used by a neural network in the process of matching faces. The
   results of experiments demonstrate the potential applicability of our
   proposal to the forensic investigations. Finally, discussed are
   important aspects of constructing neural networks regarded as a vehicle
   to perform classification process.}},

Abstract = {{Face recognition by computers in recent years has been a topic of
   intensive studies. In this problem, we witness several challenges: one
   has to cope with large data sets, solve problems of data extraction, and
   deal with poor quality of images caused by e.g., poor lighting of the
   subject. There have been a lot of algorithms and classifiers developed,
   which are aimed at recognizing faces of individuals. In this paper, we
   present a novel classification method, which involves a collection of
   classifiers with a certain utility function regarded as an aggregation
   operator. The nearest neighbor method with various similarity measures
   is used as a generic classifier for selected face areas. The main task
   is to assign photos of a person to one of the classes of image present
   in the available database. This problem is similar to the
   decision-making process with some evident analogies. If in face
   recognition, a single classifier is being used, the problem becomes
   similar to the one of decision-making with a single criterion. When
   having several classifiers, the problem resembles a problem of a
   multi-criteria decision making. The second scenario requires an
   aggregation of the results produced by different classifiers. The paper
   presents the use of the utility function which is well-known in the
   decision-making theory as an aggregation operator applied to the results
   of various classifiers. The study is focused on the two-factor utility
   function and its variants.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a dissipativity based robust stability analysis and control
   design for plantwide chemical processes. A plantwide process is
   represented as a network of process units (subsystems) interconnected
   via mass and energy flows (e.g., material recycle and energy
   integration) and controlled by a network of controllers. In this
   analysis, the dynamical properties of process units are captured by
   their dissipativity. The plantwide stability is determined based on the
   dissipativity of each process unit and the network topology. To perform
   robust stability analysis, the process units are represented using LPV
   models which accommodate their uncertainties and a method is developed
   to determine the dissipativity (the storage function and the supply
   rate) of process units as a function of the scheduling variable. By
   polytopic LPV modelling, a dynamical system can be represented as the
   linear combination of the models at convex vertices. This allows the
   proposed dissipativity to be determined based on the dissipativity of
   each model at vertices. This plantwide analysis is based on the
   dissipativity of the LPV models of process units rather than the model
   for the entire plant and as such it very scalable. In this work, the
   results include: (1) determining dissipativity for LPV systems (2)
   robust analysis on the effects of uncertainties in process units on the
   stability of the plantwide system (3) robust control design for
   plantwide systems.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic data reconciliation and gross error detection ask for an
   accurate physical model, e.g. a state-space model, based on which
   measurement noise and gross errors can be quantitatively assessed. The
   model can be established based on either first-principle knowledge or
   process operation data. This work considers a case with limited
   first-principle knowledge and imperfect operation data, which is
   inspired by a real industrial process. We seek to develop a dynamic
   model using operation data contaminated by not only measurement noise
   but also gross errors, which conforms to known static constraints such
   as mass balance. Probabilistic slow feature analysis (PSFA) is adopted
   to describe dynamics of both nominal variations and gross errors, and
   model parameters are estimated by means of the expectation maximization
   (EM) algorithm. Data from an industrial slurry preparation process are
   used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. (C) 2016,

Abstract = {{The distributed framework has been considered as one promising framework
   for the control of large-scale systems. In this work, we propose a
   coordination algorithm for distributed moving horizon state estimators
   (MHEs) for discrete-time linear systems composed of subsystems. In the
   proposed coordinated distributed MHE (CDMHE) scheme, each subsystem is
   associated with a local MHE. In the design of a local MHE, a
   coordinating term is incorporated into its cost function which is
   determined by an upper-layer coordinator. At each sampling time, a local
   MHE estimates its local state and system noise, then sends them to the
   coordinator. The coordinator calculates a price vector based on
   information received from all the local MHEs and sends the price vector
   together with the calculated interaction estimates to each local MHE.
   The above steps are performed iteratively every sampling time. It is
   shown that the CDMHE scheme is able to achieve the estimation
   performance of the corresponding centralized design if convergence at
   each sampling time is ensured. A simulation study based on a chemical
   process is used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme.}},

   distributions of the states on the event-triggered measurement

Abstract = {{Simulation has long been used in the construction domain to model
   construction systems. Simulation techniques (e.g., discrete event
   simulation, system dynamics, and agent-based modeling) are well-equipped
   to handle complex systems; however, they fail to account for the
   subjective uncertainties present in many construction systems. Fuzzy
   logic, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for dealing with subjective
   uncertainty; therefore, integrating these two techniques is advantageous

Abstract = {{In Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making (MCGDM) problems, aggregation
   and consensus methods are two key elements in reaching an overall
   collective value representing the group of experts making the decision.
   In many instances, the assessment process is based on linguistic terms
   rather than numerical values. Therefore, fuzzy aggregation and fuzzy
   consensus methods are more suitable for dealing with the linguistic
   terms used to reach the final decision. First, we present fuzzy set
   theory, fuzzy aggregation, and fuzzy consensus. Then, we describe a
   process for integrating fuzzy aggregation and fuzzy consensus in group
   decision-making problems. This process considers the aggregation of
   multiple criteria used for evaluation as well as the degree of consensus
   between the experts. Finally, we present a hypothetical case study to
   implement the developed process in MCGDM related to contractor
   selection. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by developing
   a process that applies fuzzy aggregation and fuzzy consensus in solving
   MCGDM problems in construction. Furthermore, through the application of
   fuzzy set theory in aggregation and consensus, the developed process
   assists decision makers in problems that encompass subjectivity and
   uncertainty in their assessment.}},

   analysis of stochastic and dynamic complex systems in both academic and

   Modeling, and hybrid approaches, e. g., combined discrete- continuous
   simulation, etc. Each of these simulation methods works best for certain
   types of problems. In this paper, a discrete- continuous simulation
   approach is described for studying train and pedestrian traffic
   interactions for purposes of decision support. A practical operations
   problem related to commodity train operation within two small towns in

Abstract = {{Pipe spool fabrication is the most vital process to the successful
   delivery of industrial construction project. Due to the various
   combinations of pipe attributes in terms of Nominal Pipe Size (NPS),
   Pipe Schedule, and material, it is hard for practitioners to estimate
   the pipe welding quality performance based on the available historical
   data. This paper aims to develop a Bayesian Inference based simulation
   approach to assist making good estimates of welds fraction nonconforming
   for proposing a new project to clients. In this proposed approach, the
   pipe welding inspection process is first modeled as a Bernoulli process.
   Utilizing the tracked historical inspection data, Jeffreys Intervals are
   estimated for determining the distributions of welds fraction
   nonconforming. These distributions can serve as the inputs for Monte
   Carlo Simulation to incorporate uncertainties for fabricators'
   decision-making process. The simulation results demonstrate good
   reliability and accuracy compared to the actual project welds repair
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{The global material supply chain for modular construction, consisting of
   assemblies prefabrication, material delivery and handling, module
   assembly, and site installation, can be regarded as a ``Big Site{''}
   problem. With a combination of various transportation modes (i.e.,
   trucks, ships, and rails), insufficient logistic planning on the
   capacity and time availability of unloading bays and transportation
   resources potentially delays material arrival dates on an industrial
   construction site and field installation schedules. Previous related
   research in construction engineering and project management domain
   largely focused on matching material supply with site demand without
   emphasis on logistics and supply chain management. A special purpose
   simulation template is developed based on the Simphony platform to
   facilitate the simulation modeling of module fabrication,
   transportation, assembly, and installation processes. System performance
   indicators are adapted from port management literature in order to
   assess different scenarios of modular construction planning. A case
   study representing modular construction practice is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Modular construction has been a widely used method for industrial
   construction in Alberta. Heavy piperack modules are prefabricated and
   assembled offsite and transported to site for installation, which
   minimizes the impact of Alberta's harsh weather and improves efficiency.
   Such projects are large in scale, ranging from hundreds of modules to
   thousands; because of this, project planning often requires a relatively
   long period of time. At the front-end engineering design stage,
   information is limited, but the planning is critical for determining the
   appropriate cranes, locations, and lift sequences. To ensure sound
   planning, information must be extracted from the 3D models, which can be
   tedious without automation, and engineering analyses are required for
   crane location selection. This paper introduces a data-driven management
   system used for project planning. The outputs include selection of crane
   with locations considering site constraints. Valid automation is
   implemented in practice to achieve high efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Effective evaluation of the productivity and safety of manual operations
   is essential for successful planning of operations as well as for
   workplace design. However, actions employed by production planners to
   improve productivity might adversely impact the ergonomic safety of
   workers. To address this issue, methods and tools are required that
   enable simultaneous evaluation of the efficiency and safety of
   operations. Thus, this study proposes an approach that integrates
   predetermined motion time systems and ergonomic assessment into a
   discrete-event simulation environment, and uses inputs obtained from
   point cloud and 3D models of a workplace to analyze both the
   productivity and ergonomic safety of manual operations. The proposed
   approach facilitates the evaluation and improvement of efficiency and
   ergonomic safety of manual tasks by automating the analysis and
   eliminating the need for onsite measurements and observations, all
   without the need for extensive prior knowledge regarding how PMTSs and
   ergonomic assessment methods work.}},

   engineering. Air can influence water flows in a variety of ways, such as
   the formation of air cavity, air entrapment and geysering in circular
   pipes. Cavity outflows with shock waves are not well investigated
   according to the existing literature. Experimental studies of geysering
   in transient flows are also scarce. A large physical model was
   established to study the cavity outflow and geysering in circular pipes.
   Critical non-dimensional flow rates were developed for cavity outflows
   according to distinct air-water interface patterns and characteristics
   of shock waves were determined. The effect of a vent pipe is also
   studied on its influence on the pressure distribution. Geyser phenomena
   were investigated using a 2\% slope pipe connected by a horizontal one.
   Pressure data and recorded videos show that the pressure drop
   corresponds to air release in all geysering scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of the dissipation of total dissolved gases (TDGs) is
   important in the downstream of hydropower facilities which often
   encounter TDG supersaturation. An analysis of the two consecutive spill
   events at the Peace River hydropower system, which includes the Bennett
   Dam and the Peace Canyon Dam, showed that the percent saturation of TDG
   and dissolved oxygen (DO) varied with spill rates, pre and post-spill
   conditions. The decay of TDG was comparatively slower than DO and the
   rates decreased with the drop of spill flows. For spill of 1,160 m(3)/s
   at the Peace Canyon Dam, the decay rate for TDG at the dam tailrace and
   at a distance 7 km downstream was found to be 0.005 and 0.0014 hr(-1),
   respectively. A conceptual computational fluid dynamics model of the
   reservoir indicated that density driven currents could affect the TDG
   dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{Free-standing TiO2 nanotube array membranes are mounted in the active
   coupling gap of a planar ring-type microwave resonator with f(0) of 5.5
   GHz and Q of 220. When illuminated by ultraviolet radiation, the
   S-parameters of the resonator vary as a function of time due to changes
   in the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of the membranes,
   which in turn occur due to the filling of trap states and
   photoexcitation of charge carriers respectively. Monitoring the
   amplitude and frequency response of the resonator enables photodetection
   and carrier lifetime measurements in a simple, compact and low-cost
   configuration. TiO2 nanotube membranes decorated with gold nanoparticles
   are found to have a much faster temporal microwave response upon
   illumination compared to bare, undecorated membranes, which we attribute
   to fast and enduring charge separation at the Au-TiO2 heterojunction.}},

Journal = {{FACILITIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{233-246}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Organizations involved in facility management (FM) can use
   building information modeling (BIM) as a knowledge repository to
   document evolving facility information and to support decisions made by
   the facility managers during the operational life of a facility. Despite
   ongoing advances in FM technologies, FM practices in most facilities are
   still labor intensive, time consuming and often rely on unreliable and
   outdated information. To address these shortcomings, the purpose of this
   study is to propose an automated approach that demonstrates the
   potential of using BIM to develop algorithms that automate
   decision-making for FM applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - A BIM plug-in tool is developed that uses
   a fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) algorithm to automate the
   process of detecting malfunctioning heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) equipment. The algorithm connects to a complaint
   ticket database and automates BIM to determine potentially damaged HVAC
   system components and develops a plan of action for the facility
   inspectors accordingly. The approach has been implemented as a case
   study in an operating facility to improve the process of HVAC system
   diagnosis and repair.
   Findings - By implementing the proposed application in a case study, the
   authors found that automated BIM approaches such as the one developed in
   this study, can be highly beneficial in FM practices by increasing
   productivity and lowering costs associated with decision-making.
   Originality/value - This study introduces an innovative approach that
   leverages BIM for automated fault detection in operational buildings. FM
   personnel in charge of HVAC inspection and repair can highly benefit
   from the proposed approach, as it eliminates the time required to locate
   HVAC equipment at fault manually.}},

   load frequency control of a microgrid with multiple synchronous
   generation systems and renewable energy sources in the islanded mode of

   proportional-integral (PI) controllers designed and optimized
   simultaneously by using a classical descent-direction Quasi-Newton based
   optimization technique. The optimal decentralized PI controller accounts
   for the dynamic coupling among the areas of the microgrid without any
   communication links required among the PI controllers, and hence
   improves the frequency control performance as compared to a set of
   optimal linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) integral controllers of eighth
   order which are designed independently. Simulation results confirm the
   effectiveness of the proposed decentralized control approach.}},

   computationally efficient and enjoys enlarged feasibility regions than

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of estimating the covariance of

   algorithm. The problem is relevant for localization of mobile robots and
   vehicles equipped with depth-sensing cameras (e.g., Kinect) or Lidar
   (e.g., Velodyne). The closed-form formulas for covariance proposed in
   previous literature generally build upon the fact that the solution to
   ICP is obtained by minimizing a linear least-squares problem. In this
   paper, we show this approach needs caution because the rematching step
   of the algorithm is not explicitly accounted for, and applying it to the
   point-to-point version of ICP leads to completely erroneous covariances.
   We then provide a formal mathematical proof why the approach is valid in
   the point-to-plane version of ICP, which validates the intuition and
   experimental results of practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{The general methods of health indicators extraction for planetary
   gearbox are based on the vibration signals which acquired by sensors
   equipped on the casing of the gearbox and sampled in the frame of
   Shannon sampling theory. Therefore, it is necessary to sample and save
   abundant original vibration data in the process of uninterrupted
   monitoring, and this will generate masses of original data which would
   burden the storage and transmission. For this issue, a health indicator
   extraction method based on sparse representation and reconstruction
   theory is proposed in this paper. It only needs to sample and save fewer
   compressive measurements of vibration signal directly compared to
   original signal. There is no need to recover the original signal
   accurately for extract health indicators, while it just requires some
   sparse representation and reconstruction results based on the redundant
   dictionary of the original signals. The effectiveness of the method
   proposed is validated with simulation data.}},

Abstract = {{Tooth pitting is a common failure mode of a gearbox. With the growth of
   tooth pitting, gear mesh stiffness shape changes and consequently the
   dynamic properties of the gear system change. An efficient and effective
   way to evaluate the time-varying mesh stiffness is essential for
   comprehensive understanding of dynamic properties and fault detection of
   a gear system. This study is devoted to modeling gear tooth pitting
   growth using circular pits and analytically evaluating the influence of
   tooth pitting on the mesh stiffness of a pair of external spur gears.
   Equations of the mesh stiffness are derived using the potential energy
   method. The relationship between pitting severity and mesh stiffness is

Abstract = {{Time-frequency distribution (TFD) methods have been widely used for
   planetary gearbox fault detection. The aim of TFD is to represent a
   signal by a joint energy distribution in the time-frequency domain.
   Positivity is one of the most important properties for TFDs.
   Copula-based positive TFD construction methods utilize the time
   marginal, the frequency marginal and the dependence structure between
   the marginals. In this study, the dependence between the time marginal
   and the frequency marginal is studied explicitly by numerical and
   graphical rank-based statistics. Rank-based statistics are invariant
   with monotone transformations of the marginal distributions. This study
   demonstrates that the dependence does exist between the time marginal
   and the frequency marginal. The findings build one theoretical
   foundation for further study on copula-based TFD construction for one
   planetary gearbox vibration. Moreover, the results show that with the
   increase of the gearbox degradation, the Kendall's Tau's absolute value
   increases as well. This indicates that the more severe the fault is, the
   stronger the dependence would be.}},

Abstract = {{Differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) are widely used to determine the
   size of aerosol particles, and to probe their size-dependent
   physicochemical properties when two are employed in tandem. A limitation
   of tandem DMA (TDMA) systems is their long measuring cycle when the
   properties of more than one monodisperse population of particles need to
   be probed. In this work, we propose a simple modification of the
   classical cylindrical DMA by including three monodisperse-particle
   outlets in its central electrode (namely, the 3MO-DMA), with the
   objective of using it as the first DMA in TDMA systems for reducing
   their measuring cycle. The performance of the 3MO-DMA at different flow
   conditions was evaluated using laboratory-generated aerosol particles,
   and compared with theoretical predictions. The theory predicted
   accurately (i.e., within 3\%) the geometric mean diameters of the three
   distinct populations, as well as the resolutions of the first and the
   third outlet, under all experimental conditions. For the second outlet,
   the resolution was 10\% to 74\% lower than that predicted theoretically
   depending on the sheath-to-aerosol flow ratio. Nevertheless, the
   geometric standard deviation of the monodisperse aerosol from all the
   outlets was less than 1.09, which is sufficient for using the 3MO-DMA
   designed and tested in this work as a first DMA to produce a
   monodisperse aerosol flow containing three distinct particle populations
   in TDMA systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm, called
   elephant herding optimisation (EHO), is proposed for solving global
   optimisation tasks, which is inspired by the herding behaviour of the
   elephant groups. In nature, the elephants belonging to different clans
   live together under the leadership of a matriarch, and the male
   elephants will leave their family group when growing up. These two
   behaviours can be modelled into two following operators: clan updating
   operator and separating operator. In EHO, the elephants are updated
   using its current position and matriarch through clan updating operator,
   and the separating operator is then implemented. Moreover, EHO has been
   benchmarked by 20 standard benchmarks, and two engineering cases in
   comparison with BBO, DE and GA. The results clearly establish the
   supremacy of EHO in finding the better function values on most test
   problems than those three algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In arithmetic network coding (ANC), finite field operations are replaced
   by real or complex arithmetic operations. This has applications in
   physical layer network coding or in multi-resolution multicast, where
   users with a higher download capacity experience a better quality of
   service. A major problem in random ANC is that the condition number of
   the network grows quickly with the network size, hence, noise can cause
   many errors in larger networks. An efficient solution for error
   correction in network coding is subspace coding. However, existing
   subspace coding solutions are based on finite field operations and
   cannot be used with ANC. Some of the difficulties of applying subspace
   coding to ANC are: (i) there are infinite subspaces to choose from; (ii)
   the effect of noise is on all links, where the noise strength increases
   hop by hop; and (iii) the decoding algorithms of ANC and subspace
   decoding are very different. In this work, we develop a subspace
   arithmetic network coding framework. We first model the network noise
   from which we then develop a decoding algorithm. Our simulation results
   show the success of our proposed method over conventional ANC.}},

Abstract = {{A painless self-immunization method with effective and broad
   cross-protection is urgently needed to prevent infections against newly

   cross-protection efficacy of trivalent influenza vaccine containing
   inactivated A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) and B/Lee/40 after
   skin vaccination using microneedle patches coated with this vaccine.
   Microneedle vaccination of mice in the skin provided 100\% protection
   against lethal challenges with heterologous pandemic strain influenza
   A/California/04/09, heterogeneous A/Philippines/2/82 and B/Victoria/287
   viruses 8 months after boost immunization. Cross-reactive serum IgG
   antibody responses against heterologous influenza viruses
   A/California/04/09, A/Philippines/2/82 and B/Victoria/287 were induced
   at high levels. Hemagglutination inhibition titers were also maintained
   at high levels against these heterogeneous viruses. Microneedle
   vaccination induced substantial levels of cross-reactive IgG antibody
   responses in the lung and cellular immune responses, as well as
   cross-reactive antibody-secreting plasma cells in the spleen. Viral
   loads in the lung were significantly (p< 0.05) reduced. All mice
   survived after viral challenges. These results indicate that skin
   vaccination with trivalent vaccine using a microneedle array could
   provide protection against seasonal epidemic or new pandemic strain of
   influenza viruses.}},

Abstract = {{CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) requires strong expertise and
   extensive training to obtain accurate results. To improve the usability
   in the complex product development process, two new types of engineering

   solver setup automation and robust simulation model generation in an
   ideal CAD/CAE integration system. Further, the association between
   simulation intent and design intent is integrated with another newly
   defined fluid functional feature in order to achieve the consistency.
   Consequently, an optimal design could be achieved by considering
   production operation, manufacturability and cost analysis concurrently.

Abstract = {{Random access protocols play an important role in the communication
   between elements of different newly emerged networks such as radio
   frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor networks (WSN), and
   machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks. New random multiple
   access (MAC) protocols have been suggested to satisfy the needs of such
   networks. These MAC protocols are recently aimed at the improvement of
   systems efficiency by resolving interferences and collisions in the
   received signals. This work considers one of such protocols called
   frameless ALOHA and proposes a technique to improve its energy
   efficiency without any loss in the network throughput comparing to the
   highest yet achieved in this scheme. More specifically, we propose a
   mechanism to adaptively change the probability of access at the users
   side. The proposed technique is the same as the original frameless ALOHA
   that does not need a coordination between the users. Our simulation
   results verify the improvement in energy efficiency when our proposed
   algorithm is the method of access.}},

   These could cause seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage and various
   neurological deficits based on the location of the lesion. Radiologists
   usually analysis brain magnetic resonance (MR) images to detect
   cavernomas. However, automatic detection of cavernomas by computer has
   not been investigated enough. This paper proposes a computer aided
   cavernomas detection method based on MR images analysis. The proposed
   method includes three steps: brain extraction based on deformable
   contour (to remove the non-brain tissues from image), template matching
   (to find suspected cavernomas regions) and post-processing (to get rid
   of false positives based on size, shape and brightness information). The
   performance of the proposed technique is evaluated and a sensitivity of
   0.92 is obtained after testing.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of cell nuclei is an important step towards automatic
   analysis of microscopic images. This paper presents an automated
   technique for nuclear segmentation in skin histopathological images. The
   proposed technique first detects nuclear seeds using a bank of
   generalized Laplacian of Gaussian (gLoG) kernels. Based on the detected
   nuclear seeds, a multi-scale radial line scanning (mRLS) method combined
   with dynamic programming (DP) is utilized to delineate a set of
   candidate nuclear boundaries. The gradient, intensity and shape
   information are then integrated to determine the optimal boundary for
   each nucleus in the image. Experimental results on 28 H\&E stained skin
   histopathological images show that the proposed technique is superior to
   conventional schemes in nuclear segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Differential evolution was used to optimize a fuzzy energy controller
   for a wireless sensor node. The evolved controller was validated by
   simulating a small wireless sensor network. The optimization goal was to
   best utilize the solar energy available for harvest while preserving a
   backup energy reserve. Performing the highest number of operations
   possible while leaving the energy reserve untouched increases deployment
   time and reliability. The controller being optimized was a Takagi-Sugeno
   fuzzy controller with inputs for the state of the energy buffer and a
   forecast of current day solar energy available for harvest. Two types of
   forecasts were used: one ideal and another based on atmospheric pressure
   measurements. Compared to a human-created reference controller, the
   evolved controller collected 124.96\% of the measurements across the
   network, while only consuming 1.07\% of the energy reserve capacity
   using a perfect forecast with similar results using the pressure-based
   forecast, representing an improvement in possible network deployment
   duration.}},

   role in processing realized in Granular Computing and facilitating

   a fundamental problem of constructing a collection of meaningful, easily
   interpretable spherical information granules with the use of the
   principle of justifiable granularity. The design process is formulated
   as an optimization problem. First, a series of numeric prototypes are
   determined around which information granules are constructed. Second,
   the values of radii of these information granules are optimized aiming
   at maximizing a certain performance index. Two alternatives of
   determining centers of information granules are compared, i.e., randomly
   selected numeric prototypes and prototypes generated with the aid of
   clustering. Two optimization criteria are also introduced and studied.
   Experimental studies involving synthetic data as well as data coming

   in obtaining a good awareness of how city assets (points of interest)
   are perceived by a community, and on the impact and influence that this
   collective perception can have on other city assets and city issues such
   as mobility, environment, security. The methodology employees Fuzzy
   Cognitive Maps and Fuzzy sets. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are used to model
   the relationships between elements of mental representations that
   different communities have with regards to city issues. The concept of
   signature as relation between two fuzzy sets is adopted, in analogy to
   what proposed by Yager and Reformat {[}1], to characterize a point of
   interest. Different signatures are subsequently grouped to characterize
   an area and adopted, in combination with sentiment analysis, to derive a
   measure of collective perception on the quality of the area. This
   measure is used to activate some qualitative concept of a Fuzzy
   Cognitive Map and perform what-if analysis. The methodology has been
   applied to a sample of three POIs (representing three attractions of the
   city of Salerno) by using data gathered from the Web and involving some
   real citizens. Our preliminary results are encouraging with regards to
   the possibilities offered by our approach of enforcing city decision
   makers with a good awareness on how changes in the perception of quality
   of urban areas can influence other city related issues.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the fundamental idea of Incremental Granular Models (IGM)
   introduced by Pedrycz and Kwak (2007) is followed and their
   comprehensive design framework is developed. In contrast to typical
   rule-based systems encountered in fuzzy modeling, the underlying
   principle of IGM is to consider a two-phase development. First, we build
   a Linear Regression (LR) model which could be treated as a global model.
   Next, all modeling errors are compensated by a collection of fuzzy rules
   that capture more localized nonlinearities of the system as a local
   model. Here we expand local granular models into Radial Basis Function
   Networks (RBFN) or Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Networks (ANFN) with the use of
   information granules through Context-based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM)
   clustering in the design of incremental model. Numerical studies concern
   two datasets coming from the machine learning repository. The
   experimental results revealed that both Incremental RBFN (IRBFN) and
   Incremental ANFN (IANFN) showed good performance in comparison to the
   previous works.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) incorporates weather conditions
   prevailing on line ampacity to calculate actual current-carrying
   capacity of transmission lines. These weather variables include ambient
   temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and solar intensity. In this
   paper, probability and fuzzy techniques are adopted to model the
   existing uncertainties in weather variables and their performances are
   compared. A transmission line in Alberta's electric system is considered
   as a case study. Weather data are available at nine towers along the
   transmission line. Line sectional ampacities are estimated using
   conductor thermal equations. Results indicate that fuzzy model is able
   to estimate DTLR as efficient as probabilistic model and due to its low
   computational cost can be used for real-time applications. Modeling
   uncertainties in DTLR calculation would enable system operators to make
   decisions on DTLR considering the degree of risk that power utilities
   are willing to accept.}},

Abstract = {{The Adaptive Neuro-Complex Fuzzy Inferential System was the first
   neuro-fuzzy system employing complex fuzzy sets and rule interference.
   It was shown to be both accurate and parsimonious in time series
   forecasting. The main disadvantage of this system is its slow learning
   algorithm. One possible approach to speeding up this neuro-fuzzy system
   is to apply concepts from the Extreme Learning Machine family of
   architectures; specifically, we will randomly select the parameters of a
   ``pool{''} of complex fuzzy sets, and then train the neural network by
   incrementally updating the parameters of a linear output function. We
   evaluate this new architecture on four software reliability growth
   datasets (a particular instance of time series forecasting).}},

Abstract = {{Data is frequently characterised by both uncertainty and seasonality.
   Type-2 fuzzy sets are an extension of type-1 fuzzy sets offering a
   conceptual scheme within which the effects of uncertainties in fuzzy
   inferencing may be modelled and minimised. Complex fuzzy sets are type-1
   fuzzy sets extended by an additional phase term which permits them to
   intuitively represent the seasonal aspect of fuzziness in time-series
   applications. Type-2 fuzzy sets take two forms, generalised, and the
   simpler interval. Interval-valued fuzzy sets are type-1 fuzzy sets whose
   behaviour and properties are equivalent to interval type-2 fuzzy sets.
   This paper is concerned with the combination of interval-valued fuzzy
   sets and complex fuzzy sets to develop interval-valued complex fuzzy
   sets, an adaption of complex fuzzy sets such that the membership
   function assigns each point on the domain to an interval.
   From the definition of the interval-valued complex fuzzy set, the
   principles of interval-valued complex fuzzy logic are developed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a two-dimensional (2D) convolver in which both
   approximate circuit-and algorithm-level techniques are utilized in the
   design. Truncation is used as circuit techniques, while bit-width
   reduction is utilized at the algorithm level. These different techniques
   are related to the configuration of the convolver by which its operation
   can be configured to meet different and often contrasting figures of
   merit. Circuit-level simulation (using HSPICE) and an extensive
   evaluation of different error metrics, generic metrics such as the mean
   error distance (MED) and the peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) for image
   convolution are performed. A detailed error analysis is also presented
   to substantiate the simulation results. Convolution for image processing
   (Gaussian smoothing) is treated in detail to show the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach. The design, the analysis and the simulation
   results show that the approximate techniques utilized in the inexact
   convolver can operate in synergy.}},

   parameter optimize in the design of PNNC. Moreover, data preprocessing
   techniques are used to reduce the dimension of training data. The
   proposed PNNC is compared with some well-known classifiers based on

   cloud radio access network (C-RAN) with all participate and single best
   remote radio head (RRH) association schemes. Specifically, multi-antenna
   equipped RRHs distributed according to a Poisson point process is
   assumed. The UL and DL sum rate of the single best RRH association
   scheme is maximized using receive and transmit beamformer designs at the
   UL and DL RRHs, respectively. In the case of the single best strategy,
   we study both optimum and sub-optimum schemes based on maximum ratio
   combining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) and zero-forcing/MRT
   (ZF/MRT) processing. Numerical results show that significant performance
   improvements can be achieved by using the full-duplex mode as compared
   to the half-duplex mode. Moreover, the choice of the beamforming design
   and the RRH association scheme have a major influence on the achievable
   full-duplex gains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two circuits for implementing the restore operation
   of a non-volatile (NV) memory cell in which data from a programmable
   metallization cell (PMC) can be copied (restored) into a static random
   access memory (SRAM). In the first proposed design, a transmission gate
   is added to each row of cells of the memory array in which a concurrent
   error detection (CED) circuit is also present. When a mismatch between
   the data stored in the SRAM and the PMC is detected, the restore
   operation starts for a single cell. For the second proposed design, a
   tri-state inverter is added to control the restore operation. This
   design requires a larger circuit complexity compared to the first
   design, but performance is substantially improved; moreover, all cells
   of a memory array can be simultaneously restored, thus suitable for
   restarting with power-on. A comparison of these designs with a previous
   scheme is also pursued; it is shown that the proposed designs improve
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a design of a Ternary Content Addressable Memory
   (TCAM) cell using racetrack memories (RMs) for non-volatile operation.
   Four RMs are utilized as storage elements and CMOS transistors are used
   as control elements for executing the write and search operations. The
   search operation of the TCAM cell utilizes novel circuits to read the
   RMs and compare data at cell and array levels. A simulation-based
   analysis shows that this cell has a high critical charge (so tolerant to
   a single event upset, SEU) and operates at a low CMOS feature size; the
   analysis is pursued at cell and array levels. A comparison with other
   non-volatile TCAM cells shows that the write/search delays and the read
   operating voltage of the proposed RM-based TCAM cell are superior to PCM
   (Phase Change Memory) and NAND Flash based TCAM cells.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the failure probabilities of SRAM memory cells using Monte
   Carlo or Importance Sampling techniques is expensive in the number of
   SPICE simulations needed. This paper presents a methodology for
   estimating the dynamic margin failure probabilities by building a
   surrogate model of the dynamic margin using Gaussian Process regression.
   Additive kernel functions that can extrapolate the margin values from
   the simulated samples are presented. These proposed kernel functions
   decrease the out-of-sample error of the surrogate model for a 6T cell by
   32\% compared with a six-dimensional universal kernel such as a
   Radial-Basis-Function kernel (RBF). Finally, the failure probability
   values predicted by a surrogate model built using 1250 SPICE simulations
   are reported and compared with Monte Carlo analysis with 10(6) samples.
   The results show a relative error of 30\% at 0.4V (predicted value of
   4x10(-6) for the Monte Carlo estimate of 3x10(-6)) and a relative error
   of 172\% at 0.3V (predicted value of 3x10(-5) for the Monte Carlo
   estimate of 1.1x10(-5)) for the dynamic read margin. These accuracy
   numbers are similar to those reported in previous proposals while the
   reduction in SPICE simulations is between 4x and 23x relative to these
   proposals and 800x compared to Monte Carlo method.}},

Pages = {{128-137}},
Abstract = {{Many studies have addressed spatial correlation in traffic collision
   modeling. It has been generally concluded that the inclusion of spatial
   correlation improves model goodness of fit and the precision of
   parameter estimates. However, the application in before-after safety
   evaluation has rarely been documented in the traffic safety literature.
   The objectives of the presented study were to (a) apply both the
   univariate and multivariate full Bayesian (FB) spatial models in before-
   after safety evaluation and (b) compare the results with those of
   nonspatial FB models. A reduction of the posted speed limit in urban
   residential neighborhoods in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was used as a
   case study for the before-after safety evaluation. Yearly collision data
   and other neighborhood characteristics data were collected for a group
   of treated and reference neighborhoods to develop macroscopic models.
   The four models considered in this study were (a) Poisson-lognormal, (b)
   Poisson lognormal with conditional autoregressive (CAR) distribution,
   (c) multivariate Poisson- lognormal, and (d) multivariate Poisson
   lognormal with CAR distribution. The results showed that the
   multivariate Poisson lognormal with CAR distribution model for collision
   severities outperformed the other three models according to the deviance
   information criteria. Parameter estimates showed slight differences
   across the models. However, for the current data set, the results of the
   before-after safety evaluation showed similar findings across the
   models. Estimated collision reductions were 13\%, 24\%, and 12\% for
   total, severe, and property-damage-only collisions, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We provide a case study of current inefficiencies in how traffic to
   well-known cloud-storage providers (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive,
   Microsoft OneDrive) can vary significantly in throughput (e.g., a factor
   of 5 or more) depending on the location of the source and sink of the
   data. Our case study supplements previous work on resilient overlay
   networks (RON) and other ideas.
   These inefficiencies exist in the presence of vendor-specific
   points-of-presence (POP), which try to provide better network
   performance to the clients. In fact, the existence of special-purpose
   networks (e.g., national research networks, PlanetLab) and complicated
   peering relationships between networks, means that performance problems
   might exist in many wide-area networks (WANs).
   Our main contribution is to continue the cataloging of network
   inefficiencies so that practitioners and experimenters are aware of
   them. But, we also show how simple routing detours, can improve
   throughput by factors of over 3x for client-to-cloud-storage. Although
   the specific inefficiencies in this paper might be transitory (and we
   agree with that characterization), WAN bottlenecks due to routing,
   suboptimal middlebox configuration, and congestion persist as real
   problems to be cataloged, discussed, and addressed through the use of
   detours, or data transfer nodes (DTNs), or RONs.}},

   resonant apertures lined using epsilon-negative and near-zero (ENNZ)
   metamaterials. Each aperture in the array exhibits a fano-like
   transmission resonance-antiresonance profile, and the resonance
   frequencies of adjacent apertures are adjusted so that the resonance of
   one lies within the antiresonance of the other, to ensure strong
   isolation. This approach enables each resonance peak to be uniquely
   associated with one location in space. We show that blocking an aperture
   using a conducting disk suppresses the corresponding resonance
   frequency, enabling far-field imaging of a distribution of obstacles
   with a spatial resolution of better than lambda/6.}},

   conventional pi-cell to keep the characteristic impedance of the line
   independent of the phase shift. In the proposed transformer based
   tunable inductor secondary terminals of the transformer are connected to
   a varactor to produce a variable inductor at the input of the
   transformer. To verify the operation principle, a 60GHz transformer in
   65nm CMOS technology is EM simulated in HFSS and results have been
   imported into the circuit simulator for the overall characterization of
   the system with a varactor. A large phase shift of 48 0, average

Abstract = {{The Aho-Corasick algorithm was originally proposed as a bibliographic
   search mechanism, efficient enough to preclude the construction and
   maintenance of a search index. As the size of document collections have
   grown since the development of the algorithm, document collections have
   grown to the point where cost of rescanning a corpus for every search
   has become prohibitive and indexing, in some form or another, is an
   essential optimization for any modern information retrieval system. In
   this paper we demonstrate the use of Aho-Corasick state machine, not as
   an alternative to indexing but as a lexical scanning tool employed in
   the construction of an inverted index. The proposed framework is a
   linear and incremental indexing structure for big data analytics.
   Consistent with our analysis, an empirical evaluation of our indexer
   implementation shows significant improvement from quadratic time (worst)
   to linear time (best) performance. The modular architecture of our
   indexer allows the indexing task to be parallelized over multiple
   physical nodes. The results of parallelization are presented and offer
   interesting insights towards further horizontal scaling.}},

Abstract = {{In hybrid AC/DC microgrids, parallel interfacing converters (IFCs) with
   common DC link are commonly used to connect AC and DC subsystems or to
   interface high-power distributed generations/storage elements to AC
   subsystem. Under unbalanced condition, the adverse effects of unbalanced
   voltage on single IFC's operation, such as output power oscillations, DC
   link voltage oscillations and peak current increase, can be aggregated
   in parallel IFCs compared to a single IFC. In this paper, a novel
   control strategy for parallel IFCs is proposed, which is focusing on
   reducing adverse effects of unbalanced voltage on parallel IFCs'
   operation based on peak current-based control strategy. In the proposed
   control strategy, one IFC which has largest power rating among parallel
   IFCs, named as redundant IFC, cancels out active power oscillations of
   parallel IFCs. Based on peak current analysis, it is proven in this
   paper that the collective peak current of parallel IFCs is constant
   under zero active power oscillation in the fixed average active power
   output. Therefore, the redundant IFC is controlled based on collective
   peak current of parallel IFCs to cancel out active power oscillations,
   which doesn't need communication among parallel IFCs. Moreover, the
   proposed control ensures the peak currents of IFCs to be approximately
   in-phase with collective peak current of parallel IFCs. Therefore, it
   could provide minimum peak current of redundant IFC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach for robust and autonomous dc bus voltage
   control in a dc microgrid has been proposed. A nonlinear disturbance
   observer (NDO) only with local information is designed firstly to track
   power disturbances caused by load changing or the volatility of the
   renewable sources in the dc microgrid. With the observer, voltage droop
   method has been adopted in achieving power sharing and autonomous
   operation of a dc microgrid. Furthermore, an improved current
   feedforward is developed to suppress wide fluctuations of the dc bus
   voltage during transients. In addition, a notch filter has been used to
   effectively eliminate the second harmonic ripple components in the
   inductor currents of the droop control units to improve the power
   quality. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified on
   a laboratory prototype including two bidirectional dc-dc converters
   supplied by two programmable dc power supply systems, a dc load with a
   resistor connected to the dc bus via a buck type dc-dc converter and a
   three-phase unbalanced ac load.}},

Abstract = {{The downlink performance of two-tier (macro/pico) multi-antenna cellular
   heterogeneous networks (HetNets) employing space division multiple
   access (SDMA) technique is analyzed in this paper. The number of users
   simultaneously served with SDMA by each BS in a resource block depends
   on user distribution, unlike previous studies which assume the number to
   be any arbitrary value. By exploiting the feasibility of deploying
   larger number of antennas at macro BS, we propose to utilize the excess
   spatial degrees of freedom for interference nulling to pico users from
   their corresponding nearest (dominant) macro BSs.
   Biased-nearest-distance based user association scheme is proposed as
   those introduced in previous studies are unsuitable for analyzing the
   proposed multi-antenna scheme. Coverage probability and average data
   rate of a typical user are then evaluated. Our results demonstrate that
   the proposed interference nulling scheme has strong potential to improve
   performance. However, the system parameters such as association bias,
   and number of dedicated antennas at each macro BS for serving its own
   users must be carefully tuned.}},

Abstract = {{While massive MIMO based underlay cognitive radio (CR) networks are a
   promising concept in the next generation of wireless networks to
   increase spectral efficiency, reusing the same pilot sequences in both
   networks cause pilot contamination leading to residual interference.
   Thus, this paper investigates the affects of pilot contamination on a
   random CR network underlaid upon a random primary network where both
   networks employ path loss inversion based power control. A Matern
   cluster process is considered for the underlay system, while homogeneous
   Poisson point processes are considered for the primary transmitters and
   receivers. We derive the moment generating function of the normalized
   aggregate interference at an underlay receiver, its first two moments,
   and the outage probability. Finally, it is shown that the underlay
   cluster radius, ensured received power levels through power control and
   the different node densities have a significant effect on the outage of
   an underlay receiver.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) where
   spatially distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) communicate with a
   full-duplex user. In order to reflect a realistic scenario, the uplink
   (UL) and downlink (DL) RRHs are assumed to be equipped with multiple
   antennas and distributed according to a Poisson point process. We
   consider all participate and nearest RRH association schemes with
   distributed beam-forming in the form of maximum ratio combining/maximal
   ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) and zero-forcing/MRT(ZF/MRT) processing. We
   derive analytical expressions useful to compare the average sum rate
   among association schemes as a function of the number of RRHs antennas
   and density of the UL and DL RRHs. Numerical results show that
   significant performance improvements can be achieved by using the
   full-duplex mode as compared to the half-duplex mode, while the choice
   of the beamforming design as well as the RRH association scheme plays a
   critical role in determining the full-duplex gains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of co-channel interference (CCI),
   imperfect channel state information (CSI) and pilot contamination for
   multi-pair massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) two-way relay
   networks (TWRNs). We consider a multi-cell TWRN system consisting of
   single-antenna user nodes and amplify-and-forward (AF) relay nodes
   having very large antenna arrays. Under the aforementioned channel
   imperfections, the asymptotic signal-to-interference-noise ratio and
   asymptotic sum rate expressions are derived in closed-form whenever the
   number of relay antennas grows unbounded with respect to the number of
   user nodes. For perfect CSI case, the transmit power at the user nodes
   and the relay can be scaled down inversely proportional to the number of
   antennas at the relay. Moreover, for the imperfect CSI case, these
   transmit powers can only be scaled down inversely proportional to the
   square-root of the relay antenna count. Thus, even with imperfect CSI,
   the benefits of employing a massive MIMO-enabled relay on transmit power
   savings are significant. Moreover, our analysis shows that although the
   detrimental effect of CCI can be asymptotically negated completely, the
   residual interference due to pilot contamination cannot be mitigated
   even in the limit of infinitely many relay antennas.}},

Abstract = {{Storage allocation affects important performance measures of distributed
   storage systems. Most previous studies on the storage allocation
   consider its effect separately either on the success of the data
   recovery or on the service rate (time) where it is assumed that no
   access failure happens in the system. In this paper, we go one step
   further and incorporate the access model and the success of data
   recovery into the service rate analysis. In particular, we focus on
   quasi-uniform storage allocation and provide a service rate analysis for
   both fixed-size and probabilistic access models at the nodes. Using this
   analysis, we then show that for the case of exponential waiting time
   distribution at individuals storage nodes, minimal spreading allocation
   results in the highest system service rate for both access models. This
   means that for a given storage budget, replication provides a better
   service rate than a coded storage solution.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental study was conducted to investigate the influence of
   pozzolanic admixtures on the fresh properties of cement-based foams. The
   cement-based foam mixes were tested at three different cast densities
   namely, 800, 600, and 400 kg/m(3). Along with a reference mix, other
   series were prepared in which fly ash, silica fume, and metakaolin were
   added to the binder at up to 10 \% and 20 \% replacement by cement mass.
   The Marsh cone test and the flow cone test techniques were employed to
   measure the flowability and spreadability for 21 cement-based foam
   mixes. The results show that the addition of pozzolanic admixtures
   increases the flow time and the longest time recorded with metakaolin. A
   linear relationship of spread with the density of the mixes was found in
   this study. It was also found that with the addition of fly ash and
   silica fume, there was an increase in the demand for foam content. On
   the other hand, adding metakaolin reduced this demand. Based on the
   experimental results, an equation to predict the spreadability of the
   mixes with pozzolanic admixtures has been suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of aggregates is intensive at the bottom of concrete
   model but scarce at the top position when polygon aggregates are packed
   by traditional random walking algorithm. In order to simulate the
   randomness of aggregates distribution more effectively and
   realistically, a bidirectional walk method of random polygon aggregates
   is proposed to overcome the above shortage of the traditional method.
   Firstly, the method to judge whether or not polygon aggregates
   intersection exist during each aggregate packing cycle has been
   improved. Further, after all the aggregates move into the target domain,
   the reverse walk of aggregates is taken into account, which means the
   walk direction of the aggregates is changed to straight up from straight
   down. The main results obtained reveal that the distribution of polygon
   aggregates is more evenly in two-dimensional concrete model by the
   proposed method compared to the traditional one.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous reduction in the minimum feature size of semiconductor
   devices and the supply voltages in advanced VLSI logic circuits has made
   those circuits more susceptible to soft errors. Hence, several fault
   tolerance techniques have been proposed in the literature to protect
   combinational circuits against single event transients (SETs). These
   fault tolerance techniques are based mainly on hardware redundancy and
   therefore they come at the cost of significant area and power overhead.
   In this paper, a novel gate grading approach is proposed to prioritize
   gates based on their influence on the circuit's reliability.
   Specifically, different masking factors are taken into account and the
   gates with the lowest masking capabilities are identified so that they
   can be hardened first. Since the gates with higher priorities affect the
   circuit's reliability more significantly, protecting those gates
   increases the circuit's reliability with the least required area and
   power overhead.}},

Abstract = {{OpenCL is a high-level language that allows mixed hardware/software
   systems to be specified and compiled to run on heterogeneous parallel
   computing platforms. The hardware parallelism can take the form of
   multi-core central processing units (CPUs), massively parallel graphics
   processing units (CPUs), and, most recently, field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA) fabrics. OpenCI, compilers for CPUs and CPUs have been
   available for over 6 years, but only recently has compiler support been
   extended to include FPCAs. This paper investigates OpenCL designs for
   the computationally demanding standard iterative decoding algorithm for
   low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The LDPC decoding algorithm
   offers several kinds of potentially exploitable parallelism. Our
   objective was to investigate the design trade-offs in OpenCL that will
   produce the best performance when compiled by the Altera Offline
   Compiler (AOC v15.1) for OpenCL-to-FPGA. Within a relatively short
   design time we were able to implement a decoder that achieved 5.12 Mbps
   with a length-1024 (3,6)- regular code.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks can be used to collect data in support of a
   number of tasks such as ecosystem or structural monitoring. When
   deployed in remote areas with little or no communication and power
   infrastructure, these networks face a number of power and reliability
   challenges. To collect adequate amount of data over long periods,
   operation of such networks must be managed to properly ration energy
   available in suitable storage devices and in the environment. In
   particular, predictive energy management can extend the duration a node
   is operational during its deployment and thus increase the quality of
   the collected data. This contribution presents a simulation of a small
   wireless sensor network that. employs computationally inexpensive,
   short-term solar energy forecasts based on atmospheric pressure
   measurements as an input to a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system. The
   proposed system shows improvement over a similar control scheme which
   only relies on knowledge of previously collected energy. Further
   improvements can be gained through optimization of the developed energy
   management scheme or by using more accurate energy availability
   prediction techniques.}},

Abstract = {{We present a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control law for
   a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a single
   downwards facing camera. The controller design is based on a dynamic
   model of the UAV and regulates the vehicle's relative pose to a planar
   visual target. The proposed approach uses a virtual camera which has
   zero roll and pitch motion. The IBVS image features are defined in the
   virtual camera image plane. Since the image feature error is stabilized
   in the virtual camera, the visual target can leave the real camera's
   field of view (FoV). To keep the visual target in the camera FoV, the
   proposed method bounds roll and pitch to sufficiently small prescribed
   values. A numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the
   controller's performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative framework labeled as cooperative cognitive
   Cyber Physical Systems (CCCPSs) on the sea is developed to provide
   opportunistic channel access. Specifically, a two-phase frame structure

   transmission opportunities for a portion of time as the reward by
   cooperation with Primary users (PUs). Amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
   mode is exploited in S U nodes, and Backward induction method based
   Stackelherg game is employed to achieve optimal determination of S U,
   power consumption and time portion for cooperation. Close form solutions
   for the best access time portion beta(i) to U as well as the power
   P-2(i) for SUi are derived to realize the Nash Equilibrium. Simulation

Abstract = {{Bat algorithm (BA) is newly proposed bio-inspired metaheuristic
   algorithm with the inspiration of the echolocation of bats in nature.
   Several experimental results have proven to the effectiveness and
   performance of BA. However, BA may fail to find the global optimal
   solution occasionally. In this paper, a kind of classical search
   technology, called variable neighborhood search (VNS), is incorporated
   into BA as a local search tool. An improved version of BA namely
   variable neighborhood bat algorithm (VNBA), is thus proposed. In VNBA,
   the classic BA as a global search tool searches the whole space
   globally, and this can significantly shrink the search space.
   Subsequently, VNS as a local search tool is implemented to find the
   final best solution within the small promising area. After that, the
   VNBA is benchmarked by sixteen standard benchmark functions. The
   experimental results imply that VNBA takes the absolute advantage over
   the basic BA.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the benefits of Smart Grid Technology and renewable energy
   systems, consumer demand for a controller design that allows effective
   integration of these two systems has been growing over the last few
   years. This article proposes a new controller designed with the
   objective of increasing efficiency and reliability of a consumer's
   renewable energy system. It describes the system model design and data
   selection, as well as the controller considerations and design method.
   The model subsystems are designed either as raw real world data,
   formulated models based on real world data as reasonable approximations,
   or as models that allow for proper testing of the system under relevant
   abnormal conditions and limitations. The controller is designed while
   considering the necessary flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of
   subsystems and the need for correct behavior for normal and abnormal
   states. The applied methods include frequency pattern analysis,
   forecasting, probability estimation, payoff estimation, expected value
   calculation, and neural-state-space modeling. For the analysis, a
   comparison to alternative non-controlled methods has been conducted to
   determine the relative performance of the controller in terms of energy
   efficiency, reliability, and monetary savings. The results of the
   analysis show that the controller did not reduce energy losses, but is
   reliable with respect to performance under blackout and cyber-attack
   conditions, and offers at least an 8\% savings on energy expenses and as
   much as 25\% of the expected profit from immediately selling excess
   renewable energy.}},

Abstract = {{Smart meters are a key technology to transfer information between
   service providers and end-users. However, the massive amounts of data
   evolving from smart grid meters used for visualization and control
   purposes need to be sufficiently managed to increase the reliability and
   sustainability of the smart grid. Interestingly, the nature of smart
   grids can be considered as a big data challenge that deals with huge
   amounts of data and their analytics. Therefore, this unprecedented smart
   grid data require an effective platform that elevates the smart grid in
   the big data era. This paper presents a visual analytics framework that
   can promote the sustainability of the smart grid. An application of the
   framework has been applied on a smart grid that contains over 6,000
   smart meters for dynamic demand response visualization. Further, another
   application on data that includes micro-generators including an
   electrical vehicle is presented. The findings suggest that the framework
   is feasible in performing visual analytics and further smart grid data

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the uplink of multi-user massive multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) systems with a mixed analog-to-digital converter
   (ADC) receiver architecture, in which some antennas are equipped with
   costly full-resolution ADCs and others with less expensive
   low-resolution ADCs. A closed-form approximation of the achievable
   spectral efficiency (SE) with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) detector
   is derived. Based on this approximated result, the effects of the number
   of base station antennas, the transmit power, the proportion of
   full-resolution ADCs in the mixed-ADC structure, and the number of
   quantization bits of the low-resolution ADCs are revealed. Results
   showcase that the achievable SE increases with the number of BS antennas
   and quantization bits, and it converges to a saturated value in the high
   user power regime or the full ADC resolution case. Most important, this
   work efficiency verifies that for massive MIMO, the mixed-ADC receiver
   with a small fraction of full-resolution ADCs can have comparable SE
   performance with the receiver with all full-resolution ADCs but at a
   considerably lower hardware cost.}},

Abstract = {{Electrified personal mobility vehicles are extremely important tools for
   elderly and disabled individuals. These devices offer freedom to partake
   in daily activities that would otherwise be difficult or perhaps
   impossible. Nearly all electrified mobility vehicles are battery
   powered, making the act of charging a necessity. Loss of power from an
   uncharged battery could place users in frustrating or even dangerous
   situations. Dynamic wireless charging is a promising solution to
   mitigate this problem. However, high installation costs to sidewalks and
   roadways could potentially reduce wide-scale use of these wireless
   solutions. Here we present a method of dynamic wireless power transfer
   that operates over inexpensive surfaces, greatly reducing the
   implementation cost. Our system utilizes a unipolar capacitive coupling
   to transfer energy to a special standing wave receiver which in turn
   delivers power to the vehicle. We demonstrate charging of a 200 W
   personal mobility scooter over a 3 m long aluminum foil surface and
   discuss system efficiency, safety, and optimization parameters.}},

Abstract = {{As the size of CMOS devices continues to scale down, the reliability of
   circuits becomes one of main challenges in low supply voltage designs.
   Markov Random Field (MRF) circuits, a probabilistic-based approach, can
   achieve higher noise immunity compared to traditional designs under
   conditions of ultra-low supply voltage and low threshold voltage.
   However, the basic MRF elements have complex structures and become a
   stringent factor that limits MRF-based VLSI design. In this paper, we
   provide a partial-clique-energy MRF (PMRF) design method, trading off
   the noise immunity for area efficiency. We then propose an Enhanced PMRF
   (EPMRF)-pair for multi-level and multi-function joint PMRF designs. The
   main idea is to use the joint clique energy of two complementary partial
   clique energies to make up performance losses. The measurement results
   show that, the proposed EPMRF pair can operate at 0.25 V with 10(-4) dB
   output noise power with 5.6 dB input signal-noise ratio (SNR). With the
   130 nm CMOS technology, the chip of our EPMRF based carrylook-ahead
   adder achieves 29\% area-saving and 55\% energysaving compared to
   existing ultra-low supply voltage fault tolerant designs.}},

Abstract = {{As the world's population ages, healthcare costs become heavy burdens
   worldwide. Portable point-of-care diagnostic devices, such as glucose
   meters, can significantly reduce the costs associated with patient care.
   There are many of small biological molecules present in biological
   samples which are of interest in healthcare applications. In this paper,
   a simple low-cost impedance detection circuit has been designed to
   detect different biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and other
   metabolites. In particular, the impedance across an electrode will
   change due to the binding of target biomolecules and gold nanoparticles.
   Experimental results show that the device can measure impedance changes
   with accuracy in the range of +/- 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a miniaturized UHF RFID tag is developed for industrial
   harsh environment applications like oil and gas industries. The tag is
   designed based on an open-ended slot structure and fed by a primary
   radiator from the middle. Feeding the antenna using coupling mechanism
   by a primary radiator results to lower fabrication complexity and costs
   as well as mechanical durability against continuous vibrations,
   humidity, water and mud. The whole tag is 0.084 lambda x0.066 lambda and
   can be read up to 5 m in the US band and 3 m in the EU band. By
   utilization of low cost FR4 substrate alongside the magnetically coupled
   primary radiator the fabrication costs diminishes significantly. An
   open-ended slot fed from the middle with bent T-shape pattern for the
   closed-end and meandered pattern for the open-ended side acts as the
   antenna and matching circuit together. The measurement results prove the
   functionality of the designed tag.}},

Abstract = {{A lot of requirements are discarded throughout the product development
   process. However, resources are invested on them regardless of their
   fate. If it would exist a model that predicts reliably and early enough
   whether a requirement will be deployed or not, the overall process would
   be more cost-effective and the software system itself more qualitative,
   since effort would be channeled efficiently. In this work we try to
   build such a predictive model through modelling the lifecycle of each
   requirement based on its history, and capturing the underlying dynamics
   of its evolution. We employ a simple classification model, using
   logistic regression algorithm, with features coming from an engineering
   understanding of the problem and patterns observed on the data. We
   verify the model on more than 80,000 logs for a development process of
   over 10 years in an Italian Aeronautical Company. The results are
   encouraging, so we plan to extend our study on one side collecting more
   experimental data and, on the other, employing more refined modeling
   techniques, like those coming from data mining and fuzzy logic.}},

   collaborative relationship through research and development (R \& both
   have expectations for outcomes and impacts as incentives to maintain
   this relationship. However, assessing outcomes and measuring impacts is
   often challenging. To address this challenge, an evaluation framework
   for assessing the impact of construction R\&D on the construction
   industry and academia is proposed in this paper. This framework consists
   of a ``logic model{''} and an ``evaluation plan{''} to define and
   evaluate construction R\&D impacts on both the construction industry and
   academia. The logic model helps to define the relationship between
   academia and the construction industry in terms of inputs, outputs, and
   outcomes and impacts; this relationship is expressed using ``if-then{''}
   rules to relate the inputs to outputs, and the outputs to outcomes and
   impacts. The evaluation plan helps determine the fulfillment degree of
   the expected outcomes and impacts from the perspectives of both the
   construction industry and academia. The proposed evaluation framework
   will help quantify and assess the impact of construction R\&D on the
   construction industry and on academia so that the inputs of both parties
   can be better used to deliver the outcomes each expects.}},

Abstract = {{The use of motion sensing technologies for ergonomic analysis of worker
   motions has gained increasing attention in construction. Using motion
   capture data enables extracting ergonomic assessment inputs more
   accurately than through a human observer. Accordingly, methods of
   collecting and analyzing human motion data have been developed to
   automate the ergonomic evaluation process for effective identification
   of ergonomic risk factors associated with manual operations. However,
   despite advancements in motion capture technologies, there is still
   inaccuracy associated with the resulting motion capture data, which
   leads to impreciseness of the output of the ergonomic assessment. This
   study investigates the impact that the imprecision of the motion capture
   data has on the results of ergonomic analysis, to evaluate the technical
   feasibility of a motion sensing approach to ergonomic analysis and to
   discuss the potential solutions by incorporating sensing errors into the
   motion analysis. Specifically, different possible sensing errors
   pertaining to a body joint location have been considered and the
   sensitivity of the errors on the results of ergonomic evaluation has
   been quantified. The results can be used to obtain an accurate and
   realistic adjustment for the results of ergonomic assessment based on
   the amount of error associated with any motion capture technology.}},

Abstract = {{On-site worker observation is a fundamental task for a wide spectrum of
   construction applications such as safety behavior monitoring and
   productivity analysis. Vision-based action recognition techniques have
   been proposed to complement the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks
   involved in manual observation. In construction, however, previous
   studies have mainly utilized an RGB-D sensor (e.g., Microsoft Kinect),
   the operating conditions of which (e.g., active ranges from 80 cm to 4
   m, sensitivity to sun light) may hinder the application to actual
   construction jobsites. To address these issues, we propose a
   silhouette-based human action recognition method using a single video
   camera that has less operational constraint. In this framework, the
   human worker is localized and tracked throughout the monocular video,
   based on both spatial (i.e., contour of worker) and temporal changes
   (i.e., moving direction and speed over consecutive frames). Then human
   action models are learned with temporally adjacent frames and utilized
   to recognize similar actions in testing video by computing the
   similarity between the learned action model and newly computed model in
   a testing dataset. For performance evaluation, we carried out lab
   experiments, in which a video camera was installed 5-10 m from multiple
   human subjects. Results indicate that the proposed framework performs
   well (i.e., an accuracy of 90.68\%) to capture predefined poses (e.g.,
   walking, lifting, crawling) in image sequences. This study thus explores
   an automated means for worker monitoring which potentially helps
   understand and measure human motions without significant human effort.}},

Abstract = {{Temporary haul roads are typically designed and constructed to handle
   mass earthworks in heavy civil and industrial construction, critical to
   achieving haulage efficiency and safety in earthmoving operations.
   Traditional temporary haul road layout design has long been based on
   experience rather than science. Previous research endeavors developed
   mathematical models and solution algorithms in an attempt to explore the
   possibility of analytically addressing temporary haul road layout design
   problems, while achieving limited progress. This study introduces a
   grid-based optimization methodology by adopting a Mixed-Integer Linear
   Programming (MILP) model, aimed to generate the optimal layout solution
   in real-world applications. The optimization processes and results are
   illustrated with a practical engineering case. A comparison of different
   layout designs for the same case, including the heuristics-based field
   design and analytical designs resulting from recent research, shows that
   the proposed methodology is capable of producing optimal solutions to
   temporary haul road layout design problems.}},

Abstract = {{In early stages of fast tracked construction projects-such as mega
   industrial projects-contractors do not have access to detailed and final
   drawings. Yet, they usually need rough estimates of material quantities
   in the project. They usually depend on initial versions of BIM models
   that contain all trades (e.g., pipes, steel, etc.) information. Because
   they are premature models, 3D object attributes may be missed, omitted,
   inconsistent, or incomplete which makes extracting quantities from them
   a manual, time-consuming, and inaccurate task. In this research, we aim
   to automate this task by applying shape recognition techniques on
   unlabeled 3D models. These techniques have been used in different fields
   such as handwriting recognition, object recognition, and 3D object
   search and retrieval. We experiment with some of these techniques to
   estimate material quantities for industrial construction projects based
   on the geometry of unlabeled 3D objects. We investigate a number of
   these techniques keeping in mind that the main usage will be a
   preliminary estimate in early stages of the project; therefore, we favor
   fast techniques with a margin of error over more accurate-but relatively
   slow-ones. This paper discusses applicability of these techniques and
   shows the results of applying and testing them on real industrial
   construction projects from a partner contractor.}},

Abstract = {{The unique nature of construction projects and uncertainties during
   project execution make construction a highly risk-prone industry. The
   system dynamics (SD) approach, which focuses on the cause-effect
   relationship of model variables, is a viable option to model and analyze
   construction risks, which are considered to be highly dynamic, and has
   the ability to capture the interrelationships and interactions among
   different risks. However, conventional SD has a limited ability to
   handle risk imprecision and uncertainty; these elements can be best
   dealt with using fuzzy logic. Research endeavors to integrate SD and
   fuzzy logic so as to address the shortcomings of SD in construction risk
   modeling and analysis are very few. In this paper, a methodology for
   developing a fuzzy system dynamics (FSD) framework is proposed that
   combines the strengths of SD with those of fuzzy logic to improve
   construction risk modeling and develop risk mitigation strategies. The
   main contributions of this paper are: (1) identifying research gaps in
   FSD modeling; (2) providing a systematic and detailed methodology for
   developing the FSD framework; and (3) examining existing approaches for
   representing fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules, and the impact of
   different fuzzy arithmetic operators and defuzzification methods in FSD
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Construction production systems are complex in nature and possess a high
   level of uniqueness. Modelling and simulation of such systems is
   challenging due to the randomness, complexity, and interdependency
   associated with many factors such as the type of product created, the
   steps of the production process, and the medium or the environment
   hosting the production process. These factors represent or control the
   working behaviour of a construction system and need to be realistically
   represented in a model in order to achieve accurate replication of real
   system behaviours. However, modeling and simulation of these factors
   require either a rich real life data set, which is seldom available for
   construction operations, or random generation of complex data structures
   with highly correlated attributes. This paper presents an investigation
   of mathematical techniques that can be used to generate random complex
   data structures while preserving the correlations between the embedded
   attributes. Generation of weather and pipelines data sets are selected
   in this study. We propose a non- parametric approach in the weather
   generation; its performance is measured against a parametric approach.
   For the generation of pipeline data sets, we propose a generation
   methodology based on a Markov chain model for a pipeline structure. It
   represents part of an ongoing research. A detailed description of the
   methodology and the progress in this part of the study are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Shield cutter head failures exist in almost every tunnel project. A
   systematic approach that incorporates dynamic fault tree (DFT) and
   discrete-time Bayesian network (DTBN) is developed in this research, in
   order to facilitate the analysis for shield cutter head failures in
   tunnel construction. A causal network model is built to simulate the
   behaviors of shield cutter head failures over time during the tunnel
   boring machine (TBM) operation. One of the tunneling projects recently
   completed in the Wuhan metro system in China is selected as a case study
   to demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach. Results
   indicate that the developed approach is capable of predictive analysis
   for the estimation of the TBM performance, and diagnostic analysis in
   case a low performance or a failure is observed. This approach provides
   a powerful potential solution to modeling and analyzing various kinds of
   system components behaviors and interactions in a complex project
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering design of a drainage tunnel specifies start/end positions,
   alignment, grades, and tunnel diameter/lining material. Tunnel
   construction faithfully transforms engineering design into the built
   structure in the underground space. In construction, the guidance system
   of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) is crucial to ensure all design
   specifications are met within tight tolerances. The laser-based guidance
   system has been the mainstream solution in practice. However, laser
   system setup and calibration demands experience and expertise from a
   survey crew and also results in frequent construction shutdown over
   extensive time periods. In (1) straight tunnel sections with highly
   restrained survey window or (2) curved tunnel sections, the line of
   sight between the laser station and TBM can be easily blocked. Thus,
   tunnel construction has to be more frequently shut down solely for the
   sake of calibrating or relocating the guidance system, causing
   substantial productivity loss. To improve productivity of tunnel
   construction and enhance current practice of TBM guidance, this paper
   introduces research and prototyping of the Smart Laser Projector system.
   Unlike the traditional laser system, the Smart Laser Projector does not
   rely on maintaining the parallelism between the tunnel alignment and the
   laser beam. The system calculates the as-designed coordinates of the
   center in the same cross section of the as-designed tunnel model and
   projects a laser spot at the exact as-designed position of the center of
   the target board. It presents the as-designed position information to
   guide the operator just like the conventional laser, but its operations
   take much less effort of the surveyors, and the same level of accuracy
   and reliability can be maintained. A lab test is provided to demonstrate
   the concept and prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Erasure coding has been applied in many cloud storage systems to enhance
   reliability at a lower storage cost than replication. While a large
   amount of prior work aims to enhance recovery performance and
   reliability, the overall access delay in coded storage still needs to be
   optimized. As most production systems adopt a systematic code and place
   the original copy of each block on only one server to be read normally,
   it is harder to balance server loads and more likely to incur latency
   tails in coded storage than in three-way replication, where a block can
   be read from any of the 3 servers storing the block. In this paper, we
   propose to reduce the access latency in coded storage systems by moving
   blocks with anti-correlated demands onto same servers for statistical
   load balancing. We formulate the optimal block placement as a problem
   similar to Min-k-Partition, propose a local block migration scheme, and
   derive an approximation ratio as a function of demand variation across
   blocks. Based on request traces from Windows Azure Storage, we
   demonstrate that our scheme can significantly reduce the access latency
   with only a few block moves, especially when the request demand is
   skewed.}},

Abstract = {{Cobaltite-based double perovskite oxides with high electrocatalytic
   activity and conductivity have been developed as high-performance
   cathode alternatives for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the
   use of cobaltite-based double perovskites on Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2
   (YSZ)-based SOFCs requires the application of a doped ceria barrier
   layer. This is due to their poor chemical and physical compatibility
   with the YSZ electrolyte during high-temperature sintering and
   fabrication processes. Here we report a viable approach to in operando
   assemble double perovskites such as PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta
   (PBSCF), on YSZ electrolyte and thus effectively form an
   electrode/electrolyte interface without high-temperature processing. The
   electrochemical performance of the in situ assembled PBSCF cathode is
   comparable to that of the cathode prepared by conventional methods. A
   single cell with an in situ assembled PBSCF-GDC (Gd-doped ceria) cathode
   achieved a peak power density (PPD) of 1.37 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C
   and exhibited a high stability at 500 mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C for
   100 h. Surface and cross-sectional microstructure analysis offer solid
   evidence that the PBSCF-GDC cathode/YSZ electrolyte interface was formed
   by electrochemical polarization. This work offers new opportunities to
   effectively and effortlessly use high-performance double perovskite
   cathodes in commercial SOFCs.}},

   areas of the microgrid without any communication links required among
   the local controllers. Moreover, the controller is designed to be robust
   to the variations of different parameters of the microgrid, and hence
   improves the frequency control performance significantly. Simulation
   results of a small islanded microgrid with three generators confirm the
   effectiveness of the controller design approach proposed in this paper.}},

   characterizing facial images to carry out face classification. Despite
   various automated face recognition techniques, the expert's opinion
   plays a pivotal role in making classification decisions when recognizing
   faces, say in problems of suspect identification. Here, we analyze the
   impact of critical factors (e.g., a number of experts, voting schemes,
   distance functions) and their impact on the performance of
   classification schemes. The well-established Analytic Hierarchy Process
   (AHP) is used to quantify importance of linguistic descriptors in the
   process of face recognition by humans. As a result we produce realistic
   weights improving the accuracy of classification. Experimental results
   are presented including a number of parametric studies.}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments on release behaviors of arsenic in thermal
   treatment, e.g., pyrolysis, combustion, and gasification, of a typical
   high arsenic coal were conducted in a laboratory-scale drop tube
   furnace. Mineralogy of the coal and ashes was characterized by X-ray
   diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Distributions and speciations of arsenic
   in the coal and ashes were determined by using the inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectrometry. The results indicated that quartz and pyrite in coal would
   transformed into mullite and hematite. The decompositions of pyrite are
   followed by the unreacted coal modal and controlled by the surface
   sulfur vapor pressure, and pyrite would be transformed to Fe or Fe2O3
   finally. Bleeding ration of arsenic in air combustion, CO2 gasification,
   and N-2 pyrolysis is 85, 65, and 45 \%, respectively, at 1300 degrees C.
   Arsenic is obviously enriched in the fine particles of size around
   0.1-0.2 mu m both in coal combustion and gasification. The arsenic
   species of arsenic in fine particles generated from coal gasification is
   As2O5, As, AsO, Ca-3(AsO4)(2).}},

Abstract = {{Liquid phase oxidation of a simple naphthenic-aromatic hydrocarbon was
   studied in a microreactor over low temperatures. The goal was to
   investigate how local oxygen availability could be controlled during
   oxidation and how it affected both oxidation rate and product
   selectivity. A microfluidic reactor provides a unique opportunity to
   exactly manipulate local oxygen availability by changing the
   hydrodynamics of the reactor in a Taylor flow region. Ketone-to-alcohol
   selectivity in the microreactor was increased by an order of magnitude
   from less than 1 : 1 to 14 : 1 by increasing oxygen availability in the
   liquid phase at a near constant conversion, oxygen partial pressure, and
   temperature. Similar oxidation experiments were conducted in semi-batch
   and batch reactors and the results were compared to the microreactor
   experiment. The higher ketone selectivity in the microreactor could be
   explained in terms of the oxidation of the alcohol and/or alkoxy
   radicals formed. It was observed that the selectivity to alcohols and
   addition products increased at lower oxygen availabilities. In addition
   to selectivity, the oxygen mass transfer coefficient to the liquid phase
   was also calculated based on the microreactor geometry and
   hydrodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the design of an adaptive filter in stochastic
   circuits. The proposed circuit requires lower area and power than a
   conventional stochastic implementation. In the proposed design, the
   stochastic multiplier is implemented by an XNOR gate, as in a
   conventional scheme. However, the stochastic adder based on a
   multiplexer is not a very efficient implementation due to the three
   required stochastic number generators (SNGs) and the iterative operation
   required in the adaptive filter. Thus, a novel stochastic adder using a
   counter and a post processing unit is proposed. This adder avoids the
   use of SNGs, therefore it incurs a smaller area and power, while
   operating faster than the conventional (multiplexer-based) stochastic
   adder. In terms of accuracy and hardware efficiency, simulation results
   show that the adaptive filter using the proposed stochastic design
   outperforms the conventional stochastic implementation using linear
   feedback shift register (LFSR) based SNGs. Specifically, the proposed
   design consumes 35.81\% less dynamic power and 21.34\% less area than an
   LFSR-based implementation at a slightly higher accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate memory is a promising technology for emerging recognition,
   mining and vision applications. These applications require the
   processing of large volumes of data to achieve energy-efficiency with
   negligible accuracy loss. This paper proposes a multi-level approximate
   memory architecture based on data significance analysis. In this
   architecture, a memory array is divided into several separated banks
   with different predefined accuracy levels. A key novelty of this work is
   the design of a memory controller that distributes data to the memory
   banks according to the results of data significance analysis. When
   applied to a DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) processing module, the
   proposed approximate memory controller can achieve over 60\% power
   saving with on-chip memory model of multiple supply voltage SRAM banks,
   at the cost of a marginal output PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio)
   degradation of 3.34 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Given the high-dimensionality of the original data, dimensionality
   reduction becomes a necessary step in data processing. In this study, a
   novel unsupervised feature selection model is proposed, which regards
   the unsupervised feature selection process as nonnegative subspace
   learning. Considering the efficiency of the learned subspace which can
   better indicate the selected features, a nonnegative sparsity adaptive
   subspace learning framework is proposed. It adapts the sparsity by
   weighted l(2),(1) model. Specifically, the weights are defined by
   multi-stage support detection. Then we provide an approach to solve this
   weighted l(2,1) constraint non-convex problem leading to the
   Non-negative Sparsity Adaptive Subspace Learning (NSASL) algorithm. By
   the experiments which are conducted on real-word datasets, the
   superiority of proposed method over seven state-of-the- art unsupervised
   feature selection algorithms is verified.}},

Abstract = {{A multiplier has a significant impact on the speed and power dissipation
   of an arithmetic processor. Precise results are not always required in
   many algorithms, such as those for classification and recognition in
   data processing. Moreover, many errors do not make an obvious difference
   in applications such as image processing due to the perceptual
   limitations of human beings. Error-tolerant algorithms and applications
   have promoted the development of approximate multipliers to tradeoff
   accuracy for speed, implementation area and/or power efficiency. This
   paper briefly reviews the current designs of approximate multipliers and
   provides a comparative evaluation of their error and circuit
   characteristics. Image sharpening is performed using the considered
   approximate multipliers to assess their performance in such

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approximate scheme for a coordinate rotation
   digital computer (CORDIC) design; this scheme is based on modifying the
   existing Para-CORDIC architecture with multiple approximations. These
   approximations make possible a relaxation of the CORDIC algorithm
   itself, such that a fully parallel approximate CORDIC (FPAX-CORDIC)
   scheme is designed. This scheme avoids the memory register of
   Para-CORDIC and makes fully parallel the generation of the rotation
   direction. A comprehensive analysis and the evaluation of the error
   introduced by the approximations together with different circuit-related
   metrics are pursued using HSPICE as simulation tool. The error analysis
   of this paper combines existing figures of merit for approximate
   computing (such as the Mean Error Distance (MED)) with CORDIC-specific
   parameters; a good agreement between expected and simulated error values
   is found. As an application to image processing, the Discrete Cosine
   Transformation (DCT) is investigated by utilizing the proposed
   approximate FPAX-CORDIC architecture with different accuracy
   requirements. The results confirm the viability of the proposed scheme.}},

   provide a clear understanding of the generation of ZSCC. And then the

   impact on the common mode current (CMC), and switching losses are made
   and compared with the existing methods. The proposed method has been

Abstract = {{A series distributed generation (DG) units based islanding microgrid
   configuration and the corresponding power sharing method are proposed in
   this paper. Unlike a conventional islanding microgrid where parallel DG
   units are connected to the point of common coupling (PCC) to supply
   electricity to loads in a cooperative manner, this paper discusses the
   possibility of using series connected low voltage (LV) converters as an
   alternative solution. It has been demonstrated that the DC/DC boost
   conversion in the back stage of a conventional DG unit can be removed
   from this proposed microgrid. In addition, via a very simple power
   factor-frequency inverse droop control, an accurate real and reactive
   power sharing can be simultaneously achieved in multiple series DG
   units. Note that the effectiveness of the proposed power sharing control
   does not rely on the communications between DG units or the knowledge of
   detailed microgird circuitry parameters. Therefore, the challenging
   power sharing problems in conventional islanding microgrids is perfectly
   solved with this proposed configuration and the control method.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate large signal analysis and modeling of Power Electronics
   converters are essential for achieving high performance and reliable
   designs. Converter topologies with large signal variations are
   conventionally analyzed using numerical methods, averaged or inaccurate

   transform is developed to derive the steady state response of periodic
   signals with a switching input signal. It is shown that the proposed
   methodology provides accurate and parametric analysis tool for dc-dc
   power converters specially for resonant converters and has many
   applications in design and analysis of the converters and their control
   systems. The proposed method is used to analyze and model a few power
   circuit including full bridge Series Resonant Converter (SRC) topology
   where both CCM and DCM operating modes are analyzed. It is observed that
   the proposed analysis approach gives great insight and simplifies

Abstract = {{Cuckoo search (CS) is a novel biologically inspired algorithm and has
   been widely applied to many fields. Although some binary-coded CS
   variants are developed to solve 0-1 knapsack problems, the search
   accuracy and the convergence speed are still needed to further improve.
   According to the analysis of the shortcomings of the standard CS and the
   advantage of the global harmony search (GHS), a novel hybrid
   meta-heuristic optimization approach, called cuckoo search Algorithm
   with global harmony search (CSGHS), is proposed in this paper to solve
   0-1 knapsack problems (KP) more effectively. In CSGHS, it is the
   combination of the exploration of GHS and the exploitation of CS that
   makes the CSGHS efficient and effective. The experiments conducted
   demonstrate that the CSGHS generally outperformed the binary cuckoo
   search, the binary shuffled frog-leaping algorithm and the binary
   differential evolution in accordance with the search accuracy and
   convergence speed. Therefore, the proposed hybrid algorithm is effective
   to solve 0-1 knapsack problems.}},

Abstract = {{We study the contribution of variable surface effects to the antiplane
   deformation of a linearly elastic material with a mode-III crack. The
   surface elasticity is incorporated using a modified version of the
   continuum based surface/interface model of Gurtin and Murdoch. In our
   discussion, the surface moduli are not constant but vary along the crack
   surfaces. Using Green's function method, the problem is reduced to a
   single first-order Cauchy singular integro-differential equation, which
   is solved numerically using Chebyshev polynomials and a collocation
   method. Our results indicate that the gradient of the surface shear
   modulus exerts a significant influence on the crack opening displacement
   and on the singular stress field at the crack tips.}},

Abstract = {{Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm has good adaptability to
   deal with high dimensional, small sample, and nonlinear problems. The
   standard GPR algorithm assumes constant noise power throughout the
   sampling process. However, different sample points are often affected by
   different degrees of noise, which will reduce the modeling accuracy and
   increase uncertainty of the prediction in the standard GPR algorithm. In
   this paper, we introduce a weighting strategy to the standard GPR
   algorithm, and propose a weighted GPR (W-GPR) algorithm. Different from
   the standard GPR algorithm, the proposed W-GPR algorithm assigns a
   weight to each observation. In addition, in order to optimize
   hyper-parameters in the GPR modeling process, the particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm is used instead of the traditional gradient
   method. By means of a numerical example and one chemical process
   example, the W-GPR algorithm significantly reduces the uncertainty of
   the prediction, and improves the accuracy of the model. Further,
   simulation results demonstrate that the W-GPR model optimized by the PSO
   algorithm achieves a more accurate and reliable estimation result than
   the traditional gradient method.}},

   CMUT arrays. Recently, we showed precise models for simulating the

   with excellent agreements with FEM and experimental results. In this
   work the model was extended to simulate large-scale multi-frequency CMUT
   arrays for realistic ultrasound applications which is not feasible with
   FEM analysis. The models predicted the effects of the mutual radiation
   impedance between cells with dissimilar sizes for complex and

   evaluated on performance of the array for different sets of CMUT

Abstract = {{To reduce the greenhouse effects due to the massive emission of CO2,
   efficient reduction of carbon footprint and effective utilization of CO2
   have been a crucial research field worldwide in the past few decades.
   Novel catalysts efficiently facilitating the conversion of CO2 into
   target chemicals are highly desirable. Herein, we developed a new
   cathode with in situ exsolved Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles embedded in an
   active (Pr0.4Sr0.6)(3)(Fe0.85Mo0.15)(2)O-7 (PSFM) double-layered
   perovskite backbone (Co-Fe-PSFM), which acts as a more stable and
   efficient catalyst to promote CO2 electrolysis in a high temperature
   solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) compared to the
   Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3-delta (PSCFM) cubic perovskite. This newly
   developed material shows superb redox reversibility between reduction
   and re-oxidation cycles. Additionally, a remarkable current density of
   1.01 A cm(-2) of the SOEC with the Co-Fe-PSFM cathode in conjunction
   with an impressive polarization area-specific resistance (ASR) as low as
   0.455 Omega cm(2) of the cathode was achieved at 1.6 V and 850 degrees
   C. In particular, a high value of Faraday efficiency (similar to 93\%)
   was achieved at 0.8 V (vs. OCV) and 850 degrees C. More importantly, the
   cell with the new cathode shows no observable degradation and carbon
   formation at 850 degrees C over a period of 100 h at a constant applied
   potential. The improved oxygen vacancies resulted from the exsolving
   process, and phase change (cubic perovskite to double-layered
   perovskite), together with the exsolved Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles,
   contributed to the improved catalytic activity, high Faraday efficiency,
   good stability, and excellent coking resistance for CO2 electrolysis. In
   light of the properties above, double-layered PSFM socketed with Co-Fe
   alloy nanoparticles is an attractive ceramic material for
   intermediate/high temperature applications, especially for CO2
   electrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions involving deformable surfaces reveal a number of
   distinguishing physicochemical characteristics that do not exist in
   interactions between rigid solid surfaces. A unique fully
   custom-designed instrument, referred to as integrated thin liquid film
   force apparatus (ITLFFA), was developed to study the interactions
   between one deformable and one solid surface in liquid. Incorporating a
   bimorph force sensor with interferometry, this device allows for the
   simultaneous measurement of the time-dependent interaction force and the
   corresponding spatiotemporal film thickness of the intervening liquid
   film. The ITLFFA possesses the specific feature of conducting
   measurement under a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions, with a
   displacement velocity of deformable surfaces ranging from 2 mm s(-1) to
   50 mm s(-1.) Equipped with a high speed camera, the results of a bubble
   interacting with hydrophilic and partially hydrophobic surfaces in
   aqueous solutions indicated that ITLFFA can provide information on
   interaction forces and thin liquid film drainage dynamics not only in a
   stable film but also in films of the quick rupture process. The weak
   interaction force was extracted from a measured film profile. Because of
   its well-characterized experimental conditions, ITLFFA permits the
   accurate and quantitative comparison/validation between measured and
   calculated interaction forces and temporal film profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Needle insertion is commonly used in procedures such as prostate
   brachytherapy or biopsy. In prostate brachytherapy, the success of the
   procedure depends on the accurate placement of needles in their
   pre-planned target location. In order to steer the needle towards a
   defined target, past research has used ultrasound-image-based needle
   localization for needle tip position feedback. Acquiring and processing
   of ultrasound images, however, significantly limits the control sampling
   rate. This work proposes a method for needle path prediction and control
   without the need for image feedback. The needle tip path obtained during
   insertion from a force-sensor based deflection estimator is used to
   parameterize a kinematic bicycle model. The bicycle model is then used
   to predict the needle tip path and the ideal rotation depth for reaching
   a desired target. Experimental results show that the introduced method
   accurately predicts the needle tip path and the ideal rotation depth to
   guide the needle to a pre-defined target.}},

Abstract = {{Robotics-assisted needle steering can enhance the accuracy of
   needle-based medical interventions, especially when the designated
   target locations are obscured by obstacles. However, the steering
   techniques using standard needles are not capable of achieving high
   curvatures and cannot follow tightly curved paths inside tissue. In this
   work, we introduce a new notched steerable needle with improved
   curvature. The notched needle is developed by carving a series of small
   notches on a regular needle shaft. The notches decrease the needle's
   flexural rigidity and increase the maximum achievable curvature. First,
   we develop a model of the notched needle deflection inside soft tissue
   using the finite element method (FEM). The model relates the needle
   radius of curvature to the number of notches and their locations on the
   needle shaft. Next, the capability of the notched steerable needle in
   achieving high curvature and the model's accuracy in predicting needle
   curvature are validated by performing several needle insertion
   experiments on a tissue phantom. The results demonstrate that our newly
   developed needles can achieve a minimum radius of curvature of 198 mm,
   which is 67\% better than standard needles, enabling future research in
   needle steering in tight spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy is a widely used treatment for patients with localized
   cancer where high doses of radiation are administered to cancerous
   tissue by implanting radioactive seeds into the prostate using long
   beveled-tip needles. Accurate seed placement is an important factor that
   influences the outcome of the treatment. In this paper, we present and
   study the suitability of a new framework for computer-assisted needle
   steering during seed implantation in brachytherapy. The framework is
   based on a hand held brachytherapy needle steering apparatus. As the
   needle is manually inserted, the device automatically rotates the
   needle's base axially at appropriate depths inside tissue in order to
   control the trajectory of the needle tip towards a target. The steering
   controller is based on the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree algorithm that
   updates the necessary manoeuvres online. Experimental results performed
   in phantom and ex-vivo biological tissues show an average absolute
   targeting error of 0.56 +/- 0.62 and 0.48 +/- 0.48 mm, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate brachytherapy is a current technique used to treat cancerous

   tracked needle shape is used to update the parameters of a kinematic
   bicycle model in a robust manner to predict the shape of the entire
   needle after it is fully inserted. The method is verified in both
   ex-vivo beef phantom tissue and in-vivo clinical images, yielding an

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a needle steering strategy designed to reduce
   the out-of-plane deflection of a flexible, bevel-tipped needle for
   clinical needle insertion applications. This is performed through an
   integrator-backstepping approach. Integrator-backstepping is a nonlinear
   feedback controller design that divides the entire system into a
   sequence of smaller design problems that are easier to manage.
   Simulations were performed to observe the effects of our controller
   design on the system's response, specifically the rate at which the
   out-of-plane deflection converges. We tested our proposed method using a
   biological tissue phantom composed of two separate heterogeneous layers
   and using an 18 gauge brachytherapy needle. A paired-sample t-test was
   performed to compare out-of-plane needle deflection results with and
   without the use of our needle steering algorithm under varying
   bevel-angle starting conditions. Results showed a significant decrease
   in the out-of-plane needle deflection with the use of our controller at
   the 1\% significance level. The absolute-mean out-of-plane needle
   deflection at a depth of 140 mm changed from 7.1 mm to 0.7 mm with the
   implementation of our needle steering approach. Our proposed steering
   method does not require ``drilling{''} motions often encountered in
   duty-cycling controllers, and has been shown to be effective for
   clinical needles travelling through multiple heterogeneous tissue

Abstract = {{In many subcutaneous needle insertion procedures, measuring needle
   deflection is necessary in order to accurately guide the needle towards
   inner body targets. Typically, needle deflection measurement are
   obtained from 2D ultrasound images, which can only provide the needle
   tip position, however, having knowledge about the needle tip heading
   (orientation) is very valuable in predicting the needle's future path
   for planning and needle steering reasons. Due to the small diameter of
   the needles and the low resolution of ultrasound imaging, the direct
   measurement of the needle tip orientation is not a trivial task. This
   paper represents a model-based non linear observer for partial
   estimating the needle tip orientation during needle insertion procedures
   using image-based position measurements. The proposed method employs a
   3D kinematic unicycle model expressed in generalized coordinates.
   Applying nonlinear transformations on system states, the linearized
   transformed system equations are utilized in the observer design
   procedure. However, due to the singularities imposed by these
   transformations, certain assumptions are made for the convergence proof
   of the observer. The proposed observer is tested in simulations and
   experiments. In experiments, the observer is fed by the needle tip
   position measurements, which are obtained from real-time ultrasound
   images.}},

Abstract = {{PID controllers are widely used in industry because of their remarkable
   effectiveness and simplicity of implementation. The PID parameters can
   smartly be tuned using random search optimization algorithms. This
   article aims to introduce a high-accuracy and high-speed-of-convergence
   Vector-Based Swarm Optimization (VBSO) algorithm, which is able to
   suitably orient solutions towards global optimum. To demonstrate its
   effectiveness, the VBSO is applied to two set of case studies: benchmark
   functions and Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) systems. By applying it
   to 12 well-known benchmark functions with different degrees of
   complexity. it is shown that the VBSO performs faster and more
   accurately than PSO and pPSA algorithms. Moreover, the VBSO is applied
   to the problem of tuning PID parameters for AVR systems. Considering
   several objective functions used in different research works, simulation
   results confirm that the proposed PID controllers perform better than
   those given by PSO, APSO, DE, MOL, and ABC algorithms.}},

   event-based state estimation system (see Fig. 3.1) is composed of four
   parts: the process to be estimated, the sensors, the event-triggering
   scheme and the estimator. In applications to remote control and
   monitoring, the sensors and the event-triggering schemes are normally
   located on the process side, while the estimators are on the remote
   side, which are sometimes referred to as remote estimators. To aid the
   readers, some commonly used notation throughout the remaining chapters
   of the book is introduced in this chapter as well.}},

Abstract = {{In the previous chapter, approximation techniques were utilized to
   exploit the information contained in the event-triggering sets for
   event-based estimator design. As has been mentioned earlier, the
   motivation of undertaking these approximations arises from the
   non-Gaussianity issue caused by the event-triggered measurement
   information, and the consequence is that the results and properties are
   obtained in an approximate sense, with the approximation errors
   difficult to evaluate. One possible way to avoid these approximations is
   to formulate the event-based state estimation problems into constrained
   optimization problems, which is discussed in detail in this chapter.
   Apart from estimator design, a general framework to evaluate
   sensor-to-estimator communication rates is also introduced.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the state estimation problem for a class of stochastic
   event-triggering conditions is considered. Different from the problems
   considered in Chap. 4, the exact MMSE estimates can be developed without
   resorting to the Gaussian approximations in this scenario. The central
   idea behind the stochastic event-trigger compared with its deterministic
   counterpart is that at each time instant, the sensor, instead of sending
   its data to the remote estimator by probability 1 or 0, decides whether
   or not to trigger an event with a data-dependent probability. The
   probability is chosen in such a manner that the distribution of the
   measurement conditioned on this event maintains a Gaussian distribution
   (rather than a truncated Gaussian distribution). In this way, the
   originally difficult nonlinear estimation problem is changed into a
   linear problem, and the closed-form expressions for the MMSE estimates
   as well as the corresponding estimation error covariance matrices can be
   obtained. Based on the estimator equations, the performance of the MMSE
   estimates is analyzed, and a method of designing the parameters in the
   event-triggering conditions is further introduced.}},

   using an approach called ``set-valued filtering{''}. With this approach,
   the design of an event-based estimator becomes a much simpler task. The
   main benefit of using the set-valued filtering approach is that the
   properties of the event-based estimates designed for deterministic
   event-triggering conditions can be analyzed without relying on any
   assumptions or approximations of the probability distributions. The
   properties of the set-valued event-based estimates also lead to a new

   requirements on the estimation performance and the sensor-to-estimator
   communication rate.}},

Abstract = {{Group decision making situations are part of today's organizations. It
   is a type of decision making involving many decision makers which act
   collectively to choose the best alternative (or alternatives) from a set
   of feasible alternatives. Usually, numerical values have been used by
   the decision makers to express their opinions on the possible
   alternatives. However, as the standard representation of the concepts
   that humans use for communication is the natural language, words or
   linguistic terms instead of numerical values should be used by the
   decision makers to provide their preferences. In such a situation, the
   linguistic information has to be made operational in order to be fully
   utilized. In this contribution, assuming that decision makers express
   their opinions by using linguistic terms, we present an information
   granulation of such a type of information, which is formulated as an
   optimization problem in which consistency is maximized by a suitable
   mapping of the linguistic terms on information granules. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Wind is one of the fastest growing sources of green energy in the last
   few decades. A special attention has been recently focused on the wind
   ramps, sudden changes in wind power production caused by surges of wind
   speed (both increases and decreases).
   In this paper, sensitivity analysis of Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA) method is preformed on wind speed dataset with the 5 minute time
   resolution. Principal Component Analysis results can be used to evaluate
   conditional probability of forthcoming wind ramp event. Advantage of PCA
   method compared to conventional approaches is that numerical weather
   prediction model producing wind forecasts is not required. Two important
   input parameters are analyzed: the wind ramp duration and the wind ramp
   magnitude, respectively.
   Results show rapid increase of the first principal component value, when
   ramp duration is prolonging, nevertheless other two components seems to
   be insensitive in this case. Boxplots are illustrated for simple
   comparability of resultant distributions. The number of down ramp events
   is always lower than the number of up ramps, and with increasing
   percentage threshold these numbers are decreasing exponentially.
   Moreover trends of average PCA values for down ramp events are not
   monotone with significant jumps and drops.}},

Abstract = {{Structural steel is heavily utilized in the construction industry from
   residential and commercial buildings to oil and gas projects. For steel
   fabrication companies as suppliers of steel structures, submitting
   competitive project bids requires substantial knowledge of the company's
   practices on the shop floor and extensive experience to interpret that
   into credible cost estimations. Being able to make reliable estimates
   would contribute to the company's competitiveness in the long run. In
   this study, the total quantity of worker-hours or man-hours required for
   each major subdivision of a project is considered as the variable of
   interest in estimating a steel fabrication project, mainly because of
   the labor-intensive nature of steel fabrication. In collaboration with a
   partner company, three years of project data, were collected by matching
   the company's building information modeling (BIM) system with their
   labor costing system resulting in over 3,000 records, each representing
   the quantity takeoff for 46 design features and the worker-hours
   expended in shop fabrication. Stepwise regression and error analysis are
   used to recognize the most crucial design features in estimating project
   worker-hours, allowing discovery of the minimized set of inputs for
   estimating worker-hours and characterization of the estimation
   uncertainties. This labor cost estimation benefits estimators and shop
   production planners in that they can configure labor resources to
   deploy, schedule shop floor production, and recognize estimates'
   associated errors, based on the company's historical data. This study is
   an example of using BIM data and providing tools for structural
   engineers to consider steel fabrication and possibly achieve more
   sustainable designs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforced steel rebar is commonly supplied in one-dimensional stocks
   and typically designed for and installed in various structural
   components in civil and industrial construction. Surplus reinforcement
   constitutes a major fraction of construction generated waste. Cutting
   one-dimensional stocks to suit construction project requirements results
   in cutting losses. Therefore, reducing steel waste (or minimizing
   cutting losses) has long been the focus of academic research in
   one-dimensional stock design and cutting problems. Previous research
   developed mathematical models in an attempt to analytically minimize
   cutting losses based on preliminary engineering designs, but little
   insight has been provided on how to integrate minimization of cutting
   losses and engineering design into an integrated optimization problem,
   let alone considering minimizing total steel rebar installation cost as
   a parallel objective. The sustainability issue in regard to balancing
   reinforcement waste and crew installation costs on the basis of
   optimized engineering design has yet to be addressed. This study
   introduces a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach to generate
   optimal cutting patterns, minimum cutting losses and associated total
   installation cost. A reinforced concrete slab case is adopted as a test
   to show that the proposed methodology is capable of producing optimal
   tradeoff solutions in slab reinforcement detailing design, resulting in
   less wastage and lower crew installation cost. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Title = {{Molecular dynamics study on structure evolution of monocarboxylic acid
   intercalated layered double hydroxides}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{101}},
Pages = {{98804-98811}},
Abstract = {{Hydrotalcite derived materials are considered to be promising candidates
   for solid sorbents for carbon dioxide capture at intermediate
   temperatures (250-400 degrees C). The recently developed organically
   intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) shows a great improvement in
   carbon dioxide adsorption capacity compared to alternative sorbents.
   However, the molecular-scale structure of this new class of materials is
   yet to be understood, hindering the further development of high-capacity
   carbon dioxide adsorbents based on LDH. In the current study, classical
   molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the
   atomistic structures of monocarboxylic acid intercalated LDHs containing
   Mg and Al in the ratio 3 : 1. The replacement of carbonate anions by
   stearate anions (CH3(CH2)(16)COO-) in LDH expanded the basal spacing
   from 7.8 angstrom to 19.6 angstrom. The presence of water molecules
   could further increase the basal spacing to up to 33.5 angstrom. In
   addition, the basal spacing of LDH could be expanded by other carboxylic
   anions (e.g., CH3(CH2)(11)COO-, CH3(CH2) 5COO(-)), and the spacing was
   proportional to the length of the carbon chains. Water molecules inside
   interlayer galleries tend to bond firstly with the hydroxyl groups of
   hydroxide layers, and water molecules added subsequently then fill the
   gallery space. For comparison, LDHs intercalated by CH3(CH2)(16)COO- and
   CH3(CH2)(6)COO- were prepared by the acid-aided anion-exchange method
   and characterized by powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis,
   thermogravimetry (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The
   basal spacing and XRD patterns observed in the simulations are in good
   agreement with experimental observations. The quantitative analyses in
   this work could provide guidelines for optimizing the lamellar structure
   of LDH to improve its capacity for CO2 capture.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors (SCs) are increasingly used in energy storage system
   (ESS) to tackle the fast power transients. They can be used individually
   or together with other energy storage units like batteries. In a
   microgrid, multiple SCs could be installed at different locations
   without communication among each other. This paper addresses the energy
   management strategy (EMS) of multiple SCs in a DC microgrid, where the
   distributed generation (DGs) units and energy storage units are
   controlled with the plug-n-play feature. A novel EMS is proposed, which
   uses the state of charge (SOC) based adaptive virtual impedance to
   facilitate the transient power sharing among the parallel SCs without
   physical communications. The detailed analysis and design procedure are
   explained based on an example microgrid system with two SCs and one
   battery energy storage connected in parallel through the DC/DC
   converters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by

Abstract = {{Mixed road users on most urban arterials are controlled by the same set
   of signals and must compete for shared road space. Transit signal
   priority (TSP) systems have been established to improve transit service
   operations in mixed traffic. To balance the benefits of priority control
   with the negative effects, most existing adaptive TSP strategies
   normally use an integrated performance index, a weighted sum of all
   types of delays, for evaluation and optimization. In a previous study,
   the authors formulated the TSP optimization into a quadratic programming
   problem with an enhanced delay-based performance index to obtain global
   optimization. In this study, the problem was formulated into a multi
   objective optimization model, which was solved with a nondominated
   sorting genetic algorithm. Pareto-optimal front results were presented
   to evaluate the trade-offs between two objectives: minimization of
   private vehicle delay and of bus delay. Then the most appropriate
   solution was chosen with high-level information. A simulation study was
   conducted along 7.4 km of a bus corridor, with an adaptive TSP
   simulation platform, by using a full-scale signal simulator, ASC/3, in
   Vissim. The results show that the Pareto-optimal solutions provided more
   interesting practical options for decision makers.}},

   precoding can achieve lower outage probability than that with a total
   power constraint under the standard MRT precoding, even though its power

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a low-complexity precoding scheme for the downlink
   of single-cell two-user massive multi-input- multi-output (MIMO)
   systems, which can be seen as a combination of matched-filter (MF)
   precoding with extra user power adjustment. In this scheme, the base
   station (BS) antennas are grouped into two sets according to their
   channels, then each set has a main user to serve and a power coefficient
   is introduced to adjust the weighting between main user and the other
   user. Via theoretical analysis on the statistical properties of the
   signal power and interference power, the achievable sum-rate is derived.
   In addition, the power adjustment coefficient optimization with respect
   to the sum-rate maximization is solved. Our results show that the
   proposed precoding outperforms the standard MF precoding.}},

   networks, where the relay station is equipped with a large number of

   low-complexity processing. Different from existing work, we consider the
   practical scenario with limited number of users, fixed source power, and
   fixed relay power. Our work shows that the interference is neither
   negligible nor asymptotically deterministic, and it dominates the
   statistical properties of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR). Via deriving an approximation on the probability density
   function (PDF) of the interference power, analytical results on the

Abstract = {{Recently, Wang et al. proposed a new kind of metaheuristic algorithm,
   called Monarch Butterfly Optimization (MBO), for global continuous
   optimization tasks. It has experimentally proven that it has better
   performance than some other heuristic search strategies. On the other
   hand, travelling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most
   representative NP-hard problems that are hard to be solved by
   traditional methods. It has been widely studied and solved by several
   metaheuristic algorithms. In this paper, MBO is discretized, and then a
   discrete MBO (DMBO), and firstly used to solve Chinese TSP (CTSP). In
   the basic MBO, Wang et al. had made little effort to fine-tune the
   parameters. In our present work, the parametric study for one of the
   most parameter, butterfly adjusting rate (BAR), is also provided. The
   best-selected BAR is inserted into the DMBO method and then solve CTSP
   problem. By comparing with three other algorithms, experimental results
   presented clearly demonstrates DMBO as an attractive addition to the
   portfolio of swarm intelligence techniques.}},

   In this paper, brain storm optimization in objective space (BSO-OS)

   goal is to measure the performance and effectiveness of BSO-OS
   algorithm. The experimental tests are conducted on eight benchmark
   functions. Based on the experimental results, the conclusions could be
   made that the BSO-OS algorithm performs good on solving multimodal

Abstract = {{The process of particle formation from evaporating droplets containing
   more than one solute was studied. Two-component microparticles were
   produced using a piezoceramic dispenser with an inner diameter of 30 mu
   m. Initial droplets had a diameter in the range of 70-85 mu m and
   contained sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate in different molar ratios
   of 30:70, 50:50, and 70:30, corresponding to weight ratios of 26.5:73.5,
   45.7:54.3, and 66.2:33.8, in the form of aqueous solutions with initial
   concentrations of 1 or 10mg/ml. The monodisperse droplets were dried in
   a dry laminar gas flow with temperatures of 50 degrees C or 100 degrees
   C. Different initial conditions affected the particle formation process
   and the particle morphology. The diameter of the final dried
   microparticles ranged from 4 to 10 mu m. Their density varied from 1250
   to 1950mg/ml. The formulation and process conditions determined the
   distribution of chemical components in the dried microparticles,
   especially their surface composition as determined by energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy. The distribution of the chemical components was
   theoretically explained using characteristic times for the
   crystallization kinetics of the drying process. It was shown that the
   solute that reached supersaturation first formed most of the outer shell
   of the microparticles.(c) 2016 American Association for Aerosol Research}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The trapped geothermal heat in the infinite rock mass through
   which mine tunnels are excavated is a great threat to the safety of
   personnel and mine operating equipment in deep underground hot mines. In
   order to lessen the temperature inside the tunnel a considerable amount
   of energy is being spent by the way of using ventilation and cooling
   systems to dissipate the heat. However, operational costs of the system
   rise quite considerably, especially as the mines get deeper. Shotcrete
   is used both as a structural lining and as an effective insulation to
   reduce the heat load on the ventilation and cooling system within such
   tunnels. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to analyse this problem of heat
   flow and thermal stresses and their time dependent pattern, several
   cylindrical models, in both analytical and numerical forms, are
   discussed and compared in this paper.
   Findings - This study shows the validation of ABAQUS (R) software to
   predict the time dependent temperature and the thermal stresses in mine
   tunnels through the comparisons with the available analytical models.
   Further, thermal insulation effects of shotcrete are also evaluated with
   these theoretical models and it is found that all the models gave
   results in close agreements with one another.
   Originality/value - Therefore, this study provides the theoretical proof
   for advantages in applying shotcrete as the thermal insulation layer in
   underground mines.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Abstract = {{Nano-electrodeposition has been demonstrated to be more effective in
   protecting materials from corrosion, compared to conventional
   electrodeposition. However, debate still exists regarding why
   nanocrystalline electrodeposits show more negative corrosion potentials
   but lower corrosion rates than those of coarse-grained electrodeposits.
   In this work, we investigated corrosion behaviors of electrodeposited
   nanocrystalline and microcrystalline zinc coatings in a 3.5 wt\% NaCl
   solution, and related them to the electron work functions of the
   coatings in order to understand the addressed issue based on the
   electron stability. It is demonstrated that the corrosion potential
   (phi(m)) of a deposit depends on its electron work function (phi(m)) and
   the contact potential difference at the electrodeposit/solution
   interface (Delta(m)(s)psi). phi(m) reflects the stability of electrons
   in the deposit, while Delta(m psi)(s) reflects the environmental
   influence on the chemical stability of the deposit, which affects the
   actual corrosion rate. The present study shows that electrons in the
   nanocrystalline zinc coating are less confined due to its high-density
   grain boundaries, corresponding to lowered phi(m). However,
   Delta(m)(s)psi of the nanocrystalline coating is more positive than that
   of coarse-grained one, leading to a lower corrosion rate. This study
   helps end the debate and provide relevant information for optimize
   nanocrystalline electrodeposits.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical noise (EN), as one of the most promising in situ
   electrochemical methods in corrosion and electrochemical science, has
   been developing rapidly in recent years with the advancements in

   its application in long-term or early stage corrosion process monitoring
   because it instantly detects corrosion rate and corrosion forms.
   Investigators have applied various mathematical methods to extract
   characteristic parameters from EN. In this paper, identifying corrosion
   forms using parameters obtained from time domain, frequency domain and
   time-frequency domain is reviewed, and the correlation between
   parameters and corrosion forms is discussed. Finally, other in situ
   techniques are recommended to be employed synchronously with EN
   measurement in order to obtain reliable analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The number of lost-time accidents associated with hot fluids and steam
   is of the same magnitude as those attributed to flash fire, yet little
   attention has been paid to protection against these hazards.
   Conventional materials that are used in the petrochemical industry for
   protection against short-duration flash fires do not perform well
   against either a hot liquid or steam hazard primarily because the fluid
   is able to penetrate the materials. ASTM F2701, Evaluating Heat Transfer
   Through Materials for Protective Clothing. Upon Contact with a Hot
   Liquid Splash, was compared to two other similar test methods developed
   at the University of Alberta. Tests of the three methods were conducted
   using materials intended to protect individuals against a hot liquid
   splash. All materials used in the evaluation contained either a
   semipermeable membrane (polytetrafluoroethylene or polyurethane) or were
   impermeable to liquid penetration; as a result, energy transfer rates
   were low in comparison to permeable, or more conventional,
   flame-resistant materials. The analysis used in the evaluation of test
   methods utilized energy absorbed at the sensor surface rather than Stoll
   because, in most cases, the materials were protective enough to prevent
   burn injury under the chosen fluid temperatures and exposure durations.
   Both alternative test methods were found to provide superior
   differentiation among fabrics compared to the existing standard. In the
   set of fabrics tested (a mix of semipermeable and impermeable), SPSS (a
   statistical package) was used to evaluate test results. The ASTM F2701
   method was only able to separate the samples into three groups based on
   energy transferred through the material. Both alternative test methods
   were able to separate the test fabrics into six distinct groups,
   indicating that both alternative tests provided better differentiation
   among fabrics than ASTM F2701.}},

Abstract = {{Existing test methods for determining of thermal protection from fire
   offered by textiles are typically characterized by the exposure of
   specimens to a controlled flame and measurement of energy transferred
   through the specimen. The measured energy transfer is then used to
   differentiate materials or further processing (burn injury prediction)
   is used as a basis for comparison. The test conditions are set by
   measuring the energy transferred to the sensor or sensors in absence of
   a test specimen. In order to represent a potential hazard and provide
   good differentiation among tested materials, an exposure heat flux is
   required that allows for rapid and substantial increase in the
   temperature of the tested specimen. A specified heat flux of 80-84
   kW/m(2) is common in both bench-scale and full-scale tests. Because of
   the use of controlled flame and significant energy transfer rates
   involved in these tests, there is a common misconception that these test
   methods constitute a simulation of a particular hazard, especially with
   regard to the hazard of hydrocarbon flash fires. In order to provide a
   basis for comparing specified test conditions with real-world hazard
   conditions, a series of heat flux measurements were performed on
   propane-fueled flash fires in open air. In each test, an array of heat
   flux sensors was positioned around a propane source. A large fuel cloud
   was allowed to form and subsequently ignited using a pilot flame. These
   experiments were carried out outdoors and as such were subject to
   prevailing wind currents. Because of the potentially high variability,
   more than 50 separate fuel releases were undertaken. The output of the
   array of sensors was used to determine the intensity and duration of
   each flash fire event. In addition to the array of heat flux sensors, an
   instrumented mannequin was constructed to measure the heat flux incident
   on a human form within the flash fire. The results indicate that there
   was significant variability in the conditions in each fire due to the
   open air conditions creating unpredictable distribution of fuel and air.
   Flash fires occurred that were less severe and more severe than the
   conditions used in standardized laboratory testing.}},

Abstract = {{Round-robin testing of European-weight structural firefighting clothing
   was undertaken at the request of Working Group 1 of the International
   Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee
   94/Subcommittee 14, Firefighters' Personal Equipment. The primary
   purpose was to gage the suitability of ISO 13506:2008, Protective
   Clothing Against Heat and Flame Test Method for Complete Garments
   Prediction of Burn Injury Using an Instrumented Manikin, for this type
   of testing by measuring the interlaboratory variability with existing
   laboratories. The impetus for the study was the lack of agreement
   reported by three laboratories in Europe when testing similar clothing.
   Fifty test garments of one design were produced by one clothing
   manufacturer from supplied materials. Six sets of randomly selected
   two-piece suits (jacket and trousers) were sent to each of seven
   laboratories for testing according to ISO 13506:2008. The seven
   laboratories were located in five different countries in three regions
   of the world: Asia, Europe, and North America. The exposure durations
   were 8 s at an average heat flux of 84 kW/m(2). Data from the mannequin
   sensors were gathered for 240 s. The predicted total skin burn injury
   under the garment showed reasonable agreement among five of the seven
   laboratories. Two of the laboratories reported total skin burn injury
   results that were significantly different from the others. In response
   to the lack of agreement, a heat flux calibration system was circulated
   to the laboratories as a means of independently checking the sensor
   calibration-skin burn injury calculation as required in the ISO
   13506:2008 test method. The results showed that the two laboratories
   with the low predicted skin burn injuries overpredicted the time it
   takes for injury to occur; another laboratory, one with the highest
   predicted skin burn injury, underpredicted the time required. These
   errors could be due to improper calibration of the sensors or errors in
   the numerical codes used for the calculations (or both). Observations on
   smoke generation, after-flaming, and shrinkage are also reported.
   Recommendations for modifications to the ISO 13506:2008 test method are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity of Lane Position and Steering Angle Measurements to Driver
   Fatigue}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2585}},
Pages = {{67-76}},
Abstract = {{The parameter value chosen to measure driving performance affects the
   accuracy of the estimated fatigue level. Methods to analyze the
   sensitivity of these parameter values were proposed. Standard deviation
   of lane position (SDLP) and steering reversal rate (SRR) were considered
   to assess fatigue, and the sensitivity of these parameters was analyzed
   from the time domain and value domain. Thirty-six male drivers
   participated in a field test. Lane position, steering wheel angle data,
   and self reported fatigue level (scored on the Karolinska sleepiness
   scale) were recorded. SDLP results indicate that the maximum average
   coefficient with fatigue level reached.11, with a unified statistical
   interval of 202 s when the consecutive analysis method was used; the
   maximum average coefficient was .12 with a unified interval of 120 s
   when the maximum analysis method was used. SRR results indicate that a
   steering angle difference of 6 was the most sensitive threshold for
   driver fatigue level and has an average correlation coefficient of .42,
   which demonstrated that SRR was more reliable than SDLP for monitoring
   fatigue level. With the use of the optimal parameter value, the
   variation results of SDLP and SRR at each fatigue level were examined,
   and results indicate that driving ability was impaired as fatigue level
   increased. The methods and results can be applied to analyses of

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{180-184}},
Abstract = {{Lead (Pb) is one of the impurities that cause stress corrosion cracking
   (SCC) of the tubing material in the steam generator (SG), the corrosion
   behavior of surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) treated
   surface was measured for alloy 690 in simulated SG condition with and
   without Pb contamination. Even though the polarization curves indicated
   the corrosion potential of SMAT-processed specimens shifted negatively,
   the positive effect of SMAT on resistance of SCC was observed. The
   reduced susceptibility to lead-induced stress corrosion cracking may be
   attributed to the formation of stable passive film and the significant
   compressive stress on the surface induced by SMAT.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   IMPACT STATEMENT
   A significant compressive stress induced by the SMAT process effectively
   reduced the susceptibility of the alloys to lead-induced stress
   corrosion cracking.}},

Title = {{Training-Specific Neural Plasticity in Spinal Reflexes after Incomplete
   Spinal Cord Injury}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The neural plasticity of spinal reflexes after two contrasting forms of
   walking training was determined in individuals with chronic,
   motor-incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Endurance Training involved
   treadmill walking for as long as possible, and Precision Training
   involved walking precisely over obstacles and onto targets overground.
   Twenty participants started either Endurance or Precision Training for 2
   months and then crossed over after a 2-month rest period to the other
   form of training for 2 months. Measures were taken before and after each
   phase of training and rest. The cutaneomuscular reflex (CMR) during
   walking was evoked in the soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior muscles by
   stimulating the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle. Clonus was
   estimated from the EMG power in the SOL during unperturbed walking. The
   inhibitory component of the SOL CMR was enhanced after Endurance but not
   Precision Training. Clonus did not change after either form of training.
   Participants with lower reflex excitability tended to be better walkers
   (i.e., faster walking speeds) prior to training, and the reduction in
   clonus was significantly correlated with the improvement in walking
   speed and distance. Thus, reflex excitability responded in a
   training-specific way, with the reduction in reflex excitability related
   to improvements in walking function. Trial registration number is
   NCT01765153.}},

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a thermally enhanced heavy oil
   recovery method which is widely practiced for the bitumen extraction
   from the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. This study is the first
   application of forward osmosis (FO) for the treatment of SAGD produced
   water with the intent to reuse the treated water. The effects of
   temperature, flow rate, and pH of the feed water (produced water) and
   concentration and flow rate of the draw solution (salt solution) on the
   water flux as well as undesired diffusion of organic matter toward the
   draw solution were studied. Since no interaction between parameters is
   predicted, a fully saturated L-16 Taguchi design was used to investigate
   these five parameters each at four levels. It was found that increasing
   the feed water temperature and the draw solution concentration enhanced
   the water flux. The change in feed pH did not have any significant
   effect on water flux. Increasing the flow rate of both the BFW and the
   draw solution reduced the concentration polarization layer on both
   sides, thus increased the efficiency of the separation process. Analysis
   of variance showed that the feed water temperature and the draw solution
   concentration were the most influential parameters. This study provides
   valuable insights regarding the feasibility of the FO process for the
   treatment of oil sands produced water.}},

Title = {{The evolution of hierarchical porosity in self-templated nitrogen-doped
   carbons and its effect on oxygen reduction electrocatalysis}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{84}},
Pages = {{80398-80407}},
Abstract = {{Pyrolitic self-templating synthesis is an effective method for creating
   hierarchically porous N-doped carbons. We study the evolution of
   microstructure in self-templated carbons derived from magnesium
   nitrilotriacetate, in the 600-1000 degrees C temperature range. The
   materials are characterised using N-2 adsorption, Hg intrusion, X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
   elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy. The carbons display high specific surface areas (up
   to 1830 m(2) g(-1)), and high pore volumes (up to 3.1 mL g(-1)).
   Interestingly, each porosity type -micro, meso, and macro -evolves along
   its own route. Micropore growth is most significant between 600 and 700
   degrees C, yet it slows down and stops around 800 degrees C; this
   indicates that micropores form by removal of tarry matter from the
   interstices between graphitic sheets, rather than by physical/chemical
   etching of these sheets. Mesopores, templated by spontaneously forming
   MgO nanoparticles, become dominant at 800 degrees C; further
   agglomeration of these particles leads to macropore templating at 900
   degrees C. The porosity evolution is explained by the growth of MgO
   particles, as monitored by XRD broadening. Furthermore, the degree of
   disorder decreases with the pyrolysis temperature, most significantly
   between 700 and 800 degrees C, with the Raman I-D/I-G ratio dropping
   from 1.36 to 1.17. Correspondingly, the in-plane length of graphitic
   crystallites increases along the series, from 14 to 17 nm. Although the
   nitrogen content decreases with pyrolysis temperature, from 6.9 to 4.1
   at\%, the ratio between graphitic and pyridinic nitrogens remains
   constant. We then measure the performance of these carbons as
   electrocatalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at pH 13 using
   rotating disk electrode voltammetry and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. Remarkably, the ORR activity trend is independent of
   nitrogen concentration or degree of disorder. Instead, it is governed by
   the microstructural parameters, most importantly surface area and
   microporosity.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbines have attracted considerable attention as a renewable
   energy source due to the environmental concerns and fossil fuel
   depletion. When connected to existing power systems, wind turbines can
   cause a number of issues related to the system stability and power
   quality. Dynamic performance of an electric power grid with wind
   turbines under variable wind speeds is considered and investigated in
   this paper. A four-machine-two-area benchmark system has been adopted
   from the IEEE, and combined with the wind turbines. Wind power
   generation system with variable-speed provides an opportunity to extract
   more wind power compared to fixed speed systems. However, the use of
   variable-speed generators leads to variable output power, frequency and
   voltage, all due to the wind speed fluctuations. The performance of the
   output power can be improved if adequate control mechanism is
   implemented in the system. To maintain the output power, voltage and
   frequency of system at desired values, a fuzzy logic system is designed
   as a damping controller for the power output and frequency fluctuations
   of a variable-speed wind power generation system. Control is implemented
   by changing the blade pitch angle of the wind turbine. Dynamic modeling,
   control and simulation study of the two area-wind power generation
   system is performed using MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show
   that the controlled variables reach required operation values in a very
   short time, and improve the dynamic response and the transient stability
   of the power system.}},

   reclaimed and engineered soils, the success of various vegetation
   complexes, and the risk of toxicity and impacts to bio-indicators are
   being compared to the findings from the decade of continuous data
   collected during FORWARD 1 \& 2 that sets our expectations for watershed
   recovery. The previous results indicate that runoff coefficients were
   strongly correlated with disturbance intensity with recovery for many
   key indicators (e.g. nutrient loading) occurring over three to six
   years. In the case of harvesting, no detectable changes were observed
   below 50\% harvest intensity, and wetlands played a crucial role in
   mitigating hydrologic and water quality impacts obscuring the role of
   riparian buffers in this same function. The data collected by the
   FORWARD Project has been used to improve forest management practices and
   improve SWAT runoff modeling in the boreal forest, which can be used in
   forest management planning. Specific results from the first phase of
   FORWARD are outlined in this summary.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic NOx sensor model is developed to remove ammonia cross
   sensitivity from production NOx sensors mounted downstream of
   Diesel-engine selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. The model is
   validated for large amounts of ammonia slip during different engine
   transients. A three-state nonlinear control oriented SCR model is also
   developed to predict the NH3 concentration downstream of the SCR (NH3
   slip). NH3 slip is then used as an input for modeling the cross
   sensitivity of a production NOx sensor and calculating the actual NOx
   concentration in the presence of NH3 contamination. The cross
   sensitivity is considered to be a function of temperature, normalized
   ammonia slip rate (NASR) and time. The validation results show that the
   developed model has an acceptable accuracy for the actual NOx
   concentration downstream of the SCR. This model should be of utility for
   engine emission control strategies such as SCR control. (C) 2016,IFAC

Abstract = {{A control oriented model that includes combustion timing, engine load
   and combustion efficiency for Homogeneous Charge compression Ignition
   (HCCI) engines is developed. In HCCI engines, a lean homogeneous air
   fuel mixture auto-ignites due to compression and combustion occurs at
   lower temperatures compared to spark ignition and diesel engines. The
   low HCCI combustion temperature results in low NOx level, however
   unburnt HC and CO levels are high. Higher thermal efficiencies are
   realized for higher combustion efficiencies when combustion timings is
   appropriate. First, the effects of valve timing and fueling rate on
   combustion efficiency are investigated experimentally. Then, the
   influence of combustion efficiency on HC and CO emissions is studied. A
   physics based control oriented model of HCCI engine combustion
   efficiency and emissions for future control design is developed. This
   model includes the effect of trapped residual gas and fueling rate on
   combustion timing and output power. The developed model has acceptable
   accuracy for combustion timing, load and combustion efficiency
   prediction when compared to experimental data. This model is useful for
   combustion timing and load control in VICO engines while simultaneously
   considering the constraints of combustion efficiency mid emission. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen treatment based on intermittent-flow devices with pulse delivery
   modes available from portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) depends on the
   characteristics of the delivered pulse such as volume, pulse width (the
   time of the pulse to be delivered), and pulse delay (the time for the
   pulse to be initiated from the start of inhalation) as well as a
   patient's breathing characteristics, disease state, and respiratory
   morphology. This article presents a physiological-based analysis of the
   performance, in terms of blood oxygenation, of a commercial POC at
   different settings using an in silico model of a COPD patient at rest
   and during exercise. The analysis encompasses experimental measurements
   of pulse volume, width, and time delay of the POC at three different
   settings and two breathing rates related to rest and exercise. These
   experimental data of device performance are inputs to a
   physiological-based model of oxygen uptake that takes into account the
   real dynamic nature of gas exchange to illustrate how device-and
   patient-specific factors can affect patient oxygenation. This type of
   physiological analysis that considers the true effectiveness of oxygen
   transfer to the blood, as opposed to delivery to the nose (or mouth),
   can be instructive in applying therapies and designing new devices.}},

Abstract = {{Transient electronics are of great interest in medical implants and
   environmentally friendly devices. These electronic devices can be
   partially or fully dissolved in water in a controlled period of time.
   Herein, we show the fabrication and characterization of silver
   nanoparticle-based strain sensors on the water-soluble nanofibril paper,
   a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) produced flexible film, by stencil
   lithography. This is the first demonstration of using
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencils to pattern metal electrodes on
   water-soluble substrates. For the large London dispersion force (LDF)
   between the PDMS stencil and the flexible substrate, the stencil can
   conformably cover the substrate and prevent metal diffusion into the
   area under the stencil when metal electrodes are patterned on
   water-soluble nanofibril papers. PDMS stencil lithography avoids damage
   to the cellulose nanofibril paper, which conventional photolithography
   processes lead to, without compromising the resolution in patterning.
   Our strain sensors have a high sensitivity with a gauge-factor of over
   50 in strain testing, which is the highest among reported strain sensors
   fabricated on water-soluble substrates.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},

Pages = {{1910-1931}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a new multi-material level set topology optimization
   method which is developed especially for designing plastic parts.
   Instead of representing the structure using multiple level set
   functions, this new method employs only one level set function to
   describe the material/void interface. The injection moulding filling
   simulation is used to determine the material/material interfaces.
   Because plastic parts are targeted, domain-specific knowledge is
   carefully investigated to improve the optimization algorithm. Both
   homogeneous and heterogeneous fibre-reinforced plastics are considered
   as potential material phases. For the latter, one extra design freedom,
   fibre orientation distribution, is introduced. Instead of generating
   incremental interior voids, which complicates the mould design and part
   ejection, shape-fixed interior voids could be predefined inside the
   design domain for functional or assembly purposes. This is represented
   by an additional level set function. A few numerical examples are
   studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2590}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Abstract = {{The application of time frequency domain analysis methods, such as
   continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and short-time Fourier transform
   (STFT), is evaluated in the extraction of the dominant frequency from
   asphalt longitudinal strain signals. The pavement response data
   collected at the fully instrumented Integrated Road Research Facility in
   Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was used in this study. Promising results
   were achieved when CWT and STFT were used to determine the dominant
   frequency of the measured longitudinal strain at the bottom of the
   asphalt layer at different vehicular speeds. The dominant frequencies
   obtained from these methods were compared with those from conventional
   time-to-frequency conversion methods. Results showed that a frequency
   calculation that used the inverse of tensile pulse duration led to
   noticeably larger frequencies compared with those associated with the
   CWT and STFT methods. The accuracy of the determined frequencies and the
   corresponding moduli of hot-mix asphalt were evaluated by predicting
   strains with the KENPAVE program. This analysis showed the advantage of
   using time frequency domain methods because they led to more reasonable
   agreements between the measured and predicted responses. Finally, the
   impact of frequency calculation methods on the potential fatigue
   cracking life was assessed by taking the estimated moduli and strains of
   hot-mix asphalt into account. It was found that the fatigue cracking
   life can be overestimated by almost 45\% when frequency is considered as
   a reciprocal of pulse duration compared with when prediction is based on
   time-frequency domain methods.}},

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{243-257}},
Abstract = {{THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE QUESTION of whether it is possible to design a
   nanoinclusion (characterized here by the incorporation of interface
   effects along the material interface) to achieve a screw
   dislocation-induced uniform internal strain field when a composite is
   subjected to anti-plane shear deformation. We demonstrate the existence
   of such an inclusion by identifying its shape via a conformal mapping
   with unknown coefficients obtained through a system of nonlinear
   equations. Our numerical examples verify that the inclusion shape is
   dependent on its size and the specific uniform internal strain field. We
   show also that the inclusion shape is available even with increasing
   distance between the inclusion and dislocation. This latter fact leads
   to the additional conclusion that non-circular nano-inclusions which
   achieve uniform internal strain fields do indeed exist in a composite
   subjected to uniform remote anti-plane shear loading.}},

Abstract = {{A well-established compensation technique to remove oscillations caused
   by control valve stiction is the two-moves method. However, the actual
   versions of this technique present major drawbacks, as the long time for
   implementation and, mostly, some strong assumptions on the valve
   position in oscillation. A recent version of two-moves compensation has
   proven to reduce the time of execution. Nevertheless, this method does
   not allow the control loop to handle set point tracking and disturbance
   rejection. The present paper proposes a revised version of two-moves
   stiction compensation method, which overcomes previous limitations. This
   new approach is based on the estimation of controller output associated
   with the desired valve position at the steady-state, by using the
   amplitude of oscillation before compensation and through the estimate of
   valve stiction, obtainable with specific techniques. In this case, fast
   responses are possible as well as a complete removal of the oscillation.
   In addition, set point tracking and disturbance rejection are
   guaranteed, by monitoring the control error and by switching temporarily
   to a standard PI(D) controller. Simulation examples and applications to
   a pilot plant show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016,

Title = {{Effects of Seasonal Variation on the Load-Bearing Capacity of Pavements
   Composed of Insulation Layers}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2579}},
Pages = {{87-95}},
Abstract = {{Seasonal variation in the subgrade resilient modulus is likely caused by
   external factors, such as precipitation and freeze thaw cycles. One of
   the strategies for minimizing the impact of this variation on the
   subgrade modulus is to use insulation layers to prevent frost
   penetration. This study investigated the effects of the use of
   insulation layers on pavement performance in the fully instrumented
   Integrated Road Research Facility in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Three
   insulated sections of the test road were comprised of bottom ash (BA)
   (100 cm) and polystyrene boards of two thicknesses (5 and 10 cm), and
   the adjacent conventional section was considered the control section
   (CS). The resilient modulus and the effective modulus of pavement were
   backcalculated with the data obtained from falling weight deflectometer
   testing conducted at the test road during a 1-year monitoring period,
   from July 2014 to July 2015. Temperature and moisture probes, installed
   across the depth of the sections, were used to determine the frozen,
   thawed, or recovering condition of the pavement. The study results
   revealed that polystyrene boards protected subgrade soil from freezing
   and thawing effects. The minimum ratio of the backcalculated subgrade
   modulus of each test to the resilient modulus of the test performed in
   September was 0.94 in the BA section, and the ratio of the CS could
   decrease to 0.88 in the recovering period. Comparison of the
   load-bearing capacity of insulated sections and the CS indicated that,
   unlike BA, polystyrene boards significantly decreased the load-bearing
   capacity of the pavement.}},

   macroscopic level leading to photodriven mass-migration. For this
   reason, a set of polymer brushes, containing azobenzene (Disperse Red 1,
   DR) on the side chains of poly(methacrylic acid), was synthesised and
   the influence of DR on the polymer brush dynamics was investigated for
   the first time by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). Briefly,
   two dynamics were observed, a short one coming from the isomerisation of
   DR and a long one related to the brush main chain. Interestingly,
   photoinduced polymer aggregation in the confocal volume was observed.}},

Abstract = {{Using a PIT detection system and two in-stream, swim-through antennas,
   we examined the movements of Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus through
   a low-gradient (< 1\%), nature-like fishpass that connected two small
   lakes in the Barrenlands region of northern Canada. We used an ensemble
   of generalized linear mixed models to evaluate whether passage events
   (1) were related to fish FL, water depth in the fishpass, and/or
   temperature in the fishpass; and (2) exhibited any diel patterns. During
   two seasons, passage events were not related to fish FL or fishpass
   water temperature; however, the probability of a passage event occurring
   increased with increases in fishpass depth, which likely served as a
   proxy for velocity and/or discharge. Most notably, 95\% (n = 193/204) of
   Arctic Grayling passages occurred at night (1800-0559 hours) throughout
   our study. Although the cause(s) of this diel pattern were not examined
   directly, we hypothesized that it represented a response to avian
   predation given the shallow depth of the fishpass and given our
   observations of daytime avian predation events on Arctic Grayling in the
   littoral zones of the study lakes. Our results offer novel insights into
   correlates of Arctic Grayling passage through a fishpass and lay the
   foundation for future studies to address the hypotheses supported herein
   with well-designed experiments to determine the mechanisms behind the
   patterns we observed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper makes a comparative study about the structural performances
   of the consolidated AM (additive manufacturing) parts and the
   multi-piece assemblies. Generally, it is recognised that AM part
   consolidation can improve the structural performance compared to the
   traditional multi-piece assembly. However, this may not be true given
   that the AM materials are directionally weakened, especially in the
   build direction (BD). Hence, the comparative study performed in this
   work will provide some conclusions and at the same time, these
   conclusions could be valuable guidelines for designing AM part
   consolidation. For implementation details, the level set topology
   optimisation method will be applied to optimising the multi-piece
   assembly with rigid joints and the AM part with weakened material
   properties; and the same design domain will be shared in order to make a
   fair comparison. A set of different joint positions and material
   weakening levels will be studied in order to get comprehensive
   conclusions.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Recent analyses indicated that autophagy can be regulated via some
   nuclear transcriptional networks and many important players in the
   autophagy and other forms of programmed cell death are known to be
   intrinsically disordered. To this end, we analyzed similarities and
   differences in the intrinsic disorder distribution of nuclear and
   non-nuclear proteins related to autophagy. We also looked at the
   peculiarities of the distribution of the intrinsically disordered
   autophagy-related proteins in various intra-nuclear organelles, such as
   the nucleolus, chromatin, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, promyelocytic
   leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, nuclear lamina, nuclear pores, and
   perinucleolar compartment. This analysis revealed that the
   autophagy-related proteins constitute about 2.5\% of the non-nuclear
   proteins and 3.3\% of the nuclear proteins, which corresponds to a
   substantial enrichment by about 32\% in the nucleus. Curiously,
   although, in general, the autophagy-related proteins share similar
   characteristics of disorder with a generic set of all non-nuclear
   proteins, chromatin and nuclear speckles are enriched in the
   intrinsically disordered autophagy proteins (29 and 37\% of these
   proteins are disordered, respectively) and have high disorder content at
   0.24 and 0.27, respectively. Therefore, our data suggest that some of
   the nuclear disordered proteins may play important roles in autophagy.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless devices with no direct access to ports are tested by antenna
   couplers, which are designed to have wideband performance and an
   omni-directional radiation field profile for uniform near-field coupling
   with positional variation. The spiral antenna coupler presented here is
   designed to be used in a RF-shielded enclosure, requiring a metal
   backing (lambda/83 away at 0.4 GHz in this study) to preserve consistent
   performance, but can also be used separately. The design is a stripline
   fed spiral antenna with mixed Archimedean and Equiangular antenna
   equations describing the spiral expansion of the arms. Absorbing
   material placed around the antenna removes resonances/reflections on the
   metal backing and reflections from the antenna's open end. The infinite
   balun stripline feed is shown to provide high return loss over the
   required frequency range of 0.4-6 GHz. The antenna near- and far-field
   performance, as well as coupling between identical antennas are measured
   with and without metal backing to demonstrate the performance as an
   antenna coupler. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{AIMS ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{379-396}},
Abstract = {{Due to an ever-increasing market penetration of plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEVs), the charging demand is expected to become a main
   determinant of the load in future distribution systems. In this paper,
   we investigate the problem of controlling in-home charging of PHEVs to
   accomplish peak load shifting while maximizing the revenue of the
   distribution service provider (DSP) and PHEV owners. A leader-follower
   game model is proposed to characterize the preference and revenue
   expectation of PHEV owners and DSP, respectively. The follower (PHEV
   owner) decides when to start charging based on the pricing schedule
   provided by the leader (DSP). The DSP can incentivize the charging of
   PHEV owners to avoid system peak load. The costs associated with power
   distribution, line loss, and voltage regulation are incorporated in the
   game model via power flow analysis. Based on a linear approximation of
   the power flow equations, the solution of sub-game perfect Nash
   equilibrium (SPNE) is obtained. A case study is performed based on the
   IEEE 13-bus test feeder and realistic PHEV charging statistics, and the
   results demonstrate that our proposed PHEV charging control scheme can
   significantly improve the power quality in distribution systems by
   reducing the peak load and voltage fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike most of civil engineering structures whose static and dynamic
   responses are estimated accurately through several codes and guidance,
   stadiums reserve a distinctive place especially when it comes to their
   dynamic behavior. This difference takes its source from several factors
   such as influence of crowd size, motion and slenderness of the
   structure. The most noticeable form of this difference shows itself as
   excessive vibration levels which is actually a threat to the
   serviceability of these structures. Eventually, it becomes essential to
   carefully evaluate several steps of this particular problem starting
   from correct representation of crowd activity through accurate loadings
   and human-structure interaction models to arranging acceptable vibration
   serviceability limits. This publication intends to point out the newly
   developed techniques and discovered issues on several stages of the
   problem during the last decade.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The online detection of wheelset size has important implications for
   ensuring the safety of railway operation and decreasing the maintenance
   costs. Based on laser displacement sensors (LDS), a novel online
   detection system of the wheel size is proposed using only six
   two-dimensional LDS and two one-dimensional LDS. The calculation
   principles of tread profile and wheel diameter are given, as well as the
   calibration method. Errors induced by wheel-rail vibration,
   misalignment, sensor noise, S-shape running, and wheelset differential
   are also analyzed. After system implementation, field experiments were
   performed using both standard wheel and several real trains. It turns

Abstract = {{Decision-making in mining is a challenging task. Optimal decisions
   regarding shovel and truck allocations, in consideration to the
   short-term production schedule, are very important to keep the
   operations inline with the planned objectives of the company in long
   term. This paper presents a mixed integer linear goal programming
   (MILGP) model to optimise the operations based on four desired goals of
   the company: (a) maximise production, (b) minimise deviations in head
   grade, (c) minimise deviations in tonnage feed to the processing plants
   from the desired feed, and (d) minimise operating cost. The model
   provides shovel assignments and the target productions; as an input to
   the dispatching system while meeting the desired goals and constraints
   of the mining operation. The model implementation with an iron ore mine
   case study provided average plant utilisation above 99\%, average truck
   utilisation above 92\% and average shovel utilisation above 95\%.}},

Title = {{Thickness Dependent Interlayer Magnetoresistance in Multilayer Graphene
   Stacks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Chemical Vapor Deposition grown multilayer graphene (MLG) exhibits large
   out-of-plane magnetoresistance due to interlayer magnetoresistance
   (ILMR) effect. It is essential to identify the factors that influence
   this effect in order to explore its potential in magnetic sensing and
   data storage applications. It has been demonstrated before that the ILMR
   effect is sensitive to the interlayer coupling and the orientation of
   the magnetic field with respect to the out-of-plane (C-axis) direction.
   In this work, we investigate the role of MLG thickness on ILMR effect.
   Our results show that the magnitude of ILMR effect increases with the
   number of graphene layers in the MLG stack. Surprisingly, thicker
   devices exhibit field induced resistance switching by a factor of at
   least similar to 10(7). This effect persists even at room temperature
   and to our knowledge such large magnetoresistance values have not been
   reported before in the literature at comparable fields and temperatures.
   In addition, an oscillatory MR effect is observed at higher field
   values. A physical explanation of this effect is presented, which is
   consistent with our experimental scenario.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{230-246}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of various road elements on collision
   frequencies for urban residential collector roads. Negative binomial
   safety performance functions were developed for total collision
   occurrence and severity using 4 years of data from the City of Edmonton.
   The proposed models were estimated using the maximum likelihood
   estimation technique. Scaled deviance and the Pearson chi-squared
   statistic were used to assess the models' goodness of fit. Results
   revealed that the property-damage-only (PDO) collision model has the
   same significant covariates as the total collisions model. For predicted
   total and PDO collisions, there is a statistically significant positive
   relationship between collisions and access-point density,
   stop-controlled intersection density, the presence of a horizontal
   curve, licensed premises, seniors' centers, and on-street parking. For
   severe (i.e., fatal and injury) collisions, the results were quite
   similar to the total and PDO collisions with some exceptions (e.g.,
   number of lanes, bus-stop density). On the contrary, there is a
   significant negative relationship between predicted severe collisions
   and the presence of a median, center line, and manned enforcement. The
   city authority could use this information to assess the associated
   safety risk of residential collector roads and, hence, prioritize
   collision prone road segments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present the design of integrable magnetoplasmonic
   isolators and modulators, based on a long-range magnetoplasmonic
   waveguide structure. With the addition of magnetized cerium-substituted
   yttrium iron garnet waveguides and planar samarium-cobalt biasing
   magnets to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), we show that an
   efficient isolator architecture can be implemented with insertion loss
   of 2.51 dB and an isolation of 22.82 dB within a small footprint of 6.4
   x 10(-3) mm(2). Additionally, employing bismuth-substituted yttrium iron
   garnet in a MZI and transient magnetic fields from nearby transmission
   lines, we propose a high-speed electrical-to-optical clock multiplier.
   Such a device exhibits a modulation depth of 16.26 dB, and an output
   modulation frequency of 279.9 MHz. Thus, input clock signals can be
   multiplied by factors of 2.1 x 10(3). These devices are envisioned as
   fundamental constituents of future integrated nanoplasmonic circuits.}},

Title = {{Methodology for quantifying the volatile mixing state of an aerosol}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{759-772}},
Abstract = {{Mixing state refers to the relative proportions of chemical species in
   an aerosol, and the way these species are combined; either as a
   population where each particle consists of a single species ('externally
   mixed') or where all particles individually consist of two or more
   species ('internally mixed') or the casewhere some particles are pure
   and some particles consist of multiple species. The mixing state affects
   optical and hygroscopic properties, and quantifying it is therefore
   important for studying an aerosol's climate impact. In this article, we
   describe a method to quantify the volatile mixing state of an aerosol
   using a differential mobility analyzer, centrifugal particle mass
   analyzer, catalytic denuder, and condensation particle counter by
   measuring the mass distributions of the volatile and non-volatile
   components of an aerosol and determining how the material is mixed
   within and between particles as a function of mobility diameter.
   Themethod is demonstrated using two aerosol samples from aminiCAST soot
   generator, one with a high elemental carbon (EC) content, and one with a
   high organic carbon (OC) content. The measurements are presented in
   terms of the mass distribution of the volatile and non-volatile
   material, as well as measures of diversity and mixing state parameter.
   It was found that the high-EC soot nearly consisted of only pure
   particles where 86\% of the total mass was non-volatile. The high-OC
   soot consisted of either pure volatile particles or particles that
   contained a mixture of volatile and non-volatile material where 8\% of
   the total mass was pure volatile particles and 70\% was non-volatile
   material (with the remaining 22\% being volatile material condensed on
   non-volatile particles).}},

Abstract = {{Coalbed methane (CBM) is an unconventional source of natural gas
   produced from coal seams. In recent years, it has gained a lot of
   attention and is being developed as a significant energy source in
   various parts of the world. However, high capital cost requirements and
   uncertainties arising from heterogeneity of coal beds are major
   hindrances in CBM production. In this chapter, we explore the origin,

Abstract = {{Quantifying the contribution of passive mechanical deformation in the
   human pharynx to upper airway collapse is fundamental to understanding
   the competing biomechanical processes that maintain airway patency. This
   study uses finite element analysis to examine deformation in the passive
   human pharynx using an intricate 3D anatomical model based on computed
   tomography scan images. Linear elastic properties are assigned to bone,
   cartilage, ligament, tendon, and membrane structures based on a survey
   of values reported in the literature. Velopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
   cross-sectional area versus airway pressure slopes are determined as
   functions of Young's moduli of muscle and adipose tissue. In vivo
   pharyngeal mechanics for small deformations near atmospheric pressure
   are matched by altering Young's moduli of muscle and adipose tissue. The
   results indicate that Young's moduli ranging from 0.33 to 14 kPa for
   muscle and adipose tissue matched the in vivo range of area versus
   pressure slopes. The developed anatomical model and determined Young's
   moduli range are expected to be useful as a starting point for more
   complex simulations of human upper airway collapse and obstructive sleep
   apnea therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional reduced graphene oxide (RGO) coated cloths were prepared
   through the thermal treatment of GO coated cloths without using any
   harmful reducing agent. The effect of heating temperature on the wetting
   properties of the cloths was also monitored through contact angle
   measurement. The highest contact angle 141 degrees was observed for the
   RGO coated dense cloth while the highest contact angle exhibited by the
   RGO coated sparse cloth was 130 degrees. The as prepared RGO coated
   cloths were utilized as a filter and an absorbent for oil/water
   separation. The RGO coated sparse cloth was utilized as a filter for the
   separation of an oil/water mixture while the dense cloth was utilized as
   an absorbent for the selective absorption of oil from water. RGO coated
   cloths were also explored as an antibacterial agent and the effect of
   the microstructure of coated cloths on their antibacterial properties
   was also investigated. The cloth with the dense structure exhibited
   higher antibacterial activity compared to the sparse cloth. A
   significant loss of percentage viability up to 98\% was achieved using
   the RGO coated cloth, proving it highly efficient as an antibacterial
   agent, which makes it a suitable bandage material for the dressing of
   open wounds. Apart from being antibacterial, the RGO coated cloths are
   also hydrophobic in nature so they can protect wound from water and
   atmospheric moisture which is not possible with ordinary bandages.}},

Abstract = {{The escalating global warming effects are a reason for immediate
   measures to reduce the level of greenhouse gases. In this context, dry
   reforming of methane (DRM), an old yet both scientifically and
   industrially important process, is making a comeback in contributing to
   the utilization of CO2. However, catalyst deactivation (sulfur poisoning
   and coke formation) and the associated high energy consumption remain
   technological hurdles to its practical implementation. Here we
   demonstrated that dry reforming of H2S-containing CH4 can be efficiently
   conducted in conventional solid oxide fuel cells via incorporating a
   coke/sulfur resistant catalyst layer. The add-on layer, composed of
   tailored Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 supported NiCu nanoclusters, demonstrated
   outstanding in situ reforming activity while possessing reasonable
   coke/sulfur resistance. At 800 degrees C and in a 50 ppm H2S containing
   CH4-CO2 mixture, the cell had a maximum power density of 1.05 W cm(-2),
   a value high enough for practical application. Through H-2 selective
   oxidation, the energy required for DRM was partially compensated for and
   the produced water greatly suppressed the carbon deposition. This study
   offers a new dimension in cogenerating CO2-derived synthesis gas and
   electrical power in the context of increasing interests in efficient
   utilization of H2S-containing CH4 and CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Standard classification process allocates all processed elements to
   given classes. Such type of classification assumes that there are only
   native and no foreign elements, i.e., all processed elements are
   included in given classes. The quality of standard classification can be
   measured by two factors: numbers of correctly and incorrectly classified
   elements, called True Positives and False Positives. Admitting foreign
   elements in standard classification process increases False Positives
   and, in this way, deteriorates quality of classification. In this
   context, it is desired to reject foreign elements, i.e., not to assign
   them to any of given classes. Rejecting foreign elements will reduce the
   number of false positives, but can also reject native elements reducing
   True Positives as side effect. Therefore, it is important to build
   well-designed rejection, which will reject significant part of
   foreigners and only few natives. In this paper, evaluations of
   classification with rejection concepts are presented. Three main models:
   a classification without rejection, a classification with rejection, and
   a classification with reclassification are presented. The concepts are
   illustrated by flexible ensembles of binary classifiers with evaluations
   of each model. The proposed models can be used, in particular, as
   classifiers working with noised data, where recognized input is not
   limited to elements of known classes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, single sample face recognition (SSFR) problem is
   addressed by introducing an adaptive biometric system within a modular
   architecture where one detector per target individual is proposed. For
   each detector, a face model is generated with the gallery face image and
   updated overtime. Sequential Karhunen-Loeve technique is applied to
   update the face model using representative face captures which are
   selected from the operational data by using reliable tracking
   trajectories. This process helps to induce intra-class variation of face
   appearance and improve representativeness of the face models. The
   effectiveness of the proposed method is detailed in security
   surveillance and user authentication using Chokepoint and FIA datasets
   in SSFR setting.}},

Abstract = {{Current efforts in design and characterization of drugs often rely on
   the structure of their protein targets. However, a large fraction of
   proteins lack unique 3-D structures and exist as highly dynamic
   structural ensembles. These intrinsically disordered proteins are
   involved in pathogenesis of various human diseases and are highly
   abundant in eukaryotes. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the current
   druggable human proteome covering 12 drug classes and 18 major classes
   of drug targets we show a significant bias toward high structural
   coverage and low abundance of intrinsic disorder. We review reasons for
   this bias including widespread use of the structural information in
   various stages of drug development and characterization process and
   difficulty with attaining structures for the intrinsically disordered
   proteins. We also discuss future of intrinsically disordered proteins as
   drug targets. Given the overall high disorder content of the human
   proteome and current bias of the druggable human proteome toward
   structural proteins, it is inevitable that disordered proteins will have
   to raise up on the list of prospective drug targets. The protein
   disorder-assisted drug design can draw from current rational drug design
   techniques and would also need novel approaches that no longer rely on a
   unique protein structure.}},

Abstract = {{This review article discusses the climate, water resources and
   historical droughts of Africa, drought indices, vulnerability, impact of
   global warming and land use for drought-prone regions in West, southern
   and the Greater Horn of Africa, which have suffered recurrent severe
   droughts in the past. Recent studies detected warming and drying trends
   in Africa since the mid 20th century. Based on the Fourth Assessment
   Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), both northern and
   southern Africa are projected to experience drying, such as decreasing
   precipitation, runoff and soil moisture in the 21st century and could
   become more vulnerable to the impact of droughts. The daily maximum
   temperature is projected to increase by up to 8 degrees C (RCP8.5 of
   CMIP5), precipitation indices such as total wet day precipitation
   (PRCPTOT) and heavy precipitation days (R10 mm) could decrease, while
   warm spell duration (WSDI) and consecutive dry days (CDD) could
   increase. Uncertainties of the above long-term projections,
   teleconnections to climate anomalies such as ENSO and the Madden-Julian
   Oscillation, which could also affect the water resources of Africa, and
   capacity building in terms of physical infrastructure and nonstructural
   solutions are also discussed. Given that traditional climate and
   hydrological data observed in Africa are generally limited, satellite
   data should also be exploited to fill the data gap for Africa in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Previously we described the potential for multiple illumination
   photoacoustic tomography to provide quantitative reconstructions,
   however this work used only simulated data. We have developed a custom
   photoacoustic-ultrasound tomography system capable of multiple
   illuminations and parallel acquisition from a 256 element 5 MHz
   transducer ring array with 8-cm diameter. The multiple illumination
   scheme uses a free-space light delivery geometry where a rotational
   stage scans a pulsed laser beam onto different incident locations around
   the sample. For each illumination location a photoacoustic image is
   reconstructed using a modified backprojection algorithm. Images from
   different source locations have the potential to be combined to form an
   improved deep-tissue image using our previously developed iterative
   algorithms. We complement the photoacoustic imaging data with unique
   ultrasound imaging data. Most previous ultrasound tomography methods
   have used migration algorithms, iterative ray-based analysis,
   wave-equation modeling, or frequency-based algorithms that all demand
   large amounts of data and computational power. We propose a new UST
   method that offers isotropic resolution, provides scattering contrast,
   as well as the potential for measuring ultrasound scattering anisotropy
   and decoupling density and compressibility contributions. The imaging
   system is driven by a Verasonics scan engine and programmed for both
   ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging modes. Resolution has been measured
   to be 150 lam for ultrasound and 200 lam for photoacoustic images.
   Imaging capabilities are demonstrated on phantoms with custom-tailored
   ultrasound scattering and optical properties, as well as in murine
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Exogenous insulin administration is the mainstay treatment therapy for
   patients with Type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, for select
   patients, clinical islet transplantation is an alternative therapeutic
   treatment. In this procedure, islets are transplanted into the hepatic
   portal vein, and despite improved success within the last decade,
   obstacles are still associated with this approach. It has been
   discovered that the subcutaneous space may be an effective alternative
   site for islet transplantation, and may provide advantages of easy
   access and potential for simple monitoring. The ability to monitor islet
   viability and the transplant microenvironment may be key to future
   success in islet transplantation. A subcutaneous device-less technique
   has been developed to facilitate angiogenesis in the islet transplant
   site, however, a method for monitoring the potential engraftment site
   have yet to be explored fully. Here we demonstrate the ability to track
   angiogenesis in mice with 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-catheter implant on
   both sides of the abdomen using a FujiFilm VisualSonics Vevo-LAZR system
   Quantitative analysis on vessel densities exhibited gradual vessel
   growth successfully induced by catheter implantation. Our study
   demonstrates the ability of employing photoacoustic and micro-ultrasound
   imaging to track angiogenesis around the catheter site prior to islet
   transplantation.}},

Title = {{Online Method to Impute Missing Loop Detector Data for Urban Freeway
   Traffic Control}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2593}},
Pages = {{37-46}},
Abstract = {{The dual loop detector provides input data for real-time traffic
   control. However, the common scenario of missing or invalid loop data
   samples negatively impacts the performance of the subsequent traffic
   control or traffic prediction model. This paper describes a method that
   detects blank data samples when a new data record is listed, then
   imputes missing data samples to form a complete data record in real
   time. One three-lane loop detector station on Whitemud Drive in
   Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, is used as a case study to verify the
   algorithms. The imputation scope for this study involves diagnosing and
   filling in the missing data of one lane for at least one whole day at a
   specific loop station. The diagnosis of missing data for both volume and
   speed measurements is based on data records from upstream and downstream
   stations, rather than from single samples. The imputation algorithm for
   volume and density data models the relationship of one loop detector
   with all other loop detectors at the same station as linear. The
   multiple linear regression algorithm is applied to full historic data
   offline to learn the linear relationship between loops at the same
   station, and the online data imputation is based on the equations
   learned. Two other commonly used imputation techniques pairwise linear
   regression and the average of the surrounding detectors are also
   conducted for comparison. The proposed diagnosis and imputation method
   enables the loop data input to support control models with high
   frequency and large data requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, grammar-based fuzzers have been proposed to automate the
   generation of testing data. Grammar-based fuzzers differ from
   traditional fuzzers because the fuzzer is provided a grammatical
   definition of the test objective for the system under test. A novel
   fuzzer, Policy Generator (PG), is introduced. PG utilizes a number of
   heuristic techniques to improve space coverage over existing fuzzers. A
   simple grammatical test-bed, firewall policy generation, is used to
   compare the performance of these two systems. The set of test cases
   produced for this scenario are examined and each algorithm is evaluated
   against a number of novel grammar-based coverage metrics. The empirical
   study demonstrates that PG generates superior coverage compared to
   current generation techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless charging is a technology of transmitting power through an air
   gap to electrical devices for the purpose of energy replenishment. The
   recent progress in wireless charging techniques and development of
   commercial products have provided a promising alternative way to address
   the energy bottleneck of conventionally portable battery-powered
   devices. However, the incorporation of wireless charging into the
   existing wireless communication systems also brings along a series of
   challenging issues with regard to implementation, scheduling, and power
   management. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
   wireless charging techniques, the developments in technical standards,
   and their recent advances in network applications. In particular, with
   regard to network applications, we review the static charger scheduling
   strategies, mobile charger dispatch strategies and wireless charger
   deployment strategies. Additionally, we discuss open issues and
   challenges in implementing wireless charging technologies. Finally, we
   envision some practical future network applications of wireless

Title = {{Distributed Channel-Aware Quantization Based on Maximum Mutual
   Information}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In distributed sensing systems with constrained communication
   capabilities, sensors' noisy measurements must be quantized locally
   before transmitting to the fusion centre. When the same parameter is
   observed by a number of sensors, the local quantization rules must be
   jointly designed to optimize a global objective function. In this work
   we jointly design the local quantizers by maximizing the mutual
   information as the optimization criterion, so that the quantized
   measurements carry the most information about the unknown parameter. A
   low-complexity iterative approach is suggested for finding the local
   quantization rules. Using the mutual information as the design
   criterion, we can easily integrate the effect of communication channels
   in the design and consequently design channel-aware quantization rules.
   We observe that the optimal design depends on both the measurement and
   channel noises. Moreover, our algorithm can be used to design quantizers
   that can be deployed in different applications. We demonstrate the
   success of our technique through simulating estimation and detection
   applications, where our method achieves estimation and detection errors
   as low as when designing for those special purposes.}},

Abstract = {{PEFC electrodes manufactured using inkjet printing are investigated.
   Cell performance, Tafel slope, reaction order and local oxygen transport
   resistance of electrodes with varying Pt loadings of 0.014 to 0.113
   mg/cm(2) are studied in order to understand the nonlinear relationship
   between loading and performance. The performance increase with Pt
   loading was substantially reduced above Pt loadings of 0.08 mg/cm(2).
   Electrochemical active area of the electrodes decreased from 66.4 to
   40.4 m(2)/g as the Pt loading increased from 0.026 to 0.113 mg/cm(2).
   Below the transition voltage of 0.8 V-iRfree, the Tafel slope was found
   to be a function of the Pt loading and oxygen partial pressure. The
   kinetic performance dependence on p(O2) was quantified by measuring the
   total reaction order. Oxygen transport resistance evaluated from
   limiting current experiments revealed its dependence on the inlet
   relative humidity of the reactants. The local oxygen transport
   resistance was found to drop from 5.93 +/- 3.16 s/cm to 3.43 +/- 1.67
   s/cm as the humidity increased from 50\% to 90\%. (C) The Author(s)

Abstract = {{The prediction of the fate of a requirement has a visible impact on the
   use of the resources associated with it. Starting the implementation of
   a requirement that does not get inserted in the final product implies
   that we waste the resources associated with it. Moreover, we also create
   code and other artifacts that may be difficult to identify and delete
   once the decision of not to proceed with such requirement has been made,
   if it will ever been made explicitly instead of simply letting the
   requirement to fall in the oblivion. Furthermore, an additional
   requirement creates an increased complexity in managing the system
   underdevelopment. Therefore, it would be of immense benefit to predict
   the fate of such requirement as early as possible. Still, such
   prediction does not seem to be feasible and has not been subject yet to
   a significant investigation. In this work, we propose an approach to
   build such a prediction in a domain in which it is of particular
   benefit-the embedded systems domain, where typically the cost of errors
   is higher due to its direct impact on hardware. To determine whether a
   requirement will fail, we consider simply the history of the operations
   it underwent, treating the requirement as a black box. We use logistic
   regression to discriminate among the failures. We verify the model on
   more than 80,000 logs for a development process of over 10 years used in
   an Italian company operating in an embedded domain. The results are
   interesting and worth follow-up analysis and extensions to new datasets.}},

Abstract = {{A droplet chain technique was used to study the influence of the
   crystallization process on the morphology of spray dried microparticles.
   A piezoceramic dispenser produced a chain of monodisperse solution
   droplets with an initial diameter in the range of 60-80 mm. Aqueous
   solutions of sodium nitrate were prepared in concentrations ranging from
   5 mg/ml to 5.10(-5) mg/ml. The solution droplets were injected into a
   laminar flow with gas temperatures varying from 25 to 150 degrees C,
   affecting the droplet temperature and the evaporation rate, accordingly.
   Dried particles with diameters between 0.3 and 18 mu m were collected.
   The properties of the collected microparticles were studied and
   correlated with a particle formation model which predicted the onset of
   saturation and crystallization. The model accounted for the dependence
   of the diffusion coefficient of sodium nitrate in water on droplet
   viscosity. The viscosity trend for sodium nitrate solutions was
   determined by studying the relaxation time observed during coalescence
   of two aqueous sodium nitrate droplets levitated in optical tweezers.
   The combination of theoretical derivations and experimental results
   showed that longer time available for crystallization correlates with
   larger crystal size and higher degrees of crystallinity in the final
   microparticles.}},

Abstract = {{A test setup that enables investigating the synergistic effects of tape
   coating disbondment, cathodic protection (CP) and low-frequency cyclic
   loading is used to determine the effect of oxygen on near-neutral pH
   stress corrosion crack initiation. After low-frequency corrosion fatigue
   tests, results show that surface micro-cracks initiate under the
   simulated tape coating disbondments at regions with insufficient CP
   potentials, not more remote locations completely free from CP as
   commonly believed. The presence of 1\% oxygen in the composition of the
   purging gas has binary effects on the crack initiation under the
   simulated tape coating disbondment. On one hand it increases the size of
   the surface micro-cracks initiated on the steel surface at locations
   with some but insufficient CP potentials; and on the other, it reduces
   the number of surface micro-cracks at regions with no CP because of an
   extension of the general corrosion region deep inside the simulated
   coating disbondment.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advancement of microfluidic technology in the recent years has
   opened a new era for biological diagnostics. The demands for fast
   response, multi-functionality, non-invasiveness, and programmability
   boost the developments in many fields, such as tissue engineering, cell
   analysis, and molecular biology. For this trend, an appropriate
   manipulation tool is pivotal to the success of all applications. In this
   chapter, we explore two newly developed optoelectrokinetic techniques,
   termed rapid electrokinetic patterning (REP) and optoelectronic tweezers
   (OETs), from the fundamental principles to their applications in
   cell-related research. Details about fabrications, setups, and
   assessments are also thoroughly discussed. Both techniques are enabled
   by a deliberate integration of light and electric fields, therefore
   imparting them the unique abilities to dynamically manipulate biological
   targets. Unlike some well-adopted techniques, such as dielectrophoresis
   (DEP), REP and OETs feature high flexibility in manipulation. Their
   repertoire of manipulation includes, but not limited to, micro/nano
   concentration, sorting, translation, single particle trapping, and
   patterning. By combining with optoelectrowetting (OEW), a cross-scale
   platform suitable for multiple purposes can be even achieved. The
   multi-functionality endows the optoelectrokinetic manipulation the
   potential to further extend the cell analysis in all aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical earth load on pipes is an important factor during pipe
   jacking/microtunneling as it largely affects the jacking force. Although
   several methods can determine the normal load, the difference among them
   in calculating vertical normal stress is quite large. Hence, this paper
   provides an extensive analysis of nine different models/standards and
   their variations based on experimental data as well as a parametric
   study. The results show that some models predicted normal stress values
   close to the measured value, while others give much higher or lower
   values than the measurement. This discrepancy is due to the variation of
   assumptions of different methods. To identify the influence of
   parameters on normal stress, a parametric study is also conducted to
   reveal the effect of different parameters on arching factor as well as

Title = {{Compartmentalization and Functionality of Nuclear Disorder: Intrinsic
   Disorder and Protein-Protein Interactions in Intra-Nuclear Compartments}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The cell nucleus contains a number of membrane-less organelles or
   intra-nuclear compartments. These compartments are dynamic structures
   representing liquid-droplet phases which are only slightly denser than
   the bulk intra-nuclear fluid. They possess different functions, have
   diverse morphologies, and are typically composed of RNA (or, in some
   cases, DNA) and proteins. We analyzed 3005 mouse proteins localized in
   specific intra-nuclear organelles, such as nucleolus, chromatin, Cajal
   bodies, nuclear speckles, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies,
   nuclear lamina, nuclear pores, and perinuclear compartment and compared
   them with similar to 29,863 non-nuclear proteins from mouse proteome.
   Our analysis revealed that intrinsic disorder is enriched in the
   majority of intra-nuclear compartments, except for the nuclear pore and
   lamina. These compartments are depleted in proteins that lack disordered
   domains and enriched in proteins that have multiple disordered domains.
   Moonlighting proteins found in multiple intra-nuclear compartments are
   more likely to have multiple disordered domains. Protein-protein
   interaction networks in the intra-nuclear compartments are denser and
   include more hubs compared to the non-nuclear proteins. Hubs in the
   intra-nuclear compartments (except for the nuclear pore) are enriched in
   disorder compared with non-nuclear hubs and non-nuclear proteins.
   Therefore, our work provides support to the idea of the functional
   importance of intrinsic disorder in the cell nucleus and shows that many
   proteins associated with sub-nuclear organelles in nuclei of mouse cells
   are enriched in disorder. This high level of disorder in the mouse
   nuclear proteins defines their ability to serve as very promiscuous
   binders, possessing both large quantities of potential disorder-based
   interaction sites and the ability of a single such site to be involved
   in a large number of interactions.}},

Title = {{Turbulent flow over wetted and non-wetted superhydrophobic counterparts

Abstract = {{The turbulent structure of a channel flow over a non-wetted
   superhydrophobic (SHO) surface is experimentally investigated at Re =
   9600 (based on channel width) at the region of y(+) > 10 within the
   buffer and logarithmic layers. The SHO surface has a random pattern
   produced by spray coating and is compared with a wetted counterpart and
   also a smooth surface. Two planar particle image velocimetry
   measurements are carried out in the streamwise/spanwise and
   streamwise/wall-normal planes. The vector fields are obtained from both
   ensemble averaging and individual cross-correlations of double-frame
   images. The results showed a small increase (similar to 5\%) of the mean
   velocity profile at y(+) = 10 over the non-wetted surface in comparison
   with the wetted and the smooth surfaces. Up to 15\% reduction of normal
   and shear Reynolds stresses is observed in the inner layer over the
   non-wetted SHO surface. The wetted SHO counterpart demonstrates no
   effect on the mean velocity and Reynolds stresses in comparison with the
   smooth surface. The result confirms the comment of Gad-el-Hak
   {[}{''}Experimental study of skin friction drag reduction on
   superhydrophobic flat plates in high Reynolds number boundary layer
   flow,{''} Phys. Fluids 25, 025103 (2013)] that the wetted SHO is
   hydrodynamically smooth if the surface pores are smaller than the
   viscous sublayer thickness. A noticeable suppression of the sweep and
   ejection events, increase of the spanwise spacing of the low and high
   speed streaks, and attenuation of vortical structures are observed over
   the non-wetted SHO. These indicate attenuation of the turbulence
   regeneration cycle due to the slip boundary condition over the
   non-wetted SHO surfaces with random texture. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention, which, despite
   being routinely used in ICUs, poses the risk of causing further damage
   to the lung tissue if the ventilator is set inappropriately. Medical
   decision support systems may help in optimizing ventilator settings
   according to therapy goals given by the clinician. Before using the
   decision support algorithms in commercially available systems, extensive
   tests are necessary to ensure patient safety and correct decision
   making. Model-based patient simulators can assist in evaluating such
   decision support systems by creating different clinical scenarios. We
   propose a new Java based patient simulator that implements various
   models of respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and cardiovascular
   dynamics to form a complex patient model. The implemented models
   interact with one another to allow simulation of the ventilators
   influence on various physiological processes. Model simulations are
   running in real-time and simulation results can be extracted via
   multiple interfaces. Each of the implemented models has been validated
   to exhibit physiologically correct behavior. Results of the combined
   model system also showed to be physiologically plausible.}},

Abstract = {{Software development has been often considered as a ``standard{''}
   manufacturing activity, whose actions can be sequenced and optimized
   quite like the production of cars. From this the ``Waterfall Model{''}
   of software production was defined. But, like most human activities,
   even what people consider a ``simple{''} production of a Cappuccino,
   cannot be represented as such, and software is definitely more difficult
   than making a Cappuccino; in particular, in software three major
   problems occur: irreversibility, uncertainty, and complexity. This has
   lead to the emergence of novel approach to software production that
   acknowledges such problems and reverts upside-down the idea of
   formalizing software processes with a waterfall approach. However, such
   acknowledgment has not yet been fully received in the area of empirical
   and quantitative software engineering, where software processes have
   been still modeled usually with standard statistics and other
   traditional mathematical tools. We advocate that the usage of
   Computational Intelligence can translate into empirical and quantitative
   software engineering the paradigm shift implemented by the new, emerging
   process models in software development.}},

Abstract = {{Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease must periodically undergo a
   series of tests, usually performed at medical facilities, to diagnose
   the current state of the disease. Parkinson's disease progression
   assessment is an important set of procedures that supports the clinical
   diagnosis. A common part of the diagnostic train is analysis of speech
   signal to identify the disease-specific communication issues. This
   contribution describes two types of computational models that map speech
   signal measurements to clinical outputs. Speech signal samples were
   acquired through measurements from patients suffering from Parkinson's
   disease. In addition to direct mapping, the developed systems must be
   able of generalization so that correct clinical scale values can be
   predicted from future, previously unseen speech signals. Computational
   methods considered in this paper are artificial neural networks,
   particularly feedforward networks with several variants of
   backpropagation learning algorithm, and adaptive network-based fuzzy
   inference system (ANFIS). In order to speed up the learning process,
   some of the algorithms were parallelized. Resulting diagnostic system
   could be implemented in an embedded form to support individual
   assessment of Parkinson's disease progression from patients' homes.}},

Abstract = {{In coal liquefaction process initial coal particle size can be

   particles of coal are prepared by pulverisation and separation into
   different particle size ranges below 45 to 1,000 mu m. Since
   conventional batch autoclave is not suitable for short contact time
   experiments, as the time required for the autoclave to reach the
   reaction temperature can be substantial, the liquefaction runs were
   investigated with a rapid injection reactor designed specifically for
   investigating the effect of initial particle size on liquefaction
   conversion. A Canadian coal was examined in a tubular bomb reactor in
   presence of tetralin at 400 degrees C for a short reaction time (5 min)
   with pressure of 6 MPa under nitrogen atmosphere. The results indicated
   that total conversion obtained during the liquefaction changed according
   to the different particle size, and optimum particle size (150-212 mu m)
   was detected for the liquefaction condition.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the migration of small water droplets from the side wall
   of amicropillar onto its top surface during dropwise condensation
   without application of an external force. The observed droplet migration
   occurs due to the difference in wettability between the hydrophobic
   sides and hydrophilic top surfaces of the micropillars imposed by a
   novel fabrication process. The movement of condensate from the pillars'
   side walls onto their tops is suggested as a method for shifting
   condensate from a Wenzel to a Cassie-Baxter state to promote droplet
   detachment. In this communication, we also emphasize the use of combined
   surface texturing and wettability patterning to prompt the migration of
   condensate on pillars for the effective design of surfaces for high
   condensation heat transfer performance.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductivity of passive films on steam generator (SG) tubing alloys,
   Alloys 690 and 800, in simulated crevice chemistries containing lead and
   sulphur was investigated using the Mott-Schottky analysis. The
   interaction of the above species with other ions on the properties of
   passive film and the correlation between the semiconductivity and the
   breakdown of passive film were discussed. Experimental results revealed
   that semiconductivity could be either n or p type semiconductor; both Pb
   and S can incorporate into the passive layer, depending on the solution
   pH and alloy compositions. For n type semiconductors formed on Alloy
   800, they are easily broken down but more resistant to anodic
   dissolution; for p type passive films formed on Alloys 690 and 800, they
   are not easily broken down but more prone to anodic dissolution. It is
   concluded that the semiconductivity of passive film on SG tubing alloys
   was dependent on the alloy compositions, the solutions, temperature and
   film formation potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Doped polysilicon is used as a via fill material for through silicon via
   technology. Boron doping is used to reduce the polysilicon resistivity
   but boron doping significantly decreases the polish removal rate. Here
   the influence of slurry characteristics, chemistry and abrasive
   properties, on the chemical mechanical polishing of heavily boron-doped
   polysilicon is investigated. The effect of slurry pH on silica abrasive
   size and colloidal stability is examined as well as the influence of
   these effects on the polish rate. The optimum abrasive concentration is
   similar to 6 wt\% and higher concentrations did not improve the polish
   rate due to the saturation of slurry particles on the wafer surface.
   Smaller abrasive particles, with 10 times higher surface area per unit
   weight improved the polish rate similar to 20\%. Finally, polish
   conditions with mechanical and chemical dominance are compared. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose new methods to represent interdependence among
   alternative attributes and experts' opinions by constructing Choquet
   integral using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In the
   sequel, we apply these methods to solve the multiple attribute group
   decision-making (MAGDM) problems under interval-valued intuitionistic
   fuzzy environment. First, the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic
   fuzzy Choquet integral is defined, and some elementary properties are
   studied in detail. Next, an axiomatic system of interval-valued
   intuitionistic fuzzy measure is established by delivering a series of
   mathematical proofs. Then, with fuzzy entropy and Shapely-values in game
   theory, we propose the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy measure
   development methods in order to form the importance measure of
   attributes and correlation measure of the experts, respectively. Based
   on the results of theoretical analysis, a new method is proposed to
   handle the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making
   problems. A numerical example illustrates the procedure of the proposed
   methods and verifies the validity and effectiveness of our new proposed
   methods.}},

Pages = {{352-367}},
Abstract = {{Covering generalized rough set theory is an important extension of
   classical rough set theory. To characterize a fuzzy set in a given
   covering approximation space, a pair of fuzzy sets, called covering
   rough fuzzy lower and upper approximations, were introduced, but they do
   not describe well how much uncertainty is induced by the granularity of
   knowledge. In this paper, we first discuss the relationship between
   uncertainty and granularity of knowledge. Then we examine several
   commonly used distance measures, and indicate that some of them exhibit
   some limitations. Next we propose a roughness measure based on Minkowski
   distance, and examine some important properties of this measure.
   Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the
   application of the roughness measure to incomplete information systems

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new architecture of optimized Radial Basis
   Function neural network classifier developed with the aid of fuzzy
   clustering and data preprocessing techniques and discuss its
   comprehensive design methodology. In the preprocessing part, the Linear
   Discriminant Analysis (LDA) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   algorithm forms a front end of the network. The transformed data
   produced here are used as the inputs of the network. In the premise
   part, the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm determines the receptive field
   associated with the condition part of the rules. The connection weights
   of the classifier are of functional nature and come as polynomial
   functions forming the consequent part. The Particle Swarm Optimization
   algorithm optimizes a number of essential parameters needed to improve
   the accuracy of the classifier. Those optimized parameters include the
   type of data preprocessing, the dimensionality of the feature vectors
   produced by the LDA (or PCA), the number of clusters (rules), the
   fuzzification coefficient used in the FCM algorithm and the orders of
   the polynomials of networks. The performance of the proposed classifier
   is reported for several benchmarking data-sets and is compared with the
   performance of other classifiers reported in the previous studies.}},

Title = {{Novel Point-to-Point Scan Matching Algorithm Based on Cross-Correlation}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The localization of mobile robots in outdoor and indoor environments is
   a complex issue. Many sophisticated approaches, based on various types
   of sensory inputs and different computational concepts, are used to
   accomplish this task. However, many of the most efficient methods for
   mobile robot localization suffer from high computational costs and/or
   the need for high resolution sensory inputs. Scan cross-correlation is a

Abstract = {{Aim: This study aimed to create fibronectin (FN)-grafted polymeric
   surfaces to investigate the influence of leukemic cell adhesion on siRNA
   treatment. Materials \& methods: FN was grafted on plasma-treated PTFE
   surfaces using chemical crosslinkers. Adhesion and growth of chronic
   myeloid leukemia K562 cells on modified surfaces were investigated. The
   silencing effect of siRNA/lipid-polymers nanoparticles on cells grown on
   FN-grafted surfaces was evaluated. Results: Crosslinker-mediated
   immobilization showed significant FN grafting on surfaces, which
   provided K562 cell adhesion and growth advantage. siRNA nanoparticle
   silencing was similarly effective on FN-adhered and suspension-growing
   K562 cells. Conclusion: This study provided initial data to develop a
   cell-adhesive system to investigate therapeutic effects on leukemic
   cells. The response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to siRNA
   nanoparticles was independent on cell attachment.}},

Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we offer a general view at the area of fuzzy modeling and
   elaborate on a new direction of system modeling by introducing a concept
   of granular models. Those models constitute a generalization of existing
   fuzzy models and, in contrast to existing models, generate results in
   the form of information granules (such as intervals, fuzzy sets, rough
   sets and others). We present a rationale and some key motivating
   arguments behind the emergence of granular models and discuss their
   underlying design process. Central to the development of granular models
   are granular spaces, namely a granular space of parameters of the models
   and a granular input space. The development of the granular model is
   completed through an optimal allocation of information granularity,
   which optimizes criteria of coverage and specificity of granular
   information. The emergence of granular models of type-2 and type-n, in
   general, is discussed along with an elaboration on their formation. It
   is shown that achieving a sound coverage-specificity tradeoff
   (compromise) is of essential relevance in the realization of the
   granular models.}},

Abstract = {{To model the combined multistage technologies of radio-frequency
   electromagnetic heating (RF-EM), solvent injection, and hydraulic
   fracturing, a mathematical model was developed. It was assumed that the
   well was previously hydraulically fractured and then the solvent was
   injected through it with simultaneous RF electromagnetic irradiation.
   The radiator of RF-EM waves was located at the bottom of the injection
   well. When the electromagnetic waves were irradiated into the reservoir,
   the temperature rises and the viscosity of the liquid decreases around
   the fractured well. While ``cold{''} solvent was injected, it was heated
   at the bottom of the well so that the heat was transferred into the
   fracture and reservoir by convection. This leads to an increase of
   reservoir coverage by heating. The area of the thermal effect was
   determined by the length of fracture, duration of solvent injection,
   reduction in oil viscosity, increasing injectivity due to rising
   temperature, and solvent-heavy oil mixing around the bottomhole.
   Multistage process of reservoir stimulation was considered: (1)
   ``Cold{''} production of heavy oil through the fractured well, (2) shut
   (shutdown) of the well without treatment, (3) solvent injection into the
   fractured production well with simultaneous RF-EM heating, (4) well was
   suspended to ``soak{''} without any treatment, and (5) production of
   heavy oil with solvent without heating. The most efficient scenario was
   the combined RF-EM heating/fracturing multistage production technology.
   Recurring stages of solvent injection/RF-EM heating allowed maximum use
   of thermal energy and achieved the most efficient production growth.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2611-2622}},
Abstract = {{subsequences that exhibit departures from normal state of operation. In
   this paper, to solve the problems of unknown data distribution, control
   limit determination, multiple parameters, training data and fuzziness of
   `anomaly', a self-adaptive and unsupervised model is developed for
   finding anomalies in data streams. A salient feature is a synergistic
   combination of both statistical and fuzzy set-based techniques. Anomaly
   detection problem is viewed as a certain statistical hypothesis testing
   which is realized in an unsupervised mode. At the same time, `anomaly'
   is a much more complex concept and as such can be described with fuzzy
   set theory. Fuzzy sets bring a facet of robustness to the overall scheme
   and play an important role in the successive step of hypothesis testing.
   Because of the fuzzification, parameters determination is self-adaptive
   and no parameter needs to be specified by the user, what's more, there
   is no need to consider the data distribution in statistical hypothesis
   testing in this paper. The approach is validated with a number of
   experiments, which help to quantify the performance of constructed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{New gas therapies using inert gases such as xenon and argon are being
   studied, which require in vitro and in vivo preclinical experiments.
   Examples of the kinetics of gas transport during such experiments are
   analyzed in this paper. Using analytical and numerical models, we
   analyze an in vitro experiment for gas transport to a 96 cell well plate
   and an in vivo delivery to a small animal chamber, where the key
   processes considered are the wash-in of test gas into an apparatus dead
   volume, the diffusion of test gas through the liquid media in a well of
   a cell test plate, and the pharmacokinetics in a rat. In the case of
   small animals in a chamber, the key variable controlling the kinetics is
   the chamber wash-in time constant that is a function of the chamber
   volume and the gas flow rate. For cells covered by a liquid media the
   diffusion of gas through the liquid media is the dominant mechanism,
   such that liquid depth and the gas diffusion constant are the key
   parameters. The key message from these analyses is that the transport of
   gas during preclinical experiments can be important in determining the
   true dose as experienced at the site of action in an animal or to a
   cell.}},

Title = {{A Novel Compensation Strategy for the Radiation Characteristics of Large

Abstract = {{To mitigate the degradation of radiation characteristics for large
   ground-reflector antennas due to dielectric radomes, a simple
   compensation strategy based on phase modification has been proposed. A
   modification of the phase distribution in the original aperture of an
   enclosed reflector antenna via moving the feed or subreflector along
   axial direction opportunely could compensate the phase shift caused by
   dielectric radome, minimize the phase difference in transmission
   aperture, and reduce the distortion of the antenna's far-field pattern.
   The movement of the subreflector could be calculated by a formula, which
   has been provided in this work based on geometrical optics (GO). Good
   compensated results are obtained in a 9.14-m one-piece dielectric
   sandwich radome. The proposed compensation strategy could also be
   applied to metal-space frame radome; a 20-m radome is presented to
   verify the results.}},

Abstract = {{Sole thermal or solvent methods for heavy-oil recovery are not effective
   enough to deliver cost efficient processes. Hybrid applications of those
   two techniques have been proposed to take advantage of each and a wide
   range of investigations have been recently performed focusing on extreme
   conditions such as bitumen containing sands and carbonates, deep
   reservoirs, and oil-wet fractured carbonates. What is critically
   important in these applications is to determine the best performing
   solvent for a particular application and optimal application conditions
   for a given solvent at high temperature conditions. In this study, the
   results from various reported works on the hybrid applications of
   thermal (mainly steam) and solvent methods were complied, analyzed, and
   compared. Attention was given to a comparative analysis of
   steam-over-solvent injection in fractured reservoirs (SOS-FR) method.
   Steam/solvent methods show a promising outcome in general, while
   specific modifications must be taken into account for different
   application situations. These were discussed and specified, especially
   from proper solvent type and optimal application conditions for
   alternate injection of steam and solvent in different reservoir types.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{7466-7473}},
Abstract = {{Sensing of molecular analytes by probing the effects of their
   interaction with microwaves is emerging as a cheap, compact, label-free
   and highly sensitive detection and quantification technique. Microstrip
   ring-type resonators are particularly favored for this purpose due to
   their planar sensing geometry, electromagnetic field enhancements in the
   coupling gap and compatibility with established printed circuit board
   manufacturing. However, the lack of selectivity in what is essentially a
   permittivity-sensing method is an impediment to wider adoption and
   implementation of this sensing platform. By placing a polycrystalline
   anatase-phase TiO2 nanotube membrane in the coupling gap of a microwave
   resonator, we engineer selectivity for the detection and differentiation
   of methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. The scavenging of reactive trapped
   holes by aliphatic alcohols adsorbed on TiO2 is responsible for the
   alcohol-specific detection while the different short chain alcohols are
   distinguished on the basis of differences in their microwave response.
   Electrodeless microwave sensors which allow spectral and time-dependent
   monitoring of the resonance frequency and quality factor provide a
   wealth of information in comparison with electrode-based resistive
   sensors for the detection of volatile organic compounds. A high dynamic
   range (400 ppm-10 000 ppm) is demonstrated for methanol detection.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{For strain-controlled fatigue tests, especially at elevated temperature,
   implementation of knife-edges and punching dimples within the gauge
   length of a specimen is a common practice to mount the extensometer.
   Premature failure on the test section of the specimens might be
   introduced by implementing these techniques. In this paper, an
   alternative approach is introduced to control and measure the strains in
   fatigue tests. Two dimples outside the gauge-length section are punched
   and used to mount the extensometer. The correlation between the
   controlled (measured) strain and the strain within the gauge-length
   section is established. For the isothermal fatigue tests (strain cycling
   at constant elevated temperature), the correlation can be established
   either through analytical analysis or finite-element analysis (FEA). By
   comparing the hysteresis loops obtained through the correlation and the
   one directly measured within the gauge length, it is found that the
   established correlation obtained from FEA has better agreement with the
   latter result. In addition, this technique can also be used for
   thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) tests (both temperature and strain
   cycling). However, it is found that the correlation developed through
   FEA does not give accurate result. Therefore, the interconnection should
   be established through a cyclic test, in which two extensometers are
   mounted on the specimen, one measures the strain within the gauge length
   and the other measures the strain outside the gauge length.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of the ring contraction reaction of

   iron tricarbonyls 1 was initially broken to form an eta(4)-intermediate
   3 by an intramolecular activation reaction with iron via the transition
   state 2TS. The Si-C bond of intermediate 3 was then activated by an
   intramolecular cheletropic reaction with iron, which generated a high
   energy state 5 through the transition state 4TS. Because of the
   dissociation of the silacarbenoid from 5, the pi electrons of one C=C
   bond coordinated to iron produced an intermediate 6 and {[}:SiMe2]. In
   particular, the silacarbenoids rapidly formed aggregations by
   oligomerizations. Finally, intermediate 6 achieved the six membered ring
   product 8 with the intramolecular nucleophilic reaction to accomplish
   the ring contraction reaction using the transition state 7TS. The
   rate-determining step was the intramolecular activation reaction of the
   Si-Si bond using iron.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid level measurement and material identification with ultrawideband
   (UWB) free-space radar is considered in this letter. Traditional level
   measurement methods cannot distinguish between overlapping pulses, and
   their accuracy in identifying thin layers of material is limited by the
   width of the pulse used. A thin layer resolution algorithm is introduced
   to estimate the amplitudes of overlapping pulses, which in turn
   increases the accuracy in thin layer identification. The proposed thin
   layer resolution algorithm is shown to outperform spectral estimation
   methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC). A complete test
   setup was developed in laboratory, and the proposed signal processing
   method was tested on measurement data. The thin layer resolution method
   can recognize a 1-cm top layer of oil that corresponds to an overlapping
   of 66\% between the first two reflected pulses.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, ultrathin polypyrrole/protein fibrous films have
   been successfully fabricated by polymerizing pyrrole onto
   three-dimensional electrospun hordein network surfaces at a low
   temperature. The nanostructured polypyrrole is rooted on the surface of
   protein microfibers like ``taste buds{''}. Such modification not only
   eliminated the issue of protein shrinkage in the liquid medium, but also
   significantly improved the film's mechanical strength and wettability.
   The ultrathin fibrous films exhibited a ``metallic{''} character, and
   could effectively respond to temperature changes, and thus have
   potential to be used as flexible materials for sensors and electronic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{We created a hybrid Na ion capacitor (NIC) with a unique architecture
   and exceptional energy-power characteristics. Both the anode and the
   cathode are based on peanut skin derived carbon nanosheets fabricated by
   simultaneous carbonization and activation or by carbonization alone. The
   tens of nanometer thick (down to 20 nm) - high surface area (up to 2070
   m(2) g(-1)) nanosheets possesses a disordered structure for copious
   reversible binding of Na at the carbon defects. They are also
   hierarchically micro-meso-macro porous, allowing facile ion transport at
   high rates both through the pore-filling electrolyte and in the
   solid-state. When employed as sodium ion battery anode, the carbon shows
   a tremendous reversible (desodiation) capacity of 461 mA h g(-1) at 100
   mA g(-1) and excellent rate capability, e.g. 107 mA h g(-1) at 5 A
   g(-1). The optimized NIC device displays highly favorable Ragone chart
   placement, e.g. 112 and 45 Wh kg(-1) at 67 and 12 000 W kg(-1),
   retaining 85\% of its capacity after 3000 cycles.}},

Pages = {{145-154}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study investigating the behavior of
   peat subgrade beneath a railway embankment. Instrumentation was
   installed to measure the temperature, pore water pressure, and vertical
   settlement at different depths within peat strata over a 3-year period.
   The pore pressures within the peat subgrade were observed to increase
   significantly during the warmer months (>10 kPa) and to be strongly
   correlated to the seasonal changes in temperature. However, no clear
   correlation was found between pore pressure and settlement. Gas bubbles
   observed coming up through ponded surface water beside the embankment
   suggested that pore pressure may be a result of the expansion of gas
   bubbles within the peat. To confirm this hypothesis, laboratory tests
   were conducted. Peat specimens, kept at room temperature and in an
   anaerobic environment, confirmed the potential to generate gas. Further,
   the pore pressures of peat specimens placed within a triaxial cell
   apparatus with a constant applied confining pressure showed a direct
   correlation to incremental increases in the temperature of the specimen.
   Measurements showed that a 30 kPa increase in pore pressure corresponded
   to a 10 degrees C increase in temperature. The results of this
   investigation showed the existence of gas within a peat subgrade and its
   effect on the pore pressure within the peat.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative paradigm named Cooperative Cognitive Maritime Cyber
   Physical Systems (CCMCPSs) is developed to achieve highspeed and
   low-cost communication services. The analysis of the available white
   space at sea, as well as the framework, is presented. Specifically, a
   bilevel game with two stages of PUs-to-SUs (primary users to secondary
   users) and SUs-to-SUs is proposed, to address the resource allocation
   issue of Decode-and-Forward (DF) relay mode with maximal-ratio combining
   (MRC) receiving mode in destination. Stackelberg game with priority is
   employed between PU and SUs, while a symmetrical system model is
   considered among SUs-to-SUs. The game theoretic procedure that converges
   to Nash equilibrium based on the utility and payoff function is
   illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy
   could effectively increase the throughput as well as the payoffs of the

Abstract = {{We present a complete analysis for the deformation profiles of lipid
   membranes induced by their interactions with solid elliptical cylinder
   substrates (e.g., proteins). The theoretical framework for the mechanics
   of lipid membranes is described in terms of the classical Helfrich
   model, and the resulting shape equation is formulated in general
   curvilinear coordinates to accommodate the elliptical shape of the
   contour surrounding the contact area. Admissible boundary conditions for
   the contact region are taken from the existing literature but
   reformulated and adapted to the current framework. A complete
   semi-analytic solution (in terms of Mathieu functions) is obtained
   within the limitation of superposed incremental deformations and the
   Monge representation in the deformed configuration functions. The
   results predict smooth morphological transitions over the domain of
   interest when a lipid membrane interacts with a rigid substrate through

Title = {{Constructing Continuous Strain and Stress Fields From Spatially Discrete
   Displacement Data in Soft Materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A recent study demonstrated that three-dimensional (3D) continuous
   displacement fields in transparent soft gels can be constructed from
   discrete displacement data obtained by optically tracking fluorescent
   particles embedded in the gels. Strain and stress fields were
   subsequently determined from gradients of the displacement field. This
   process was achieved through the moving least-square (MLS) interpolation
   method. The goal of this study is to evaluate the numerical accuracy of
   MLS in determining the displacement, strain, and stress fields in soft
   materials subjected to large deformation. Using an indentation model as
   the benchmark, we extract displacement at a set of randomly distributed
   data points from the results of a finite-element model, utilize these
   data points as the input for MLS, and compare resulting displacement,
   strain, and stress fields with the corresponding finite-element results.
   The calculation of strain and stress is based on finite strain
   kinematics and hyperelasticity theory. We also perform a parametric
   study in order to understand how parameters of the MLS method affect the
   accuracy of the interpolated displacement, strain, and stress fields. We
   further apply the MLS method to two additional cases with highly
   nonuniform deformation: a plate with a circular cavity subjected to
   large uniaxial stretch and a plane stress crack under large mode I
   loading. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using optical
   particle tracking together with MLS interpolation to map local strain
   and stress field in highly deformed soft materials.}},

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) deliver an energy-efficient and
   eco-friendly pathway to convert biogas into syngas and electricity.
   However, many problems still need to be solved before their
   commercialization. Some of the disadvantages of biogas SOFC technology
   include coking and sulfur poisoning that lead to catalyst deactivation
   and large thermal gradients causing thermal stress. In this work, a
   novel on-cell micro-reformer and NiSn bimetallic nanoparticles were
   introduced into a conventional Ni-based anode for efficient and durable
   internal reforming of biogas. The add-on micro-reformer, consisting of
   tailored Ni foam supported NiSn/Al2O3 nanoclusters, exhibited excellent
   reforming activity and outstanding resistance to coking and sulfur
   poisoning. Thus, the pre-reforming process in the micro-reformer could
   effectively decrease the thermal gradients in the anode. Besides, the
   loosely filled nanoclusters showed high capability of releasing thermal
   stress due to their movable nature. Moreover, the yielded syngas was
   partially electro-oxidized in a coke/sulfur tolerant NiSn bimetallic
   anode to compensate the energy consumption and promote the conversion of
   biogas. At 850 degrees C and in a CH4-CO2-200 ppm H2S atmosphere, a peak
   power density as high as 0.946 W cm(-2) was achieved. With a constant
   current density of 1.25 A cm(-2), the CH4 conversion and CO selectivity
   remained at around 95\% while processing a steady output voltage (0.69
   V), demonstrating excellent activity and coke/sulfur tolerance that have
   rarely been reported. This work delivered an efficient way for biogas
   utilization in the context of efficient energy conversion technologies.}},

Abstract = {{As a new and meaningful extension of the Pawlak rough set,
   multi-granulation rough sets (MGRSs) have attracted much attention and
   fruitful achievements have been reported in different aspects. By
   combining with fuzzy rough set, the paper introduces multi-granulation
   fuzzy rough sets in the covering approximation space, namely,
   covering-based multi-granulation fuzzy rough sets (CMFRS), which form
   the extension of fuzzy rough sets. We first investigate several
   important properties of lower and upper approximations of concepts in
   covering-based multi-granulation fuzzy rough sets and elaborate on the
   differences between the proposed models and the existing ones in
   literature. By employing the notions of reduct and exclusion of a
   covering, the paper studies the necessary and sufficient conditions for
   two CMFRS to generate identical lower and upper approximations of a
   target concept in the given covering approximation space. Finally, the
   relationships between the new models are explored in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution is developed for the unsteady flow of fluid
   through a parallel rotating plate microchannel, under the influence of
   electrokinetic force using the Debye-Huckel (DH) approximation.
   Transient Navier-Stokes equations are solved exactly in terms of the
   cosine Fourier series using the separation of variables method. The
   effects of frame rotation frequency and electroosmotic force on the
   fluid velocity and the flow rate distributions are investigated. The
   rotating system is found to have a damped oscillatory behavior. It is
   found that the period and the decay rate of the oscillations are
   independent of the DH parameter (kappa). A time dependent structure of
   the boundary layer is observed at higher rotational frequencies.
   Furthermore, the rotation is shown to generate a secondary flow and a
   parameter is defined (beta(t)) to examine the ratio of the flow in the y
   and x directions. It showed that both the angular velocity and the
   Debye-Huckel parameters are influential on the induced transient
   secondary flow in the y direction. At high values of the Debye-Huckel
   parameter and the rotation parameter the flow rates in the x and y
   directions are found to be identical. The analytical solution results
   are found to be in good agreement with the numerical method results and
   previously published work in this field.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we regard the membership degree and the non-membership

   correlation coefficient between the IFSs. The proposed method not only
   reflects the symbol attribute of the correlation degree between the IFSs
   (the value of the correlation coefficient lies in the interval {[}-1,
   1]), but also makes sure the integrity of the IFS is maintained. Several
   examples are given to show the feasibility and advantages of the
   proposed method. Moreover, we extend this approach to the

Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{697-710}},
Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions offer numerous
   advantages in the context of protein-protein interactions when compared
   to the structured proteins and domains. These advantages include ability
   to interact with multiple partners, to fold into different conformations
   when bound to different partners, and to undergo disorder-to-order
   transitions concomitant with their functional activity. Molecular
   recognition features (MoRFs) are widespread elements located in
   disordered regions that undergo disorder-to-order transition upon
   binding to their protein partners. We characterize abundance,
   composition, and functions of MoRFs and their association with the
   disordered regions across 868 species spread across Eukaryota, Bacteria
   and Archaea. We found that although disorder is substantially elevated
   in Eukaryota, MoRFs have similar abundance and amino acid composition
   across the three domains of life. The abundance of MoRFs is highly
   correlated with the amount of intrinsic disorder in Bacteria and Archaea
   but only modestly correlated in Eukaryota. Proteins with MoRFs have
   significantly more disorder and MoRFs are present in many disordered
   regions, with Eukaryota having more MoRF-free disordered regions.
   MoRF-containing proteins are enriched in the ribosome, nucleus,
   nucleolus and microtubule and are involved in translation, protein
   transport, protein folding, and interactions with DNAs. Our insights
   into the nature and function of MoRFs enhance our understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying the disorder-to-order transition and
   protein-protein recognition and interactions. The fMoRFpred method that
   we used to annotate MoRFs is available at
   http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/fMoRFpred/.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{16301-16307}},
Abstract = {{Anomalous growth per cycle was observed using in situ ellipsometry
   during the initial cycles of plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) of high-k dielectrics, while thermal atomic layer deposition of
   these oxides exhibited linear growth per cycle. The anomalous growth per
   cycle was attributed to oxidation of the substrate by plasma oxygen.
   Thermally grown films have a lower capacitance density and higher
   leakage current but lower density of interfacial traps compared to
   plasma enhanced grown films. For plasma enhanced films, the leakage
   current is dominated by direct tunnelling while trap assisted tunnelling
   seems to be dominant in thermally grown films. Initiating the oxide
   growth with thermal atomic layer deposition and then switching to the
   plasma enhanced process protects the substrate surface from plasma
   oxygen and lowers the density of interfacial traps (D-it). Starting with
   ten cycles of thermal atomic layer deposition of ZrO2 enhances the
   capacitance density while decreasing the D-it. The lowest value of D-it
   was obtained with twenty cycles of thermal atomic layer deposition (1.8
   x 10(10) cm(-2) eV(-1)). The mid-gap D-it reduces systematically with an
   increasing number of thermal ALD cycles. Furthermore, the frequency
   dispersion in accumulation is reduced with an increasing number of

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation of water from a saturated soil surface with ample free water
   is known as potential evaporation, PE, and the associated physical
   processes are quite well understood. However, evaporation of water from
   an unsaturated soil surface is known as actual evaporation, AE, and the
   associated physical processes are more complex and less understood. The
   calculation of actual evaporation is important for many geotechnical
   engineering applications. Soil suction and the corresponding water
   content at which the AE rate begins to depart from the PE rate during a
   drying process are re-assessed using a series of laboratory tests (i.e.,
   thin soil section drying tests and soil column drying tests). Laboratory
   results show that the suction at which the actual rate of evaporation
   begins to depart from the PE rate for soil columns (or thick soil
   layers) may be different than for thin soil layers. Suction at the
   ``evaporation-rate reduction point{''} (ERRP) appears to be
   approximately 3000 kPa for thin soil layers, but is between the
   air-entry value and residual soil suction for thick soil layers or soil
   columns. The analyses presented in this paper have resulted in the
   development of a methodology for the estimation of suction corresponding
   to the ERRP in soil columns. Equations are also proposed to calculate
   the coefficient of surface moisture availability, vapour pressure, and
   ``surface resistance{''} at the ground surface. The paper also presents
   an equation (i.e., new soil-atmosphere moisture flux equation) for
   predicting evaporation rate from a soil surface using ``surface
   resistance{''} to vapour water diffusion from the soil to the
   atmosphere. The proposed soil-atmosphere model is verified using
   evaporation rate data collected from various drying tests on thin soil
   layers and soil columns. Reasonably good agreement was found between the
   computed and measured rates of evaporation. The findings and
   recommendations in this paper contribute to an improved understanding of
   the prediction of AE from unsaturated soil surfaces.}},

   surface functionalized by ion exchanging the solid with copper and
   chromium ions. The ability of this bi-metallic adsorbent to remove H2S
   at elevated temperatures was assessed using a dynamic breakthrough
   system and contrasted against an analogous mixed metal oxide, Cu-Cr-O.
   Unlike Cu-Cr-O, the H2S capacity for CuCr-ETS-2 remains unchanged from
   350 degrees C up to 950 degrees C. Using ETS-2 as a support for the
   metals increased the adsorbents surface area and improved its sulfur
   capacity from 35 mg H2S/g for Cu-Cr-O to 61 mg H2S/g adsorbent for
   CuCr-ETS-2. The consistent presence of Cu9S5 on the sulfided adsorbents
   suggests that chromium effectively stabilizes the copper against
   reduction to metallic copper up to temperatures as high as 950 degrees
   C.}},

Title = {{Pore structure characterization, permeability evaluation and enhanced
   gas recovery techniques of tight gas sandstones}},

Abstract = {{This mini review provides an overview of the recent developments in the
   pore structure characterization of tight gas sandstones, permeability
   measurement techniques, and enhanced tight gas recovery techniques.
   Firstly, we review the various testing techniques used for
   characterizing pore structures of tight gas sandstones, namely, the
   characteristics of pore, throat and micro-cracks in tight sandstones.
   These techniques can be grouped into qualitative, semi-quantitative and
   quantitative methods. We review the capabilities of these methods as
   well as their resolutions in pore-throat diameter measurement. Then the
   descriptive theories of pore networks of tight sandstones are
   overviewed, with a special attention paid to the fractal theory.
   Secondly, the commonly used permeability measurement techniques for
   tight cores are discussed; these measurements techniques are
   unsteady-state methods that accommodate the nature of low permeability
   of tight sandstones. Their merits and drawbacks are provided in this
   review. We next elaborate on the effect of effective stress and water
   saturation on the gas relative permeability in tight sandstones; a
   consensus is found to exist that agrees on the pronounced reduction of
   gas relative permeability due to increasing water presence and higher
   effective stress. The permeability jail concept can be used to explain
   some field observations where there is little water or gas production.
   Lastly, we move on to review the enhanced gas recovery techniques
   including waterless fracturing and CO2-based enhanced gas recovery. Both
   lab experiments and field applications demonstrate that, due to the
   negative impact that water causes on gas-phase relative permeability,
   waterless hydraulic fracturing holds a large potential in effectively
   unlocking tight gas resources. It deserves further detailed experimental
   and numerical investigation as well as field studies. In addition, CO2
   injection into tight gas formations is an important technology that is
   worth of consideration by both industry and governments due to its
   promising potential for enhancing CH4 recovery as well as sequestrating
   CO2 into depleted tight gas formations. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The development of new antibacterial coatings (against Escherichia coli
   and Staphylococcus aureus) using a natural dye, quercetin, according to
   a green chemistry process was investigated. Quercetin was used as both a
   photosensitizer and antibacterial agent. The synthesized material was
   developed according to a cationic photopolymerization process under
   light irradiation. The photosensitizing mechanism involving quercetin
   and an iodonium-based cationic photoinitiator was described for the
   first time according to steady state photolysis and fluorescence
   experiments. The resulting coatings showed excellent adhesion on a
   stainless steel plate as demonstrated by nanoindentation and scratch
   tests, with a high thermal stability up to 375 degrees C. Finally, a
   primary investigation was conducted to assess the antibacterial
   properties of the glycerol-derived coatings against Escherichia coli and
   Staphylococcus aureus under light illumination. Electron paramagnetic
   resonance spectroscopy confirmed the generation of reactive oxygen
   species, such as singlet oxygen, which is responsible for inhibiting
   bacteria proliferation.}},

   coating via the interfacial valence electron localization}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{18793-18799}},
Abstract = {{Electron work functions (EWF) and open potentials of electrodeposited
   nickel, TiC microparticle-reinforced and TiC nanoparticle-reinforced Ni
   matrix coatings were studied with the objective of investigating the
   effects of TiC particle size on the surface activity and corrosion
   tendency of the coatings. First-principles calculation was conducted to
   elucidate the underlying mechanism. Results of the study demonstrate
   that the overall EWF and open potential of Ni coating decreased when TiC
   microparticles (diameter = 2 mm) were added. However, TiC nanoparticles
   (diameter = 200 nm) showed opposite effects. Such changes are ascribed
   to the effect of particle size on the TiC/Ni interfacial state. It was
   shown that TiC microparticle/Ni interface had a low interfacial EWF.
   While the TiC nanoparticle resulted in a stronger TiC/Ni interface with
   elevated EWF. The first-principles calculation revealed that valence
   electrons were more localized in the region of the nano TiC/Ni
   interface, resulting in higher EWF, stronger interfacial bonding, and
   higher surface stability that limited the electrons available to
   participate in corrosion reactions.}},

   transfer}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1998-2008}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents both experimental and numerical simulations of
   liquid transfer between two solid surfaces with contact angle hysteresis
   (CAH). Systematic studies on the role of the advancing contact angle
   (theta(a)), receding contact angle (theta(r)) and CAH in determining the
   transfer ratio (volume of the liquid transferred onto the acceptor
   surface over the total liquid volume) and the maximum adhesion force
   (F-max) were performed. The transfer ratio was found to be governed by
   contact line pinning at the end of the transfer process caused by CAH of
   surfaces. A map based on theta(r) of the two surfaces was generated to
   identify the three regimes for liquid transfer: (I) contact line pinning
   occurs only on the donor surface, (II) contact line pinning occurs on
   both surfaces, and (III) contact line pinning occurs only on the
   acceptor surface. With this map, an empirical equation is provided which
   is able to estimate the transfer ratio by only knowing theta(r) of the
   two surfaces. The value of Fmax is found to be strongly influenced by
   the contact line pinning in the early stretching stage. For symmetric
   liquid bridges between two identical surfaces, F-max may be determined
   only by theta(a), only by theta(r), or by both theta(a) and theta(r),
   depending on the magnitude of the contact angles. For asymmetric
   bridges, Fmax is found to be affected by the period when contact lines
   are pinned on both surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Real Time Traction Tool (RT3)-Curve was used in this study to evaluate
   the effect of ice and snow on tire-road lateral friction coefficient,
   herein referred to as the Halliday Friction Number (HFN). The field
   experiments for the study were performed in winter 2012-2013 on the
   University of Alberta's test road facility in Edmonton, Alberta. Each
   run was repeated at three target speeds under varied road conditions,
   bare dry, dry with ice patches, ice, and three levels of snow
   accumulation. No considerable correlation was found between vehicle
   speed and the friction measurements for bare dry, ice-and snow-covered
   conditions. Expectedly, the bare dry asphalt concrete surface had the
   highest HFN, the presence of ice reduced the dry surface friction by
   55\%. The accumulation of snow on the dry surface reduced the HFN
   further than ice, by 69, 75, and 81\% for light, moderate, and heavy
   snow, respectively. A falling trend was observed for friction as more
   snow accumulated on the ground. Analysis of the effect of number of
   truck passes over ice at -3.5 and -5 degrees C showed that ice can
   become more slippery after each pass of traffic. A similar analysis for
   snow revealed that more passes over moderate snow will compact the fresh
   snow into a slippery surface. For light snow, even at low temperatures
   (<-10 degrees C), passes of traffic will melt the snow through
   frictional heat and result in higher friction values.}},

   laser displacement sensors}},

Abstract = {{The real-time detection of wheel-set size, the most significant
   technical parameter during vehicle operation, has important implications
   for ensuring the safety of wheel running. Based on laser ranging, an
   online detection system of the wheel size installed below the track is
   developed. Eight two-dimensional (2D) laser displacement sensors are
   applied to detect the wheel-set size including wheel flange and tread
   profile. A digital I/O card is utilized to generate synchronous signals
   which guarantee simultaneous working of all sensors. Least square based
   curve fitting and pick-up algorithm of tread feature-points are used to
   process the measured data and calculate the flange width, flange height
   and wheel diameter. The experimental results show that the online
   detection system of wheel-set size can realize the non-contact, dynamic
   and real-time measurement of wheel-set parameters. When train running
   speed is under 5 km/h and sampling frequency is 30 Hz, the detection
   accuracy of flange width and height is 0.2 mm and the detection accuracy
   of wheel diameter is 0.5 mm, which can meet the requirements of
   maintenance operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multivalent metals in oilsands bitumen can be present in metal-bridged
   structures that keep smaller molecules together. Oilsands bitumen,
   maltenes, and asphaltenes were treated with hydrochloric acid to remove
   metals from these materials and evaluate the hypothesis that metals
   removal would improve asphaltenes to maltenes transformation. Single
   step acid treatment was effective for metal removal, particularly from
   asphaltenes. About 2600 mu g/g divalent metals could be removed from the
   asphaltenes by washing with a 1 N HCl solution in a 4:1 mass ratio with
   the asphaltenes. Acid washing also resulted in some ester hydrolysis.
   Around 8 wt \% of the asphaltenes fraction consisted of maltenes that
   were in the asphaltenes fraction as result of bridging and that could be
   returned to the maltenes fraction by acid treatment. It was estimated
   that the average molecular mass of these molecules liberated by acid
   treatment was of the order 700 g/mol. Water and/or acid washing did not
   meaningfully remove V and Ni. Multivalent metals were present
   predominantly in the organic phase, not in the connate water, and were
   removed mainly by acid washing. Water washing was deleterious and
   promoted emulsion formation. It was proposed that a pH-sensitive change
   in the relative concentration of phenol and phenoxide groups to increase
   the concentration of hydrophilic phenoxide groups was responsible for
   increased emulsion formation, and spectroscopic evidence in support of
   this was presented.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{A major drawback associated with current hot or warm water-based bitumen
   extraction processes is the high consumption of energy. To address this
   issue, an aqueousnonaqueous hybrid bitumen extraction process (HBEP), in
   which a portion of the diluent (solvent) was added upfront to soak mined
   oil sands prior to its water-based extraction, was proposed and
   demonstrated to be feasible to process mineable oil sands at ambient
   temperatures. This study investigates the effect of adding ethyl
   cellulose (EC) as a promising demulsifier to the solvent on bitumen
   recovery and froth quality in the ambient HBEP. The laboratory flotation
   results clearly showed a significant improvement in froth quality with a
   negligible setback on bitumen recovery by 100200 ppm EC addition to the
   HBEP. Determined by an online visualization method, the addition of EC
   in solvent to the HBEP was found to further enhance separation kinetics
   of bitumen from sand grains of real oil sands ores. The addition of EC
   in solvent also increased the probability of bitumen droplet coalescence
   determined with a micropipette technique, but hindered the attachment of
   air bubbles to solvent-soaked bitumen, in particular at high EC dosages
   as evaluated by increased induction time of air bubble-bitumen
   attachment.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thermal conversion of oilsands bitumen at 400 degrees C was investigated
   to gain a better understanding of temporal changes in liquid properties.
   The work approximated a mild thermal cracking (visbreaking) process with
   run-lengths extending into the coking region. Reaction progress could be
   divided into three main regimes: (I) stable visbreaking, (II) coking
   visbreaking, and (III) coking. In addition to observations anticipated
   from the literature, the work revealed aspects of the reaction
   progression that was not fully appreciated before. Stable visbreaking
   with minimal formation of coke had a productive period during which
   viscosity decreased, while asphaltenes content and gas yield were
   unchanged, followed by an unproductive period during which the
   viscosity, asphaltenes content, and gas yield all increased. After the
   onset of precipitation of solids, the solids (coke) yield increased and
   the asphaltenes content in the liquid decreased, but the viscosity
   increased. The origin of increased viscosity was not due to increased
   asphaltenes content but due mainly to free radical addition products
   that remained soluble in the bulk liquid. The insolubility of molecules
   in the liquid and meso-phase that ultimately led to precipitation as
   solids and coke formation at higher temperatures, appeared to be caused
   by addition reactions more than as result of asphaltenes and
   hydrogen-depletion. The investigation does not prove this conclusively,
   but if this interpretation is correct, the coking limit of stable
   visbreaking operation at 400 degrees C is not as result of a solubility
   constraint caused by hydrogen-depletion; instead, it is the result of
   free radical addition that manifests as a solubility constraint leading
   to hydrogen-depletion. In the reaction sequence, the importance of
   hydrogen disproportionation of alkyl cycloalkane functionality in the
   bitumen was highlighted to explain the major changes, including the
   onset of increased gas yield and increased viscosity that was attributed
   to free radical addition.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Nice knot is a bulky double-stranded knot. Biomechanical
   data supporting its use as well as the number of half hitches required
   to ensure knot security is lacking. Materials and Methods: Nice knots
   with, one, two, or three half-hitches were compared with the surgeons
   and Tennessee slider knots with three half hitches. Each knot was tied
   10 times around a fixed diameter using four different sutures: FiberWire
   (Arthrex, Naples, FL), Ultrabraid (Smith and Nephew, Andover, MA), Hi-Fi
   (ConMed Linvatec, Largo, FL) and Force Fiber (Teleflex Medical OEM,
   Gurnee, IL). Cyclic testing was performed for 10 min between 10N and
   45N, resulting in approximately 1000 cycles. Displacement from an
   initial 10N load was recorded. Knots surviving cyclic testing were
   subjected to a load to failure test at a rate of 60 mm/min. Load at
   clinical failure: 3 mm slippage or opening of the suture loop was
   recorded. Bulk, mode of ultimate failure, opening of the loop past
   clinical failure, was also recorded. Results: During cyclic testing, the
   Nice knots with one or more half-hitches performed the best, slipping
   significantly less than the surgeons and Tennessee Slider (P < 0.002).
   After one half-hitch, the addition of half-hitches did not significantly
   improve Nice knot performance during cyclic testing (P > 0.06). The
   addition of half-hitches improved the strength of the Nice knot during
   the force to failure test, however after two half-hitches, increase of
   strength was not significant (P = 0.59). While FiberWire was the most
   bulky of the sutures tested, it also performed the best, slipping the
   least. Conclusion: The Nice knot, especially using FiberWire, is
   biomechanically superior to the surgeons and Tennessee slider knots. Two
   half hitches are recommended to ensure adequate knot security. The level
   of Evidence: 2, prospective comparative study.}},

Abstract = {{Railway alignments through the Canadian Cordillera are constantly
   exposed to slope instabilities. Proactive mitigation strategies have
   been in place for a few decades now, and instability record keeping has
   been recognized as an important aspect of them. Such a proactive
   strategy has enhanced the industry's capacity to manage slope risks, and
   some sections have been recognized as critical due to the frequency of
   instabilities. At these locations, quantification of the risks becomes
   necessary. Risk analysis requires knowledge of some variables for which
   statistical data are scarce or not available, and elicitation of
   subjective probabilities is needed. A limitation of such approaches lies
   in the uncertainty associated to those elicited probabilities. In this
   paper, a quantitative risk analysis is presented for a section of
   railway across the Canadian Cordillera. The analysis focused on the risk
   to life of the freight train crews working along this section. Upper and
   lower bounds were elicited to cope with the uncertainties associated
   with this approach. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was then applied
   to obtain the probability distribution of the estimated risks. The risk
   probability distribution suggests that the risk to life of the crews is
   below previously published evaluation criteria and within acceptable
   levels. The risk assessment approach proposed focuses on providing a
   measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimated risk and is
   capable of handling distributions that cover more than two orders of
   magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of electrostatic heterogeneity on the
   electric-field-induced destabilization of thin ionic liquid (IL) films
   is investigated to control spatial ordering and to reduce the lateral
   dimension of structures forming on the films. Commonly used perfect
   dielectric (PD) films are replaced with ionic conductive films to reduce
   the lateral length scales to a sub-micron level in the EHD pattering
   process. The 3-D spatiotemporal evolution of a thin IL film interface
   under homogenous and heterogeneous electric fields is numerically
   simulated. Finite differences in the spatial directions using an
   adaptive time step ODE solver are used to solve the 2-D nonlinear thin
   film equation. The validity of our simulation technique is determined
   from close agreement between the simulation results of a PD film and the
   experimental results in the literature. Replacing the flat electrode
   with the patterned one is found to result in more compact and
   well-ordered structures particularly when an electrode with square block
   protrusions is used. This is attributed to better control of the
   characteristic spatial lengths by applying a heterogeneous electric
   field by patterned electrodes. The structure size in PD films is reduced
   by a factor of 4 when they are replaced with IL films, which results in
   nano-sized features with well-ordered patterns over the domain.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Semantic Web, introduced by Berners-Lee in 2001,
   emphasizes importance of expressing semantics of data stored on the web.
   The introduced data format called Resource Description Framework (RDF)
   is a meaningful way of expressing and exploring data relations. It
   provides basics for constructing semantics-oriented data formats. More
   and more often RDF is used to represent variety of data including N-ary
   relations and temporal information. On many occasions this results in
   complex data structures. Their utilization requires a full understating
   of applied data configurations.
   This paper presents a fuzzy-based Linguistically Oriented RDF Interface
   - LORI - for querying RDF data containing temporal information and using
   non-trivial data structures. The interface includes specialized built-in
   predicates suitable for constructing temporal queries and supporting
   imprecise phrases describing time and data features, and high-level
   predicates built based on them. A simple case study using LORI interface
   for imprecise querying about time-based events is presented.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the maximum gain that can be achieved through cooperative
   broadcast with energy accumulation and memory. We consider a linear
   network, where a known number of nodes are placed on a line, and derive
   an upper bound on G(tot), the gain of cooperative broadcast over
   noncooperative broadcast with respect to total power consumption.
   Specifically, we prove that, in linear networks with path loss exponent
   alpha = 2, G(tot) <= pi(2)/12-pi(2) approximate to 4.64, irrespective of
   the number of devices, the size of the network, the node placement
   strategy, and the cooperative broadcast strategy. We extend this result
   to any path loss exponent alpha >= 2. We also show that the cooperation
   gain in short-range transmissions, wherein the circuit energy
   consumption is nonnegligible, is smaller than that in long-range
   transmissions. We further study the cooperative broadcast gain when the
   objective is to reduce the maximum transmission power used by any node
   in the network. In this case, we show that, when nodes are distributed
   uniformly at random, the maximum cooperation gain will be O(log n), with
   high probability, where n is the number of nodes in the network. These
   are important observations that should be considered in designing
   power-efficient broadcast algorithms in future network-wide cooperative
   broadcast.}},

Abstract = {{Geothermal coil heat exchangers of a ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP)
   system have been simulated in this research for the cooling mode of the
   heat pump system. Three types of vertical pile-foundation heat
   exchangers including 1-U-shaped type, 1-W-shaped type and a W-shaped-all
   round type which 6-U pipes have been connected serially and situated all
   round inside the pile in order to determine the most efficient type.
   Heat transfer rates in the three types have been determined via
   numerical methods which couples convection and conduction through water
   in pipelines, concrete pile, and soil. Results have been reported to
   present the heat transfer rate between water, pipe, pile and soil for
   acquiring the specific outlet temperature of water in comparison of
   inlet water in three types and three different depths of the pile. This
   research presents better performance in heat transfer rate between
   1-U-shaped, 1-W-shaped, and W-shaped-all round configurations for
   designing vertical pile-foundation of GCHP. Comparison between serial
   and parallel connection of pile-foundations in cooling mode has been
   investigated as well. Results show that a pile-foundation with
   W-shaped-all round configuration has the best efficiency in heat
   transfer rate compared to other mentioned types. In addition, serial
   connection of pile-foundations has better performance and efficiency in
   comparison to parallel method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Erasure codes, such as LT and Raptor codes, are designed for the purpose
   of erasure-resilient distribution of data over computer networks. To

   real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a new class of erasure
   codes based on Reed-Solomon codes that unlike other Reed-Solomon-based
   erasure codes are rateless and also, unlike other rateless codes,
   guarantee zero overhead even for small k. Moreover, they have a
   reasonable computational complexity of coding when k is not too large.
   In fact, a practical implementation of subfield subcodes of Reed-Solomon
   codes with arbitrarily large block lengths is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The particle-based direct simulation of Monte Carlo(DSMC) was present
   and validated for the investigation of non-equilibrium effects in
   diatomic gas flows. All the validations show that the results of the
   present DSMC is in agreement with the experimental data. Then, the
   numerical studies of micro scale shock/composite-vortex interactions in
   diatomic gas flows were conducted The substantial attenuation of
   enstrophy in diatomic gas flow is observed Differ from the sharp
   decreasing in diatomic gas, the time evolution of enstrophy in monatomic
   gas flow decrease linearly in the whole process. This study also shows
   that the vortex deformation through a shock, in particular, is observed
   to be strongly dependent on the shock and vortex strengths. Also, it is
   also found that strong interaction can also cause voracity production in
   microscale shock/vortex interaction for diatomic gas flow The
   attenuation, analogous to DSMC results, overwhelms the vorticity
   generation only in a limited set of regimes with low shock Mach number;
   small vortex size, or weak vortex. Besides, in diatomic gas flow,
   viscous voracity generation is also most dominant in the three dynamical
   processes of voracity transportation, followed by dilatational and
   baroclinicvorticity generation. The present study conform that
   shock/vortex present different features in strong and weak interactions
   for monatomic and diatomic gas flows. Furthermore, it provides a new way

Title = {{Parametric Study of Strain Rate Effects on Nanoparticle-Reinforced
   Polymer Composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Crashworthiness, energy absorption capacity, and safety are important
   factors in the design of lightweight vehicles made of fiber-reinforced
   polymer composite (FRP) components. The relatively recent emergence of
   the nanotechnology industry has presented a novel means to augment the
   mechanical properties of various materials. As a result, recent attempts
   have contemplated the use of nanoparticles to further improve the
   resiliency of resins, especially when resins are used for mating FRP
   components. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the response of
   nanoreinforced polymer composites, subjected to various rates of
   loading, is of paramount importance for developing reliable structures.
   In this paper, the effects of nanoreinforcement on the mechanical
   response of a commonly used epoxy resin subjected to four different
   strain rates, are systematically investigated. The results are then
   compared to those of the neat resin. To characterize the mechanical
   properties of the nanocomposite, a combination of the strain
   rate-dependent mechanical (SRDM) model of Goldberg and his coworkers and
   Halpin-Tsai's micromechanical approach is employed. Subsequently, a
   parametric study is conducted to ascertain the influences of particle
   type and their weight percentage. Finally, the numerical results are
   compared to the experimental data obtained from testing of the neat and
   the nanoreinforced epoxy resin.}},

Title = {{Influence of sea level rise on saline water intrusion in the Yangtze
   River Estuary, China}},
Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{12-25}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is vulnerable to the accelerated sea
   level rise (SLR). In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and
   salinity transport model, with a high resolution unstructured mesh and
   spatially varying bottom roughness, is applied to quantify the
   influences of SLR on saline water intrusion in the YRE. The model has
   well been validated through observation data of tidal level, flow
   velocity and direction, and salinity. The performances of four scenarios
   of the present sea level (PSL) as well as 0.5, I and 2 m SLR reveal that
   (1) the isohaline shifts upstream nonlinearly in the YRE with SLR, and
   non-uniform in the spatial distribution under the same SLR. The
   isohalines of 1, 2 and 5 psu near the north bank of the South Branch
   intrude farther upstream than those near the south bank, and the
   upstream advance distance of 0.45 psu isohaline is much longer than
   those of 1,2 and 5 psu isohalines under the same SLR. (2) The spillover
   of saline water from the North Branch into the South Branch intensifies
   with SLR, while the salinity in the lower reach of the North Branch is
   reduced due to increased low salinity flow from the South Branch and the
   North Channel caused by SLR. (3) The durations of undrinkable water
   increase at four reservoirs with SLR, and four reservoirs cannot intake
   raw drinking-water in the dry season in the 2 m SLR scenario. (4) A
   regression analysis obtains a quantitative quadratic expression between
   salinity and SLR. Finally, the effects of the operation of the Three
   Gorges Reservoir and more SLR scenarios on the salinity, and two
   different approaches for SLR simulations are also discussed. (C) 2015

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE \& PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We present the excellent anti-icing performance for a superhydrophobic
   coating surface based on ZnO/polydimethylsiloxane (ZnO/PDMS) composite.
   The superhydrophobic ZnO/PDMS coating surface was prepared by a facile
   solution mixing, drop coating, room-temperature curing and surface
   abrading procedure. The superhydrophobic ZnO/PDMS composite coating
   possesses a water contact angle of 159.5 degrees and a water sliding
   angle of 8.3 degrees at room temperature (5 degrees C). The anti-icing
   properties of the superhydrophobic coating were investigated by
   continuously dropping cold-water droplets (about 0 degrees C) onto the
   pre-cooled surface using a home-made apparatus. The sample was placed at
   different tilting angle (0 degrees and 10 degrees) and pre-cooled to
   various temperatures (-5, -10 and -15 degrees C) prior to measure. The
   pure Al surface was also studied for comparison. It was found that icing
   accretion on the surface could be reduced apparently because the water
   droplets merged together and slid away from the superhydrophobic surface
   at all of the measuring temperatures when the surface is horizontally
   placed. In addition, water droplet slid away completely from the
   superhydrophobic surface at -5 and -10 degrees C when the surface is
   tilted at 10 degrees, which demonstrates its excellent anti-icing
   properties at these temperatures. When the temperature decreased to -15
   degrees C, though ice accretion on the tilted superhydrophobic coating
   surface could not be avoided absolutely, the amount of ice formed on the
   surface is very small, which indicated that the coating surface with
   superhydrophobicity could significantly reduce ice accumulation on the
   surface at very low temperature (-15 degrees C). Importantly, the sample
   is also stable against repeated icing/deicing cycles. More meaningfully,
   once the superhydrophobic surface is damaged, it can be repaired easily
   and rapidly.}},

Journal = {{NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-36}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The ideal material for nanophotonic applications will have a large
   refractive index at optical frequencies, respond to both the electric
   and magnetic fields of light, support large optical chirality and
   anisotropy, confine and guide light at the nanoscale, and be able to
   modify the phase and amplitude of incoming radiation in a fraction of a
   wavelength. Artificial electromagnetic media, or metamaterials, based on
   metallic or polar dielectric nanostructures can provide many of these
   properties by coupling light to free electrons (plasmons) or phonons
   (phonon polaritons), respectively, but at the inevitable cost of
   significant energy dissipation and reduced device efficiency. Recently,
   however, there has been a shift in the approach to nanophotonics.
   Low-loss electromagnetic responses covering all four quadrants of
   possible permittivities and permeabilities have been achieved using
   completely transparent and high-refractive-index dielectric building
   blocks. Moreover, an emerging class of all-dielectric metamaterials
   consisting of anisotropic crystals has been shown to support large
   refractive index contrast between orthogonal polarizations of light.
   These advances have revived the exciting prospect of integrating exotic
   electromagnetic effects in practical photonic devices, to achieve, for
   example, ultrathin and efficient optical elements, and realize the
   long-standing goal of subdiffraction confinement and guiding of light
   without metals. In this Review, we present a broad outline of the whole
   range of electromagnetic effects observed using all-dielectric
   metamaterials: high-refractive-index nanoresonators, metasurfaces,
   zero-index metamaterials and anisotropic metamaterials. Finally, we
   discuss current challenges and future goals for the field at the
   intersection with quantum, thermal and silicon photonics, as well as
   biomimetic metasurfaces.}},

Abstract = {{To energy-efficiently offset our carbon footprint, we herein developed a
   novel CH4-CO2 dry reforming process to co-produce electricity and
   CO-concentrated syngas, which takes advantage of the selective oxidation
   of H-2 in high performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFCs). In these cells, an additional functional layer, consisting of a
   Ni0.8Co0.2-La0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (NiCo-LDC) composite, was successfully
   incorporated into the anode support, forming a layered SOFC
   configuration. The multiple-twinned bimetallic nanoparticles were then
   proven to have superior activity towards in situ dry reforming. In
   comparison to the conventional design, this layered SOFC demonstrated
   drastically improved CO2 resistance as well as internal reforming
   efficiency (CO2 conversion reached 91.5\% at 700 degrees C), and up to
   100 h galvanostatic stability in a CH4-CO2 feedstream at 1 A cm(-2).
   More importantly, H-2 was effectively and exclusively converted by
   electrochemical oxidation, yielding no CO2 but CO concentrated syngas in
   the anode effluent. The maximum power density exceeded 910 mW cm(-2) at
   700 degrees C with a polarization resistance as low as 0.121 Omega
   cm(2). Consequently, the heat released by H-2 electrochemical oxidation
   fully compensated for that required by the extremely endothermic dry
   reforming reaction, making the entire process thermally self-sufficient.
   We also showed that the layered design was beneficial in terms of
   decreasing coking and increasing CO2 resistance of the SOFC in the mixed
   CO2 and CH4 feedstock. This novel process promises to play a pivotal
   role in future CO2 conversion and utilization.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of climate change on extreme precipitation events in the
   Oldman (ORB), Bow, (BRB) and Red Deer (RRB) River Basins of southern
   Alberta, Canada, was assessed using six extreme climate indices for the
   rainy period of May-August (MJJA), and 9-km resolution Special Report on
   Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and A1B climate scenarios of four Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) Global Climate Models
   (GCMs) dynamically downscaled by a regional climate model, MM5. R95p of
   the three study sites showed an increase of 4\% for the 2050s
   (2041-2070) and 10\% for the 2080s (2071-2100) period, whereas R99p
   increased by 39\% (2050s) and 42\% (2080s) which suggest a projected
   increase in the volume of precipitation expected in future very wet and
   particularly extremely wet days. Similarly, R20mm, P30yr, RX1day and
   RX5day are also projected to increase by about 15\% by the mid-and late
   21st century in the three study sites. However, compared to BRB and RRB,
   ORB located in the southernmost part of the study site is projected to
   undergo a relatively higher increase in both temperature and
   precipitation intensity, which is assessed in terms of indices such as
   P30yr, RX1day and RX5day. On the other hand, RRB and BRB are projected
   to experience higher increase in R20mm, which suggest a relatively
   higher increase in the number of very heavy precipitation days projected
   for these two basins. Overall, these results suggest that in the 2050s
   and 2080s, southern Alberta will be expected to experience more frequent
   and severe intensive storm events in the MJJA season that could
   potentially increase the risk of future flooding in this region.}},

   Specific indicators (production costs in a techno-economic analysis,,
   functional units and environmental impacts in a life cycle analysis) for
   different technologies were compared. Finally, gaps in research and
   future trends in biomass thermochemical conversion were identified. This

Abstract = {{As part of the City of Edmonton's light rail transit expansion, twin 6.5
   m diameter oval shaped tunnels were constructed using conventional
   tunnelling methods. The geology of the site consists predominately of a
   hard, fissured cohesive till unit. The tunnel face construction was
   sequenced as top header, bench and invert excavations. At its narrowest,
   the pillar separating the twin tunnels was less than 1.5 m across or
   0.23 tunnel diameters. Typically, the minimum pillar spacing required to
   reduce the interaction between twin, side by side tunnels is one tunnel
   diameter. Because the tunnel construction was within an urban
   environment, there was considerable concern with ground loss and
   excessive surface settlements. This study demonstrates that within
   similar materials, a pillar width of 0.5 tunnel diameters sufficiently
   reduces the tunnel interactions and minimize the risk of damage to
   nearby structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The release of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) into the
   environment is a concern because it contains persistent organic
   pollutants that are toxic to aquatic life. A modified Ludzack-Ettinger
   membrane bioreactor (MLE-MBR) with a submerged ceramic membrane was
   continuously operated for 425 days to evaluate its feasibility on OSPW
   treatment. A stabilized biomass concentration of 3730 mg mixed liquor
   volatile suspended solids per litre and a naphthenic acid (NA) removal
   of 24.7\% were observed in the reactor after 361 days of operation.
   Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography/High Resolution Mass
   Spectrometry analysis revealed that the removal of individual NA species
   declined with increased ring numbers. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed
   that Betaproteobacteria were dominant in sludge samples from the
   MLE-MBR, with microorganisms such as Rhodocyclales and
   Sphingobacteriales capable of degrading hydrocarbon and aromatic
   compounds. During 425 days of continuous operation, no severe membrane
   fouling was observed as the transmembrane pressure (TMP) of the MLE-MBR
   never exceeded -20 kPa given that the manufacturer's suggested critical
   TMP for chemical cleaning is -35 kPa. Our results indicated that the
   proposed MLE-MBR has a good potential for removing recalcitrant organics

Title = {{Microstructure Evolution of Fine-Grained Heat-Affected Zone in Type IV
   Failure of P91 Welds}},
Journal = {{WELDING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27S-36S}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A microstructure analysis has been conducted on the fine-grained
   heat-affected zone (FGHAZ) of P91 welds that have undergone sequential
   thermomechanical histories: the as-welded (AW), after a postweld heat
   treatment, and after a creep rupture test. The Type IV failure is
   observed to have initiated by wedge-type cavities that coalesce to form
   an intergranular separation with a high local deformation at the outer
   edge of the FGHAZ. The ratio of the high-angle grain boundary (HAGB)
   frequency to low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) frequency in the FGHAZ
   increases from the as-welded 0.48 to the crept 1.06, resulting in an
   increased grain size from 1.2 mu m (AW) to 3.1 mu m (crept). The area
   fraction of the fully recrystallized ferrite grains increases from 14\%
   (AW) to 45\% (crept). Coarse, undissolved, Cr-rich M23C6-type carbides
   remain on prior austenite grain boundaries and packet/block boundaries
   after welding. V (C, N) and Nb (C, N) carbonitrides distribute at HAGBs.
   The MoC/MO2C and M7C3 precipitates form a grain boundary network that is
   believed to help the nucleation of cavities during creep. The kernel
   average misorientation (KAM) maps show the higher local strain level in
   the particle-containing grains. Straining variation of the
   particle-containing grains and particle-free grains in the crept FGHAZ
   can be traced back to the degree of austenitization in the welding
   thermal cycle. Creep deformation mismatch between fully recrystallized
   grains that are free of precipitates and the unrecrystallized grains
   that contain carbide particles seems to have contributed to nucleation
   of the initial creep cavities.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Our objective was to identify and evaluate the accuracy
   and precision (intrarater and interrater reliabilities) of various
   anatomic landmarks for use in 3-dimensional maxillary and mandibular
   regional superimpositions. Methods: We used cone-beam computed
   tomography reconstructions of 10 human dried skulls to locate 10
   landmarks in the maxilla and the mandible. Precision and accuracy were
   assessed with intrarater and interrater readings. Three examiners
   located these landmarks in the cone-beam computed tomography images 3
   times with readings scheduled at 1-week intervals. Three-dimensional
   coordinates were determined (x, y, and z coordinates), and the
   intraclass correlation coefficient was computed to determine intrarater
   and interrater reliabilities, as well as the mean error difference and
   confidence intervals for each measurement. Results: Bilateral mental
   foramina, bilateral infraorbital foramina, anterior nasal spine,
   incisive canal, and nasion showed the highest precision and accuracy in
   both intrarater and interrater reliabilities. Subspinale and bilateral
   lingulae had the lowest precision and accuracy in both intrarater and
   interrater reliabilities. Conclusions: When choosing the most accurate
   and precise landmarks for 3-dimensional cephalometric analysis or
   plane-derived maxillary and mandibular superimpositions, bilateral
   mental and infraorbital foramina, landmarks in the anterior region of
   the maxilla, and nasion appeared to be the best options of the analyzed
   landmarks. Caution is needed when using subspinale and bilateral
   lingulae because of their higher mean errors in location.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate statistical process monitoring involves dimension reduction
   and latent feature extraction in large-scale processes and typically
   incorporates all measured variables. However, involving variables
   without beneficial information may degrade monitoring performance. This
   study analyzes the effect of variable selection on principal component

   fault-relevant variable selection and Bayesian inference-based
   distributed method for efficient fault detection and isolation. First,
   the optimal subset of variables is identified for each fault using an
   optimization algorithm. Second, a sub-PCA model is established in each
   subset. Finally, the monitoring results of all of the subsets are
   combined through Bayesian inference. The proposed method reduces
   redundancy and complexity, explores numerous local behaviors, and
   provides accurate description of faults, thus improving monitoring
   performance significantly. Case studies on a numerical example, the
   Tennessee Eastman benchmark process, and an industrial-scale plant
   demonstrate the efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Different Earth observation resources (EORs) {[}e.g., satellites,
   airships, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)] are usually managed by
   different organization sub-planners, which lack interactions and
   cooperation among one another. Such independent resource operations are
   no longer efficient to meet diverse and vast observation requests,
   especially in emergency situations, such as earthquakes, flooding, and
   forest fire disasters. This paper addresses the issue of coordinated
   planning of heterogeneous EORs, including satellites, airships, and
   UAVs. A hierarchical coordinated planning architecture is proposed to
   integrate heterogeneous EORs for the construction of a distributed and
   loosely coupled Earth observation system. The architecture comprises
   four component categories, namely, observation resource, sub-planner,
   coordination, and information management. Moreover, we propose two task
   assignment algorithms to coordinate and allocate observation tasks to
   sub-planners. The first algorithm is a highest-weight-first-allocated
   algorithm, and the second is a tabu-list-based simulated annealing
   (SA-TL) algorithm. Experiments and comparative studies demonstrate the
   efficiency of the coordinated planning architecture and SA-TL algorithm.
   We also show that the system responds dynamically to unexpected
   situations through effective disturbance-handling mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Field scale modeling of CHOPS and solvent/thermal based post CHOPS EOR
   applications considering non-equilibrium foamy oil behavior and
   realistic representation of wormholes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{144-156}},

Abstract = {{Due to its lower cost, the cold heavy oil production with sands (CHOPS)
   method is a common primary production recovery technique, not only in
   Canada where it originated, but also in many other countries including
   Venezuela, Kuwait, Russia and China. However, this method has several
   practical limitations. It continuously changes the geo-mechanical and
   petro-physical properties of the reservoir due to the sand produced,
   resulting in high permeability channels known as wormholes. In addition,
   this method has a low oil recovery factor (5-15\%) and this entails
   further recovery techniques.
   Thermal methods after CHOPS are not usually favorable due to
   heterogeneity and reservoir instability. In addition to this, CHOPS
   wells are not completed for thermal (steam) operations. The CHOPS method
   is typically applied in thin formations in which heating by injected
   steam is characteristically inefficient. Solvent injection possesses
   similar problems caused by heterogeneity and cost. An option could be
   the hybrid application of steam/solvent. Assessment of this technique
   first requires a realistic modeling of the CHOPS process. Due to dynamic
   changes in reservoir properties, no valid model was available to
   accurately simulate field-scale CHOPS production.
   Our main focus in this paper is to present a quick workflow for CHOPS
   modeling to investigate efficient EOR/IOR methods after CHOPS. To
   achieve this, we first propose a partial-dual porosity approach coupled
   with algorithms for wormhole generation to create a realistic static
   reservoir model. After generating fractal wormhole patterns of different
   kinds using a diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) algorithm, they were
   introduced into a reservoir model. It is assumed that wormhole's
   properties are a function of its radius and can be controlled along its
   length and pattern, which facilitates the history matching process.
   Based on fractal analysis, novel upgridding procedures for wormhole
   network in partial dual porosity models were introduced. After
   validation of the models using data obtained from a field in Alberta,
   several preliminary post-CHOPS scenarios including thermal, solvent and
   thermal/solvent hybrid applications were simulated.
   The new modeling workflow, proposed and validated to model the CHOPS
   process with realistic wormholes representations along with a simple
   mathematical wormhole network growth model, are the primary
   contributions of this paper. Secondarily, hybrid steam/solvent
   applications were evaluated from technical and economics points of view
   using this validated static model and compared with the sole application
   of steam and solvent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of the oil sand deposits in Alberta Canada can only be
   extracted using in situ methods, mainly the Steam Assisted Gravity
   Drainage (SAGD). SAGD project consists of Central Processing Facility
   (CPF) and Surface Pad (SP) situated surface and Drainage Area (DA)
   consisting of multiple injector and producer well pairs situated
   subsurface. DA placement is crucial in ensuring that maximum amount of
   bitumen is extracted. In this work, an optimization framework is
   developed to plan the development of DAs. The first step aims to obtain
   a compact DAs arrangement by maximizing the amount of extractable
   bitumen. In the second step, a Mixed Integer Linear Optimization (MILP)
   model is developed to arrange the multiperiod development plan of the
   DAs. The proposed method is applied to a case study with multiple DAs
   for arrangement and the results demonstrate that the method can
   effectively generate a good DA layout and an economically optimal
   development plan that maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV). (C) 2015

Title = {{Value of transverse relaxometry difference methods for iron in human

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-59}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the brain iron dependence of transverse
   relaxation rate difference methods derived from spin echo and gradient
   echo measurements from two field strengths.
   Methods: Transverse relaxation rates R-2 and R-2{*}; were measured in
   human brain in 17 healthy subjects at 1.5 T and 4.7 T using multi-slice,
   multiecho spin echo and gradient echo sequences. R-2 quantification used
   stimulated echo compensation and R-2{*} quantification used linear
   background gradient correction at 4.7 T only. Subtraction of R-2 from
   R-2{*} within each field strength yielded (R) over dot(2), and R-2
   subtraction across fields yielded Field Dependent R-2 Increase (FDRI).
   All transverse relaxation measures were then correlated with published
   post-mortem iron concentrations using linear regression analysis.
   Regional differences were tested using paired t-tests. Phantom
   measurements of FDRI were also performed.
   Results: In deep grey matter, all transverse relaxation rates (R-2,
   R-2{*}, (R) over dot(2)) at both 1.5 land 4.7 T, and FDRI had moderate
   to strong correlations (r > 0.71, p < 0.0001) with estimated non-heme
   iron. The 4.7 T methods and FDRI had higher correlations (r > 0.9) than
   1.5 T measures. R-2, R-2{*}, R-2' at 4.7 T and FDRI had slopes 0.49,
   1.96, 1.48 and 0.33 {[}s(-1)/mg Fe/100 g wt. tissue] and intercepts
   14.40, 16.87, 2.47 and 3.21 {[}s(-1)] respectively. Even though FDRI
   yielded a zero intercept in phantom, in vivo FDRI was found to be
   ineffective at fully removing non-iron contributions and yielded a large
   intercept. The slope for (R) over dot(2) was 3.4 times greater at 4.7 T
   than 1.5 T. For white matter fiber tracts oriented predominantly
   perpendicular versus parallel to B-0, (R) over dot(2) increased by
   similar to 50\% at 4.7 T and similar to 30\% at 1.5 T, while R-2 and
   FDRI in white matter was insensitive to its orientation with respect to
   B-0.
   Conclusion: The transverse relaxation difference methods FDRI and (R)
   over dot(2) at 4.7 T had high correlations to predicted iron content
   similar to R-2 and R-2{*} at 4.7 T. Although (R) over dot(2) had smaller
   y-intercept with estimated iron concentration than FDRI, in white matter
   (R) over dot(2) demonstrated strongest dependence on fiber orientation
   with respect to B-0, These results suggest that for brain iron
   correlation, there is minimal value of transverse difference methods
   over a single R-2{*} measurement at highest available field, which was
   4.7 T. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A promising way of upgrading bitumen is de-asphalting with the
   subsequent partial oxidation of asphaltene. Sulfur, metals (V, Ni), and
   other minerals concentrated in the asphaltene are subjected to reactions
   at elevated temperatures in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres.
   Upon the cooling of the raw syngas, some of the particulate and
   condensable material deposit surfaces and ages.
   This paper discusses the subsequent deposition of layers on syngas
   cooler tubes. The-deposit consists of a corrosion layer of FeS, a
   condensation layer of Ni3S2, and subsequent fouling layers composed of
   V2O3 and Ni3S2. Firstly, the base metal is corroded by the H2S
   electrochemical attack with the simultaneous Ni3S2 condensation on the
   cold surface. With the increasing fouling thickness of the Ni3S2 layer,
   the surface temperature at the process side increases, causing the
   condensation process to come to a gradual stop. Then infusible nanometer
   size V2O3 particles with Ni3S2 are deposited upon this sticky and rough
   surface, forming an extremely thick composite fouling layer. A high
   resolution inspection of this layer shows three sub-layers with distinct
   morphologies: (i) a fully molten liquid dense layer of Ni3S2 with V2O3
   particles soaked below solidified into the smooth surface, (ii) very
   fine-grained (average particle size of 140 nm) spherical V2O3 particles
   embedded within a melting Ni3S2 sheet along with scale, where the spaces
   between the V2O3 particles are filled with Ni3S2, and (iii) a fire side
   sub-layer consisting primarily of spherical V2O3 particles wrapped by
   the condensed Ni3S2 glue and keeping the original morphology of the
   particles in the syngas. The paper discusses the mechanism in detail.

   based on ``what if{''} scenarios. This method facilitates the design of
   collision-free mobile crane operations for a large number of lifts in
   congested areas. The proposed methodology is established based on two
   types of interactive analyses: (1) rotation analysis to build 3D
   visualization for the motions of crane body configurations; and (2)
   spatial analysis to detect potential collision errors in order to design
   collision-free crane operations. The rotation analysis accounts for
   calculating the angles describing the orientations of mechanical
   elements in the crane system by reading the coordinates of the crane
   location and the pick and set points of the object (module) to be
   lifted. The spatial analysis is used to monitor and maintain sufficient
   clearances between existing obstacles and the crane body configurations
   in order to prevent potential collisions during crane operation design.
   The methodology is tested on a case study in order to illustrate its
   effectiveness. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{By taking advantage of cost-effective technology and elegant computing
   algorithms, turning invisibility into transparency provides field crews
   with peace of mind and substantially improves controllability and
   efficiency of construction operations. In current practice, the as-built
   information of a tunnel is generally collected as a separate effort
   after tunnel construction is completed, which requires special surveying
   expertise and incurs significant resources and time. The main
   contribution of this research lies in the formalization of a simple,
   computationally efficient computing approach that can be implemented as
   real-time analytics to determine the coordinates of the invisible tunnel
   invert point based on analyzing the visible tunnel boring machine (TBM)
   tracking points during tunnel-boring operations. In addition, Monte
   Carlo simulation is applied to characterize error propagation on the
   computing algorithm due to measurement errors of total station, which
   provides input data collection means for the computing approach. The
   practical feasibility of the proposed approach was evaluated by
   conducting field testing over six months on a 1-km-long and
   2.34-m-diameter drainage tunnel project in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Title = {{Resource Supply-Demand Matching Scheduling Approach for Construction
   Workface Planning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses a novel approach for resource-based scheduling that
   builds upon existing analytical models to achieve practical allocation
   of resources that are constrained by supply and demand. The approach
   facilitates workface planning to allocate work to individual craft
   persons. The main contribution of the work is advancement of the current
   scheduling practice of workface planning by (1) generalizing the
   resource supply-demand matching problem (RSDMP); and (2) formalizing the
   RSDMP scheduling approach for planning resource workflows which consists
   of (a) the mathematical model, (b) a two-stage optimization approach,
   and (c) innovative use of a resource-activity interaction table. The
   result is an optimum resource-constrained schedule providing the
   shortest project duration with the leanest resource supply. The optimum
   resource requirement is identified between the lower and upper bounds of
   the resource supply limit, thus ensuring the site's spatial and safety
   requirements. The optimum resource workflows of individual craft persons
   are presented to facilitate the project execution at the workface level.
   To illustrate the approach, an example adapted from a classic textbook
   is used. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a practical
   level, an oil refinery turnaround project including input data and
   relevant information prepared for workface planning is used. As a result
   of the RSDMP analysis, the optimum plan obtained is resource-loaded,
   practically feasible, and workface executable. (C) 2015 American Society

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The cervical spine sustains high rate complex loading modes during Motor
   Vehicle Crashes (MVCs) which may produce severe injuries accompanied
   with soft and/or hard tissue failure. Although previous numerical and
   experimental studies have provided insights on the cervical spine
   behavior under various loading scenarios, its response to complex impact
   loads and the resulting injury mechanisms are not fully understood. A
   validated Finite Element (FE) model of the ligamentous cervical C2-C3
   Functional Spinal Unit (FSU) was utilized to assess the spinal response
   to six combined impact loading modes; flexion-extension combined with
   compression and distraction, and lateral bending and axial rotation
   combined with distraction. The FE model used time and rate-dependent
   material laws which permit assessing bone fracture and ligament failure.
   Spinal load-sharing, stresses in the spinal components, intradiscal
   pressure (IDP) change in the nucleus as well as contact pressure in the
   facet joints were predicted. Bone and ligaments failure occurrence and
   initiation instants were investigated. Results showed that spinal
   load-sharing varied with loading modes. Lateral bending combined with
   distraction was the most critical loading mode as it increased stresses
   and strains significantly and produced failure in most of the spinal
   components compared to other modes. The facet joints and surrounding
   cancellous bone as well as ligaments particularly the capsular (CL) and
   flavum (FL) ligaments were the most vulnerable structures to rapid
   flexion-extension, axial rotation and lateral bending combined with
   distraction or compression. The excessive stress and strain resulted
   from these loading modes produced rupture of the CL and FL ligaments and
   failure in the cancellous bone. The detection of failure initiation as
   well as fracture assessment demonstrated the vulnerability of ligaments
   to tensile combined loads and the major contribution of the bony
   structures in resisting compressive combined loads. Findings of this
   study may potentially assist in the development of injury prevention and
   treatment strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sum fraction terms can approximate multi-variable functions on the basis
   of discrete observations, replacing a partial differential equation
   definition with polynomial elementary data relation descriptions.
   Artificial neural networks commonly transform the weighted sum of inputs
   to describe overall similarity relationships of trained and new testing
   input patterns. Differential polynomial neural networks form a new class
   of neural networks, which construct and solve an unknown general partial
   differential equation of a function of interest with selected
   substitution relative terms using non-linear multi-variable composite
   polynomials. The layers of the network generate simple and composite
   relative substitution terms whose convergent series combinations can
   describe partial dependent derivative changes of the input variables.
   This regression is based on trained generalized partial derivative data
   relations, decomposed into a multi-layer polynomial network structure.
   The sigmoidal function, commonly used as a nonlinear activation of
   artificial neurons, may transform some polynomial items together with
   the parameters with the aim to improve the polynomial derivative term
   series ability to approximate complicated periodic functions, as simple
   low order polynomials are not able to fully make up for the complete
   cycles. The similarity analysis facilitates substitutions for
   differential equations or can form dimensional units from data samples
   to describe real-world problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{131-138}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Heel formation on three activated carbon fiber cloths (ACFC10, ACFC15,
   and ACFC20, with increasing pore widths and volumes) was assessed after
   cyclic adsorption/resistive heating regeneration using
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB). Following regeneration at 288 degrees C,
   cumulative heel for ACFC10, ACFC15, and ACFC20 was 3.5 wt\%, 4.1 wt\%,
   and 4.2 wt\%, respectively. Adsorption capacity of ACFC10; however,
   dropped by 83\% compared to only 9\% and 5\% for ACFC15 and ACFC20,
   respectively. To prevent these capacity losses, regeneration temperature
   was increased to 400 degrees C. However, this increased cumulative heel
   and adsorption capacity losses to 3.7 wt\% and 93\% (ACFC10), 10.4 wt\%
   and 51\% (ACFC15), and 18.9 wt \% and 50\% (ACFC20), respectively. It is
   proposed that these observations results from carbon deposition due to
   thermal degradation of TMB during regeneration and rapid adsorbent
   heating. Increasing regeneration temperature enhances the endothermic
   decomposition processes, increasing heel buildup. Because the pores in
   ACFC10 are narrower-than in ACFC15 and ACFC20, even small amounts of
   heel obstruct ACFC10's pores, explaining its notably larger decrease in
   adsorption capacity. These results suggest that rapid heating could be
   associated with reduced adsorbent performance. Regeneration conditions
   could be optimized to allow fast desorption with minimal adsorbate
   decomposition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   methodology. The martensite and bainite fractions calculated using the
   presented methodology for all seven samples are in good agreement with
   the ones measured with quantitative metallography. Hot stage microscopy

   and larger graphitic disks. Scanning electron microscopy of fracture
   surfaces identifies the graphitic disks as fracture initiation sites.
   The size, orientation and number density of the graphitic disks are then
   quantified using image processing techniques. We use these defect

Title = {{AN ATOMIZER TO GENERATE MONODISPERSE DROPLETS FROM HIGH VAPOR PRESSURE

Abstract = {{This work describes an atomizer capable of generating monodisperse
   droplets of high vapor pressure liquids such as HFA227ea and HFA134a.
   This atomizer is expected to be a useful tool in future fundamental
   explorations of the mechanics of these highly dynamic aerosols.
   Hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) are the most common propellants in metered
   dose inhalers (MDIs), which are themselves the most common delivery
   method for pulmonary disease medications. As a result of the high vapor
   pressure of these fluids, generation of monodisperse droplets and their
   study are not possible with previously existing monodisperse atomizers
   due to fluid flashing when exposed to ambient conditions. The new
   atomizer uses a piezoelectric transducer to disintegrate the propellant
   jet, a cooling circuit with a low-temperature limit of -30 degrees C to
   reduce propellant vapor pressure, and a high-pressure feed system (up to
   2.7 MPa) to keep the propellant in the liquid phase, thereby avoiding
   flash atomization. In the current setup, the diameter of the generated
   droplets was monitored with a laser scattering system (using Fraunhofer
   diffraction theory) to optimize the operating parameters of the setup
   (for example, the actuation frequency and amplitude of the piezoelectric
   transducer). This monitoring system allowed for the measurement of
   droplet geometric diameter, spacing, and velocity. The capabilities of
   the atomizer for generating monodisperse droplets are demonstrated by a
   case study in which monodisperse dry particles of beclomethasone
   dipropionate (BDP) are generated using a solution of BDP, ethanol
   co-solvent, and HFA134a propellant.}},

Title = {{An efficient method for evaluating the effect of input parameters on the
   integrity of safety systems}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{111-123}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Safety systems are significant to reduce or prevent risk from
   potentially dangerous activities in industry. Probability of failure to
   perform its functions on demand (PFD) for safety system usually exhibits
   variation due to the epistemic uncertainty associated with various input
   parameters. This paper uses the complementary cumulative distribution
   function of the PFD to define the exceedance probability (EP) that the
   PFD of the system is larger than the designed value. Sensitivity
   analysis of safety system is further investigated, which focuses on the
   effect of the variance of an individual input parameter on the EP
   resulting from epistemic uncertainty associated with the input
   parameters. An available numerical technique called finite difference
   method is first employed to evaluate the effect, which requires
   extensive computational cost and needs to select a step size. To address
   these difficulties, this paper proposes an efficient simulation method
   to estimate the effect. The proposed method needs only an evaluation to
   estimate the effects corresponding to all input parameters. Two examples
   are used to demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain more
   accurate results with less computation time compared to reported
   methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation attempts to understand the corrosion fatigue crack
   propagation behavior of pipeline steels exposed to near-neutral pH
   environments. The fatigue loading was designed to simulate the
   underload-type variable amplitude pressure fluctuations found during
   pipeline operation. The effects of amplitudes (R ratios) of underload
   and minor cycles were investigated. It has been found from this
   investigation that the crack growth rate is enhanced significantly
   through load interaction of the variable amplitude fatigue. The
   acceleration factor is found to be up to 2.7 and 5.3 for tests in air
   and in the near-neutral pH solution, respectively. The crack growth rate
   decreases with R ratios of underload and minor cycles for tests both in
   air and in near-neutral pH environments. The latter could enhance crack
   propagation by a factor of up to 11, as compared with the crack growth
   rate in air. The critical R ratio of minor cycles at which the minor
   cycles do not contribute to crack propagation through load interaction
   was determined to be as high as 0.982, which is much lower than the
   threshold determined by constant amplitude fatigue. This critical R
   ratio could be utilized to demarcate stress corrosion cracking and
   corrosion fatigue, and should be incorporated as one of the design
   principles for components/structures subjected to variable amplitude
   cyclic loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Basal aquifer water is deep groundwater found at the bottom of
   geological formations, underlying bitumen-saturated sands. Some of the
   concerns associated with basal aquifer water at the Athabasca oil sands
   are the high concentrations of hardness-causing compounds, alkalinity,
   and total dissolved solids. The objective of this pilot-scale study was
   to treat basal aquifer water to a quality suitable for its reuse in the
   production of synthetic oil. To achieve zero-liquid discharge (ZLD)
   conditions, the treatment train included chemical oxidation, polymeric
   ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO), and
   evaporation-crystallization technologies. The results indicated that the
   UF unit was effective in removing solids, with UF filtrate turbidity
   averaging 2.0 NTU and silt density index averaging 0.9. Membrane
   autopsies indicated that iron was the primary foulant on the UF and RO
   membranes. Laboratory and pilot-scale tests on RO reject were conducted
   to determine the feasibility of ZLD crystallization. Due to the high
   amounts of calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate in the RO reject,
   softening of the feed was required to avoid scaling in the evaporator.
   Crystals produced throughout the testing were mainly sodium chloride.
   The results of this study indicated that the ZLD approach was effective
   in both producing freshwater and minimizing brine discharges. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{With the growing concerns in the scientific and health communities over
   increasing levels of antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptide
   bacteriocins have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional
   small molecule antibiotics. A substantial attention has recently focused
   on the utilization of bacteriocins in food preservation and health
   safety. Despite the fact that a large number of bacteriocins have been
   reported, only a few have been fully characterized and structurally
   elucidated. Since knowledge of the molecular structure is a key for
   understanding the mechanism of action and therapeutic effects of
   peptide, we centered our focus in this review on the structure-activity
   relationships of bacteriocins with a particular focus in seven
   bacteriocins, namely, nisin, microcin J25, microcin B17, microcin C,
   leucocin A, sakacin P, and pediocin PA-1. Significant structural changes
   responsible for the altered activity of the recent bacteriocin analogues

Title = {{The fate of fracturing water: A field and simulation study}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{282-294}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing of multi-lateral horizontal wells for shale gas
   production usually requires a great amount of water. Field data indicate
   that only a small fraction of the injected water can be recovered during
   the clean-up phase. Especially, when shale oil and gas wells undergo
   month-long shut-in periods after multi-stage fracturing processes. Field
   data also indicate that in some wells, such shut-in episodes
   surprisingly increase the oil and gas flow rate. However, the fate of
   non-recovered water in the reservoir and the reasons behind increased
   early-time oil and gas production after a long shut-in period are poorly
   understood.
   In this paper, we first interpret the flowback data of a 18-well pad
   completed in the Horn River Basin. Then, we use a numerical simulator to
   investigate the parameters controlling water and gas production during
   the flowback process. In the simulation model, the shale reservoir is
   represented by a fracturematrix model, where the fractures form a
   continuum of interconnected network. The simulation results show that
   the counter-current imbibition of fracturing water during the shut-in
   period can result in a significant gas build-up in the fractures and
   therefore increases early-time gas production rate. It was also
   concluded that early-time water and gas production depends on reservoir
   properties such as capillary pressure and complexity of created fracture
   network and operational parameters such as shut-in time. The gas
   production rates from reservoirs with higher capillary pressure is
   higher at the beginning of flowback process but the production rate
   falls later. The complexity of fracture network created during hydraulic
   fracturing process has a great effect on load recovery and gas
   production. As the complexity increases, the gas production rate
   increases and load recovery decreases due to higher contact surface
   created between fractures and shale matrices. Further, field data and
   simulation results show that extended shut-in period increases
   early-time gas production but it decreases load recovery and late-time
   gas production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An eigen-based transformation called Channel Components Transform (CCT)
   has been recently proposed for decoupling power networks. CCT has
   revealed many unique features in power system studies especially voltage
   stability analysis and monitoring. However, this method may face some
   difficulties in certain situations. The difficulties including the
   non-existence difficulty and the robustness difficulty are discussed in
   this paper. This paper will then show that by using the singular value
   decomposition instead of the eigen-decomposition, the difficulties can
   be effectively overcome. Therefore, a new transformation based on
   singular value decomposition is proposed. An algorithm is also presented
   which shows how the proposed transformation can be applied to voltage
   stability analysis. The proposed algorithm is verified by using several
   standard systems as case studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Detection of methane at room temperature using adsorption-based chemical
   sensing is a challenge since methane is inert and does not adsorb on
   surfaces. We demonstrate that nanomechanical photothermal spectroscopy
   is capable of detecting femtogram level physisorbed methane on a
   thermally sensitive microcantilever. Even though the residence time of
   methane is in sub nanoseconds, it is enough for a vibrationally excited
   methane molecule to transfer its energy to the cantilever through a
   non-radiative decay process. The variation of cantilever deflection as a
   function of excitation wavelength shows the characteristic vibrational
   spectrum of methane. Photothermal cantilever deflection spectroscopy,
   therefore, offers a powerful technique for chemical characterization of
   physisorbed molecules which are chemically inert. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{153-163}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Fouling of nanofiltration (NF) membranes by colloidal matter is a
   commonly encountered phenomenon, adversely influencing the permeate
   quality and membrane life. In this work, a transient electrokinetic
   model has been developed to predict the permeate flux and observed
   rejection of NF membranes in presence of colloidal particles. The cake
   layer is considered as a swarm of non-interacting, incompressible,
   spherical, charged particles and the structure is represented using the
   cell model approach. In the cell model a single particle and a
   representative volume of the fluid enclosing that particle is
   considered. The hydrodynamic drag exerted by the stationary colloidal
   cake layer is obtained by the Stokes-Einstein law and combined with
   Kuwabara cell model to account for the effect of neighboring particles.
   The transport of solvent around the charged particles distorts the ionic
   distribution causing the development of streaming potential and
   electroosmotic back flow. The model provides valuable insight into
   application of this phenomenon in colloidal fouling of membranes, in
   light of the classical Levine-Neale cell model of electrophoresis. This
   model is then coupled with film theory to appraise the permeate flux
   decline and salt rejection during the filtration processes. To validate
   the model, cross flow NF experiment was conducted with silica particles
   and sodium chloride solution over a wide range of operating conditions.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{685-688}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Naturally occurring zeolites are uniquely useful for small molecule
   separations due to the effective size of their pores. While the crystal
   structure of clinoptilolite has large 12-ring pores, the effective pore
   size of the zeolite excludes molecules larger than similar to 0.4 nm. In
   this work, the structure of a naturally occurring clinoptilolite was
   modified through ammonium exchange, calcination, and post-calcination
   steam treatment. The ammonium exchange removed some fraction of the
   structural cations, which caused the framework to expand, while steam
   treatment at 600 degrees C causes a contraction in the structure. The
   effective pore size of the modified clinoptilolite allowed it to adsorb
   ethylene and exclude ethane in a dynamic adsorption experiment. By
   incrementally changing the pore size of clinoptilolite, a new rate-based
   adsorbent for the adsorptive separation of ethylene from ethane was
   created. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the system consisting of phenetole (PNT) and
   4-tert-butylphenol (TBP) in methanol-water (63:37 v:v) on a Zorbax
   300SB-C18 column by characterising single component isotherms, by
   performing a large number of binary experiments of different types and
   by describing the experiments through simulations carried out using a
   novel, rather powerful competitive adsorption isotherm, that we call the
   generalized bi-Langmuir isotherm. This system is of great interest
   because it was previously reported to yield a new type of transition in
   nonlinear chromatography, the so-called delta-shock. Such transition had
   been discovered earlier through a theoretical analysis and confirmed by
   detailed simulations. The initial aim of this work was to reach a
   satisfactory agreement between delta-shock experiments and corresponding
   numerical simulations. In the course of this work however, a number of
   inconsistencies in the interpretation of the previous experimental
   results were highlighted and explained. This led to a new experimental
   campaign, which is reported here and has allowed to reach two important
   conclusions: (1) The binary system PNT-TBP mentioned above does not
   exhibit a delta-shock; the spike in the UV profile, which has previously
   been interpreted as an experimental evidence of the delta-shock, results
   from liquid-liquid phase separation within the chromatographic column.
   (2) The same system exhibits a rather peculiar behavior in breakthrough
   and displacement experiments, which could be well described using the
   generalized bi-Langmuir isotherm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, mesoporous cellular foams (MCFs) were synthesized and
   impregnated with different weight percentage of polyethylenimine (PEI)
   for post-combustion CO2 capture. The synthesized adsorbents were
   characterized using various techniques such as nitrogen
   adsorption/desorption SEM, TEM, and FTIR analysis. The CO2 adsorption
   capacity of PEI-impregnated MCFs was measured using thermogravimetric
   analyzer (TGA). The effects of PEI loadings, adsorption temperatures,
   and CO2 partial pressures on CO2 adsorption performance were studied. 70
   wt.\% PEI was found to be the optimum PEI loading in MCFs for
   post-combustion CO2 capture with higher CO2 adsorption capacity, higher
   amine efficiency and fast kinetics. The adsorbent with optimal PEI
   loading was tested for CO2 adsorption capacity, multi-cycle stability
   and adsorption/desorption kinetics. The CO2 adsorption capacity of about
   5.16 mmol/g in 95\% CO2/5\% N-2 gas mixture and 3.95 mmol/g in 10\%
   CO2/90\% N-2 gas mixture at 75 degrees C was observed. The CO2
   adsorption performance of PEI-impregnated MCFs improved in the presence
   of moisture, only at low adsorption temperatures. The adsorbent with
   optimum PEI loading was also tested for multi-cycle stability and
   adsorption/desorption kinetics in both humid and dry conditions. A good
   thermal stability of adsorbent and no degradation in CO2 adsorption
   capacity was observed in multi-cycle tests. Fractional-order kinetic
   model was found to be the best fitted to describe the adsorption
   behavior of PEI-impregnated MCFs for CO2 capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Random copolymers based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) containing
   2-aminoethyl methacrylamide hydrochloride (AEMA) and
   5-methacrylamido-1,2-benzoboroxole (MAAmBo) were synthesized and
   subsequently evaluated for their performance in solid-liquid separation
   at various pH and temperatures. The strong interactions between
   benzoboroxole residues and kaolin hydroxyl groups were evaluated for the
   first time in the flocculation of fine particle suspensions. The lower
   critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) of PAMN decreases because of the
   hydrophobic nature of the benzoboroxole moieties, resulting in strong
   hydrophobic interaction at temperatures higher than the LCSTs.
   Temperature and pH responsive polymer,
   P(AEMA(51)-st-MAAmBo(76)-st-NIPAM(381)) (denoted as PAMN) shows the
   ability to induce fastest settling at a low dosage of 25 ppm and under
   the condition of pH 9 and 50 degrees C. The accelerated settling rate is
   considered to be due to the strong adhesion of benzoboroxole residues to
   the kaolin hydroxyl groups, the electrical double layer force, and the
   hydrophobic force. During condensation phase, increasing the pH of
   sediment to pH 11 could attain the most compact structure. Random
   copolymers containing benzoboroxole groups act as dispersants (due to
   pH-responsive character) rather than flocculants at pH 11, providing
   repulsive force that enables particles to rearrange their position and
   consolidate well. Through a two-step solid-liquid separation including
   settling phase and consolidation phase, rapid settling and compact
   sediment are feasible simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural inhomogeneity generally deteriorates the corrosion
   resistance of materials due to the galvanic effect and interfacial
   issues. However, the situation may change for nanostructured materials.
   This article reports our studies on the corrosion behavior of SiC
   nanoparticle-reinforced Al6061 matrix composite. It was observed that
   the corrosion resistance of Al6061 increased when SiC nanoparticles were
   added. Overall electron work function (EWF) of the Al-SiC nanocomposite
   increased, along with an increase in the corrosion potential. The
   electron localization function of the Al-SiC nanocomposite was
   calculated and the results revealed that valence electrons were
   localized in the region of SiC-Al interface, resulting in an increase in
   the overall work function and thus building a higher barrier to hinder
   electrons in the nano-composite to participate in corrosion reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The hot deformation characteristics of an as-extruded ZM31 (Mg-Zn-Mn)
   magnesium alloy with an addition of 3.2 wt.\% Y, namely ZM31 + 32Y, have
   been studied via isothermal compression testing in a temperature range
   of 300-400 degrees C and a strain rate range of 0.001-1 s(-1). A
   constitutive model based on hyperbolic-sine equation along with
   processing maps was used to describe the dependence of flow stress on
   the strain, strain rate, and deformation temperature. The flow stress
   was observed to decrease with increasing deformation temperature and
   decreasing strain rate. The deformation activation energy of this alloy
   was obtained to be 241 kl/mol. The processing maps at true strains of
   0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 were generated to determine the region of hot
   workability of the alloy, with the optimum hot working parameters being
   identified as deformation temperatures of 340-500 degrees C and strain
   rates of 0.001-0.03 s(-1). EBSD examinations revealed that the dynamic
   recrystallization occurred more extensively and the volume fraction of
   dynamic recrystallization increased with increasing deformation
   temperature. The role of element Y and second-phase particles (I- and
   W-phases) during hot compressive deformation was discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Large-scale separation cells, used in primary extraction in the oil
   sands industry, are integral parts of the overall process of bitumen
   extraction. Good regulation of the interface level between the bitumen
   froth and the middlings in these cells can result in a significant
   improvement in bitumen recovery and throughput and heavily influence
   process economics. This paper details a case study application of
   identification and design of a model based predictive controller for the
   separation cell process. Internal model control (IMC) and model
   predictive control (MPC) schemes using linear models are designed and
   implemented in real time on the industrial separation cell The
   industrial implementation result shows that both IMC and MPC schemes
   provide significant benefits over the current operations which use a PID
   controller. The benefits include significant reduction in the variance
   of the interface level and underflow pump movement, resulting in higher
   bitumen recovery, smoother operations downstream and pump energy
   savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) films were fabricated using
   acetic acid as an alternative to common solvents such as chloroform. The

   mechanical properties and surface morphology of the films cast at
   different temperatures were characterized and compared to PHB films cast
   using chloroform as a solvent. Results revealed that the properties of
   the PHB film varied considerably with solvent casting temperature. In
   general, samples processed with acetic acid at low temperatures had
   comparable mechanical properties to PHB cast using chloroform. This

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Steam injection is an integral and a crucial element of the
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process that has emerged as a
   leading technology to recover heavy crude oil from oil sands. In this
   contribution, we have developed a simulation algorithm for an unsteady
   state nonisothermal two-phase wellbore model to predict the downward
   flow of a wet steam. This numeric model is reconstructed by
   incorporating the mass and energy conservation equations, and a pressure
   drop relationship, along with a couple of algebraic
   equations/correlations. A drift-flux model is used to consider the
   slipping occurred between the phases inside the wellbore. Further, the
   existence of four flow regimes in the wellbore is also taken into
   account. This dynamic wellbore flow model is attempted to simulate by
   developing a numerical algorithm. Furthermore, an analytical expression
   for wellbore pressure is determined to derive a semi-analytic model.
   Formulating a computer-assisted simulation algorithm for this, it is
   shown that the semi-analytic model offers a reduced complexity and
   computational time over the numeric model. A series of numerical and
   analytical results are presented to validate the wellbore models against
   the real field data. Subsequently, both the models are extended to
   predict the transient behavior of the steam injection system. It is
   investigated that both the solution methods provide similar results. (C)

Abstract = {{A reconstruction methodology based on different-phase-neighbor (DPN)
   pixel swapping and multigrid hierarchical annealing is presented. The
   method performs reconstructions by starting at a coarse image and
   successively refining it. TheDPNinformation is used at each refinement
   stage to freeze interior pixels of preformed structures. This preserves
   the large-scale structures in refined images and also reduces the number
   of pixels to be swapped, thereby resulting in a decrease in the
   necessary computational time to reach a solution. Compared to
   conventional single-grid simulated annealing, this method was found to
   reduce the required computation time to achieve a reconstruction by
   around a factor of 70-90, with the potential of even higher speedups for
   larger reconstructions. The method is able to perform medium sized (up
   to 300(3) voxels) three-dimensional reconstructions with multiple
   correlation functions in 36-47 h.}},

Title = {{Contribution of human and climate change impacts to changes in
   streamflow of Canada}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Climate change exerts great influence on streamflow by changing
   precipitation, temperature, snowpack and potential evapotranspiration
   (PET), while human activities in a watershed can directly alter the
   runoff production and indirectly through affecting climatic variables.
   However, to separate contribution of anthropogenic and natural drivers
   to observed changes in streamflow is non-trivial. Here we estimated the
   direct influence of human activities and climate change effect to
   changes of the mean annual streamflow (MAS) of 96 Canadian watersheds
   based on the elasticity of streamflow in relation to precipitation, PET
   and human impacts such as land use and cover change. Elasticities of
   streamflow for each watershed are analytically derived using the Budyko
   Framework. We found that climate change generally caused an increase in
   MAS, while human impacts generally a decrease in MAS and such impact
   tends to become more severe with time, even though there are exceptions.
   Higher proportions of human contribution, compared to that of climate
   change contribution, resulted in generally decreased streamflow of
   Canada observed in recent decades. Furthermore, if without contributions
   from retreating glaciers to streamflow, human impact would have resulted
   in a more severe decrease in Canadian streamflow.}},

Title = {{Detection of Heart Sounds in Children with and without Pulmonary
   Arterial Hypertension-Daubechies Wavelets Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Automatic detection of the 1st (S1) and 2nd (S2) heart sounds is
   difficult, and existing algorithms are imprecise. We sought to develop a
   wavelet-based algorithm for the detection of S1 and S2 in children with
   and without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
   Method
   Heart sounds were recorded at the second left intercostal space and the
   cardiac apex with a digital stethoscope simultaneously with pulmonary
   arterial pressure (PAP). We developed a Daubechies wavelet algorithm for
   the automatic detection of S1 and S2 using the wavelet coefficient `D-6'
   based on power spectral analysis. We compared our algorithm with four
   other Daubechies wavelet-based algorithms published by Liang, Kumar,
   Wang, and Zhong. We annotated S1 and S2 from an audiovisual examination
   of the phonocardiographic tracing by two trained cardiologists and the
   observation that in all subjects systole was shorter than diastole.
   Results
   We studied 22 subjects (9 males and 13 females, median age 6 years,
   range 0.25-19). Eleven subjects had a mean PAP < 25 mmHg. Eleven
   subjects had PAH with a mean PAP >= 25 mmHg. All subjects had a
   pulmonary artery wedge pressure <= 15 mmHg. The sensitivity (SE) and
   positive predictivity (+P) of our algorithm were 70\% and 68\%,
   respectively. In comparison, the SE and +P of Liang were 59\% and 42\%,
   Kumar 19\% and 12\%, Wang 50\% and 45\%, and Zhong 43\% and 53\%,
   respectively. Our algorithm demonstrated robustness and outperformed the
   other methods up to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB. For all
   algorithms, detection errors arose from low-amplitude peaks, fast heart
   rates, low signal-to-noise ratio, and fixed thresholds.
   Conclusion
   Our algorithm for the detection of S1 and S2 improves the performance of
   existing Daubechies-based algorithms and justifies the use of the
   wavelet coefficient `D-6' through power spectral analysis. Also, the
   robustness despite ambient noise may improve real world clinical
   performance.}},

   enhanced with an increase in the Ni concentration, corresponding to an
   increase in EWF. However, an opposite trend was observed during sliding

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that vibrations created by the pulmonary circulation
   would create sound like the vocal cords during speech and that subjects
   with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) might have a unique sound
   signature. We recorded heart sounds at the cardiac apex and the second
   left intercostal space (2LICS), using a digital stethoscope, from 27
   subjects (12 males) with a median age of 7 years (range: 3 months-19
   years) undergoing simultaneous cardiac catheterization. Thirteen
   subjects had mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAp) < 25 mmHg (range:
   8-24 mmHg). Fourteen subjects had mPAp >= 25 mmHg (range: 25-97 mmHg).
   We extracted the relative power of the frequency band, the entropy, and
   the energy of the sinusoid formants from the heart sounds. We applied
   linear discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross validation to
   differentiate children with and without PAH. The significance of the
   results was determined with a t test and a rank-sum test. The entropy of
   the first sinusoid formant contained within an optimized window length
   of 2 seconds of the heart sounds recorded at the 2LICS was significantly
   lower in subjects with mPAp >= 25 mmHg relative to subjects with mPAp <
   25 mmHg, with a sensitivity of 93\% and specificity of 92\%. The reduced
   entropy of the first sinusoid formant of the heart sounds in children
   with PAH suggests the existence of an organized pattern. The analysis of
   this pattern revealed a unique sound signature, which could be applied
   to a noninvasive method to diagnose PAH.}},

Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Analyzing before-after speed data is often limited to a standard
   comparison of various speed parameters. Although a few studies have used
   a model-based approach, various limitations exist in terms of both data
   and methodology. The aim of this paper was to examine the applicability
   of using multilevel models to analyze before-after speed data and to
   explore the effect of various temporal, geometrical, and traffic
   characteristics on traffic speed in an urban residential context. Two
   multilevel models, one with homogeneous and one with heterogeneous
   within-site variance, were used for analyzing the hourly free-flow speed
   data. The study used a dataset collected before and after a posted speed
   limit (PSL) reduction from 50 km/h to 40 km/h; the reduction was a pilot
   program in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The results
   demonstrated the appropriateness of using the multilevel model for
   analyzing speed data. Moreover, the heterogeneous within site variance
   model outperformed the homogeneous counterpart in terms of goodness-of
   fit and the precision of parameter estimates. The parameter estimations
   demonstrated intuitive findings with respect to the effect of various
   factors on mean free-flow speed. In general, the evaluation results
   showed that the mean free-flow speed was reduced by 4.6 km/h in the
   after period, when the multilevel model with heterogeneous within-site
   variances was used. The use of the multilevel model with homogeneous
   within-site variances slightly underestimated the mean free-flow speed
   reduction. A separate investigation revealed that the mean free-flow
   speed was reduced by 5.3 km/h and 4.0 km/h for local and collector
   roads, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Falls among older adults are a growing concern in today's
   society, and poor design of the home environment is likely to have a
   detrimental effect on the risk of falling. The aim of the study is to
   identify bathroom design alternatives that affect the risk of falling
   for older adults.
   Methods: Literature sources such as Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Abstract in
   Social Gerontology, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library are searched up
   to August 2014, and papers that meet inclusive criteria of participants
   65 years and over, randomized controlled trial (RCT),
   quasi-experimental, and non-experimental descriptive studies are
   included. Nine papers are found to meet these inclusive criteria.
   Results: Most studies are found to have been carried out in the USA,
   Canada, and Australia. Studies are classified based on the major design
   components of bathrooms: toilet, bathtub, lighting, and flooring.
   Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge this is the first systematic
   review on this topic. An interdisciplinary framework for the concept of
   geriatric design is identified and implemented on the bathroom design.
   Results show the possibility of generating various evidence-based design
   scenarios that are associated with less risk of falling for older
   adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS and European Union Geriatric

Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{80-90}},

Abstract = {{Mine planning for oil sands involves the integration of waste management
   into the long term production planning process. This ensures that while
   ore is provided for the processing plant, sufficient in-pit tailings
   containment areas are made available as dedicated disposal areas for
   backfilling. This enables the creation of a trafficable landscape at the
   earliest opportunity to facilitate progressive reclamation. Apart from
   being a regulatory requirement, this integration impacts directly on the
   profitability and sustainability of oil sands mining operations. This
   paper introduces a mixed integer linear programming mine planning
   framework that seeks to simultaneously determine the production
   schedule, dyke construction schedule and the backfilling schedule.
   Different waste management strategies were also investigated. The model
   generated a practical, smooth and uniform schedule for ore, dyke
   material and backfilling activities. The results show that for the case
   studies considered, increasing the number of in-pit tailings cells
   reduces the net present value of the mine as a result of a reduced
   operational flexibility. However, this strategy makes in-pit tailings
   storage areas available earlier in the mine life, and ensures an
   efficient use of in-pit storage areas required for sustainable
   operations.}},

   Application to Multiple Sclerosis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate subcortical gray matter segmentation using
   transverse relaxation rate (R-2{*}) and quantitative susceptibility
   mapping (QSM) and apply it to voxel-based analysis in multiple sclerosis
   (MS).
   Materials and Methods: Voxel-based variation in R-2{*} and QSM within
   deep gray matter was examined and compared to standard whole-structure
   analysis using 37 MS subjects and 37 matched controls. Deep gray matter
   nuclei (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus) were
   automatically segmented and morphed onto a custom atlas based on QSM and
   standard T-1-weighted images. Segmentation accuracy and scan-rescan
   reliability were tested.
   Results: When considering only significant regions as returned by the
   multivariate voxel-based analysis, increased R-2{*} and QSM was found in
   MS subjects compared to controls in portions of all four nuclei studied
   (P < 0.002). For R-2{*}, regional analysis yielded at least 66-fold
   improved P-value significance in all nuclei over standard
   whole-structure analysis, while for QSM only thalamus benefited, with
   5-fold improvement in significance. Improved segmentation over standard
   methods, particularly for globus pallidus (2.8 times higher Dice score),
   was achieved by incorporating high-contrast QSM into the atlas.
   Voxel-based reliability was highest for QSM (< 1\% variation).
   Conclusion: Automatic segmentation of iron-rich deep gray matter can be
   improved by incorporating QSM. Voxel-based evaluation yielded increased
   R-2{*} and QSM in MS subjects in all four nuclei studied with R-2{*},
   benefiting the most from localized analysis over whole-structure
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, algorithms inspired by nature have matured
   into a widely used class of computing methods. They have shown the
   ability to adjust to variety of conditions, and have been frequently
   employed for solving complex, real-world optimization problems. They are
   especially suitable for problems that require adaptation, and that
   involve optimization of complex, distributed systems, operating in
   dynamic environments. Among other application domains, nature-inspired
   methods have been extensively used in the areas of networking in
   general, and wireless sensor networks in particular. Energy management
   and network lifetime optinlization are two great research and
   implementation challenges for wireless sensor networks. Duty cycle
   management, synchronization, and wake-up scheduling are complementary
   approaches that facilitate this complex optimization process. This
   review focuses on the intersection of nature-inspired computing and
   wake-up scheduling algorithms for wireless sensor networks. It describes
   the state-of-the-art in these fields and provides an up-to-date review
   of the most recent developments in this interdisciplinary domain. It
   discusses the motivation for using nature-inspired methods for wake-up
   scheduling, and presents related open issues and research challenges.

   edges is not the major source of a high axial ratio (AR) at grazing
   angles, which opposes presently accepted theory. It is shown that the AR
   problem originates in the different theta dependence of the intrinsic
   field components E-theta and E-phi. The use of a three-layer-tapered FSS
   in close proximity to the patch modifies E-theta and results in an
   acceptable AR for angles close to 90 degrees. An AR better than 2 dB is
   achieved at angles beyond the horizon (theta= 90 degrees) and in all
   planes at the GPS L1 frequency band (f = 1.575 GHz). This solution
   outperforms the techniques in literature in terms of profile, diameter,
   performance, and simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Develop an MRI method to estimate skeletal muscle oxygen
   consumption (VO2) with dynamic exercise using simultaneous measurement
   of venous blood flow (VBF) and venous oxygen saturation (SvO(2)).
   Methods: Real-time imaging of femoral VBF using a complex-difference
   method was interleaved with imaging of venous hemoglobin oxygen
   saturation (SvO(2)) using magnetic susceptometry to estimate muscle VO2
   (Fick principle). Nine healthy subjects performed repeated 5-watt
   knee-extension (quadriceps) exercise within the bore of a 1.5 Tesla MRI
   scanner, for test/re-test comparison. VBF, SvO(2), and derived VO2 were
   estimated at baseline and immediately (<1 s) postexercise and every 2.4
   s for 4 min.
   Results: Quadriceps muscle mass was 2.43 +/- 0.31 kg. Mean baseline
   values were VBF = 0.1360.06 L/min/kg, SvO(2) = 69.4 +/- 10.1\%, and VO2
   = 6.8 +/- 4.1 mL/min/kg. VBF, SvO(2), and VO2 values from peak exercise
   had good agreement between trials (VBF = 0.9 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1
   L/min/kg, R-2 = 0.83, CV = 7.6\%; SvO(2) = 43.2 +/- 13.5 versus 40.9 +/-
   13.1\%, R-2 = 0.88, CV = 15.6\%; VO2 = 95.7 +/- 18.0 versus 108.9 +/-
   17.3 mL/min/kg, R-2 = 0.88, CV = 12.3\%), as did the VO2 recovery time
   constant (26.1 +/- 3.5 versus 26.0 +/- 4.0 s, R-2 = 0.85, CV = 6.0\%).
   CV = coefficient of variation.
   Conclusion: Rapid imaging of VBF and SvO(2) for the estimation of whole
   muscle VO2 is compatible with dynamic exercise for the estimation of
   peak values and recovery dynamics following exercise with good
   reproducibility. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation of bacteria and their initial adhesion to silica surfaces
   are affected greatly by solution chemistry, particularly pH and ionic
   strength (IS). The effects of pH and IS on the aggregation and
   deposition of Escherichia coli K12 on silica surfaces were investigated
   in NaCl solutions at variable pH and IS, and in the absence and presence
   of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). In the presence of CNC, bacterial
   aggregation was generally enhanced as the pH was increased from 3.5 to
   neutral at a given IS (10 mM). At a given pH (7.2), bacterial
   aggregation was highest at 10 mM as the IS was increased from I mM to 50
   mM. The contribution of DLVO interaction and depletion interaction to
   bacterial aggregation in the bacteria and CNC system was compared. The
   results indicate that at pH ranging from 5.2 to 7.2 and IS ranging from
   10 mM to 50 mM conditions, depletion attraction is the dominant
   mechanism for CNC induced bacterial aggregation. The lower bacterial
   deposition rates observed at 10 mM IS and pH 7.2 compared with other
   conditions were mainly attributed to the aggregation of bacteria which
   could result in decreased convective-diffusive transport to the silica
   surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Relay selection strategies help to improve spectral and energy
   efficiencies, to enhance transmission robustness, or to reduce latency
   in multi-relay cooperative networks. Two novel relay selection
   strategies are proposed and analyzed here for multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks
   (TWRNs) with spatial multiplexing. Specifically, they are designed to
   maximize the effective end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and
   thereby minimize the overall outage probability or maximize the
   achievable sum rate. Interestingly, the first strategy amounts to
   maximizing the minimum of the eigenvalues of the Wishart matrices from
   the selected relay to the two user nodes. Counter-intuitively, the
   latter strategy amounts to maximizing the minimum of the determinant of
   the same Wishart matrices. The performance of these two strategies is
   investigated by deriving lower/upper bounds of the overall outage
   probability and the average sum rate approximations in closed form.
   Further, the asymptotic high-SNR approximations of the outage
   probability are derived, and thereby, the achievable
   diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is quantified. This tradeoff reveals
   that whenever the sum of relay antennas is fixed, the achievable
   diversity order is always a constant, and hence, the multiplexing gain
   can indeed be improved by equally distributing antennas among the
   available set of relays. Our results reveal that relay selection indeed
   significantly alleviates the inherent diversity-gain loss associated
   with the use of available degrees of freedom for spatial multiplexing.}},

Abstract = {{A relay network in which a source wishes to convey a confidential
   message to a legitimate destination with the assistance of trusted
   relays is considered. In particular, cooperative beamforming and user
   selection techniques are applied to protect the confidential message.
   The secrecy rate (SR) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the
   network are investigated first, and a tight upper bound for the SR and
   an exact formula for the SOP are derived. Next, asymptotic
   approximations for the SR and SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) regime are derived for two different schemes: 1) cooperative
   beamforming and 2) multiuser selection. Furthermore, a new concept of
   cooperative diversity gain, namely, adapted cooperative diversity gain
   (ACDG), which can be used to evaluate the security level of a
   cooperative relaying network, is investigated. It is shown that the ACDG
   of cooperative beamforming is equal to the conventional cooperative
   diversity gain of traditional multiple-input single-output networks,
   while the ACDG of the multiuser scenario is equal to that of traditional
   single-input multiple-output networks.}},

Abstract = {{A full-duplex (FD) multiple antenna access point (AP) communicating with
   single antenna half-duplex (HD) spatially random users to support
   simultaneous uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) transmissions is investigated.
   Since FD nodes are inherently constrained by the loopback interference
   (LI), we study precoding schemes for the AP based on maximum ratio
   combining (MRC)/maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing, and the
   optimal scheme for UL and DL sum rate maximization using tools from
   stochastic geometry. In order to shed insights into the systems
   performance, simple expressions for single antenna/perfect LI
   cancellation/negligible internode interference cases are also presented.
   We show that FD precoding at AP improves the UL/DL sum rate and hence a
   doubling of the performance of the HD mode is achievable. In particular,
   our results show that these impressive performance gains remain
   substantially intact even if the LI cancellation is imperfect.
   Furthermore, relative performance gap between FD and HD modes increases
   as the number of transmit/receive antennas becomes large, while with the
   MRC/MRT scheme, increasing the receive antenna number at FD AP, is more
   beneficial in terms of sum rate than increasing the transmit antenna
   number.}},

Abstract = {{Ring-opening conversion of multinuclear aromatics can be used to upgrade
   heavy aromatic oils to lighter products, and it is usually performed
   reductively with H-2. Oxidative ring-opening is an alternative strategy
   that involves three steps: (i) oxidation of multinuclear aromatics to
   quinonoids, (ii) further oxidation and ring-opening, to produce aromatic
   carboxylic acids, and (iii) decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic
   acids. In the last step, decomposition by ketonization is an undesirable
   side reaction that leads to a ring-closed product. Selectivity control
   during aromatic carboxylic acid decomposition was investigated using
   biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid, biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid, zinc(II)
   biphenyl-2-carboxylate, and zinc(II) biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The
   reaction networks of thermal decomposition of the aromatic carboxylic
   acids were determined. Decomposition of biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid took
   place mainly by decarboxylation to produce biphenyl; dehydration and
   ring-closure to produce fluorenone, and the formation of diphenic
   anhydride as intermediate product leading to fluorenone. Decomposition
   of biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic add proceeded through decarboxylation to
   biphenyl-2-tarboxylic acid as intermediate, as well as two seemingly
   related pathways, leading to the formation of a hydroxy-fluorenone and a
   cyclic trione. Over the temperature range from 340 degrees C to 400
   degrees C, thermal decomposition invariably resulted in a higher
   ketonization than decarboxylation selectivity. Decomposition of the
   analogous zinc carboxylates demonstrated that ketonization could be
   suppressed and the most abundant products were biphenyl > fluorenone >
   fluorene. It was possible to achieve a biphenyl (decarboxylation) to
   fluorenone (ketonization) selectivity ratio of 17:1 during batch reactor
   decomposition of zinc(II) biphenyl, 2,2Cdicarboxylate at 380 degrees C.
   Reaction. stoichiometry indicated that water should affect selectivity,
   which is consistent With observations in the literature, but this aspect
   was not investigated further.}},

Abstract = {{Brominated carbon injection is a commonly applied technology for capture
   of mercury in flue gases emitted from coal-fired power plants. However,
   a previous study has shown leaching potential Of mercury (Hg) and
   bromine (Br) from brominated carbon sorbents, with recommendations to
   reduce Br concentration in the sorbents. To reduce the Br content
   required on the sorbent, a strategy of coimpregnation of sulfur and Br
   was employed in this study. Sulfur (S) loading was found to increase the
   mercury uptake by the sorbent, with the maximum uptake occurring at a
   S:Sorbent mass ratio of 1:20 Co-loading of a low concentration of
   bromine (0.7-0.9\%), to the sulfur-loaded sample further improved
   mercury,capture by the Sorbein and appeared to have a synergistic
   effect-on Hg removal. Leaching tests confirmed that combining both Br
   and S onto the sorbent reduced the leaching potential of Er and Hg from
   the spent sorbent material. In addition, analysis of Hg X-ray absorption
   spectra (XAS) revealed a mixed Hg-Br, Hg-S, and Hg-C binding environment
   on the sorbent coimpregnated with bromine and sulfur.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the fault-tolerant shape control (FTSC) problem
   for stochastic distribution systems. For this problem, in addition to
   measurable input signals, it is assumed that the distribution function
   of the system output can be evaluated so that it is available. It is
   also assumed that the system is subject to actuator faults. In this
   case, the main control objective is for the output of the stochastic
   distribution system to track a given target distribution even in the
   presence of actuator faults. By estimating these actuator faults, an
   effective FTSC strategy is proposed, which consists of a normal control
   law and an adaptive compensation control law. The former can track the
   given output distribution with an optimized performance index in the
   fault-free case, while the latter can automatically reduce (or even
   eliminate) the adverse effects caused by the actuator faults. The
   proposed method can be applied to tracking control of output probability
   density functions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   scheme, simulation is performed on one numerical example with
   satisfactory results obtained. In addition, a practical example of soil
   particle gradation control in geotechnical applications is given in this
   paper, and the results show that the proposed fault-tolerant scheme is
   applicable to practical particle size distribution control.}},

Title = {{Robust Isenthalpic Flash for Multiphase Water/Hydrocarbon Mixtures}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1350-1365}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Robust isenthalpic flash is important in compositional simulation of
   steam injection, which involves at least three phases-oleic, gaseous,
   and aqueous. However, multiphase isenthalpic flash is challenging
   because the total enthalpy can be substantially nonlinear, or even
   discontinuous, with respect to temperature. This type of phase behavior
   is referred to as narrow-boiling behavior in the literature.
   This paper presents robust isenthalpic flash for multiphase
   water-containing hydrocarbon mixtures. The algorithm developed is based
   on the direct substitution (DS) presented in our previous research for
   two phases. A detailed analysis is given for narrow-boiling behavior and
   its effects on the DS algorithm. A new method is also presented for
   K-value estimates for three phases for water-hydrocarbon mixtures. The
   thermodynamic model used is the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the
   van der Waals mixing rules.
   The narrow-boiling behavior in isenthalpic flash occurs when a small
   temperature change yields significant changes of equilibrium-phase
   compositions relative to the overall composition. The system of
   equations used in the DS algorithm becomes degenerate for narrow-boiling
   fluids. The multiphase DS algorithm developed in this paper adaptively
   switches between Newton's iteration step and the bisection step
   depending on the Jacobian condition number. The bisection algorithm
   solves for temperature, based solely on the enthalpy constraint only
   when narrow-boiling behavior is identified. The algorithm is tested with
   a number of different isenthalpic flash calculations for three and four
   phases formed by water-containing hydrocarbon mixtures at elevated
   temperatures. Results show the robustness of the algorithm for
   narrow-boiling fluids, including the cases with one degree of freedom.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveAlthough altered large-scale brain network organization in
   patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has been shown using
   morphologic measurements such as cortical thickness, these studies, have
   not included critical subcortical structures (such as hippocampus and
   amygdala) and have had relatively small sample sizes. Here, we
   investigated differences in topological organization of the brain
   volumetric networks between patients with right TLE (RTLE) and left TLE
   (LTLE) with unilateral hippocampal atrophy.
   MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional analysis of 86 LTLE patients, 70
   RTLE patients, and 116 controls. RTLE and LTLE groups were balanced for
   gender (p = 0.64), seizure frequency (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.94),
   age (p = 0.39), age of seizure onset (p = 0.21), and duration of disease
   (p = 0.69). Brain networks were constructed by thresholding correlation
   matrices of volumes from 80 cortical/subcortical regions (parcellated
   with Freesurfer v5.3 ) that were then analyzed using graph theoretical
   approaches.
   ResultsWe identified reduced cortical/subcortical connectivity including
   bilateral hippocampus in both TLE groups, with the most significant
   interregional correlation increases occurring within the limbic system
   in LTLE and contralateral hemisphere in RTLE. Both TLE groups
   demonstrated less optimal topological organization, with decreased
   global efficiency and increased local efficiency and clustering
   coefficient. LTLE also displayed a more pronounced network disruption.
   Contrary to controls, hub nodes in both TLE groups were not distributed
   across whole brain, but rather found primarily in the paralimbic/limbic
   and temporal association cortices. Regions with increased centrality
   were concentrated in occipital lobes for LTLE and contralateral
   limbic/temporal areas for RTLE.
   SignificanceThese findings provide first evidence of altered topological
   organization of the whole brain volumetric network in TLE, with
   disruption of the coordinated patterns of cortical/subcortical
   morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Storage allocation, meaning the way that a chunk of data is stored over
   a set of storage nodes, affects different performance measures of a
   distributed storage system (DSS). In this work, we study the storage
   allocation problem for a DSS where nodes have different storage
   capacities. To this end, we first introduce the notion of k-guaranteed
   allocations referring to allocations where the data can be recovered by
   accessing any arbitrary set of k storage nodes. We then find the
   necessary conditions for an allocation to be k-guaranteed considering
   the limit on the individual node capacities and the overall storage
   budget. Using these conditions, an iterative algorithm is developed to
   find k-guaranteed allocations, if feasible.}},

Abstract = {{The radio-frequency (RF) linearity performance potential of
   short-channel graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) is assessed by
   using a nonlinear small-signal circuit model under the first
   approximation of ballistic transport. An intrinsic GFET is examined to
   reveal the key features of GFET linearity, and extrinsic parasitics are
   then included to assess the overall RF linearity. It is shown that
   short-channel GFETs can be expected to have a signature behavior versus
   gate bias that includes a constant-linearity region at low gate bias,
   sweet spots of high linearity before and after the gate bias for peak
   cutoff frequency, and poor linearity at the gate bias corresponding to
   the peak cutoff frequency. It is otherwise found that a GFET offers
   overall linearity that is comparable to a MOSFET and a CNFET, with the
   exception that the amount of intermodulation distortion in a GFET is
   dominated by the drain-injected carriers, a unique outcome of graphene's
   lack of a bandgap. Qualitative agreement with experiment in the
   signature behavior of GFET linearity supports the approach and
   conclusions.}},

   Henry's law constants of hydrogen sulfide in propylene carbonate were
   determined at each temperature with a combination of the
   Krichevsky-Ilinskaya equation and the Peng-Robinson equation of state.
   The results were compared with the existing literature data for this
   system. The same modeling approach was used to correlate the solubility
   of carbon dioxide in propylene carbonate using data available in the

Abstract = {{A Pt/Si Schottky diode was prepared by depositing thin-film Pt on Si
   (100) via RF magnetron sputtering. The I-V characteristics of the
   nano-Schottky structure were measured by conductive-AFM (CAFM) and
   probe-based measurement, where nano-and micro-size tip was used,
   respectively. Result from both measurements showed the rectifying
   behaviors, whereas the leakage current detected by CAFM is about six
   orders of magnitude larger than that detected by the micro-measurement.
   It was proposed that this electronic transport discrepancy is mainly
   ascribed to the different electronic transmission. In order to reveal
   the characteristics of the Schottky junction, a thermionic emission (TE)
   model and thermionic-field emission (TFE) model were applied for the I-V
   data fitting. It was proved that the result can be well fitted by the TE
   model, with an ideality factor (IF) n = 1-2 and barrier height (BH)
   0.75-0.85 eV, indicating this Schottky diode approximates to an ideal
   Schottky diode (n = 1). (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Title = {{Inverse Gas Chromatography Study of the Permeability of Aroma through

Journal = {{ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3114-3122}},

Abstract = {{Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) was used to study the permeability of a
   series of aromas through neat hydroxypropyl xylan (HPX) film and HPX
   films containing sorbitol, a commonly used food grade plasticizer, and
   cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), a nanosized filler. The aroma used included
   methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol. Also, their solubility and
   diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution were measured over the
   temperature range 120-160 degrees C, and the corresponding permeability
   coefficients were calculated. It was observed that the alcohols
   exhibited lower solubility (3 orders of magnitude) and diffusivity (2-3
   orders of magnitude) than those of water in the neat HPX film.
   Solubility coefficient showed a minimum over the range of the molecular
   weight of the aforementioned alcohols. However, the diffusion
   coefficient decreased monotonically with increasing the alcohol's
   molecular weight. Adding sorbitol (40 wt \%) decreased solubility
   coefficients slightly but increased diffusion coefficients by about 1
   order of magnitude. However, replacing 5 wt \% of sorbitol by CNC while
   maintaining the total additive concentration at 40 wt \% did not alter
   the solubility coefficients much but decreased diffusion coefficients by
   approximately half of the values of the HPX film containing 40 wt \%
   sorbitol. Permeability, a quantity signifying the combined effect of
   solubility and diffusivity, was observed to decrease with increasing the
   alcohol's molecular weight. This implies that diffusivity controls the
   permeability of the alcohols at high molecular weights. As expected,
   sorbitol increases while CNC decreases permeability. However, effects of
   additives are stronger for methanol and ethanol than for propanol and
   butanol. Temperature also exerts stronger effects for methanol and
   ethanol than for propanol and butanol. The above observation is likely
   due to the differences in the abilities of the low and high molecular
   weight alcohols to form hydrogen bonds with HPX, sorbitol, and CNC.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning plays an important role in data classification and
   data-based prediction. In some real-world applications, however, the
   training data (coming from the source domain) and test data (from the
   target domain) come from different domains or time periods, and this may
   result in the different distributions of some features. Moreover, the
   values of the features and/or labels of the datasets might be nonnumeric
   and involve vague values. Traditional learning-based prediction and
   classification methods cannot handle these two issues. In this study, we
   propose a multistep fuzzy bridged refinement domain adaptation
   algorithm, which offers an effective way to deal with both issues. It
   utilizes a concept of similarity to modify the labels of the target
   instances that were initially predicted by a shift-unaware model. It
   then refines the labels using instances that are most similar to a given
   target instance. These instances are extracted from mixture domains
   composed of source and target domains. The proposed algorithm is built
   on a basis of some data and refines the labels, thus performing
   completely independently of the shift-unaware prediction model. The
   algorithm uses a fuzzy set-based approach to deal with the vague values
   of the features and labels. Four different datasets are used in the
   experiments to validate the proposed algorithm. The results, which are
   compared with those generated by the existing domain adaptation methods,
   demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in both the
   above-mentioned datasets.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a concept of hierarchical granular
   clustering and establish its algorithmic framework. We show that the
   proposed model naturally gives rise to information granules that are
   both of higher order and higher type, offering a compelling
   justification behind their emergence. In a concise way, we can capture
   the overall architecture of information granules as a hierarchy
   exhibiting conceptual layers of increasing abstraction: numeric data ->
   information granules -> information granules of type-2, order-2 -> ...
   information granules of higher type/order. The elevated type of
   information granules is reflective of the visible hierarchical facet of
   processing and the inherent diversity of the individual locally revealed
   structures in data. While the concept and the methodology deliver some
   general settings, the detailed algorithmic aspects are discussed in
   detail when using fuzzy clustering realized by means of fuzzy c-means.
   Furthermore, for illustrative purposes, we mainly focus on
   interval-valued fuzzy sets and granular interval fuzzy sets arising at
   the higher level of the hierarchy. Higher type fuzzy sets are formed
   with the help of the principle of justifiable granularity. The
   conceptually sound hierarchy is established in a general way, which
   makes it equally applicable to various formalisms of representation of
   information granules. Experiments are reported for synthetic and
   publicly available datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) form an important class of models for
   describing and simulating the behavior of dynamic systems through causal
   reasoning. Owing to their abilities to make the symbolic knowledge
   processing simple and transparent, FCMs have been successfully used to
   model the behavior of complex systems originating from numerous
   application areas, such as economy, politics, medicine, and engineering.
   However, the design of FCMs necessarily involves domain experts to
   develop a graph-based model composed of a collection of system's
   concepts and causal relationships among them. Consequently, since humans
   exhibit an intrinsic factor of subjectivity and are only able to
   efficiently develop small-size graph-based models, there is a legitimate
   need to devise methods capable of automatically learning FCM models from
   data. This research addresses this need by introducing a competent
   memetic algorithm to generate FCM models from available historical data,
   with no human intervention. Extensive benchmarking tests performed on
   both synthetic and real-world data quantify the performance of the
   competent memetic method and emphasize its suitability over the models
   obtained by conventional and noncompetent hybrid evolutionary approaches
   in terms of accuracy, approximation ability, and convergence speed.
   Moreover, the proposed approach is shown to be scalable due to its
   capability to efficiently learn high-dimensional FCM models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel method based on image processing is proposed for

   obtain a two-dimensional (2-D) image of the transformer winding using
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging method and Kirchhoff migration
   algorithm. The main goal of the image processing method is to detect the
   location of the radial deformation on the transformer high-voltage (HV)
   winding. Two different deformations are applied on the winding under the
   test in this paper. The first one is a modeled bulgy mechanical
   deformation and the second one is an actual concave buckling made on the
   actual transformer HV winding. The experimental results for different
   cases show the effectiveness of the proposed method to detect the

Abstract = {{Traditional time-based reliability assessment methods evaluate the
   reliability of a multi-state system (MSS) from a population or a
   statistical perspective that the reliability of a system is computed
   purely based upon historical time-to-failure data collected from a large
   population of identical components or systems. These methods, however,
   fail to characterize the stochastic behaviors of a specific individual
   system. In this paper, by utilizing system-level observation history, a
   dynamic reliability assessment method for MSSs is put forth. The
   proposed recursive Bayesian formula is able to dynamically update the
   reliability function of a specific MSS over time by incorporating
   system-level inspection data. The dynamic reliability function, state
   probabilities, and remaining useful life distribution of an MSS in
   residual lifetime are derived for two common cases: the degradation of
   components follows a homogeneous continuous time Markov process, and a
   non-homogeneous continuous time Markov process. The effectiveness and
   accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated via two numerical
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the strain hardening and hot
   deformation behavior of as extruded Mg-Zn-Mn (ZM31) magnesium alloy with
   varying Y contents (0.3, 3.2, and 6 wt\%) via compression testing along
   the extrusion direction at room temperature, 200 degrees C and 300
   degrees C. Texture and phases were identified by X-ray diffraction.
   Alloy ZM31 + 0.3Y consisted of a mixture of fine equiaxed grains and
   elongated grains with I-phase (Mg3YZn6); alloy ZM31 + 3.2Y contained
   I-phase and W-phase (Mg3Y2Zn3); alloy ZM31 + 6Y had long-period
   stacking-ordered (LPSO) X-phase (Mg12YZn) and Mg24Y5 particles. With
   increasing Y content the basal texture became weakened significantly.
   While alloys ZM31 + 0.3Y and ZM31 + 3.2Y exhibited a skewed true
   stress-true stain curve with a three-stage strain hardening feature
   caused by the occurrence of \{10 (1) over bar2\} extension twinning, the
   true stress-true stain curve of alloy ZM31 + 6Y was normal due to the
   dislocation slip during compression. With increasing temperature the
   extent of skewness decreased. While the compressive yield stress,
   ultimate compressive stress, strain hardening exponent, and hardening
   capacity all decreased as the temperature increased, the retention of
   the high-temperature deformation resistance increased with increasing Y
   content mainly due to the presence of thermally-stable LPSO X-phase.

   with near field coupling to the ENZ metamaterial. Preferential emission
   from the ZnO layer into the metamaterial with suppression of forward
   emission by 90\% in comparison to ZnO on silicon is observed. We
   attribute this observation to the presence of dispersionless plasmonic
   modes in the ENZ regime as shown by the results of theoretical modeling
   presented here. Integration of ENZ metamaterials with light emitters is
   an attractive platform for realizing a low threshold subwavelength
   laser. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The fracture behavior of a cylindrical bar containing a circumferential
   edge crack under transient thermal loading is analyzed in this paper
   using the dual phase lag heat conduction model. The lateral surface of
   the bar is subjected to an asymmetric, convective thermal boundary
   condition. The Laplace transform method is adopted to solve the
   one-dimensional, hyperbolic heat conduction equation in the uncracked
   bar, and the corresponding thermal stress is obtained in the Laplace
   domain under plane strain condition. Then, based on the superposition
   method, the axial stress with minus sign is applied on the crack surface
   to form a mode I crack problem in the cylindrical coordinate. Love's
   potential function is introduced to solve the crack problem and a
   singular integral equation is obtained by using the Fourier and Hankel
   transform methods. Furthermore, a numerical Laplace inversion technique
   is employed to transform all the results to the time domain. Finally,
   the effect of heat conduction model, phase-lag parameters, Biot number,
   and the crack depth on the transient temperature, thermal axial stress,
   stress intensity factor, and crack opening displacement is analyzed. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Currently bronchial provocation testing (BPT) using mannitol
   powder cannot be performed in children under 6 years. A primary reason
   is it is challenging for children at this age to generate a consistent
   inspiratory effort to inhale mannitol efficiently from a dry powder
   inhaler. A prototype system, which does not require any inhalation
   training from the pediatric subject, is reported here. It uses an
   external source of compressed air to disperse mannitol powder into a
   commercial holding chamber. Then the subject uses tidal breathing to
   inhale the aerosol. Method: The setup consists of a commercially
   available powder disperser and Volumatic holding chamber. Taguchi
   experimental design was used to identify the effect of dispersion
   parameters (flow rate of compressed air, time compressed air is applied,
   mass of powder, and the time between dispersion and inhalation) on the
   fine particle dose (FPD). The prototype was tested in vitro using a USP
   throat connected to a next generation impactor. The aerosols from the
   holding chamber were drawn at 10L/min. A scaling factor for estimating
   the provoking dose to induce a 15\% reduction in forced expiratory
   volume in 1 second (FEV1) (PD15) was calculated using anatomical
   dimensions of the human respiratory tract at various ages combined with
   known dosing values from the adult BPT. Results: Consistent and doubling
   FPDs were successfully generated based on the Taguchi experimental
   design. The FPD was reliable over a range of 0.8 (0.09) mg to 14 (+/-
   0.94) mg. The calculated PD15 for children aged 1-6 years ranged from
   7.1-30mg. The FPDs generated from the proposed set up are lower than the
   calculated PD15 and therefore are not expected to cause sudden
   bronchoconstriction. Conclusion: A prototype aerosol delivery system has
   been developed that is consistently able to deliver doubling doses
   suitable for bronchial provocation testing in young children.}},

Abstract = {{Geo-distributed data-centers in cloud computing are becoming
   increasingly popular due to their lower end-user perceived latency and
   increased reliability in distributed applications. The important
   challenge of resource allocation in cloud management is more pronounced
   in geo-distributed data-centers compared to traditional data-centers. A
   geo-distributed cloud manager faces applications whose virtual machines
   (VMs) are far apart and need to interact with end users, access
   distributed data and communicate with each other. In such applications,
   the service level agreement is not met if the communication latency is
   not bounded. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding
   data-centers for hosting VMs while the requested VMs are located in
   different geo-distributed data-centers and are sensitive to the
   communication latency. We propose an algorithm to minimize communication
   latency by taking into account the cloud network topology to be either a
   tree or that of the Internet. Moreover, our algorithm can utilize user's
   locations to find better candidate solutions. In the case of tree
   topology, we prove that our algorithm finds a solution whose latency is
   minimum. In addition, we show that our algorithm performs well in the
   Internet topology, with simulation results indicating that it can reduce
   the communication latency up to compared to existing algorithms.}},
