Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel bioparticle system operated for simultaneous
   carbon and nitrogen biodegradation, with an anoxic-aerobic bioparticle
   circulation pattern. In the Circulating Fluidized Bed Biofilm Reactor
   (CFBBR), bioparticles are slowly transferred from the Riser (Anoxic
   column) to the Downer (Aerobic column) for enhanced biological nutrient
   removal (BNR), with bioparticles residing in the Downer prior to
   recirculation back to the Riser for refreshment. In this study, low
   shear stress was maintained during all experiments in order to achieve
   rich biofilm conditions, where predation was encouraged. A lab-scale
   CFBBR with a 4 L reaction zone was designed to evaluate the circulation
   effect. Long-term (285 days) performance showed that stable and
   high-rate chemical oxygen demand (COD) with sodium acetate as the carbon
   source and total nitrogen (NH4Cl as nitrogen source) conversions were
   achieved simultaneously, with extremely low sludge production in the
   0.034-0.1 gVSS(volatile suspended solids)/gCOD range. These results
   supported the considerable advantages of the bioparticle process in
   biological nutrient removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Batch anaerobic studies were conducted to study the effect of
   ultrasonication as a pretreatment method for pulp waste prior to
   anaerobic hydrogen production. Pre-treatment was conducted by sonicating
   a 100 mL of pulp waste at different sonication times varying from 0.5
   min to 30 mm. The ultimate hydrogen production increased with increasing
   sonication time. The highest ultimate hydrogen production was achieved
   at a sonication time of 30 min and reflected an 88\% increase over the
   unsonicated food waste, of 80 mWg VSadded. The highest final VFAs
   concentration after fermentation (corresponding to 70\% increase over
   the unsonicated food waste) was also achieved at a sonication time of 30
   min. There were no significant differences between the
   acetate-to-butyrate ratios (HAc/HBu) for the all sonication times. The
   maximum hydrogen production rate at sonication time of 30 min was about
   145\% higher than that the unsonicated food waste. Copyright (C) 2011,

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The flows around a series of flat plates with various leading- and
   trailing-edge shapes and a range of elongation ratios were simulated
   with a 2-D, high-resolution vortex method. The resultant map depicting
   the variation of chord-based Strouhal number, St(c), with elongation
   ratio, c/t, and leading/trailing edge angles reveals that there are
   upper and lower limits for St(c). The upper limit is characterized by
   linear variations of St(c) with c/t, while the lower limit is
   characterized by constant St(c) until a critical c/t ratio where St(c)
   jumps to a new value. By changing the separation angle of the flow at
   the leading edge, the transition between these bounds is continuous.
   However, in contrast to the results for rectangular cylinders, St(c) for
   plates with relatively small leading edge separation angles was observed
   to increase almost linearly with c/t after a jump, followed by a region
   where St(c) is constant. Based on detailed analyses of the flow
   characteristics, the underlying mechanics leading to these behaviors
   were identified. It was found that it is the competition between the
   leading- and trailing-edge shedding for the control of the overall
   shedding process that leads to the observed linear and horizontal
   variations, as well as the abrupt jumps, of St(c). (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The performance of a newly developed three dimensional (3-D) reactor
   kinetic model for CANDU reactor is evaluated in this paper. The
   evaluation is carried out in a closed-loop environment with the help of
   an existing reactor regulating system (RRS). The 3-D model is obtained
   based on a modal synthesis method, which represents the neutron flux
   distribution inside the reactor in both time and space. Throughout this
   paper, a special attention has been paid to compare the performance of
   the developed 3-D model with that of traditional coupled point kinetic
   models. The dynamic behavior of the reactor model in a practical
   load-following mode has also been examined. The accuracy of the model
   has been validated against actual plant measurements under both
   transient and steady-state conditions. Through the analysis and the
   simulation studies, it has convincingly demonstrated that the developed
   3-D model has significant advantages over traditional coupled point
   kinetic models in terms of the improved accuracy and the higher
   resolution in modeling the reactor internal dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Impact cratering is an important and unique geologic process. The high
   speeds, forces and temperatures involved are quite unlike conventional
   endogenic processes, and the environmental consequences can be
   catastrophic. Kilometre-scale craters are excavated and collapse in
   minutes, in some cases distributing debris around the globe and exhuming
   deeply buried strata. In the process, rocks are deformed, broken, heated
   and transformed in unique ways. Elevated temperatures in the crust may
   persist for millennia, and important chemical reactions are promoted by
   the extreme environment of the impact plume. Released gases may cause
   long-term perturbations to the climate, and impact-related phosphorus
   reduction may have played a role in the origin of life on Earth.}},

Pages = {{1464-1473}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Studies of heat transfer in slurry bubble column reactors have been
   reviewed and observed differences analyzed based on available data. Heat
   transfer in these reactors is a strong function of some parameters and a
   weak function of others. The parameters significantly influencing heat
   transfer in these reactors are the superficial gas velocity,
   thermophysical properties of liquid and solid particles, and size and
   concentration of the particles. Moreover, the rate of change with a
   parameter is dependent on the operating flow regime, particle
   properties, and presence of internals. Of all of the parameters, the
   effect of the particles is more complex and inadequately understood
   because particles influence the flow regime transition and
   thermophysical and rheological properties of the suspension, which, in
   turn, affect the hydrodynamic behavior and associated heat-transfer
   characteristics. The effects of the column diameter and internals have
   been investigated by a limited number of studies. A comparison of
   available data shows that the effect of the column diameter on heat
   transfer diminishes above 0.3 m. This, however, requires confirmation
   from larger-diameter studies together with associated hydrodynamic
   studies and appropriate modeling. Literature correlations for the
   heat-transfer coefficient have been reviewed and their limitations and
   applicability discussed. Axial and radial variations of heat-transfer
   coefficients reported in literature studies require appropriate design
   considerations.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to specify the inlet boundary conditions that considering
   the inlet air jet effect was proposed in this study to simulate
   gas-solid two-phase flows in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers more
   accurately. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on
   Eulerian-Eulerian approach coupled with kinetic theory of granular flow
   was adopted to simulate the flow using the proposed inlet boundary
   conditions. Simulation results were compared with experimental data.
   Good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data was
   observed under different operating conditions, which indicates the
   effectiveness and accuracy of the CFD model with the proposed inlet
   boundary conditions. The results show that the proposed inlet boundary
   conditions are not only physically more realistic but also result in
   more-accurate simulation results than commonly used inlet boundary
   conditions. Both experimental and numerical results illustrate a clear
   core annulus structure in the CFB riser under all operating conditions.}},

   10.1152/japplphysiol.01295.2011.-The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the regional effects of bronchodilator administration in
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using hyperpolarized
   helium-3 (He-3) MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Ten COPD
   ex-smokers provided written, informed consent and underwent
   diffusion-weighted, hyperpolarized He-3 MRI, spirometry, and
   plethysmography before and 25 +/- 2 min after bronchodilator
   administration. Pre- and postsalbutamol whole-lung (WL) ADC maps were
   generated and registered together to identify the lung regions
   containing the He-3 signal at both time points, and mean ADC within
   those regions of interest (ROI) was determined for a measurement of
   previously ventilated ROI ADC (ADC(P)). Lung ROI with He-3 signal at
   both time points was used as a binary mask on postsalbutamol WL ADC maps
   to obtain an ADC measurement for newly ventilated ROI (ADC(N)).
   Postsalbutamol, no significant differences were detected in WL ADC (P =
   0.516). There were no significant differences between ADC(N) and ADC(P)
   postsalbutamol (P = 1.00), suggesting that the ADC(N) lung regions were
   not more emphysematous than the lung ROI participating in ventilation
   before bronchodilator administration. Postsalbutamol, a statistically
   significant decrease in ADC(P) (P = 0.01) was detected, and there were
   significant differences between ADC(P) in the most anterior and most
   posterior image slices (P = 0.02), suggesting a reduction in regional
   gas trapping following bronchodilator administration. Regional
   evaluation of tissue microstructure using hyperpolarized He-3 MRI ADC
   provides insights into lung alterations that accompany improvements in
   regional He-3 gas distribution after bronchodilator administration.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of surface-air elemental mercury (Hg-0) fluxes in the literature
   were synthesized for the Great Lakes Basin (GLB). For the majority of
   surfaces, fluxes were net positive (evasion). Digital land-cover data
   were combined with representative evasion rates and used to estimate
   annual Hg-0 evasion for the GLB (7.7 Mg/yr). This value is less than our
   estimate of total Hg deposition to the area (15.9 Mg/yr), suggesting the
   GLB is a net sink for atmospheric Hg. The greatest contributors to
   annual evasion for the basin are agricultural (similar to 55\%) and
   forest (similar to 25\%) land cover types, and the open water of the
   Great Lakes (similar to 15\%). Areal evasion rates were similar across
   most land cover types (range: 7.0-21.0 mu g/m(2)-yr), with higher rates
   associated with urban (12.6 mu g/m(2)-yr) and agricultural (21.0 mu
   g/m(2)-yr) lands. Uncertainty in these estimates could be partially
   remedied through a unified methodological approach to estimating Hg
   fluxes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The chiral discrimination mechanism in the resolution of sertraline with

   pattern, herringbone-like arrangement of aromatic rings, and planar
   boundary surface in the hydrophobic region are the three most important
   structural characteristics expected in less soluble diastereomeric
   salts. The existence and magnitude of hydrogen bond, CH/pi interaction,

Abstract = {{Sensor networks are deployed to accomplish certain specific missions
   over a period of time. It is essential that the network continues to
   operate, even if some of its nodes fail. It is also important that the
   network is able to support the mission for a minimum specified period of
   time. Hence, the design of a sensor network should not only provide some
   guarantees that all data from the sensor nodes are gathered at the base
   station, even in the presence of some faults, but should also allow the
   network to remain functional for a specified duration. This paper
   considers a two-tier, hierarchical sensor network architecture, where
   some relay nodes, provisioned with higher power and other capabilities,
   are used as cluster heads. Given a distribution of sensor nodes in a
   sensor network, finding the locations to place a minimum number of relay
   nodes such that, each sensor node is covered by at least one relay node,
   is known to be a computationally difficult problem. In addition, for
   successful and reliable data communication, the relay nodes network
   needs to be connected, as well as resilient to node failures. In this
   paper, a novel integrated Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is
   proposed, which, unlike existing techniques, not only finds a suitable
   placement strategy for the relay nodes, but also assigns the sensor
   nodes to the clusters and determines a load-balanced routing scheme.
   Therefore, in addition to the desired levels of fault tolerance for both
   the sensor nodes and the relay nodes, the proposed approach also meets
   specified performance guarantees with respect to network lifetime by
   limiting the maximum energy consumption of the relay nodes. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{TiO2 nanowires and nanowalls core structures covered with carbon shell
   were selectively synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   method using commercial titanium powder as the starting material.
   Morphology and structure of the products were characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   The core shell structure is composed of single crystalline rutile
   titanium dioxide wrapped by amorphous carbon shell. By adjusting the
   growth temperature, morphology of the products can be controlled from
   one-dimensional nanowires to two-dimensional nanowalls. While TiO2@C
   nanowires were a preferred structure at higher temperature, TiO2@C
   nanowalls dominated the final product at lower temperature. A growth
   mechanism was proposed based on the initial growth state of these
   nanostructures, in which solid-state diffusion of the elements involved
   in the reaction was assumed to play an essential role. The obtained
   TiO2@C core shell structures may find potential applications in various
   nanoscale realms such as optoelectronic, electronic and electrochemical
   nanodevices and the simple synthesis procedure promises large scale
   production and commercialization of the titanium oxide@carbon

Abstract = {{Recent multiple sclerosis (MS) MRI research has highlighted the need to
   move beyond the lesion-centric view and to develop and validate new MR
   imaging strategies that quantify the invisible burden of disease in the
   brain and establish much more sensitive and specific surrogate markers
   of clinical disability. One of the most promising of such measures is
   myelin-selective MRI that allows the acquisition of myelin water
   fraction (MWF) maps, a parameter that is correlated to brain white
   matter (WM) myelination. The aim of our study was to apply the newest
   myelin-selective MRI method, multi-component Driven Equilibrium Single
   Pulse Observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) in a controlled clinical MS
   pilot trial. This study was designed to assess the capabilities of this
   new method to explain differences in disease course and degree of
   disability in subjects spanning a broad spectrum of MS disease severity.
   The whole-brain isotropically-resolved 3D acquisition capability of
   mcDESPOT allowed for the first time the registration of 3D MWF maps to
   standard space, and consequently a formalized voxel-based analysis of
   the data. This approach combined with image segmentation further allowed
   the derivation of new measures of MWF deficiency: total deficient MWF
   volume (DV) in WM, in WM lesions, in diffusely abnormal white matter and
   in normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Deficient MWF volume fraction
   (DVF) was derived from each of these by dividing by the corresponding
   region volume. Our results confirm that lesion burden does not correlate
   well with clinical disease activity measured with the extended
   disability status scale (EDSS) in MS patients. In contrast, our
   measurements of DVF in NAWM correlated significantly with the EDSS score
   (R-2=0.37; p < 0.001). The same quantity discriminated clinically
   isolated syndrome patients from a normal control population (p < 0.001)
   and discriminated relapsing-remitting from secondary-progressive
   patients (p < 0.05); hence this new technique may sense early
   disease-related myelin loss and transitions to progressive disease.
   Multivariate analysis revealed that global atrophy, mean whole-brain
   myelin water fraction and white matter atrophy were the three most
   important image-derived parameters for predicting clinical disability
   (EDSS). Overall, our results demonstrate that mcDESPOT-defined
   measurements in NAWM show great promise as imaging markers of global
   clinical disease activity in MS. Further investigation will determine if
   this measure can serve as a risk factor for the conversion into definite
   MS and for the secondary transition into irreversible disease
   progression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: To improve intra- and interobserver
   variability and enable the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) for multicenter, multiobserver studies, we generated a
   semiautomated segmentation method for hyperpolarized helium-3 (He-3)
   MRI. Therefore the objective of this study was to compare the
   reproducibility and spatial agreement of manual and semiautomated
   segmentation of He-3 MRI ventilation defect volume (VDV) and ventilation
   volume (VV) in subjects with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
   Materials and Methods: The multistep semiautomated segmentation method
   we developed employed hierarchical K-means clustering to classify He-3
   MRI pixel intensity values into five user-determined clusters ranging
   from signal void to hyperintense. A seeded region-growing algorithm was
   also used to segment the H-1 MRI thoracic cavity for coregistration to
   the 3He cluster-map, generating VDV and VV.
   Results: We compared manual segmentation performed by an expert observer
   and semiautomated measurements of He-3 MRI VDV and observed strong
   significant correlations between the volumes generated using each method
   (asthma, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001; COPD, n = 5, r = 0.84, P < .0001;
   CF, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001). Semiautomated VDV had high
   interobserver reproducibility (coefficient of variation {[}CV] = 7\%,
   intraclass correlation coefficient {[}ICC] = 0.96); intraobserver
   reproducibility was significantly higher for semiautomated (CV = 5\%,
   ICC = 1.00) compared to manual VDV (CV = 12\%, ICC = 0.98). Spatial
   agreement for W determined using the Dice coefficient (D) was also high
   for all disease states (asthma, D = 0.95; COPD, D = 0.88; CF, D = 0.90).
   Conclusions: Semiautomated segmentation 3He MRI provides excellent
   inter-and intraobserver precision with high spatial and quantitative
   agreement with manual measurements enabling its use in longitudinal
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the interaction force between a surgical needle and soft
   tissue is studied. The force is modeled using a novel nonlinear dynamic
   model. Encouraged by the LuGre model for representing friction forces,
   the proposed model captures all stages of needle-tissue interaction,
   including puncture, cutting, and friction forces. An estimation
   algorithm for identifying the parameters of the model is presented. This
   online approach, which is based on sequential extended Kalman filtering,
   enables us to characterize the total contact force using an efficient
   mathematical model. The algorithm compares the axial force measured at
   the needle base with its expected value and then adapts the model
   parameters to represent the actual interaction force. While the nature
   of this problem is very complex, the use of multiple Kalman filters
   makes the system highly adaptable for capturing the force evolution
   during an interventional procedure in standard operating conditions. To
   evaluate the performance of our model, experiments were performed on
   artificial phantoms.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting the shear strength of mine tailings/clay mixtures with
   varying clay content and clay mineralogy}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{125}},

Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Artificial mine tailings/clay mixtures were used to prepare concentrated
   slurries, from which beds with different composition, thickness and age
   were obtained through sedimentation. Those beds were sheared in a
   specially built Tilting Tank capable of simulating drained and partially
   drained conditions by varying the tilting rate. The stress range of
   interest was below 1.2 kPa, which was much lower that the stresses
   utilized by conventional geotechnical equipment, but of the same order
   of magnitude as those measured in the tailings management facilities.
   Negligible excess pore water pressure developed in the deposited beds
   when the rate of shearing was sufficiently slow, whereas a rapid
   shearing rate caused a significant excess pore pressure buildup that
   reduced the shear strength of the beds. Linear drained (effective
   stress) and partially drained (total stress) failure envelopes were
   defined for beds, prepared from various mixtures. The effective friction
   angle was found to vary between 35.2 degrees and 40.4 degrees depending
   on the percentage of clay in the mixtures and the type of the clay
   additive. Shearing under partially drained conditions yielded a total
   friction angle of the mixtures that was always lower than the effective
   friction angle and varied between 15.1 degrees and 23.3 degrees. It was
   found that adding clay to mine tailings generally caused a decrease in
   the frictional strength of the latter: however, the magnitude of this
   decrease was greater when the clay was bentonite and lower when it was
   kaolinite. The time for consolidation had little effect on the shear
   strength of the tailings/kaolinite mixtures, but led to an approximate
   increase of 2 degrees in the frictional resistance of the
   tailings/bentonite mixtures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a nano-hole array structure in an opaque gold film that

   plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing experiments, the SP-matched structure
   had 2.8-fold higher differential transmission, 2-fold higher

Abstract = {{The effect of the strain-hardening rate on the plastic strain
   distribution in parts made from aluminum alloys by the Splined Mandrel
   Flow Forming (SMFF) process was investigated. Parts were made from
   annealed 5052 and 6061 aluminum alloys by SMFF with different levels of
   average work piece thickness reduction, from 20 to 60\%. The average
   yield stress for the 5052 and the 6061 alloys increased by 187\% and
   87\% after SMFF (60\% thickness reduction). The larger increase in yield
   stress of the 5052 work piece is attributed to its higher
   strain-hardening coefficient resulting from it containing higher levels
   of solid-solution Mg compared to the 6061 alloy. While the magnitude of
   the average von-Mises equivalent plastic strain through the thickness of
   the SMFF work piece was essentially the same for both alloys, the local
   equivalent plastic strain near the surface of the work piece and the
   point-to-point scatter in the measured plastic strain was greater in the
   5052. This is attributed to the effect of the increased solid-solution
   Mg content localizing plastic flow. These findings illustrate the role
   of solid solution strengthening additions, in this case Mg, on
   increasing the average mechanical strength but also increasing the
   extent of local plastic strain variability in aluminum alloy material
   subjected to intensive plastic forming operations such as SMFF. Crown

Abstract = {{Hybrid optical-wireless networks provide the inexpensive broadband
   bandwidth, vital for modern applications, as well as mobility, and
   scalability required for an access network. However, in order to provide
   satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) on such a non-homogeneous network,
   innovative designs are required.
   This paper proposes a novel scheduling mechanism to significantly
   improve the delay guarantee, while maintaining high-level throughput, by
   predicting the incoming traffic to optical network units (ONU). The
   proposed scheduler managed to exploit the available information in
   hybrid optical-wireless networks, to enhance the ONU scheduler. This
   results in accurate prediction of incoming traffic, which leads to
   intelligent and traffic-aware, scheduling and dynamic bandwidth
   assignment (DBA).
   Based on the proposed architecture, two DBA algorithms are proposed and
   their performance is evaluated by extensive simulations. Moreover, the
   maximum throughput of such network is analyzed. The results show that by
   using the proposed algorithms, the delay bound of delay-sensitive
   traffic classes can be decreased by a factor of two, without any adverse
   effect on the throughput. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic models offer a fast, reliable, and cost-effective method
   to select the best solvent or solvent mixtures for crystallization of
   solid components. To optimize the performance of the unit operations
   which produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the physical
   properties of the solute and solvent must be known. Solubility
   prediction is very crucial in the fine and specialty chemical
   industries, as the total cost of production is high in most cases. In
   this study, the solubility of three chemical compounds,
   3-pentadecylphenol, lovastatin, and valsartan, in different solvents and
   solvent mixtures were studied experimentally and theoretically. The
   thermodynamic models of the UNIFAC and the NRTL-SAC model were used for
   prediction. The results of the prediction from the two models and their
   average relative deviation for the three model compounds showed a better
   performance for the NRTL-SAC model compared to the UNIFAC. For the case
   of lovastatin and valsartan, the NRTL-SAC model gives the average
   relative deviation of 0.2401 and 0.3843, respectively. Because of the
   flexibility of the NRTL-SAC program code that is written for the phase
   behavior prediction, it can be used for further analysis and
   optimization of the performance of crystallization processes (i.e.,
   solvent screening and yield of the process). This study shows that the
   NRTL-SAC model can be used effectively in pharmaceutical industry,
   especially for solvent screening purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Biomechanical properties of cells have been identified as an important
   factor in a broad range of biological processes. Based on measurements
   of mechanical properties by atomic force microscopy (AFM) particularly
   cell elasticity has been linked with human diseases, such as cancer. AFM
   has been widely used as a nanomechanical tool to probe the elasticity of
   living cells, however, standard methods for characterizing cell
   elasticity are still lacking. The local elasticity of a cell is
   conventionally used to represent the mechanical property of the cell.
   However, since cells have highly heterogeneous regions, elasticity
   mapping over the entire cell, rather than at a few points of
   measurement, is required. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs)
   as a model, we have developed in this study a new method to evaluate
   cell elasticity more quantitatively. Based on the height information of
   the cell, a new characterization method was proposed to evaluate the
   elasticity of a cell. Using this method, elasticities of cells on
   different substrates were compared. Results showed that the elasticity
   of HAECs on softer substrate also has higher value compared to those on
   harder substrate given a certain height where the statistical
   distribution analysis confirmed that higher actin filaments density was
   located. Thus, the elasticity of small portions of a cell could not
   represent the entire cell property and may lead to invalid
   characterization. In order to gain a more comprehensive and detailed
   understanding of biomechanical properties for future clinical use,
   elasticity and cell morphology should therefore be correlated with
   discussion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the design and experimental study of a model
   predictive controller (MPC) for the regulation of the melt temperature
   (MT) and the motor load (ML) in a pilot plant co-rotating twin-screw
   extruder for thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) applications. It is shown
   that these two process variables have significant influence on the
   crosslinking of the rubber chains by initiation of curatives such as
   peroxide and phenolic agents. Since the measurement of the degree of
   crosslinking is performed only in off-line manner, the above-mentioned
   control methodology can offer inferential control of the process. The
   manipulated variables are the screw speed (SS) and the wall temperature
   (WT). The previously identified multi variable model (Trifkovic et al.,
   2010) was used for the MPC design. In order to perform the real time
   control studies, the process communication was established from the
   local PLC (programmable logic controller) to the Advanced Control and
   model predictive control toolbox in MATLAB software, via OPC (OLE
   (Object Linking and Embedding) for Process Control) server. Both,
   set-point changes and disturbance effects were applied on the process
   for comprehensive evaluation of the controller performance. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In situ melt dynamic vulcanization process has been employed to prepare
   electrically conductive polypropylene (PP)/ethylene-propylene-diene
   rubber (EPDM) (40/60 wt \%) thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs)
   incorporated by expanded graphite (EG) as a conductive filler. Maleic
   anhydride grafted PP (PP-g-MAH) was used as compatibilizer and a sulfur
   curing system was designed and incorporated to vulcanize the EPDM phase
   during mixing process. Developed microstructures were characterized
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), melt rheomechanical
   spectroscopy (RMS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and were correlated with electrical conductivity
   behavior. For comparison, another class of TPV/EG nanocomposites was
   fabricated using a commercially available PP/EPDM-based TPV via both
   direct and masterbatch melt mixing process. Conductivity of the
   nanocomposites prepared by in situ showed no significant change during
   dynamic vulcanization till the mixing torque reached to the stationary
   level where micro-morphology of the cured rubber droplets was fully
   developed, and conductivity abrupt was observed. In situ cured
   nanocomposites showed higher insulator to conductor transition threshold
   (3.15 vol \% EG) than those based on commercially available TPV. All
   electrically conductive in situ prepared TPV nanocomposites exhibited
   reinforced melt elasticity with pseudosolid-like behavior within low
   frequency region in dynamic melt rheometry indicating formation of
   physical networks by both EG nanolayers and crosslinked EPDM droplets.

Abstract = {{The absorbed energy distribution (AED) in x-ray imaging detectors is an
   important factor that limits both energy resolution and image quality.
   In the diagnostic energy range (10-120 keV), escape of characteristic
   photons following photoelectric absorption and Compton scatter photons
   are primary sources of absorbed-energy dispersion in x-ray detectors. In
   this article, we describe the development of an analytic model of the
   AED of compound semiconductor detectors including the effects of escape
   and reabsorption of characteristic and Compton-scatter photons. We
   derive analytic expressions for semi-infinite slab geometry and validate
   our approach by Monte Carlo simulations using the commercial MCNP5 (TM)
   (ORNL, USA) code. In all cases, there was good agreement between
   analytic and Monte Carlo calculations. The analytic model allows us to
   obtain the 2D x-ray response matrix of arbitrary compound materials
   without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. We believe this model
   will be useful for correcting spectral distortion artifacts commonly
   observed in photon-counting applications and optimal design and
   development of novel x-ray detectors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the classification of digital modulation schemes in
   the presence of multipath fading channels and additive noise. A novel
   modulation recognition approach is proposed based on Gaussian Mixture
   Models (GMM). Our basic procedure involves parameter estimation using
   GMM to set up an offline database and then to classify the received
   signal into different modulation schemes based on the database by using
   Kullback-Leibler (K-L) Divergence. In order to mitigate the negative
   impact from multipath fading channels, an iterative Maximum A Posteriori
   (MAP)-based channel estimation is used in conjunction with the
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Furthermore, Gaussian
   approximation is carried out to decrease the computational complexity.
   Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of
   individual modulation scheme classification. Numerical results show that
   the proposed approach is capable of recognizing various modulated
   signals with improved performance under AWGN and multipath fading
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{The strain-rate effects of cast magnesium alloys were investigated with
   uniaxial compression and compressive impact testing. The compressive
   material response of specimens cut from sand cast AZ91, AE44, and AM60,
   and high-pressure die-cast AM60 was determined for strain-rates ranging
   from quasistatic levels to typical rates experienced during crash
   situations. Several different constitutive material models
   (Johnson-Cook, Cowper-Symonds, etc.) were used in an attempt to
   characterize the experimental results. These material models are
   typically available in commercial finite-element packages and can be
   used to model the resulting material response of die-cast automotive
   components produced with these alloys to more complex loading
   conditions. The resulting deformed microstructures and fracture surfaces
   of each alloy at different strain-rates were also analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm has attracted much
   attention as an effective approach for numerical optimization. Since the
   performance of DE is sensitive to the choice of associated control
   parameters, a large number of strategies on parameter determination have
   been presented in the past several years. However, most of them have
   limitations. Thus, to get optimal performance, time-consuming parameter
   tuning is necessary. This paper introduces an extension variable
   dimension of DE (EVSDE). In EVSDE, the control parameters are considered
   as a variable of the component. The variable dimension is expended and a
   new mutation strategy is employed for the extension dimension of
   variables on mutation operation. On the basis of experience value, the
   control parameters follow the individual variable and implement the
   dynamic self-adaptive process in the evolutionary process. It thus helps
   to improve the robustness of the algorithm and avoid premature
   convergence. Simulation results show the EVSDE is better than or at
   least comparable to other classic and adaptive DE algorithms from the
   literature in terms of convergence performance for a set of 10 benchmark
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of wall heating on low Reynolds numbers channel flow has been
   investigated experimentally. The experiments were conducted at heated
   bottom wall temperatures from 30 degrees C to 50 degrees C for two flow
   rates 0.0210 and 0.0525 kg/s,. corresponding to the Reynolds number
   range of 150 and 750 (in the absence of heating). The results showed
   that the initially laminar flow became turbulent due to wall heating,
   and that wall heating has a significant influence on both the mean and
   turbulent velocity fields. The mean velocity profiles were altered by
   the convective currents. The magnitude of mean streamwise velocity near
   the heated wall increased with an increase in the wall temperature. A
   back flow near the upper channel wall was also observed primarily at the
   lower flow rate which diminished for the high flow rate. The magnitude
   of backflow increased with an increase in the wall temperature. The
   turbulent intensities were found to increase with an increase in the
   wall temperature for both flow rates. The result also showed the
   presence of strong vortices originating from the heated wall and
   advecting towards the central core of the channel.}},

   The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the effects

   direction, on the bubbly flow characteristics such as bubble formation,
   detached bubble size and frequency at different gas and liquid flow
   rates. The experiments were conducted in a Plexiglas two-dimensional rig
   using a high speed camera. High speed imaging and an image processing
   algorithm were used to track each individual bubble and to quantify the
   bubble growth as well as the detachment frequency and the bubble
   velocity. Back light shadowgraphy which utilizes a low intensity diffuse
   light source to illuminate the background was used to image bubbles.
   Nozzles were mounted in the test section which was designed such that
   the flow in this section has a two-dimensional profile.
   The results showed that the bubble size increases with an increase in
   GLR (gas to liquid flow rates ratio). Furthermore, the bubble formations

Abstract = {{The so-called core-annulus structure, that is, lower solids
   concentration in the center region and higher solids concentration in
   the near wall region along the circulating fluidized beds (CFB) riser,
   usually has a negative effect on the performance of CFB risers since it
   may greatly decrease the reactor efficiency and controllability. In
   order to improve the performance of industrial CFB risers, two potential
   approaches are proposed in this study: (1) the use of the center-sparse
   side-dense air jets arrangement for the gas distributor and the
   side-covered arrangement for the solids distributor and (2) the use of
   the air jet from the riser circumference. The results show that the
   patterns of the inlet gas distributor and solids distributor have
   significant effect on the flow structure in both the entrance region and
   the fully-developed region in the riser. The gas distributor with
   center-sparse side-dense air jet arrangement improves the uniformity of
   the radial solids distribution, while the center-dense side-sparse air
   jet arrangement steepens the non-uniformity of the solids radial
   profile. The core-annulus structure can also be greatly flattened by
   applying a side-covered solids distributor, while it can be heavily
   steepened by employing the center-covered solids distributor. The
   results also show that by employing the circumferential air jet approach
   under appropriate jet velocities, the maximum solids concentration in
   the near wall region can be greatly reduced, the entrance region can be
   shortened, and the uniformity of the flow structure can be greatly
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) assisted control
   system design methodology has been described in detail. The entire
   design and evaluation procedure has been illustrated through a feedback
   control system synthesis for a CPU chip cooling system. The design
   methodology starts with a full-scale CFD simulation of the nonlinear
   dynamic process to generate the input and output databases of the
   process. Using this data set, linear dynamic models around specified
   operating points are obtained using system identification techniques.
   Based on these models, one can design appropriate control systems to
   meet the required closed-loop control system specifications. To
   illustrate the effectiveness of this technique, it has been used to
   design a controller for a PC chip cooling system. In particular, the
   coupling issues between `real-time' dynamic controllers with non
   real-time CFD simulation have been resolved. A physical experimental
   test bench based on a cooling system of a Pentium III CPU has been
   constructed. The feedback linear control systems designed by the
   proposed CFD approach have been evaluated experimentally for six CPU

   with six different crack lengths. Three-dimensional analyses are then
   carried out to estimate the errors of prediction of the equations that
   evaluate the crack length from the plane stress- and plane strain-based

   is largely impacted by the thickness-to-width ratio, crack length,

   the relevance of the plane strain and plane stress conditions to the

Abstract = {{Modeling of power distribution networks in electronic packages requires
   the two dimensional discretization of the distributed power/ground
   planes which can be computationally expensive. Recently, the waveform
   relaxation algorithm has been proposed for fast transient simulation of
   power/ground planes. However, due to the strong coupling of each node in
   a two dimensional (2D) physical space, the relaxation iterations exhibit
   slow convergence and special techniques need to be adopted to ensure
   efficient convergence. In this work, a novel waveform relaxation
   algorithm based on physically partitioning the power/ground plane into
   smaller overlapping subcircuits is presented. The overlap between the
   subcircuits provides greater exchange of information per iteration
   leading to accelerated convergence of the waveform relaxation algorithm.
   A numerical example has been provided to illustrate the validity of the
   proposed algorithm over full SPICE simulations.}},

Title = {{A multi-layered OFDM system with parallel transmission for multicell
   cooperative cellular networks}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Recent development in multicell cooperation poses significant technical
   challenges to the design of robust and flexible transmission techniques.
   A new multi-layered orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ML-OFDM)
   system is proposed in this article to provide a dynamic platform for
   multicell cooperation with efficient base station coordination
   capability. The proposed enhanced layers (ELs), which are overlaid with
   the cellular communication data (the base layer) in both frequency and
   time domains, can be used for several specific purposes indispensable to
   multicell cooperation. It provides an efficient way of sharing the
   necessary information, e. g., channel state information, user data and
   other transmission parameters, between the collaborative BSs without the
   requirement of additional signaling or control channels. Overall network
   efficiency is substantially enhanced due to the reduction of radio
   resource overhead. Furthermore, cross BS synchronization and multimedia
   broadcast multicast service for next generation cellular networks can be
   simultaneously achieved by the proposed parallel orthogonal ELs. The
   transceiver design for the ML-OFDM system, particularly the
   modulation/demodulation of the ELs and EL-induced interference
   cancelation is presented. Overall system performance is further
   optimized by proposing a power distribution scheme with a set of
   practical constraints. The performance of the ML-OFDM system is analyzed
   and verified through numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology was developed to calculate the probabilities of tensile
   rupture and compressive local buckling for pressurised pipelines that
   are buried in unstable slopes and subjected to longitudinal loading
   imposed by the slopes. The limit state functions were established by
   comparing the tensile and compressive strain demand with the
   corresponding strain capacities. The strain demand is calculated using
   an analytical model reported in the literature, which is capable of
   accounting for the elastic-plastic behaviour of the pipeline and the
   elastic-perfectly plastic behaviour of the pipe-soil friction. The
   strain capacities are characterised based on the information available
   in the literature. The spatial variability of the soil and pipe
   properties is incorporated in a simplified manner. A numerical example
   was used to illustrate the proposed methodology and impact of the
   spatiality variability of the soil and pipe properties on the failure
   probability. The analysis results suggest that the spatial variability
   of pipe wall thickness and yield strength tends to increase the failure
   probability, whereas the spatial variability of the soil ultimate
   resistance tends to decrease the failure probability.}},

Abstract = {{Making investment decision on various available stocks in the market is
   a challenging task. Econometric and statistical models, as well as
   machine learning and data mining techniques, have proposed heuristic
   based solutions with limited long-range success. In practice, the
   capabilities and intelligence of financial experts is required to build
   a managed portfolio of stocks. However, for non-professional investors,
   it is too complicated to make subjective judgments on available stocks
   and thus they might be interested to follow an expert's investment
   decision. For this purpose, it is critical to find an expert with
   similar investment preferences. In this work, we propose to benefit from
   the power of Social Network Analysis in this domain. We first build a
   social network of financial experts based on their publicly available
   portfolios. This social network is then used for further analysis to
   recommend an appropriate managed portfolio to non-professional investors
   based on their behavioral similarities to the expert investors. This
   approach is evaluated through a case study on real portfolios. The
   result shows that the proposed portfolio recommendation approach works
   well in terms of Sharpe ratio as the portfolio performance metric.}},

Abstract = {{A single-liquid-core/liquid-clad L-2 optical waveguide/coupler is
   studied numerically. The device consists of a large aspect
   ratio-microchannel isothermally heated on its both parallel flat walls.
   Steady state laminar Poiseuille flow of cold water which is introduced
   to the heated-microchannel forms a stable thermal boundary layer
   adjacent to the isothermal heated walls. Thermal boundary layer
   development causes the lateral refractive index gradient across the
   channel which is required for waveguiding. At a particular mass flow
   rate for a given wall temperature, the wave guiding occurs. Since the
   thermal boundary layer, cladding region, is actively tunable through
   varying both surface temperature and mass flow rate, The wave guiding
   effect along the channel is highly configurable. We demonstrated that
   the excitation in the flow direction leads to defocusing of the beam at
   fundamental TE mode. By reversing the flow direction, the Counter-flow
   excitation of the waveguide also results in focusing effects. The
   current wave guide can be exploited as an integrated optical coupler at
   specific channel wall temperature and mass flow rate.}},

Abstract = {{Breast elastography has been proposed as a novel imaging modality for
   breast cancer detection and assessment. As pathologies are known to
   change tissue stiffness significantly, the idea behind elastography is
   using tissue stiffness as imaging contrast agent. Evidence in the
   literature suggests that various pathological tissues exhibit different
   mechanical stiffness characteristics. Therefore, in addition to the
   ability of detecting the presence of abnormalities, elastography is
   capable of pathological tissue classification. In this work, we propose
   a novel nonlinear (hyperelastic) breast elastography system which takes
   into account tissue large deformations resulting from mechanical
   stimulation. To idealize breast tissue, we use the well-known
   Veronda-Westman model as the forward problem solution in the
   hyperelastic parameter reconstruction process. This process involves
   tissue mechanical stimulation, displacement data acquisition followed by
   solving an inverse problem to find the hyperelastic parameters
   iteratively. These parameters are useful for in vivo tumor
   classification, image guided surgery and Virtual Reality systems
   development. Due to the exponential form of the Veronda-Westman
   function, however, this model cannot be solved using inverse-matrix
   techniques. Therefore, we have developed a novel technique to solve the
   corresponding nonlinear inverse problem. To validate the technique, we
   used an experimental breast tissue mimicking phantom that was made up of
   PVA-C (Polyvinyl Alcohol), which exhibits nonlinear mechanical behavior.
   Displacement data was acquired using a combination of Time Domain
   Cross-Correlation Estimation (TDE) and Horn-Schunck Optical Flow
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a real-time prostate elastography
   reconstruction technique which incorporates an accelerated method of
   tissue stress calculation in its algorithms. The accelerated FE method
   uses a database of prostate-tumor configurations obtained from imaging.
   These configurations undergoing specific mechanical loading, e.g. US
   probe, are modeled and analyzed using conventional FEM to obtain the
   corresponding stress fields. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used
   to obtain the main modes of shape and stress fields. As such, the shape
   and stress fields can be described by these main modes weighted by a
   small number of weight factors. Next, an efficient mapping technique is
   developed to relate the weight factors of shape to those of the stress
   fields. We used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and PCA based regression
   for this mapping. Once the mapping function is obtained it can be used
   for analyzing prostate shapes not included in the database. For a
   typical prostate, our results indicate that analysis using our technique
   takes less than 0.1 seconds on a desktop computer irrespective of the
   model size, while the maximum stress error is less than 5\% per element.
   This mapping is then used for our novel real-time Young's modulus
   reconstruction technique in which prostate and tumor moduli are updated
   iteratively using strain images acquired from an ultrasound imaging
   system and stress field estimated with the proposed method. Results of
   elastography show that relative Young's moduli can be reconstructed
   fairly accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Geospatial tools and techniques are becoming more important for land
   surveyors to do their off-location inspections of the urban areas.
   Accurate geocoded street-level images are the base of these tools. For
   these applications, an error of 2.5 meters is tolerable. However, the
   geographic coordinates provided by GPS have error up to 10 meters. In
   this paper we propose an automatic method to improve the accuracy of
   geocoding of street-level images by registering them to the accurate
   geocoded reference image, which is the satellite image. The proposed
   technique uses an unconstrained nonlinear optimization method to find
   local optimal solutions by matching high-level features and their
   relative locations. A global optimization method is then employed over
   all of the local solutions by applying a geometric constraint. We used
   our algorithm for correcting the geographic information of more than
   2500 fisheye images and show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an
   average error of 1.19 meters along both x and y directions.}},

   The MDIPW is able to adjust its forms of expression through creating
   associations between feature-based models and manufacturing resources.
   These associations as representation of knowledge are embedded into the

Abstract = {{A power management strategy for a standalone photovoltaic/battery hybrid
   system is investigated in this paper. A pair of DC-DC converters are
   used to interface a photovoltaic (PV) array and a lead-acid battery bank
   to a common DC-link. The presented control strategy manages the power
   flow between the converters and the load in order to maintain the power
   balance in the system and enable the battery to support the PV array
   when the available PV power is insufficient to meet the load. A
   multi-loop strategy is used to control the converters taking into
   account battery charge rate limits and state-of-charge constraints. The
   resulting control system is implemented without the need for discrete
   state or programmatic elements. One supplementary loop monitors the
   battery state-of-charge and the PV operating point is adjusted to avoid
   overcharge. Another loop ensures the system power balance when the
   battery is charging at its charging current limit. The controller
   design, analysis, and experimental validation results for a 2 kW
   prototype system under several operating scenarios are presented and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Regulating the directional flow of very small quantities of fluid along
   narrow microchannels has been an on-going challenge for Lab-on-a-Chip
   (LOC) technologies. The control and precise delivery of minute
   quantities of liquid is often accomplished by an externally controlled
   microvalve. A thin porous photoelectric film that controls the expansion
   and contraction of an ionic polymer actuator, or hydrogel microvalve, is
   described in this paper. The light driven transducer is comprised of an
   ultra-thin layer of oriented photosensitive bacteriorhodopsin (bR)
   purple membrane (PM) patches which are self-assembled on a
   bio-functionalized gold (Au) coated porous anodic alumina substrate.
   When exposed to visible light, the proton pumps formed by the bR PMs
   generate a unidirectional flow of ions through the very tiny pores of
   the Au-coated substrate altering the pH of two separated ionic
   solutions. The change in pH in the target solution is sufficient to
   induce isomotic pressure within the hydrogel microvalve and drive volume
   expansion. Preliminary experiments are performed using the light-driven
   proton pumps and an ionic hydrogel microvalve constructed from
   2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and acrylic acid (AA) monomers. The
   investigative study shows that an 8 mu m gap in a microchannel could be
   closed using a focused light beam. Further studies are, however,
   required to optimize important design parameters and fabrication steps
   to improve performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on control challenges caused by the slave-arm
   flexibility in master-slave telerobotic systems. Apart from time delay,
   the nonlinear non-minimum phase deflection of flexible-link slave
   manipulators creates extra challenges for control of telerobotic
   systems. These challenges have forced most of the prior research to use
   basic simplifications. In this paper, we try to remove most of the
   simplifications using a more realistic model for slave deflections. The
   degrading effects of flexibility on stability and performance of
   conventional telerobotics architectures are analyzed. Then, the standard
   Extended Lawrence Four-Channel (ELFC) control architecture is modified
   to obtain the stability condition and to enhance performance. Finally,
   the input-to-output stability (IOS) Small-Gain Theorem is used to
   generalize the stability criteria for varying delay and to remove the
   restrictive assumption of deflection-linearity. The proposed
   architecture consists of a local Partial Feedback Linearization scheme
   embedded into a modified ELFC architecture. This study is motivated by
   the use of light-weight cable driven tools in telerobotic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{In master-slave teleoperator systems used for tele-rehabilitation
   purposes, the passivity can be violated because of the assistive actions

   of such a system would defeat the purpose of the assistive therapy. In
   this paper, a design framework is presented that does not rely on

   stability and transparency properties of the telerehabilitation system
   in the case of intrinsically non-passive behaviour of the therapist. In
   particular, a stabilization scheme for the networked tele-rehabilitation
   system is proposed which guarantees stability regardless of the specific

Abstract = {{Equalization of fast time-varying channels is impacted by short
   coherence time and deep signal fading, especially in vehicle-to-vehicle
   communications due to the high mobility of user terminals. Furthermore,
   the stringent latency requirement of safety applications, such as
   collision avoidance, cannot tolerate high-complexity operations and long
   processing time. In order to achieve both requirements of equalization
   accuracy and short latency for fast varying channels, we propose a new
   model-based time-domain equalizer. In this equalizer, estimation and
   equalization are performed in two parallel parts to shorten the
   processing time. In main path, data symbols pass through an equalizer
   preset with the up-to-date channel impulse response. Since the channel
   variation model remains invariable for sufficiently long time, the
   current channel is estimated in parallel path from a number of past
   channel impulse responses to improve the accuracy. However, the channel
   variation during the long processing time of estimation leads to
   equalization error. Therefore, a predictor is used to update the channel
   response related to the processing delay, and perform the channel
   estimation beyond the channel coherence time. Thus, high accuracy and
   delay-free equalization can be achieved through this parallel structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a load management device for the load
   management of a distribution network in presence of Electric Vehicles
   (EV). With a projected EV penetration of up to 50\% by 2050, the life
   expectancy of already overloaded utility transformers and other network
   assets needs to be investigated to accommodate large penetration of EV
   loads. This research work has been done in collaboration with the local
   utility London Hydro, to create a device that is capable of handling
   heavy residential loads, and providing network control of loads, such
   as, EVs to increase better network asset management. Two Atmel
   microcontroller based hardware boards are used. One hardware board is
   used to get load information from the utility transformer whereas the
   other is used to control the EV loads and household appliances. Based on
   the load information from the transformer, one microcontroller sends
   control signal to the other controller running on customer premises to
   switch ON/OFF the EV load or any other appliances thus controlling the
   load on the network. The main purpose of this device is to automatically
   reallocate loads in an attempt to prevent damage to overhead residential
   transformers due to overloading and also offers the capability of
   reducing consumer energy use. This device when installed in a utility
   network will reduce cost to the home owner, and will increase network
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{A thorough analysis of the harmonic characteristics of a feeder in the
   London Hydro distribution system is presented in this paper. This feeder
   interconnects several solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays as well as two
   shunt capacitor banks. Harmonic measurements were acquired over one week
   at critical locations in the feeder. The analysis highlights higher than
   expected harmonic distortion levels, though still within limits
   established in IEEE 519-1992. Harmonics injected by the solar systems
   are partially additive, contributing approximately 0.1\% to the total
   harmonic distortion (THD) at the feeder terminal. Significant 3rd, 5th,
   7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th harmonic levels are discovered. Although the
   system is not subject to an immediate risk, future addition of
   inverter-based distributed generation (DG) coupled with possible
   resonant conditions presents the prospect of a rise in harmonic
   distortion levels beyond acceptable limits.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, investigations are carried out to explore the impact of
   generator distance phase backup protection (Relay (21)) on the generator
   overexcitation thermal capability. These investigations have included
   the performance of Relay (21) when it is set to provide thermal backup
   for the generator during two common system disturbances, namely a system
   fault and a sudden application of a large system load while the
   overexcitation limiter (OEL) is in service. The results of these
   investigations have shown that the current setting of Relay (21) for
   generator thermal backup protection restricts the overexcitation thermal
   capability of the generator. Such a restriction does not allow the
   generator to supply its maximum reactive power during such events. The
   paper highlights the need for conducting in-depth dynamic stability
   studies to evaluate the existing setting of the generator distance phase
   backup protection relay in order to allow the generator to fulfill the
   system requirements during major disturbances to ensure adequate level
   of voltage stability.}},

Abstract = {{This papers presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential of
   sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) in Type-1 wind farms connected to Line
   Commutated Converter (LCC) based HVDC transmission line. Since series
   compensated lines are also known to cause induction generator effect SSR
   in Type 1 wind turbine generators, this paper also considers a series
   compensated line in parallel with the HVDC line for the investigation of
   potential SSR. CIGRE Benchmark HVDC system and IEEE First Benchmark
   system are considered as the study system components. A dynamic model of
   the study system is developed and linearized at several operating points
   for eigenvalue analysis of the potential of SSR. A sensitivity study of
   the SSR modes with respective to variation in different model parameter
   such as rectifier firing angle, DC line power flow, series compensation
   level is also reported. It is found that HVDC rectifier station current
   regulator does not interact with any subsynchronous modes of the wind
   turbine generator. Hence, the operation of a Type-1 wind farm connected
   to series compensated line and HVDC line is may not be subject to SSR
   issues. However, when the wind farm operates radially with the series
   compensated line, it may experience SSR oscillation due to induction
   generator effect.}},

Abstract = {{The tuned liquid damper (TLD) is a proven and an increasingly popular
   auxiliary device for mitigating the dynamic effects induced by wind
   loading on tall buildings. As buildings become taller, lighter, and more
   flexible, there is a greater contribution from the dynamic component.
   The most reliable tool for assessing the dynamic component is wind
   tunnel testing. A boundary layer wind tunnel is capable of accurately
   calculating an equivalent static wind load (ESWL) acting on a building.
   The current study investigates the reduction in the ESWL of a
   lateral-torsional coupled building with a TLD system installed. The
   building is sensitive to torsion in the first two vibration modes. The
   current investigation uses three unique multi-modal TLD systems designed
   specifically for a lateral-torsional coupled building. The building ESWL
   is evaluated with the TLD systems using measurements from tests
   conducted at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at Western

Abstract = {{Nanowires and nanotubes of diverse material compositions, properties
   and/or functions have been produced or fabricated through various
   bottom-up or top-down approaches. These nanowires or nanotubes have also
   been utilized as potential building blocks for functional nanodevices.
   The key for the integration of those nanowire or nanotube based devices
   is to assemble these one dimensional nanomaterials to specific locations
   using techniques that are highly controllable and scalable. Ideally such
   techniques should enable assembly of highly uniform nanowire/nanotube
   arrays with precise control of density, location, dimension or even
   material types of nanowires/nanotubes. Numerous assembly techniques are
   being developed that can quickly align and assemble large quantities of
   one type or multiple types of nanowires through parallel processes,
   including flow-assisted alignment, Langmuir-Blodgett assembly,
   bubble-blown technique, electric/magnetic-field directed assembly,
   contact/roll printing, knocking-down, etc.. With these assembling
   techniques, applications of nanowire/nanotube based devices such as
   flexible electronics and sensors have been demonstrated. This paper
   delivers an overall review of directed nanowire/nanotube assembling
   approaches and analyzes advantages and limitations of each method. The
   future research directions have also been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at exploring the effect of force feedback on the
   performance of a knot-tightening task in robotics-assisted minimally
   invasive surgery (RAMIS). In this work, we evaluate performance during
   the knot-tightening task in three scenarios: without force feedback,
   with visual force feedback and with direct force reflection on the
   subject's hand. Different performance measures have been implemented:
   quality of the knot, amount and consistency of the tightening force
   applied on the suture, user's control of the instrument, tissue damage,
   and task completion time. Seven subjects participated in this study and
   were asked to tighten the second throw of surgical knots using a dual
   arm teleoperation system that is capable of force reflection in 7
   Degrees of Freedom (DOFs), 6-DOF rigid body motion plus the gripper. The
   results show that visual force feedback allows superior performance in
   the quality of the suture knots with high consistency in the tightening
   force, while direct force feedback can significantly improve the user's
   control of the instrument.}},

Abstract = {{A Modular Voltage-Source Inverter (MVSI) uses individual three-phase
   modules in a shunt connection to share the total power in a symmetrical
   manner. The operation of paralleled inverters, however, results in the
   appearance of zero-sequence current that circulates among the inverter
   modules. Moreover, conventional PWM techniques do not take advantage of
   the modular structure of MVSIs to improve harmonic content. In this
   paper, a new selective harmonic elimination (SHE) PWM technique that
   eliminates more harmonics than convention techniques current is proposed
   in the paper. In the paper, the basic principles of conventional SHE-PWM
   are reviewed, then the proposed PWM technique is introduced and
   explained, and then it is shown how the proposed technique can be just
   as good in reducing zero-sequence circulating current as conventional
   methods. The concepts discussed in the paper are confirmed with results
   obtained from an experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{We consider amplify-and-forward multi-antenna relaying between a single
   pair of source and destination under per-antenna power constraints. Our
   objective is to obtain the optimal relay processing matrix to minimize
   the maximum individual antenna power for a given received SNR target.
   The problem is not convex, but it can be shown to satisfy strong
   Lagrange duality. We reveal a prominent structure of this problem, by
   establishing its duality with direct point-to-point SIMO beamforming
   with an uncertain noise. This enables us to derive a semi-closed form
   expression for the optimal relay processing matrix that depends on a set
   of dual variables, thus converting the original optimization of a NxN
   matrix with (N+1) constraints, to a dual problem with (N+1) variables
   and three constraints. We further show that the dual problem has a
   semi-definite programming form, so that the proposed solution has
   polynomial worst-case complexity.}},

   allocated to the users in a distributed way with the purpose of

   for each channel. The interferences caused by the channel partial

Abstract = {{Information security is becoming a critical challenge in wireless
   communications due to the open nature of wireless channels and the
   transparency of standardized transmission schemes. Among the various
   wireless security techniques, user authentication is one essential
   measure to identify legitimate users and protect the integrity of
   transmissions. In this paper, a novel physical layer authentication
   scheme is proposed to enhance the communication security by exploiting
   the unique characteristics of oscillator in each communication device.
   In realistic scenarios, radio frequency (RF) oscillators in each
   transmitter and receiver pair always present some bias to the nominal
   carrier frequency due to manufacturing limitations and operating
   conditions. This bias is characterized by a device-dependent carrier
   frequency offset (CFO), which can be used to identify a specific
   wireless transmitter. In the proposed authentication scheme, the CFO at
   different time of the received signal is first estimated. It is then
   examined by a hypothesis testing to determine whether the signal has the
   consistent CFO for authentication purpose. Adaptive thresholds of CFO
   variation are derived for user discrimination based on the received
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results further confirm the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme in multipath fading environments.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the development of an indoor-to-outdoor signal
   propagation model, which can be used to analyze and reduce the
   interference in various wireless communication networks, particularly 4G
   networks with femtocells and macrocells. The developed model is based on
   generating a large number of floor plans with random, but realistic,
   designs and use signal attenuation models to analyze the statistical
   properties of the signal at a certain distance from the indoor
   transmitter after penetrating through several layers of construction
   materials such as wall, doors and windows. Further studies conducted
   using the developed model demonstrated that the walls and buildings
   could be exploited to act like a shield that reduces the mutual
   interference of indoor and outdoor transmitters as in the case of
   femtocells. As an application, the proposed model is used to investigate
   the effect of the placement of an indoor transmitter on the signal level
   outdoors. The obtained results demonstrated that optimizing the location
   of the indoor transmitter can reduce the power leakage to the outdoor
   environment by about 18.5 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Recent development in wireless communication-based positioning systems
   using time-of-arrival (TOA) methods poses a significant challenge for
   the estimation of signal propagation time in indoor environments. Due to
   the possible obstruction of the direct path, the signal component from
   direct propagation can be very weak and therefore, the performance of
   TOA estimation will be significantly degraded, especially when the
   received signal experiences severe multipath propagation effects. An
   optimal direct path detection algorithm using multipath interference
   cancellation is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy of
   communication-based positioning systems. By maximizing the probability
   of correct identification between the strong interfering paths and
   noise-only paths, an optimal threshold is derived for interfering
   multipath component selection. The interference of multipath components
   is reconstructed and then subtracted from the received signal to enhance
   the accuracy of direct path detection. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is verified by simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new control of PV solar system as a STATCOM,
   termed PV-STATCOM, for faster post-fault voltage recovery, thereby
   avoiding the voltage instability of a neighboring critical induction
   motor load. Distributed Generators (DGs), such as PV solar systems, are
   typically required to disconnect upon detection of fault according to
   the current grid code of DG interconnection. Although, the preferred
   industry trend is to allow them to remain connected with Low Voltage
   Ride Through (LVRT) capabilities. In this paper, a case study is
   presented where an induction motor close to a PV solar system becomes
   unstable due to slow post fault voltage recovery. A fast fault detection
   control strategy is utilized in the PV solar system to disconnect the PV
   solar panels and convert the PV solar system inverter into a STATCOM,
   thereby providing rapid reactive power support to stabilize the voltage.
   This novel control strategy of utilizing the PV solar farm temporarily
   as a STATCOM after the fault prevents a critical induction motor from
   becoming unstable.}},

Abstract = {{Positioning based on digital television (DTV) broadcasting systems has
   attracted considerable attention due to the high transmission power and
   wide coverage of DTV broadcasting stations in Single Frequency Networks
   (SFNs). The significant challenge with positioning in SFN is the strong
   interference from neighboring stations due to the large dynamic range of
   signals' strength from different DTV stations. In this paper, a
   progressive interference cancellation algorithm is proposed to enhance
   the accuracy of signal detection and time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation of
   different DTV stations. The interference from stronger (e.g., closer)
   stations is first reconstructed based on DTV demodulation and channel
   estimation results, and cancelled from the overall received signal prior
   to detecting the signal from the desired station. Therefore, the
   accuracy of TOA estimation of each station is progressively improved.
   The performance of the positioning system with the proposed interference
   cancellation is evaluated through computer simulations under different
   signal propagation scenarios. Simulation results show that high accuracy
   can be obtained with the proposed positioning system.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic solar farms generate power only during daytime and remain
   completely idle during the nights. This paper presents a novel
   technology of utilizing Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Farms in the nighttime.
   New controls are developed for the solar farm inverters to operate as
   STATCOM - a Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) Controller, using
   the entire inverter capacity in the night for accomplishing various
   power system objectives, such as voltage regulation, improvement of
   power transfer capacity, load compensation, etc. During the daytime, the
   same objectives can be achieved to a substantial degree with the
   inverter capacity remaining after real power generation. This technology
   is termed PV-STATCOM. Two novel applications of solar farms operating as
   PV-STATCOM in realistic transmission and distribution systems are
   presented in this paper. These are : i) Improving power transfer
   capacity of transmission lines.; and ii) Increasing the connectivity of

Abstract = {{The Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS) on the
   Odin satellite is currently in its 12th year of observing the Earth's
   limb. For the first time, continuous temperature profiles extending from
   the stratopause to the upper mesosphere have been derived from OSIRIS
   measurements of Rayleigh-scattered sunlight. Through most of the
   mesosphere, OSIRIS temperatures are in good agreement with coincident
   temperature profiles derived from other satellite and ground-based
   measurements. In the altitude region of 55-80 km, OSIRIS temperatures
   are typically within 4-5 K of those from the SABER, ACE-FTS, and SOFIE
   instruments on the TIMED, SciSat-I, and AIM satellites, respectively.
   The mean differences between individual OSIRIS profiles and those of the
   other satellite instruments are typically within the combined
   uncertainties and previously reported biases. OSIRIS temperatures are
   typically within 2 K of those from the University of Western Ontario's
   Purple Crow Lidar in the altitude region of 52-79 km, where the mean
   differences are within combined uncertainties. Near 84 km, OSIRIS
   temperatures exhibit a cold bias of 10-15 K, which is due to a cold bias
   in OSIRIS O-2 A-band temperatures at 85 km, the upper boundary of the
   Rayleigh-scatter derived temperatures; and near 48 km OSIRIS
   temperatures exhibit a cold bias of 5-15 K, which is likely due to
   multiple-scatter effects that are not taken into account in the
   retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, design of Takagi-Sugeno controllers for a twin-rotor
   system from empirical data is addressed. First, identification of linear
   models using Prediction Error Method in the presence of nonlinear
   distortions and in feedback systems is revisited, and it is demonstrated
   that feedback nonlinear systems with an integral action can be locally
   represented by linear models rather than affine models. Moreover, it is
   demonstrated that how the consistency and unbiasedness of the identified
   models can be improved by proper design of the experiments. In order to
   ensure that the unmodeled contributions in the resulting piecewise
   linear model are sufficiently small, a criterion is proposed based on
   the small-gain theorem that can be used for unfalsification of the
   piecewise linear model. Finally, by taking advantage of the separation
   principle, design of fuzzy Takag-Sugeno state feedback and observer is
   formulated in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The
   implementation results on the actual system demonstrate significant
   improvements with respect to the initial controller and previous work on
   similar systems.}},

Abstract = {{The human neck is susceptible to traumatic injuries due to impacts as
   well as chronic injuries caused by loads such as those attributed to the
   wearing of heavy headgear. To facilitate the analysis of the loads that
   cause injuries to the cervical spine, it is possible to replicate the
   human neck's behaviour with mechanical devices. The goal of this work is
   to lay the foundation for the eventual development of a novel mechanism
   used to simulate the behaviour of the cervical spine during laboratory
   experiments. The research presented herein focuses on the design of a
   mechanism capable of reproducing the non-linear relationships between
   moments applied to the C3 vertebra and its corresponding rotations with
   respect to the C4 vertebra. The geometrical and mechanical properties of
   the mechanism are optimized based on the ability of the latter to
   replicate the load-deflection profile of the osteoligamentous structure
   of the C3-C4 vertebral pair in the flexion-extension and lateral bending
   directions. The results show that the proposed design concept is capable
   of faithfully replicating the non-linear behaviour of the motion segment
   within acceptable tolerances.}},

Title = {{A biomechanical comparison of four different cementless press-fit stems

Abstract = {{Few biomechanical studies exist on femoral cementless press-fit stems
   for revision total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries. The aim of this
   study was to compare the mechanical quality of the femur-stem interface
   for a series of commercially available press-fit stems, because this
   interface may be a `weak link' which could fail earlier than the
   femur-TKR bond itself. Also, the femur-stem interface may become
   particularly critical if distal femur bone degeneration, which may
   necessitate or follow revision TKR, ever weakens the femur-TKR bond
   itself. The authors implanted five synthetic femurs each with a Sigma
   Short Stem (SSS), Sigma Long Stem (SLS), Genesis II Short Stem (GSS), or
   Genesis II Long Stem (GLS). Axial stiffness, lateral stiffness, `offset
   load' torsional stiffness, and `offset load' torsional strength were
   measured with a mechanical testing system using displacement control.
   Axial (range = 1047-1461 N/mm, p = 0.106), lateral (range = 415-462N/mm,
   p = 0.297), and torsional (range = 115-139 N/mm, p > 0.055) stiffnesses
   were not different between groups. The SSS had higher torsional strength
   (863 N) than the other stems (range = 167-197 N, p < 0.001). Torsional
   failure occurred by femoral `spin' around the stem's long axis. There
   was poor linear correlation between the femur-stem interface area versus
   axial stiffness (R = 0.38) and torsional stiffness (R = 0.38), and there
   was a moderate linear correlation versus torsional strength (R = 0.55).
   Yet, there was a high inverse linear correlation between interfacial
   surface area versus lateral stiffness (R = 0.79), although this did not
   result in a statistical difference between stem groups (p = 0.297).
   These press-fit stems provide equivalent stability, except that the SSS
   has greater torsional strength.}},

Abstract = {{Many computer vision applications can be formulated as labeling
   problems. However, multilabeling problems are usually very challenging
   to solve, especially when some ordering constraints are enforced. We
   solve in this paper a five-parts labeling problem proposed in {[}6, 7].
   In this model, one wants to find an optimal labeling for an image with
   five possible parts: ``left{''}, ``right{''}, ``top{''}, ``bottom{''}
   and ``center{''}. The geometric ordering constraints can be read
   naturally from the names. No previous method can solve the problem with
   globally optimal solutions in a linear space complexity. We propose an
   efficient dynamic programming based algorithm which guarantees the
   global optimal labeling for the five-parts model. The time complexity is
   O(N-1.5) and the space complexity is O(N), with N being the number of
   pixels in the image. In practice, it runs faster than previous methods.
   Moreover, it works for both 4-neighborhood and 8-neighborhood settings,
   and can be easily parallelized for GPU.}},

Abstract = {{Series compensation is being increasingly considered for increasing
   transmission capacity for integration of large wind farms. This paper
   presents the potential of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in large
   squirrel cage induction generator based wind farms connected to the
   series compensated transmission line. In order to suppress the unstable
   SSR oscillations, a STATCOM with suitable controller is proposed at the
   terminal of the wind farm. A detailed linear state space model is
   developed for the wind farm, transmission system which is a modified
   IEEE First SSR Benchmark system and the STATCOM. Eigenvalues are
   calculated for a wide range of wind farm power outputs and series
   compensation levels. The potential of SSR involving both induction
   generator effect and torsional interaction is investigated in-depth. The
   eigenvalues obtained from the linear state space model are validated
   through the electromagnetic transient simulation carried out with PSCAD/
   EMTDC software. It is shown that SSR may potentially occur for large
   wind farms at higher level of series compensation which can be mitigated
   by the STATCOM with an appropriate controller.}},

Abstract = {{The connection of Distributed Generation (DG) to the distribution system

Abstract = {{Land use regression (LUR) models have been widely used to characterize
   the spatial distribution of urban air pollution and estimate exposure in
   epidemiologic studies. However, spatial patterns of air pollution vary
   greatly between cities due to local source type and distribution.
   London, Ontario, Canada, is a medium-sized city with relatively few and
   isolated industrial point sources, which allowed the study to focus on
   the contribution of different transportation sectors to urban air
   pollution. This study used LUR models to estimate the spatial
   distribution of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and to identify local sources
   influencing NO2 concentrations in London, ON. Passive air sampling was
   conducted at 50 locations throughout London over a 2-week period in
   May-June 2010. NO2 concentrations at the monitored locations ranged from
   2.8 to 8.9 ppb, with a median of 5.2 ppb. Industrial land use, dwelling
   density, distance to highway, traffic density, and length of railways
   were significant predictors of NO2 concentrations in the final LUR
   model, which explained 78\% of NO2 variability in London. Traffic and
   dwelling density explained most of the variation in NO2 concentrations,
   which is consistent with LUR models developed in other Canadian cities.
   We also observed the importance of local characteristics. Specifically,
   17\% of the variation was explained by distance to highways, which
   included the impacts of heavily traveled corridors transecting the
   southern periphery of the city. Two large railway yards and railway
   lines throughout central areas of the city explained 9\% of NO2
   variability. These results confirm the importance of traditional LUR
   variables and highlight the importance of including a broader array of
   local sources in LUR modeling. Finally, future analyses will use the
   model developed in this study to investigate the association between
   ambient air pollution and cardiovascular disease outcomes, including
   plaque burden, cholesterol, and hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new open-loop model for a Magneto-Rheological (MR)
   based actuator is presented. The model consists of two parts relating
   the output torque of the actuator to its internal magnetic field, and
   the internal magnetic field to the applied current. Each part possesses
   its own hysteretic behavior. The first part uses an open-loop Bouc-Wen
   model to relate the output torque to internal magnetic field. The second
   part uses a novel nonlinear adaptive observer that relates the internal
   magnetic field to the applied current. The model facilitates accurate
   control of the actuator using its input current. It also eliminates the
   need for force/torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The
   accuracy of the constructed model is validated through simulations. The
   overall model as well as each part of it is assessed against a widely
   accepted hysteresis modeling approach, known as the Preisach model and
   its advantages are highlighted. The second part of model is also
   compared to Bingham model which has been broadly employed in modeling of
   MR fluid dynamic. Bouc-Wen model shows higher accuracy in capturing
   hysteretic behavior of MR fluid in comparison to non-hysteretic Bingham
   model. Experimental results using the prototyped actuation mechanism
   further verify the accuracy of the model and demonstrate its
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new tactile-force integrated method to localize
   tumors minimally invasively using robotic assistance. This method relies
   on using a capacitive sensor at the tip of a Tactile Sensing Instrument
   (TSI) which can be inserted into a patient's body in a minimally
   invasive manner. In this work, the operator palpates tissue containing
   tumors in a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) training box, representing
   the patient's body, through a master-slave teleoperation system which
   consists of a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface, used as the
   master, and a Mitsubishi PA10-7C robot as the slave. Using the proposed
   method, the operator would be able to palpate the tissue consistently,
   observe the pressure distribution over the tissue by a color contour map
   on a screen and feel the tumor on his/her fingers through a grasping
   mechanism of the haptic interface as a result of higher stiffness of the
   tumor. The tissue used for the experiments was ex vivo bovine lung and
   seven participants were asked to locate artificial tumors embedded in
   the lungs. The results show an accuracy of 93\% in tumor localization
   using the proposed method while the average force applied to the tissue
   was 3.42N and the force never exceeded 6N.}},

Abstract = {{Catheter-based cardiac ablation is an interventional treatment for heart
   arrhythmias. Pull-wire steerable catheters are guided to the heart
   chambers through the vasculature in order to deliver energy to destroy
   faulty electrical pathways in the heart. The effectiveness of this
   treatment is dependent on the accuracy of positioning the catheter tip
   at the target location and also on maintaining contact with the target
   while the heart is beating. Therefore, it is desirable to perform hybrid
   force/position control of the catheter tip. We have studied the problem
   of modeling the distal part of a steerable catheter using beam theory
   and have developed and validated a static force-deflection model through
   extensive experiments. It is shown that the model can estimate the shape
   of the bending section of a catheter using force information and without
   requiring extensive knowledge of the catheter's internal structure.}},

   be filtered. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns

Abstract = {{An iterative design method for Orthogonal Frequency Division
   Multiplexing (OFDM) system parameter estimation and synchronization
   under a blind scenario for cognitive radio systems is proposed in this
   paper. A novel envelope spectrum-based arbitrary oversampling ratio
   estimator is presented first, based on which the algorithms are then
   developed to provide the identification of other OFDM parameters (number
   of subcarriers, cyclic prefix (CP) length). Carrier frequency offset
   (CFO) and timing offset are estimated for the purpose of synchronization
   with the help of the identified parameters. An iterative scheme is
   employed to increase the estimation accuracy. To validate the proposed
   design, the performance is evaluated under an experimental propagation
   environment and the results show that the proposed design is capable of
   adapting blind parameter estimation and synchronization for cognitive
   radio with improved performances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple and novel digital control scheme for a
   power factor correction (PFC) AC/DC boost converter based on
   Control-Lyapunov function theory. It is shown in this paper that the
   dynamics of the boost converter can be significantly improved by
   implementing the proposed controller, which introduces a Lyapunov
   function to the system and determines the optimal converter duty-ratio
   needed to minimize the Lyapunov function. The performance of the
   proposed controller is confirmed on a digitally controlled 3 kW boost
   PFC converter operating at 100 kHz switching frequency. Experimental
   results show that the proposed controller causes the boost converter to
   operate with low input current harmonics and very fast output voltage
   transient responses that are much less than a single input line cycle,
   compared to responses of several input line cycle transient periods seen
   in conventional control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{DC/DC converters in electric vehicles (EVs) use planar magnetics to
   minimize their size and weight an to increase their ability to withstand
   mechanical vibrations. Typical planar transformers (PT) in DC/DC
   converters used in EVs have high inter-turn and inter-layer capacitances
   that cause them to draw high peak currents, increase voltage overshoot
   across secondary rectifying devices, and increase leakage current, which
   causes EMI problems. The paper proposes a novel winding layout strategy
   to mitigate the stray capacitance of planar transformers and also reduce
   overall EMI of a full-bridge DC-DC converter. The effectiveness of the
   proposed winding strategy is validated by analytical and experimental
   results that are presented in the paper.}},

Title = {{Estimation of the Orthotropic Elastic Properties of the Rat Eardrum}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{225-234}},
Abstract = {{Finite-element models of the eardrum are developed to understand its
   function. Accurate models can potentially be used to optimize diagnostic
   tests and surgical procedures. However, modeling accuracy depends on the
   elastic properties specified when constructing the models. Although the
   eardrum is an orthotropic elastic structure whose stiffness varies in
   the radial and circumferential directions, for simplicity, many
   investigators have measured the eardrum's elastic properties
   (specifically Young's modulus) under the assumption of isotropy, thus
   limiting the applicability of these measurements. Whether the eardrum is
   assumed to be isotropic or orthotropic, most measurements of its
   properties are made using strips cut from the pars tensa. However,
   cutting can potentially cause damage to soft tissue. In this work,
   existing indentation-based and pressurization-based methods were
   extended for estimating the orthotropic elastic properties of the
   eardrum in situ. The two methods are initially tested using synthetic
   data with controlled amounts of noise. The results indicate that for the
   pressurization-based method, estimated elastic parameter values are
   within 10\% of the known values used to generate synthetic data when the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 2 or greater. An SNR of 200 or greater is
   required when using the indentation-based method to achieve error of
   less than 10\%. The indentation-based method is applied to the rat
   eardrum for which experimental measurements of load-displacement curves
   are available in the literature, yielding average elastic orthotropic
   moduli values of E-C = 23.4 +/- 1.6 MPa (circumferential direction), E-R
   = 58.7 +/- 4.2 MPa (radial direction), and G(CR) = 35.6 +/- 3.3 MPa
   using an average uniform pars-tensa thickness of 12 mu m.}},

Title = {{Elastin-Derived Peptides Induce Inflammatory Responses through the
   Activation of NF-kappa B in Human Ligamentum Flavum Cells}},
Journal = {{CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{407-414}},
Abstract = {{The formation of fibrotic tissue in the ligamentum flavum (LF) is
   usually preceded by breakdown of elastic fibers. Elastin-derived
   peptides (EDPs) from breakdown of elastic fibers display a wide range of
   biological activities in a variety of cells, but there is minimal
   information regarding the involvement in the processes of LF
   hypertrophy. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of EDPs
   on cultured human LF cells and to investigate their molecular and
   biochemical mechanisms. Human LF cells were obtained from 18 patients
   who underwent lumbar spine surgery. After treatment with different
   concentrations of EDPs with or without specific inhibitors in culture
   medium, the viability and proliferation of LF cells, genes expression,
   and the signaling pathways were evaluated and analyzed. It was found
   that 50 mu g/ml EDPs significantly increased cell proliferation and
   synthesis of prostaglandin E-2. The gene expression and protein
   production of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 alpha
   (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, and IL-6, were also upregulated. The levels of
   p-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and NF-kappa B increased
   immediately following EDP treatment and sustained up to 90 min. It was
   also found that NF-kappa B inhibitor, but not ERK1/2 inhibitor,
   attenuated EDP-dependent induction of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6
   expression, indicating that NF-kappa B pathways are required for
   EDP-induced IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 gene expression in human LF
   cells. The results of this in vitro experiment suggest that EDPs do
   induce inflammatory responses in human LF cells and plays the key role
   in the development of LF hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The relations between acoustic measures and their
   articulatory bases have rarely been tested in dysarthria but are
   important for diagnostic and treatment purposes. We tested the
   association between acoustic measures of F2 range and F2 slope with
   kinematic measures of tongue movement displacement and speed in
   individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy
   controls speaking at normal and slow rates. Relations between acoustic
   and kinematic measures and speech intelligibility were examined.
   Results: As healthy controls reduced their speaking rate, their F2
   slopes and movement speeds decreased. In talkers with ALS, acoustic and
   kinematic variables were associated with changes in speaking rate,
   characteristic of disease progression. Participants with slow rate had
   shallower F2 slopes and slower movement speeds than those with normal
   rate. Relations between F2 range and tongue displacement were weaker. F2
   slope, displacement, and duration were correlated with speech
   intelligibility most consistently. Conclusion: Findings suggested that
   F2 slope is a useful marker for tracking disease progression in ALS. F2
   slope reflects changes in tongue function with disease progression and
   is linked to speech intelligibility. Changes in movement speed, however,
   might be the earliest sign of disease in the tongue. Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Whole-body vibration (WBV) of mobile machines used in the steel making
   industry has not previously been quantified in six-degrees-of-freedom
   (6DOF). The purpose of this paper was to quantify 6DOF vibrations during
   the daily operating tasks of 5 commonly used mobile machines types used
   in the steel making and metal smelting industries. Vibration data were
   recorded from the chassis of five commonly used mobile machines using a
   MEMSense MAG3 triaxial accelerometer \& gyroscope (MEMSense, SD, USA),
   and analyzed using custom MatlabTM code. Elevated values were observed
   at the chassis for crest factors, peak running root mean squared
   accelerations, and vibration total values, resulting in ISO 2631-1
   (1997) comfort predictions ranging from Uncomfortable to Extremely
   Uncomfortable. Vibration dominant frequencies were generally between 1
   and 8Hz. A second peak which occurred at approximately 27 Hz was
   observed for each vehicle in almost all axes. Occurring at a frequency
   that has the potential to produce negative health effects, this second
   peak was probably caused by the engine idling or running at low speeds.
   Field vibration profiles from this study have been used as inputs to a
   6DOF robot for use in a corresponding laboratory study designed to
   optimize seat selection thus allowing the steel making and other similar
   industries to select operator seats based on industry specific field
   vibration characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Highly active and stable Pt/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
   electrocatalysts for the application of proton exchange membrane fuel
   cells were developed by tuning the O/C atom ratio of RGO supports. The
   results showed that Pt nanoparticles with a narrow distribution of
   particle sizes were well dispersed on RGO, and an increased conductivity
   and stability of RGO were achieved when the Pt/RGO was deoxidized with
   an increased graphitization degree of RGO during hydrogen reduction. The
   highest activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and stability of
   Pt/RGO was obtained by hydrogen heat treatment Pt/RGO for 1 hour, in
   which the O/C atom ratio was 0.14. However, with increment of the
   reaction time, the atom ratio of O/C decreased to 0.11, the performance
   dropped sharply due to the further removal of the oxygenated groups on
   RGO, resulting in a serious aggregation of Pt nanoparticles. This study
   strongly suggested a bifunctional effect of both graphitization and the
   oxygenated groups on the catalytic activity and stabilization of metal
   (such as Pt) nanoparticles on RGO. This will open a door to apply
   graphene in fuel cells and other fields.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is a promising technology for indoor air
   purification due to low operating cost, potentially long service life,

   conventional UV light sources. Limited research has been conducted using
   UVLED PCO for air treatment. This study demonstrated the potential
   application of UVLED for the removal of volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs; toluene and xylene) from indoor air under different operating
   conditions including flow rate (25-117 cubic feet per minute {[}cfm]),
   types of catalysts (Degussa P25, sol-gel TiO2, nitrogen-doped TiO2, clay
   TiO2, and Bi2O3), LED intensity, and humidity in a continuous reactor.
   About 7-32\% VOC removal occurred depending on the experimental

Title = {{Towards modeling tumor motion in the deflated lung for minimally
   invasive ablative procedures}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER AIDED SURGERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{211-220}},
Abstract = {{A computational model is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of
   characterizing the motion of lung tumors caused by respiratory diaphragm
   forces using a tissue biomechanics approach. Compensating for such
   motion is very important for developing effective systems of minimally
   invasive tumor ablative procedures, e. g., Low Dose Rate (LDR) lung
   brachytherapy. To minimize the effects of respiratory motion, the target
   lung is almost completely deflated before starting such procedures.
   However, a significant amount of motion persists in the target lung due
   to the diaphragm contact forces required for the other lung's
   respiration. In this study, a model pipeline was developed which inputs
   a pre-operative 4D-CT image sequence of the lung to output the predicted
   3D motion trajectory of the tumor over the respiratory cycle. A finite
   element method was used in this pipeline to model the lung tissue
   deformation in order to predict the tumor motion. Experiments were
   conducted on an ex vivo porcine lung to demonstrate the performance and
   assess the accuracy of the proposed pipeline. The resultant tumor motion
   trajectory obtained from the biomechanical model of the lung was
   compared to the experimental trajectory obtained from CT imaging.
   Results were promising, suggesting that tissue mechanics-based modeling
   can be employed for effective characterization of lung tumor respiratory
   motion to improve accuracy in lung tumor ablative procedures.}},

Title = {{Kinematics and laxity of a linked total elbow arthroplasty following
   computer navigated implant positioning}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER AIDED SURGERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{249-258}},
Abstract = {{Aseptic loosening in total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) remains the most
   common cause of long-term failure. While several different mechanisms of
   implant loosening have been suggested, it is likely that one important
   underlying cause is implant malpositioning, resulting in changes in
   joint kinematics and loading. Although use of computer navigation has
   been shown to improve component positioning in other joints, no such
   system currently exists for the elbow. This study used real-time
   computer feedback for humeral, ulnar, and radial component positioning
   in 11 cadaveric extremities. An elbow motion simulator evaluated joint
   kinematics. Endosteal abutment of the stems of the humeral and ulnar
   components precluded optimal positioning in 5 and 6 specimens,
   respectively. Loss of the normal valgus angulation following elbow
   arthroplasty (p<0.05) suggests that errors in humeral component
   positioning translate directly into changes in joint kinematics during
   active motion. These findings suggest that although computer navigation
   can reproduce normal joint kinematics, optimal implant positioning may
   require a TEA system which allows for some modularity to accommodate the
   normal variations in osseous morphology of the elbow.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Micelles formed from amphiphilic copolymers are promising materials for
   the delivery of drug molecules, potentially leading to enhanced
   biological properties and efficacy. In this work, new poly(ester
   amide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEA-PEO) graft copolymers were synthesized
   and their assembly into micelles in aqueous solution was investigated.
   It was possible to tune the sizes of the micelles by varying the PEO
   content of the polymers and the method of micelle preparation. Under
   optimized conditions, it was possible to obtain micelles with diameters
   less than 100 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering and
   transmission electron microscopy. These micelles were demonstrated to
   encapsulate and release a model drug, Nile Red, and were nontoxic to
   HeLa cells as measured by an MTT assay. Overall, the properties of these
   micelles suggest that they are promising new materials for drug delivery
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, progress towards building a complete porous media model
   of the human lung is discussed. While the recent trend in computational
   fluid dynamics studies of airflow in the human lung has been to
   continually increase the size and detail of the airway tree under
   consideration, it is proposed in this work that simulating flow in the
   human lung as a coupled fluid-porous system is an effective method to
   simulate the flow in the whole lung. Under the proposed modeling
   paradigm, a truncated airway tree constitutes a fluid region which is
   coupled to a porous region that represents the remainder of the lung
   volume, containing small airways and alveoli. The first part of this
   work describes pore-level simulations conducted in an alveolated duct
   geometry, which are present in large quantities in the human lung, to
   determine its permeability. Next, volume-averaged simulations
   incorporating the results of the pore-level simulations and using a
   realistic lung geometry based on computed tomography images are
   discussed along with future directions for this work.}},

Pages = {{447-461}},
Abstract = {{Renewable resources supply only a small fraction of global energy
   demand. The majority of today's energy is supplied by fossil fuels. The
   capacity of fossil fueled facilities to produce power is not as location
   dependent as renewable energy sources. Many mainstream renewable energy
   sources like wind, solar, and hydrokinetic must be located where the
   appropriate natural resources are most abundant. Unfortunately, some of
   the most energy abundant sites for renewable installations (high winds,
   strong sea currents) are located where climactic conditions are severe
   and icing is prevalent. This is significant, as many renewable resources
   can be substantially or completely incapacitated by icing events. This
   is not the case for coal, natural gas, or nuclear facilities. As the
   global proportion of renewable energy infrastructure increases, dealing
   with icing issues will become more critical. In this paper, the impact
   of icing on current renewable energy resources is discussed. Renewable
   resources are categorized based on their icing conditions. Some
   comparison is made among these categories to explore how different icing
   conditions may impact potential ice mitigation schemes. It is shown that
   each of the atmospheric, gas turbine and submarine environments all pose
   icing challenges that require mostly active, energy-intensive deicing
   solutions. Such active solutions are those that require significant
   energy input to be operational and effective (e. g., heaters, shakers,
   etc.). Also, in the interest of optimizing renewable energy reliability
   and efficiency, robust and passive systems should be pursued. Passive
   solutions do not require additional energy input during operation to be
   effective (e. g., coatings, surface treatments). Such solutions will
   capitalize on surface-engineering and will be based on adhesion science
   principles. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012}},

Title = {{Controlled release of 5-fluorouracil and progesterone from magnetic
   nanoaggregates}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{3167-3189}},
Abstract = {{Background: The potential use of magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical
   applications has witnessed an exponential growth in recent years.
   Methods: In this study, we used nanoaggregates of magnetic nanoparticles
   as carriers for controlled drug delivery. The nanoaggregates are formed
   due to the presence of the block copolymer of polyethylene
   oxide-polypropylene oxide (Pluronic F-68) and beta-cyclodextrin that
   surround the magnetic core of the nanoparticles. The administration of
   the drug carriers occurs by inhalation, and the drug is delivered
   systemically via the pulmonary route. We tested the delivery of
   5-fluorouracil and progesterone, which are used as models of hydrophilic
   and hydrophobic drugs, respectively.
   Results: The estimated nanoaggregates' diameters are between 293 nm +/-
   14.65 nm and 90.2 nm +/- 4.51 nm, respectively. In-situ and
   post-synthesis techniques are two approaches for drug loading. The
   polymer composition of nanoaggregates and initial drug concentration
   showed a significant effect on both the drug entrapment efficiency and
   release kinetics. Average drug entrapment efficiencies ranged between
   16.11\% and 83.25\%. In-situ loaded samples showed significantly slower
   release rates. The drug release mechanism is investigated by
   mathematical curve fitting to different drug release kinetics models. In
   most cases, the Peppas model has shown good correlations (coefficients
   of correlation, R-2, between 0.85 and 0.99) with the examined release
   profiles. The estimated release indices are below 0.5, which indicates
   the Fickian diffusion mechanism. For samples with an initial burst
   effect, the modified Peppas model can provide a better understanding of
   the drug release mechanism, both in the samples loaded with
   progesterone, or those high polymer concentrations.
   Conclusion: Our work showed prolonged delivery of drugs (5-fluorouracil
   and progesterone) by diffusion from nanoaggregates, with the potential
   to reduce dose-related adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{The use of waste biomaterial for the adsorption of heavy metal ions is
   an economically appealing alternative to conventional metal ion removal
   methods. In the present work, S. cerevisiae biomass has been shown to be
   capable of the simultaneous removal of more than 98\% of Pb(II) ions,
   60\% of Zn(II) ions and up to 55\% of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions
   in the 10-50 mg/l concentration range. Model equations describing the
   removal efficiency of each metal ion were determined using Response
   Surface Methodology (RSM) with respect to operating conditions such as
   pH, initial metal ion concentration and biomass dosage. Characterization
   of the metal ion-biomass interactions responsible for biosorption was
   studied employing zeta potential measurements, BET, FT-IR and EDX
   techniques; these indicated that the uptake of metal ions by non-living
   yeast was a surface adsorption phenomenon. The results proved the
   involvement of an ion-exchange mechanism between the adsorbing metal
   ions and the cell walls. In the presence of the complete range of metal
   ions studied, yeast cells were more selective towards Pb(II) ions.}},

Abstract = {{The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) is widely accepted as a primary
   measure of x-ray detector performance in the scientific community. A
   standard method for measuring the DQE, based on IEC 62220-1, requires
   the system to have a linear response meaning that the detector output
   signals are proportional to the incident x-ray exposure. However, many
   systems have a non-linear response due to characteristics of the
   detector, or post processing of the detector signals, that cannot be
   disabled and may involve unknown algorithms considered proprietary by
   the manufacturer. For these reasons, the DQE has not been considered as
   a practical candidate for routine quality assurance testing in a
   clinical setting. In this article we described a method that can be used
   to measure the DQE of both linear and non-linear systems that employ
   only linear image processing algorithms. The method was validated on a
   Cesium Iodide based flat panel system that simultaneously stores a raw
   (linear) and processed (non-linear) image for each exposure. It was
   found that the resulting DQE was equivalent to a conventional
   standards-compliant DQE with measurement precision, and the gray-scale
   inversion and linear edge enhancement did not affect the DQE result.
   While not IEC 62220-1 compliant, it may be adequate for QA programs.}},

Abstract = {{The prospect of single-photon counting (SPC) detectors for x-ray image
   acquisition has identified a number of potential benefits over the usual
   approach in which the detector signal is proportional to total energy
   deposited during an image-acquisition interval. While a generalized
   approach to describing transfer of signal and noise through medical
   imaging systems has been developed over the past several years, in which
   image-forming processes are represented in terms of cascades of
   amplified point processes, this approach describes conventional
   detectors. We extend cascaded systems analysis (CSA) to the description
   of signal and noise in SPC x-ray detectors. Expressions describing
   transfer of the mean value and noise power spectrum (NPS) through a
   signal thresholding stage are derived and used to describe the effects
   of conversion to secondary quanta, collection of secondary quanta,
   additive noise, and thresholding on the zero-frequency DQE of a
   hypothetical flat-panel SPC detector. We found that when the mean number
   of secondary quanta collected is 2 to 3 times greater than the threshold
   value, the zero-frequency DQE for an SPC detector was 5-10\% greater
   than that of a conventional detector. We also found that when additive
   noise is not thresholded out, DQE(0) can be degraded by 30-50 \%.
   However, when thresholding techniques are implemented, in some
   situations this reduction can be largely recovered. It is concluded that
   in some situations SPC x-ray imaging has the potential to provide equal
   or better DQE values than conventional energy-integrating detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-end-milling requires high spindle rotational speed to achieve
   effective material removal. This results in the requirement of tool
   stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent
   to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular tool path geometry
   can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more
   consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process
   planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the
   chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry
   during end-milling along a circular tool path is often approximated as
   that of a linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for
   circular tool paths with higher tool path radius, this is not the case
   for lower tool path radius often used in micro-milling. In this study,
   the effect of circular tool path on the cutting force for varying tool
   path rotation angle, tool path radius, and feed rate is experimentally
   investigated. Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the
   measured cutting force signal along linear and several circular tool
   paths. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in
   the cutting force profiles obtained using different tool path radii,
   tool path orientations, and feed rates. This implies the need for an
   improved chip thickness formulation dedicated to micro-end-milling with
   circular tool path rather than approximating it with formulations
   derived for linear tool path.}},

Abstract = {{Calf serum lubricants consisting of various polypeptide constituent
   fractions are routinely used in knee wear simulators as part of the
   standardized test protocol. Three calf sera (bovine, new-born and alpha)
   were diluted as per the recommendation of ISO 14243-3 and used in
   displacement-controlled knee wear simulators to investigate their
   effects on polyethylene wear. Biochemical analyses included measuring
   total polypeptide degradation, electrophoretic profiles and
   low-molecular weight polypeptide concentrations to elucidate their
   involvement in the wear process. The effects of the various calf sera
   constituent fractions on microbial growth were also explored. The
   polyethylene wear rates and the results from the biochemical analyses
   for the three calf serum lubricants were all found to be statistically
   significantly different from each other. The lubricant derived from the
   alpha-calf serum was closest in constituent fractions to human synovial
   fluid. It also showed the lowest polyethylene wear rate (14.38 +/- 0.85
   mm(3)/million cycles) and the lowest amount of polypeptide degradation
   (7.77 +/- 3.87\%). Furthermore, the alpha-calf serum lubricant was
   associated with the least amount of change in the electrophoretic
   profile, the least change in low-molecular weight polypeptide
   concentration, and the lowest microbial growth in the presence of sodium
   azide (a microbial inhibitor conventionally used in implant wear
   testing). Replacing sodium azide with a broad spectrum
   antibiotic-antimycotic eradicated the microbial growth. Some speculation
   was entertained regarding the effect of alpha-calf serum on
   colloid-mediated boundary lubrication. Based on the results, it was
   recommended that ISO 14243-3 be modified to include guidelines on calf
   serum constituent fractions that would favour using alpha-calf serum in
   order to improve the fidelity of the simulation in knee implant wear
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Any electrical signal that makes recovery of the information signal more
   difficult is considered noise. For example, ``white snow{''} on a TV
   picture and ``hum{''} in an audio signal are typical electrical noise
   manifestations. Noise mainly affects receiving systems, where it sets
   the minimum signal level that it is possible to recover before it
   becomes swamped by the noise. It is important to note that amplifying a
   signal already mixed with noise does not help the signal recovery
   process at all. Once it enters the amplifier, noise is also amplified,
   which is to say that the ratio of S/N power does not improve and that is
   what matters. When the power of the noise signal becomes too large
   relative to the power of the information signal, information content may
   be irreversibly lost. In this chapter, we study the basic classification
   a noise sources and methods for evaluation of noise effects.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis and modelling of a general electrical network is based on four
   fundamental mathematical functions, associated with the behaviour of
   ideal devices, namely resistance (R), capacitance (C), inductance (L),
   and memristance (M). Each of these four fundamental elements is assumed
   to have one and one only property under all conditions and at any given
   time. For example, resistance R is always assumed to be the multiplying
   constant in the linear relationship between voltage and current at its
   terminals, i.e. V = R x I. It is also assumed that both voltage and
   current can take any numerical value within the {[}-infinity, +infinity]
   range. That is, the ideal elements have an infinite power-handling
   capability, either as the energy source or the energy sink.

Abstract = {{In the most familiar form of mechanical oscillations, the pendulum, the
   total system energy constantly bounces back and forth between the
   kinetic and potential forms. In the absence of friction (i.e., energy
   dissipation), a pendulum would oscillate forever. Similarly, after two
   ideal electrical elements capable of storing energy (a capacitor (which
   is initially charged) and an inductor) are connected in parallel then
   the total initial energy of the system bounces back and forth between
   the electric and magnetic energy forms. This process is perceived by the
   observer as electrical oscillations and the parallel LC circuit is said
   to be ``in resonance{''}. The phenomenon of electrical resonance is
   essential to wireless radio communications technology because without
   it, simply put, there would be no modern communications. In this

Abstract = {{The main purpose of an electronic circuit is to process an electronic
   signal that has arrived at its input terminals. In other words, an
   abstract mathematical operation that was envisioned during the initial
   phases of the design is materialized in the form of a physical
   electronic circuit and its transfer function. The circuit is then
   expected to modify (i.e., to process) the input signal in accordance
   with the intended mathematical function and to pass the result to the
   next stage. In addition, a real, well-designed system should perform the
   signal-processing operations efficiently with minimal waste of time and
   energy. Hence, a number of interesting questions arise: What is the most
   optimal strategy for the energy transfer and signal processing? How
   should the interface between two subsequent stages be modelled and
   designed? Is it more beneficial to pass the signal from one stage to
   another in the form of voltage or in the form of current? Based on what
   criteria should the decision be made? What happens if it is not possible
   to achieve the optimal goal and what kind of compromises are appropriate
   to make? How should we deal with general, more complicated networks? In
   this chapter, we study a simple basic methodology for interfacing two
   stages in the signal processing chain that is commonly used in the
   design of RE electronic systems, with the main criterion being maximum
   power transfer between the stages. This approach is justified by the
   argument that wireless RF signals that have arrived at the system input
   terminals are very weak, thus subsequent power loss would have broad
   consequences for the overall system performance.}},

Abstract = {{After a weak radio frequency (RF) signal has arrived at the antenna, it
   is channeled to the input terminals of the RF amplifier through a
   passive matching network. As we learned in Chap. 6, the matching network
   enables maximum power transfer of the receiving signal by equalizing the
   antenna impedance with the RF amplifier input impedance. After that, it
   is job of the RF amplifier to increase the power of the received signal
   and prepare it for further processing. In the first part of this
   chapter, we review the basic principles of linear baseband amplifiers
   and common circuit topologies. In the second part of the chapter, we
   introduce RF and IF amplifiers. In order to clarify the difference
   between RF and IF amplifiers, we need to know that in most radio
   receiver topologies the incoming high-frequency signal is not shifted
   down to the baseband in a single step. Instead, for reasons that we
   discuss in detail in Chap. 9, frequency down-shifting inside radio
   receivers is usually done in one or more intermediate steps. RF
   amplifiers used at those lower frequencies are referred to as
   intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers. Aside from their operating
   frequency, for all practical purposes, there is not much difference
   between the schematic diagrams of RF and IF amplifiers. In this book,
   unless we need to specifically separate the two functions, we refer to
   all tuned amplifiers as RF amplifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Communication transceivers require oscillators that generate pure
   electrical sinusoidal signals ({''}tones{''}) for further use in
   modulators, mixers, and other circuits. Although oscillators may be
   designed to deliver other waveforms as well, e.g. square, triangle, and
   sawtooth waveforms, if intended for applications in wireless radio
   communications, the sinusoidal waveform is probably the most important
   one. A good sinusoidal oscillator is expected to deliver either a
   voltage or a current signal that is stable both in amplitude and
   frequency. Because a variety of oscillator structures are available that
   are suitable for generation of sinusoidal waveforms, circuit designers
   make the choice mostly based on their personal preference for one
   particular type of oscillator. In this chapter, we study several
   oscillator circuits, with emphasis on understanding the underlying
   principles, rather than very detailed analysis of any special oscillator
   type.}},

Pages = {{241-252}},
Abstract = {{In this chapter, we focus on the mathematical operation of ``frequency
   shifting{''} that is fundamental to wireless communication systems.
   Frequency shifting (or ``translation{''}) is complementary to the
   frequency tuning mechanism used in VCOs. However, as will be shown, it
   is a much broader concept with a much wider range of applications. As it
   turns out, mathematical multiplication of two sinusoidal waveforms with
   given frequencies results in waveforms that contain both higher and
   lower frequencies. This phenomenon is known as ``frequency shifting{''},
   where the term ``up-conversion{''} refers to the process of shifting a
   lower frequency tone to the upper frequency range (used in RF
   transmitters), while ``down-conversion{''} refers to the frequency
   shifting from higher to lower frequency ranges (used in RF receivers).
   Hence, in a complete wireless communication system, the
   information-carrying signal is shifted in both directions.}},

Abstract = {{Arguably the most important circuit in modern electronics is a PLL. A
   PLL is embedded into virtually every piece of modern electronic
   equipment: computers, wireless communication systems, and test
   equipment, to name a few. What is more, each of the subsystem blocks
   inside these systems may contain their own PLL sub-circuit manufactured
   in an IC technology. With the advent of IC technologies, embedding PLL
   circuits into higher-level systems became a routine matter, where the
   embedding is done ``on-chip{''}, i.e on the same silicon die as the rest
   of the analog, digital, or mixed-signal ICs. Modern RF transceivers that
   include PLL circuits are realized as a single IC, implying that cost,
   size and power consumption are very important design parameters that
   contributed to the widespread use of PLLs. In this chapter, we introduce
   only the terminology, the basic principles of operation, and the
   applications of PLL; detailed analysis and study of PLL are far beyond
   the scope of this book.}},

Pages = {{263-293}},
Abstract = {{In the broad sense, the term ``modulation{''} implies a change in time
   of a certain parameter. For instance, while listening to a steady
   single-tone signal with constant amplitude and frequency coming out of a
   speaker, we merely receive the simplest message that conveys information
   only about the existence of the signal source and nothing else. If the
   source is turned off, then we cannot even say if there is a signal
   source out there or not. For the purpose of transmitting a more
   sophisticated message, the communication system must use at least the
   simplest modulation scheme, based on time divisions, i.e., turning on
   and off the signal source. By listening to short and long beeps, we can
   decode complicated messages letter by letter. When you think about it,
   smoke signals are based on the same principle. As slow and inefficient
   as it is, Morse code does work and is used even today in special
   situations, for example in a very low SNR environment.
   In this chapter, we study the main modulation techniques for wireless
   communications, which are based on the time variation of periodic
   electrical signals.}},

Booktitle = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATION ELECTRONICS: INTRODUCTION TO RF CIRCUITS AND

Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{295-317}},
Abstract = {{When a modulated signal arrives at the receiving antenna, the embedded
   information must somehow be extracted by the receiver and separated from
   the HF carrier signal. This information recovery process is known as
   ``demodulation{''} or ``detection{''}. It is based on an underlying
   mechanism similar to the one used in mixers, where a nonlinear element
   is used to multiply two waves and accomplish the frequency shifting.
   However, the demodulation process is centred around the carrier
   frequency coo and the signal spectrum is shifted downward to the
   baseband and returned to its original position in the frequency domain.
   Both modulation and demodulation involve a frequency-shifting process;
   both processes shift the frequency spectrum by a distance coo on the
   frequency axis; and both processes require a nonlinear circuit to
   accomplish the task. Although very similar, the two processes are
   different in very subtle but important details. In the modulating
   process the carrier wave is generated by the LO circuit, and then
   combined with the baseband signal inside the mixer. In the demodulating
   process, however, the carrier signal is already contained in the
   incoming modulated signal and it can be recovered at the receiving
   point.}},

Abstract = {{In the general sense, a radio receiver is an electronic system that is
   expected to detect the existence of a single, very specific EM wave in
   the overcrowded air space, separate it from the rest of the frequency
   spectrum, and extract a message. Hence, the literal implementation of
   the receiver function, which is known as a TRF receiver, consists only
   of a receiving antenna, an RF amplifier, and an audio amplifier. In
   addition, advanced radio receiver versions include one or more mixers
   and VCO blocks, which are meant to perform either a single-step
   frequency down-conversion (also known as a ``heterodyne receiver{''}) or
   multiple step frequency down-conversions (also known as a
   ``super-heterodyne receiver{''}) in order to shift the HF wave down to
   the baseband.

   cine MRI based on compressive sensing principles}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a compressive sensing approach for reducing data
   acquisition time in cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In
   cardiac cine MRI, several images are acquired throughout the cardiac
   cycle, each of which is reconstructed from the raw data acquired in the
   Fourier transform domain, traditionally called k-space. In the proposed
   approach, a majority, e.g., 62.5\%, of the k-space lines (trajectories)
   are acquired at the odd time points and a minority, e.g., 37.5\%, of the
   k-space lines are acquired at the even time points of the cardiac cycle.
   Optimal data acquisition at the even time points is learned from the
   data acquired at the odd time points. To this end, statistical features
   of the k-space data at the odd time points are clustered by fuzzy
   c-means and the results are considered as the states of Markov chains.
   The resulting data is used to train hidden Markov models and find their
   transition matrices. Then, the trajectories corresponding to transition
   matrices far from an identity matrix are selected for data acquisition.
   At the end, an iterative thresholding algorithm is used to reconstruct
   the images from the under-sampled k-space datasets. The proposed
   approaches for selecting the k-space trajectories and reconstructing the
   images generate more accurate images compared to alternative methods.
   The proposed under-sampling approach achieves an acceleration factor of
   2 for cardiac cine MRI.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of
   three-dimensional (3D) versus two-dimensional (2D) visualization on the
   amount of force applied to mitral valve tissue during robotics-assisted
   mitral valve annuloplasty, and the time to perform the procedure in an
   ex vivo animal model. In addition, we examined whether these effects are
   consistent between novices and experts in robotics-assisted cardiac
   surgery.
   Methods: A cardiac surgery test-bed was constructed to measure forces
   applied by the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale,
   CA) during mitral valve annuloplasty. Both experts and novices completed
   robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty with 2D and 3D
   visualization.
   Results: The mean time for both experts and novices to suture the mitral
   valve annulus and to tie sutures using 3D visualization was
   significantly less than that required to suture the mitral valve annulus
   and to tie sutures using 2D vision (p<0.01). However, there was no
   significant difference in the maximum force applied by novices to the
   mitral valve during suturing (p = 0.3) and suture tying (p = 0.6) using
   either 2D or 3D visualization.
   Conclusion: This finding suggests that 3D visualization does not fully
   compensate for the absence of haptic feedback in robotics-assisted
   cardiac surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate biopsy is the clinical standard for prostate cancer diagnosis.
   To improve the accuracy of targeting suspicious locations, systems have
   been developed that can plan and record biopsy locations in a 3D TRUS
   image acquired at the beginning of the procedure. Some systems are
   designed for maximum compatibility with existing ultrasound equipment
   and are thus designed around the use of a conventional 2D TRUS probe,
   using controlled axial rotation of this probe to acquire a 3D TRUS
   reference image at the start of the biopsy procedure. Prostate motion
   during the biopsy procedure causes misalignments between the prostate in
   the live 2D TRUS images and the pre-acquired 3D TRUS image. We present
   an image-based rigid registration technique that aligns live 2D TRUS
   images, acquired immediately prior to biopsy needle insertion, with the
   pre-acquired 3D TRUS image to compensate for this motion. Our method was
   validated using 33 manually identified intrinsic fiducials in eight
   subjects and the target registration error was found to be 1.89 mm. We
   analysed the suitability of two image similarity metrics (normalized
   cross correlation and mutual information) for this task by plotting
   these metrics as a function of varying parameters in the six
   degree-of-freedom transformation space, with the ground truth plane
   obtained from registration as the starting point for the parameter
   exploration. We observed a generally convex behaviour of the similarity
   metrics. This encourages their use for this registration problem, and
   could assist in the design of a tool for the detection of misalignment,
   which could trigger the execution of a non-real-time registration, when
   needed during the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Radical prostatectomy surgery (RP) is the gold standard for treatment of
   localized prostate cancer (PCa). Recently, emergence of minimally
   invasive techniques such as Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (LRP) and
   Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) has improved
   the outcomes for prostatectomy. However, it remains difficult for the
   surgeons to make informed decisions regarding resection margins and
   nerve sparing since the location of the tumor within the organ is not
   usually visible in a laparoscopic view. While MRI enables visualization
   of the salient structures and cancer foci, its efficacy in LRP is
   reduced unless it is fused into a stereoscopic view such that homologous
   structures overlap. Registration of the MRI image and peri-operative
   ultrasound image using a tracked probe can potentially be exploited to
   bring the pre-operative information into alignment with the patient
   coordinate system during the procedure. While doing so, prostate motion
   needs to be compensated in real-time to synchronize the stereoscopic
   view with the pre-operative MRI during the prostatectomy procedure. In
   this study, a point-based stereoscopic tracking technique is
   investigated to compensate for rigid prostate motion so that the same
   motion can be applied to the pre-operative images. This method benefits
   from stereoscopic tracking of the surface markers implanted over the
   surface of the prostate phantom. The average target registration error
   using this approach was 3.25 +/- 1.43mm.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy is the standard
   method for a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, this
   biopsy approach uses two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images to guide
   biopsy and can miss up to 30\% of prostate cancers. We are developing a
   molecular image-directed, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound image-guided
   biopsy system for improved detection of prostate cancer. The system
   consists of a 3D mechanical localization system and software workstation
   for image segmentation, registration, and biopsy planning. In order to
   plan biopsy in a 3D prostate, we developed an automatic segmentation
   method based wavelet transform. In order to incorporate PET/CT images
   into ultrasound-guided biopsy, we developed image registration methods
   to fuse TRUS and PET/CT images. The segmentation method was tested in
   ten patients with a DICE overlap ratio of 92.4\% +/- 1.1 \%. The
   registration method has been tested in phantoms. The biopsy system was
   tested in prostate phantoms and 3D ultrasound images were acquired from
   two human patients. We are integrating the system for PET/CT directed,
   3D ultrasound-guided, targeted biopsy in human patients.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to conventional open-heart surgeries, minimally invasive
   cardiac interventions cause less trauma and side-effects to patients.
   However, the direct view of surgical targets and tools is usually not
   available in minimally invasive procedures, which makes image-guided
   navigation systems essential. The choice of imaging modalities used in
   the navigation systems must consider the capability of imaging soft
   tissues, spatial and temporal resolution, compatibility and flexibility
   in the OR, and financial cost. In this paper, we propose a new means of
   guidance for minimally invasive cardiac interventions using 3D real-time
   ultrasound images to show the intra-operative heart motion together with
   pre-operative CT image(s) employed to demonstrate high-quality 3D
   anatomical context. We also develop a method to register intra-operative
   ultrasound and pre-operative CT images in close to real-time. The
   registration method has two stages. In the first, anatomical features
   are segmented from the first frame of ultrasound images and the CT
   image(s). A feature based registration is used to align those features.
   The result of this is used as an initialization in the second stage, in
   which a mutual information based registration is used to register every
   ultrasound frame to the CT image(s). A GPU based implementation is used
   to accelerate the registration.}},

Abstract = {{A biomechanical model is proposed to predict deflated lung tumor motion
   caused by diaphragm respiratory motion. This model can be very useful
   for targeting the tumor in tumor ablative procedures such as lung
   brachytherapy. To minimize motion within the target lung, these
   procedures are performed while the lung is deflated. However,
   significant amount of tissue deformation still occurs during respiration
   due to the diaphragm contact forces. In the absence of effective
   real-time image guidance, biomechanical models can be used to estimate
   tumor motion as a function of diaphragm's position. To develop this
   model, Finite Element Method (FEM) was employed. To demonstrate the
   concept, we conducted an animal study of an ex-vivo porcine deflated
   lung with a tumor phantom. The lung was deformed by compressing a
   diaphragm mimicking cylinder against it. Before compression, 3D-CT image
   of this lung was acquired, which was segmented and turned into FE mesh.
   The lung tissue was modeled as hyperelastic material with a contact
   loading to calculate the lung deformation and tumor motion during
   respiration. To validate the results from FE model, the motion of a
   small area on the surface close to the tumor was tracked while the lung
   was being loaded by the cylinder. Good agreement was demonstrated
   between the experiment results and simulation results. Furthermore, the
   impact of tissue hyperelastic parameters uncertainties in the FE model
   was investigated. For this purpose, we performed in-silico simulations
   with different hyperelastic parameters. This study demonstrated that the
   FEM was accurate and robust for tumor motion prediction.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of presenting medical images in an intuitive and usable
   manner during a procedure is essential. However, most medical
   visualization interfaces, particularly those designed for
   minimally-invasive surgery, suffer from a number of issues as a
   consequence of disregarding the human perceptual, cognitive, and motor
   system's limitations. This matter is even more prominent when human
   visual system is overlooked during the design cycle. One example is the
   visualization of the neuro-vascular structures in MR angiography (MRA)
   images. This study investigates perceptual performance in the usability
   of a display to visualize blood vessels in MRA volumes using a contour
   enhancement technique. Our results show that when contours are enhanced,
   our participants, in general, can perform faster with higher level of
   accuracy when judging the connectivity of different vessels. One
   clinical outcome of such perceptual enhancement is improvement of
   spatial reasoning needed for planning complex neuro-vascular operations
   such as treating Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs). The success of an
   AVM intervention greatly depends on fully understanding the anatomy of
   vascular structures. However, poor visualization of pre-operative MRA
   images makes the planning of such a treatment quite challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical resection of epileptic foci is a typical treatment for
   drug-resistant epilepsy, however, accurate pre-operative localization is
   challenging and often requires invasive sub-dural or intra-cranial
   electrode placement. The presence of cellular abnormalities in the
   resected tissue can be used to validate the effectiveness of
   multispectral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in pre-operative foci
   localization and surgical planning. If successful, these techniques can
   lead to improved surgical outcomes and less invasive procedures. Towards
   this goal, a novel pipeline is presented here for post-operative imaging
   of temporal lobe specimens involving MRI and digital histology, and
   present and evaluate methods for bringing these images into spatial
   correspondence. The sparsely-sectioned histology images of resected
   tissue represents a challenge for 3D reconstruction which we address
   with a combined 3D and 2D rigid registration algorithm that alternates
   between slice-based and volume-based registration with the ex-vivo MRI.
   We also evaluate four methods for non-rigid within-plane registration
   using both images and fiducials, with the top performing method
   resulting in a target registration error of 0.87 mm. This work allows
   for the spatially-local comparison of histology with post-operative MRI
   and paves the way for eventual registration with pre-operative MRI
   images.}},

Abstract = {{Elastography is a non-invasive imaging technique that images tissue
   stiffness. Given the well known association between tissue stiffness and
   cancer type, it can be used effectively for breast cancer detection and
   assessment. This study involves system development of a real-time
   ultrasound based elastography system designed for assessing multifocal
   breast cancer. This system is capable of imaging breast tissues absolute
   Young's Moduli. The imaging involves tissue mechanical stimulation,
   displacement and force data acquisition followed by Young's modulus
   reconstruction using a constrained full-inversion approach. This
   approach utilizes axial strain field and surface force data acquired by
   the elastography system via an iterative numerical process to construct
   the breast tissue Young's modulus. The strain field is obtained using an
   ultrasound machine equipped with an RF signal processing module. For
   force data acquisition, a system comprised of two load cells attached at
   the ultrasound system probe was employed. Each iteration of the
   reconstruction algorithm involves tissue stress calculation followed by
   tissue Young's modulus updating. To speed up the reconstruction process,
   a novel accelerated finite element method developed in our laboratory
   was used for stress calculation. To validate the proposed method,
   tissue-mimicking phantom studies were conducted. These studies showed
   promising results paving the way for further validation and application
   in a clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{It is very difficult to selectively oxidise stable compounds such as
   toluene and xylenes to useful chemicals with molecular oxygen (O-2)
   under moderate conditions. To achieve high conversion and less
   over-oxidised products, a new class of photocatalysts, metal hydroxide
   nanoparticles grafted with alcohols, is devised. They can efficiently
   oxidise alkyl aromatic compounds with O-2 using visible or ultraviolet
   light or even sunlight to generate the corresponding aldehydes, alcohols
   and acids at ambient temperatures and give very little over-oxidation.
   For example toluene can be oxidised with a 23\% conversion after a
   48-hour exposure to sunlight with 85\% of the product being
   benzaldehyde, and only a trace of CO2. The surface complexes grafted
   onto metal hydroxides can absorb light, generating free radicals on the
   surface, which then initiate aerobic oxidation of the stable alkyl
   aromatic molecules with high product selectivity. This mechanism is
   distinctly different from those of any known catalysts. The use of the
   new photocatalysts as a controlled means to generate surface radicals
   through light excitation allows us to drive the production of fine
   organic chemicals at ambient temperatures with sunlight. The process
   with the new photocatalysts is especially valuable for
   temperature-sensitive syntheses and a greener process than many
   conventional thermal reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Particle focusing has been numerically studied in a microchannel filled
   by an acoustic metamaterial fluid that possesses negative density, and
   under a pair of ultrasound incidences from the lateral boundaries.
   Acoustic metamaterial with negative density exponentially damps the
   ultrasound field along its propagation direction that forms a very low
   field at the center of the microchannel. Driven by the acoustic
   radiation force and dissipated by the fluid, the particles laterally
   vibrate in the microchannel and gradually aggregated in the vicinity of
   the channel center. A structural microchannel with acoustic resonant
   elements that generates equivalent negative density property for the
   fluid in the microchannel has been designed, which decays the ultrasound
   field in a similar way. Particle movement in the structural microchannel
   has also been investigated and particle focusing is also achieved. The
   merit of the proposed particle focusing method by metamaterial concept
   lies in its independence on the type of the incident wave and width or
   size of the microchannel.}},

Abstract = {{Known as multihoming, devices with more than one network interface can
   enhance their performance capabilities by harnessing unused resources
   from alternative access networks. Whether it's improved reliability or
   sheer throughput potential, network devices will benefit from a
   multihomed framework. Unfortunately, our current means of guaranteeing
   reliability while maintaining quality control, specifically, the
   transmission control protocol (TCP), does not support multihoming.
   Despite the latter, a relatively young transport layer standard called
   the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP), incorporates
   multihoming into its design. In this paper, we investigate
   state-of-the-art multihoming techniques using SCTP. A comprehensive
   survey of developments has brought forth three main research areas,
   namely: handover management, concurrent multipath transfer (CMT), and
   cross-layer activities. While the presented algorithms may offer
   sufficient results, many open problems still remain.}},

Title = {{Tuning polymersome surfaces: functionalization with dendritic groups}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{5947-5958}},
Abstract = {{The conjugation of dendrons having varying peripheral functionalities to
   polymer vesicles, commonly referred to as polymersomes, provides an
   opportunity to significantly alter the polymersome surface chemistry in
   a single step while leaving intact the block copolymers responsible for
   assembly. In this work, polymersomes with surface azide groups were
   prepared from poly(1,2-butadiene)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PBD-PEO) and
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-PEO (PCL-PEO) block copolymers and were
   functionalized with polyester dendrons having focal point alkyne
   moieties and peripheral hydroxyls, amines, or guanidines. The release
   rates of a small molecule rhodamine B and a rhodamine B-labeled protein
   from naked and functionalized polymersomes were investigated and the
   presence of dendritic groups was found to have a minimal effect. All of
   the naked and functionalized polymersomes were found to be nontoxic at
   all concentrations tested, except for the guanidine functionalized
   polymersomes which did impart some toxicity at the highest
   concentrations tested. The cell uptake of the different polymersomes was
   compared and it was found that the guanidine functionalized polymersomes
   exhibited increased cell uptake relative to all other materials. Further
   studies of this phenomenon suggested that the uptake is mediated by
   endocytosis and possibly direct translocation across the membrane.}},

Abstract = {{The finite element (FE) method can accurately calculate tissue
   deformation. However, its low speed renders it ineffective for many
   biomedical applications involving real-time data processing. To
   accelerate FE analysis, we introduce a novel tissue mechanics simulation
   technique. This technique is suitable for real-time estimation of tissue
   deformation of specific organs, which is required in computer-aided
   diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. In this method, principal
   component analysis is used to describe each organ shape and its
   corresponding FE field for a pool of patients by a small number of
   weight factors. A mapping function is developed to relate the parameters
   of organ shape to their FE field counterpart. We show that irrespective
   of the complexity of the tissue's constitutive law or its loading
   conditions, the proposed technique is highly accurate and fast in
   estimating the FE field. Average deformation errors of less than 2\%
   demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on a case study of delineating census tracts (CTs) in
   the Census Metropolitan area of London, Ontario, Canada. The procedure
   for defining the actual pattern of CTs by a local committee and
   Statistics Canada has involved such consideration as the compactness of
   CTs and their population-based and area-based uniformity as well as some
   subjective aspects. The actual pattern shows that compactness of CTs has
   been achieved at the expense of uniformity in population and areal
   sizes. The paper proposes an integer-coded multiobjective genetic
   algorithm for aggregating census units with the expectation of obtaining
   a higher level of compactness and population/area uniformity of CTs
   through an optimization technique. Square-shape and circular-shape
   compactness of CTs are examined under different scenarios. The results
   indicate that the proposed genetic algorithm can provide solutions that
   are considerably better in terms of the Pareto-optimality principle than
   the actual pattern of CTs.}},

Abstract = {{A respirometric approach has been developed to determine heterotrophic
   biofilm kinetics using fluidized bioparticles-particles with attached
   biomass. Lava rock particles of 600 mu m were used as a biomass carrier
   medium. The modified respirometer successfully estimates in situ biofilm
   kinetics of the bioparticles collected from a pilot-scale liquid-solid
   circulating fluidized bed (LSCFB) bioreactor. The observed maximum
   specific growth rates (mu(max)) of 3.69 +/- 0.44 d(-1) and biomass
   yields (Y-H) of 0.36 +/- 0.03 g COD/g COD in the fluidized bed
   respirometers were significantly different from the mu(max) of 5.57-5.72
   d(-1) and Y-H of 0.54-0.59 g COD/g COD observed in the conventional
   respirometric tests for bioparticles and detached biomass. The higher
   Monod half-saturation coefficient (K-S) of 186-219 mg COD/L observed in
   the fluidized bed respirometers relative to the 49-58 mg COD/L in the
   conventional respirometers reveals the presence of mass transfer
   resistance in the LSCFB despite fluidization. Significantly reduced
   yields in the fluidized bed respirometers and the estimated maintenance
   coefficient of 1.16 d(-1) for the particulate biofilm in the LSCFB
   clearly emphasize that a substantial amount of substrate was utilized
   for cell maintenance at the low food to microorganism (S/X) ratio of 0.5

Abstract = {{New techniques that can control Casimir forces in nanosacle structures
   may soon ensure the physical realization of switchable Casimir-force
   devices. In order to provide useful insights into the behaviour of this
   class of switches, the idea of Casimir-force actuation window has been
   proposed here to assist in the design of such switches. The influence of
   surface effects including residual surface stress and surface elasticity
   on the pull-in parameters of Casimir actuated switches has been
   demonstrated. These effects, together with other currently known
   difficulties due to uncertainties such as surface roughness and trapped
   electric charge may hinder the realization of this class of devices. An
   Euler-Bernoulli beam model has been employed to demonstrate surface
   effects in a nanocantilever switch, and numerical solutions employing a
   finite difference approach have been obtained for the static bending of
   this switch. The results demonstrate that surface effects play a
   significant role in the selection of basic design parameters of Casimir
   actuated switches, such as static deflection and detachment length.
   Threshold value of residual surface stress is also studied for these
   switches. The predictions reveal that exclusion of surface effects in
   Casimir-force actuation window may result in non-functional switch
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoroscopic images suffer from multiple modes of image distortion.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of
   correction using a range of two-dimensional polynomials and a global
   approach. The primary measure of interest was the average error in the
   distances between four beads of an accuracy phantom, as measured using
   RSA. Secondary measures of interest were the root mean squared errors of
   the fit of the chosen polynomial to the grid of beads used for
   correction, and the errors in the corrected distances between the points
   of the grid in a second position. Based upon the two-dimensional
   measures, a polynomial of order three in the axis of correction and two
   in the perpendicular axis was preferred. However, based upon the RSA
   reconstruction, a polynomial of order three in the axis of correction
   and one in the perpendicular axis was preferred. The use of a
   calibration frame for these three-dimensional applications most likely
   tempers the effects of distortion. This study suggests that distortion
   correction should be validated for each of its applications with an
   independent ``gold standard{''} phantom.}},

Abstract = {{Disposable microfluidic systems are used to avoid sample contamination
   in a variety of medical and environmental monitoring applications. A
   contactless hot intrusion (HI) process for fabricating reusable polymer
   micromolds with near ``optical quality{''} surface finishes is described
   in this paper. A metallic hot intrusion mask with the desired
   microchannels and related passive components is first machined using a
   tightly focused beam from a diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser. The
   polymer mold master is then created by pressing the 2D metallic mask
   onto a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrate. Since it is a
   contactless fabrication process the resultant 3D micro-reliefs have near
   optical quality surface finishes. Unfortunately, the desired
   micro-relief dimensions (height and width) are not easily related to the
   hot intrusion process parameters of pressure, temperature, and time
   exposure profile. A finite element model is introduced to assist the
   manufacturing engineer in predicting the behavior of the PMMA substrate
   material as it deforms under heat and pressure during micromold
   manufacture. The FEM model assumes that thermo-plastics like PMMA become
   ``rubber like{''} when heated to a temperature slightly above the glass
   transition temperature. By controlling the material temperature and
   maintaining its malleable state, it is possible to use the stress-strain
   relationship to predict the profile dimensions of the imprinted
   microfeature. Examples of curved microchannels fabricated using PMMA
   mold masters are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and
   verify the finite element model. In addition, the non-contact formation
   of the micro-reliefs simplifies the demolding process and helps to
   preserve the high quality surface finishes.}},

Abstract = {{Laser micro-polishing (L mu P) is a new laser-based microfabrication
   technology for improving surface quality during a finishing operation
   and for producing parts and surfaces with near-optical surface quality.
   The L mu P process uses low power laser energy to melt a thin layer of
   material on the previously machined surface. The polishing effect is
   achieved as the molten material in the laser-material interaction zone
   flows from the elevated regions to the local minimum due to surface
   tension. This flow of molten material then forms a thin ultra-smooth
   layer on the top surface. The L mu P is a complex thermo-dynamic process
   where the melting, flow and redistribution of molten material is
   significantly influenced by a variety of process parameters related to
   the laser, the travel motions and the material. The goal of this study
   is to analyze the impact of initial surface parameters on the final
   surface quality. Ball-end micromilling was used for preparing initial
   surface of samples from H13 tool steel that were polished using a
   Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The height and width of micromilled scallops
   (waviness) were identified as dominant parameter affecting the quality
   of the L mu Ped surface. By adjusting process parameters, the R-a value
   of a surface, having a waviness period of 33 mu m and a peak-to-valley
   value of 5.9 mu m, was reduced from 499 nm to 301 nm, improving the
   final surface quality by 39.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{Edge-lit backlighting has been used extensively for a variety of small
   and medium-sized liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The shape, density and
   spatial distribution pattern of the micro-optical elements imprinted on
   the surface of the flat light-guide panel (LGP) are often
   ``optimized{''} to improve the overall brightness and luminance
   uniformity. A similar concept can be used to develop interior
   convenience lighting panels and exterior tail lamps for automotive
   applications. However, costly diffusive sheeting and brightness
   enhancement films are not be considered for these applications because
   absolute luminance uniformity and the minimization of Moire fringe
   effects are not significant factors in assessing quality of automotive
   lighting. A new design concept that involves micromilling cylindrical
   micro-optical elements on optically transparent plastic substrates is
   described in this paper. The variable parameter that controls
   illumination over the active regions of the panel is the depth of the
   individual cylindrical micro-optical elements. LightTools (TM) is the
   optical simulation tool used to explore how changing the micro-optical
   element depth can alter the local and global luminance. Numerical
   simulation and microfabrication experiments are performed on several
   (100mmx100mmx6mm) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) test samples in order to
   verify the illumination behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The Radial Angular Filter Array (RAFA) is a novel optical filter
   consisting of a radially-distributed series of micro-machined channels
   with a focal length of a few millimeters. The RAFA filters photons
   passing through the focal point according to the propagation direction
   and has proven to be capable of collecting the angular distribution and
   the spectral information of photons simultaneously and non-invasively,
   which allows angle-resolved spectroscopic measurement of a turbid
   medium. To explore the feasibility of using this device to characterize
   the optical abnormalities in human tissues, we tested the performance of
   an angle-resolved RAFA-based spectroscopy system to detect absorption
   targets embedded within a tissue-mimicking phantom. The body of the
   phantom was made of 0.1\% Intralipid (TM)/agarose gel (7 mm in
   thickness) and the targets were spherical (1.5 mm in radius) and
   contained 10 mu M Indocyanine Green (ICG). The illumination source was a
   broadband near infrared (NIR) collimated beam. Photons were angularly
   filtered by the RAFA and spectrally resolved by a pushbroom
   spectrometer. The experimental results confirmed that the RAFA
   preferentially filtered photons that carried absorption and scattering
   information of the embedded targets.}},

Abstract = {{Strong earthquakes cause tangible and intangible seismic losses and
   disrupt service and function of buildings and infrastructure. The losses
   could be mitigated by increasing seismic design levels or by installing
   additional energy dissipation devices, such as tuned-mass dampers
   (TMDs). Although TMDs are useful for reducing structural responses,
   their effectiveness in terms of the expected lifecycle cost of buildings
   including the cost of TMDs, is rarely discussed. A parametric study on
   the expected lifecycle cost of a building with TMDs is carried out using
   a two-degree-of-freedom system whose non-linear hysteretic behaviour of
   the main structure is represented by the Bouc-Wen model. Probabilistic
   models of seismic demand to structures with TMDs are developed by using
   381 ground motion records. The models are employed to assess the
   expected lifecycle cost of structures with TMDs and to investigate the
   effectiveness of TMDs in reducing seismic risk. The results indicate
   that the effectiveness of TMDs decreases as the seismic excitation level
   increases and its use on occasion could worsen structural performance
   against earthquake loading. The reduction in the expected damage cost in
   terms of the initial construction cost by installing TMDs is limited.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the Biofidelity of the HIII and MIL-Lx Lower Leg
   Surrogates Under Axial Impact Loading}},
Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-85}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Lower leg injury risk is commonly assessed using an
   anthropomorphic test device (ATD). The current standard leg (the HIII)
   has been shown to have low biofidelity due to its geometry and material
   properties. A new surrogate (the MIL-Lx) was developed to address these
   issues, specifically for anti-vehicular mine blast scenarios but with
   potential applications to high-force crashes in the automotive industry.
   Before it is adopted for use, the MIL-Lx must be evaluated under impact
   loading to ensure that it represents the natural lower leg response.
   Methods: Axial impact loads were applied to both the HIII and the MIL-Lx
   at impact velocities of 2 to 7 m/s using a pneumatic impacting device.
   Testing was also conducted with the foot removed from both surrogates to
   enable comparison with previous tests of isolated cadaveric tibias at
   noninjurious and injurious (i.e., fracture) levels. To evaluate the
   effect of a boot on load attenuation, the HIII was impacted with and
   without a hiking boot.
   Results: Forces in the MIL-Lx were between 25 and 100 percent of those
   in the HIII (depending on impact conditions). The use of a boot reduced
   the peak force by approximately 65 percent at the highest impact
   velocities. The MIL-Lx fit the data from noninjurious cadaveric tibia
   tests with R-2 = 0.83.
   Conclusions: The MIL-Lx is a new surrogate that represents the response
   of the natural tibia under axial impact loading better than the HIII.
   The inclusion of a boot has a significant effect on loads in the leg and
   may influence injury assessment results. The MIL-Lx will be a useful
   tool for predicting lower leg injury risk over a wide range of impact
   velocities.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to understand whole body vibration (WBV) since it
   affects comfort and is important in worker health and performance.
   Although discomfort can be subjectively evaluated, the ISO 2631-1
   standard predicts discomfort based on vibration magnitudes, frequencies
   and durations, The objective of this study was to determine whether the
   ISO 2631-1 prediction method produces similar results to self-reported
   discomfort levels during routine heavy machinery operations in the
   field. While working under normal conditions, 6 df seat-pan vibration
   data were recorded in construction, mining, and forestry vehicles. At
   5-minute intervals, operators rated their discomfort based on the
   preceding minute of vibration exposure. Discomfort was predicted from
   the vibration total value for each corresponding one-minute vibration
   profile. Each industry showed consistent trends between the predicted
   and self-reported discomfort; however, there were different
   relationships between industries. Construction showed a weak positive
   relationship (r(2)=0.09) between predicted and self-reported discomfort
   values, whereas both forestry and mining showed no relationship. The
   predicted discomfort levels did not accurately represent self-reported
   discomfort; this is similar to some previous studies, but contrasts with
   other studies. This variability may be due to discrepancies with the
   prediction equations, or perhaps due to additional factors being
   incorporated into self-reported comfort measures, such as temperature,
   noise, and fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{The Radial Angular Filter Array (RAFA) is a novel optical filter
   consisting of a radially-distributed series of micro-machined channels,
   which converge upon a focal point several millimeters away from the edge
   of the device. It is designed to measure the angular distribution of
   light emitted from an object located at the focal point and is capable
   of selecting ballistic and quasi-ballistic photons at specific angles
   out of strong background noise due to scattering. We hypothesized that
   the device might be useful for examining optically absorbing features
   below the surface of a turbid medium via a depth mapping approach. In
   order to validate this concept, experiments were performed with a
   focused laser beam, a series of Intralipid T solutions (0.1 wt\% to 1.0
   wt\%), a 0.5 mm diameter graphite rod (absorber), and a RAFA optically
   coupled to a line camera. By scanning the position of the rod and
   comparing the light scattering profiles obtained by the RAFA at each
   scanning step, the location and the depth of the rod were successfully
   identified. Future work will be directed toward studying the performance
   of the technique with a collimated broadband illumination beam for
   spectroscopic applications.}},

   of the Kalman filter. The relationship between the mean and the drift is
   analyzed in detail to provide insights on the connection between the
   innovation sequence and the drift. The developed algorithm has been

Abstract = {{The covalent immobilization of polymers on surfaces has the potential to
   impart new properties and functions to surfaces for a wide range of
   applications. However, most current methods for the production of these
   surfaces involve multiple chemical steps or do not impart a high degree
   of control over the chemical functionalities at the surface. Described
   here is the preparation of surfaces covalently functionalized with
   quaternized poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), a known
   antibacterial polymer. PDMAEMA was coated onto octadecyltrimethoxysilane
   modified silicon wafers and was then cross-linked by the selective
   cleavage of C-H bonds using a hyperthermal hydrogen treatment. The
   surfaces were then quaternized with ethyl bromide. At each step the
   surfaces were characterized extensively using techniques including
   atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurements and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. These results demonstrated a high degree of
   functional group retention throughout the process. The antibacterial
   properties of the surfaces against Gram-positive S. aureus and
   Gram-negative E. coli were investigated using a ``drop test{''} assay.
   Furthermore, the process was successfully applied to produce
   antibacterial butyl rubber surfaces, demonstrating the versatility of
   the method for grafting onto unfunctionalized hydrocarbon surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Sonication assisted anodization of titanium in a fluorinated ethylene
   glycol and water electrolyte using Ti itself as a cathode is
   investigated. The prepared anodic film has a highly ordered
   nanotube-array surface architecture. The resulting TiO2 nanotubes at
   potential 20-40 V have various diameters (30-100 nm), tube length (3-12
   mu m) and wall thicknesses (6-15 nm). The tube diameter and wall
   thickness are increased with the anodization time while the overall
   length of the nanotube arrays is controlled by the duration of the
   anodization time. In addition, apart from the anodization time,
   formation of nanotubes is governed by the distance and supplied voltages
   between the two electrodes, for a given electrolyte. The crystal
   structure and surface morphology of the annealed anodic films are
   investigated by XRD and SEM, respectively. The corresponding
   photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency (PCE) was calculated
   under UV light. Our results show a very high PCE under UV (315-400 nm,
   100 mW/cm(2)) irradiation. The maximum value of PCE for hydrogen
   generation obtained was 29\% which is one of the best results reported

Abstract = {{Tele-Operated Catheter Ablation, In Vivo. Introduction: The close
   proximity between the interventionalist and patient during
   catheter-based interventions for cardiac arrhythmia exposes the
   interventionalist to harmful radiation. A prototype remote catheter
   navigation system (RCNS) has been developed to reduce occupational dose.
   The safety, feasibility of this RCNS and a comparison of remote and
   conventional navigation techniques is investigated in vivo.
   Methods: Seven anatomical locations in the right side of the heart in
   porcine models were chosen as navigation targets. Using fluoroscopy and
   electrogram analysis, an experienced electrophysiology interventionalist
   manipulated a radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter to each target using
   the RCNS and conventional navigation. Success rate, navigation time,
   exposure, exposure time and procedure time was recorded for all
   anatomical targets. Time to integrate the RCNS with the procedure suite
   was also measured.
   Results: All targets were successfully reached with the RCNS and
   conventional navigation. No erratic catheter motion was observed with
   the RCNS whereas 1 operation failure occurred. The anatomical targets
   were found to have the largest effect on navigation time (P < 0.05),
   exposure (P < 0.05), and exposure time (P < 0.01), although the
   navigation method had little to no effect on the metrics. These results
   suggest that remote navigation procedures can be performed with
   navigation times comparable to conventional bedside navigation.
   Conclusion: Remote navigation with the RCNS may present a safe method of
   reducing occupational dose, while providing comparable navigation time
   with conventional bedside navigation. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol.

Abstract = {{A study of an aeroelastic model of a single transmission line span and
   support structure was conducted at a length scaling of 1:100. Flexural
   rigidity of the lattice tower, mass and drag were scaled. In successive
   order, the experimental model was subjected to boundary layer and
   downdraft outflow wind forcing in a single test facility. The purpose of
   this study was to examine the difference in structural response to the
   two different types of wind forcing this was motivated by an interest to
   understand why transmission line failures occur in downdraft winds.
   Although the fundamental mode of vibration was evident in the
   frequency-domain analysis, the simulation results indicated that the
   model generally responded quasi-statically to both types of wind
   forcing. Resonant dynamic response was less significant with downdraft
   outflow wind forcing than boundary layer wind forcing. Peak values of
   tower response to downdraft outflow wind forcing were significantly
   larger than that from boundary layer wind forcing. A substantial
   imbalance between peak load on the upstream and downstream conductors
   was observed for both types of wind forcing and was particularly severe
   for the downdraft outflow simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background-Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and sustained monomorphic
   ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) are frequently associated with prior or
   acute myocardial injury. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
   provides morphological, functional, and tissue characterization in a
   single setting. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic yield of CMR-based
   imaging versus non-CMR-based imaging in patients with resuscitated SCD
   or SMVT.
   Methods and Results-Eighty-two patients with resuscitated SCD or SMVT
   underwent routine non-CMR imaging, followed by a CMR protocol with
   comprehensive tissue characterization. Clinical reports of non-CMR
   imaging studies were blindly adjudicated and used to assign each patient
   to 1 of 7 diagnostic categories. CMR imaging was blindly interpreted
   using a standardized algorithm used to assign a patient diagnosis
   category in a similar fashion. The diagnostic yield of CMR-based and
   non-CMR-based imaging, as well as the impact of the former on diagnosis
   reclassification, was established. Relevant myocardial disease was
   identified in 51\% of patients using non-CMR-based imaging and in 74\%
   using CMR-based imaging (P = 0.002). Forty-one patients (50\%) were
   reassigned to a new or alternate diagnosis using CMR-based imaging,
   including 15 (18\%) with unsuspected acute myocardial injury. Twenty
   patients (24\%) had no abnormality by non-CMR imaging but showed
   clinically relevant myocardial disease by CMR imaging.
   Conclusions-CMR-based imaging provides a robust diagnostic yield in
   patients presenting with resuscitated SCD or SMVT and incrementally
   identifies clinically unsuspected acute myocardial injury. When compared
   with non-CMRbased imaging, a new or alternate myocardial disease process
   may be identified in half of these patients. (Circ Cardiovasc Imaging.

Abstract = {{The matricellular protein periostin is expressed in the skin. Although
   periostin has been hypothesized to contribute to dermal homeostasis and
   repair, this has not been directly tested. To assess the contribution of
   periostin to dermal healing, 6 mm full-thickness excisional wounds were
   created in the skin of periostin-knockout and wild-type, sex-matched
   control mice. In wild-type mice, periostin was potently induced 5-7 days
   after wounding. In the absence of periostin, day 7 wounds showed a
   significant reduction in myofibroblasts, as visualized by expression of
   alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) within the granulation tissue.
   Delivery of recombinant human periostin by electrospun collagen
   scaffolds restored alpha-SMA expression. Isolated wild-type and knockout
   dermal fibroblasts did not differ in in vitro assays of adhesion or
   migration; however, in 3D culture, periostin-knockout fibroblasts showed
   a significantly reduced ability to contract a collagen matrix, and
   adopted a dendritic phenotype. Recombinant periostin restored the
   defects in cell morphology and matrix contraction displayed by
   periostin-deficient fibroblasts in a manner that was sensitive to a
   neutralizing anti-beta 1-integrin and to the FAK and Src inhibitor PP2.
   We propose that periostin promotes wound contraction by facilitating
   myofibroblast differentiation and contraction.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation induced dissolution of uranium dioxide (UO2) nuclear fuel and
   the consequent release of radionuclides to intruding groundwater are
   key-processes in the safety analysis of future deep geological
   repositories for spent nuclear fuel. For several decades, these
   processes have been studied experimentally using both spent fuel and
   various types of simulated spent fuels. The latter have been employed
   since it is difficult to draw mechanistic conclusions from real spent
   nuclear fuel experiments. Several predictive modelling approaches have
   been developed over the last two decades. These models are largely based
   on experimental observations. In this work we have performed a critical
   review of the modelling approaches developed based on the large body of
   chemical and electrochemical experimental data. The main conclusions
   are: (1) the use of measured interfacial rate constants give results in
   generally good agreement with experimental results compared to
   simulations where homogeneous rate constants are used; (2) the use of
   spatial dose rate distributions is particularly important when
   simulating the behaviour over short time periods; and (3) the
   steady-state approach (the rate of oxidant consumption is equal to the
   rate of oxidant production) provides a simple but fairly accurate
   alternative, but errors in the reaction mechanism and in the kinetic
   parameters used may not be revealed by simple benchmarking. It is
   essential to use experimentally determined rate constants and verified
   reaction mechanisms, irrespective of whether the approach is chemical or
   electrochemical. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soy protein concentrates and soy protein isolates act as ingredients in
   bakery, meat and dairy products, baby formulas, starting materials for
   spun textured vegetable products, and other nutritional supplements. In
   this study, the effectiveness of a liquidsolid circulating fluidized bed
   (LSCFB) ion exchanger is demonstrated for the recovery of soluble soy
   proteins from full fat and defatted soy flour. Under steady-state
   operating conditions, about 50\% of the proteins could be recovered from
   the feed streams entering the ion exchanger. The LSCFB was shown to be a
   promising system for the recovery of soy protein from both defatted and
   full fat soy flour solutions. As the ion exchange process captures
   dissolved proteins, the system may offer a less damaging form of
   processing compared with the acid precipitation process where soy
   protein aggregates form and functionality is affected. In addition, the
   LSCFB allows simultaneous adsorption and desorption of the proteins
   allowing for a continuous operation. No prefiltration of feed containing
   suspended particles is required as well, because fluidization is used in
   place of packed bed technology to improve on current ion exchange
   processes. (c) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Abstract = {{Olivine-structured LiFePO4 has been the focus of research in developing
   low cost, high performance cathode materials for lithium ion batteries.
   Various processes have been developed to synthesize LiFePO4 or C/LiFePO4
   (carbon coating on LiFePO4), and some of them are being used to mass
   produce C/LiFePO4 at the commercial or pilot scale. Due to the low
   intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities of LiFePO4, the decrease
   of particle size and the nano-layer of carbon coating on LiFePO4
   particle surfaces are necessary to achieve a high electrochemical
   performance. Significant progress has been made in understanding and
   controlling phase purity, particle size and carbon coating of the
   C/LiFePO4 composite material in the past. However, there are still many
   challenges in achieving a high quality product with high consistency. In
   this review, we summarize some of the recent progress and advances based
   on selected reports from peer-reviewed journal publications. Several
   typical synthesis methods and the effect of carbon coating quality on
   the properties of C/LiFePO4 composite are reviewed. An insight into the
   future research and further development of C/LiFePO4 composite is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel system based on the machine vision and
   machine learning techniques for fully automated, real-time
   identification of constituent elements in a sample specimen using
   laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) images. The proposed system
   is developed as a compact spectrum analyzer for rapid element detection
   using a commercially available video camera. We proposed a
   correlation-based pattern matching algorithm for analyzing single
   element spectra. However, the use of a high-speed laser and presence of
   numerous imperfections in the experimental setup require advanced
   techniques for analyzing multi-element spectra. We cast the element
   detection problem as a multi-label classification problem that uses
   support vector machines and artificial neural networks for multi-element
   classification. The proposed algorithms were evaluated using actual LIBS
   images. The machine learning approaches yielded correct identification
   of elements to an accuracy of 99\%. Our system is useful in instances
   where a qualitative analysis is sufficient over a quantitative element
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring individual foot joint motions requires a multi-segment foot
   model, even when the subject is wearing a shoe. Each foot segment must
   be tracked with at least three skin-mounted markers, but for these
   markers to be visible to an optical motion capture system holes or
   `windows' must be cut into the structure of the shoe. The holes must be
   sufficiently large avoiding interfering with the markers, but small
   enough that they do not compromise the shoe's structural integrity. The
   objective of this study was to determine the maximum size of hole that
   could be cut into a running shoe upper without significantly
   compromising its structural integrity or changing the kinematics of the
   foot within the shoe. Three shoe designs were tested: (1) neutral
   cushioning, (2) motion control and (3) stability shoes. Holes were cut
   progressively larger, with four sizes tested in all. Foot joint motions
   were measured: (1) hindfoot with respect to midfoot in the frontal
   plane, (2) forefoot twist with respect to midfoot in the frontal plane,
   (3) the height-to-length ratio of the medial longitudinal arch and (4)
   the hallux angle with respect to first metatarsal in the sagittal plane.
   A single subject performed level walking at her preferred pace in each
   of the three shoes with ten repetitions for each hole size. The largest
   hole that did not disrupt shoe integrity was an oval of 1.7 cm x 2.5 cm.
   The smallest shoe deformations were seen with the motion control shoe.
   The least change in foot joint motion was forefoot twist in both the
   neutral shoe and stability shoe for any size hole. This study
   demonstrates that for a hole smaller than this size, optical motion
   capture with a cluster-based multi-segment foot model is feasible for
   measure foot in shoe kinematics in vivo. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

   (PLIF) measurements is presented. The calibration scheme is based on the
   fact that there is a constant concentration flux through each
   cross-section of a fluorescent plume in a given flow field and makes use
   of simultaneous measurements of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and
   PLIF. The following are the advantages of the current technique: (1) it
   is experimentally less demanding and (2) it does not require in situ
   calibration for generating the calibration curves. The technique can be
   implemented in many experimental setups (both in water and gaseous
   flows) provided the geometry of the time-averaged scalar field is known.
   Using the calibration scheme, an analysis is carried out on the
   measurements of concentration fields in grid turbulence to validate the
   proposed technique. To demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme, the
   distributed second-order moments (mu(2)), and concentration and velocity
   correlations (< u'c'> and < v'c'>) are computed. Good agreement is found
   with previous studies. In addition, a quantitative appraisal of a simple
   closure approximation of the moment-based transport equation is also
   presented using simultaneous PIV and PLIF.}},

Abstract = {{A method for chemically differentiating the surface of a set of small,
   closely-spaced, lithographically-defined Au features on a die, from
   another set of similar features intimately inter-dispersed, is
   described. The key enabler of the method is a standard electronics probe
   array adapted to carry out electrochemistry on the features. The probe
   array is used first to verify the electrical integrity of features and
   the quality of electrical contacts by measuring electrical resistance,
   then, in the presence of the electrolyte, simultaneously maintain one
   potential on one set of Au features and another potential on the other
   set in order to carry out desired electrochemical reactions. The
   technique was demonstrated on dies bearing 40 electrically isolated Au
   features (based on 5 mu m wide stripes) accessed via 64 contact pads
   each 100x100 mu m(2) in area. The array had 64 probes, of which 16 were
   maintained at a desorbing potential (-1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and 48 at a
   stability potential (-0.3 V). The surface compositions were analyzed
   with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry by imaging ion
   fragments characteristic to the thiols forming SAMs, thereby validating
   the process. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out
   to predict the thermal-hydraulic behavior of supercritical fluids in the
   subchannel of supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) fuel channels.
   The thermal-hydraulic behavior of supercritical water in triangular
   array and square array fuel rod bundles is studied numerically. The
   effects of various parameters including the pitch-to-diameter ratio and
   Reynolds number on the flow and the heat transfer characteristics are
   investigated. It is found that the turbulent mixing coefficient of
   supercritical water in subchannels is strongly dependent on the fluid
   bulk temperature and pitch-to-diameter ratio in the vicinity of the
   pseudo-critical point. To have a higher overall turbulent mixing
   coefficient, a pitch-to-diameter ratio less than 1.2 is recommended for
   the design of SCWR. The turbulent mixing coefficient correlation for the
   triangular array rod bundle is developed in this study based on the
   numerical results. However, the correlation for the mixing coefficient
   for the square array rod bundle cannot be expressed as a general
   correlation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a frequent cause
   of both uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in
   young females and has recently been established as the most prominent
   gram-positive uropathogen. Although the effects of subinhibitory
   concentrations of antimicrobials on numerous other pathogenic bacteria
   have been studied, little is known regarding how S saprophyticus
   responds under such conditions.
   Materials and Methods: In this study, we investigated the effects of
   subminimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on S
   saprophyticus attachment to glass microscope slides, ureteral stent
   material, and T24 bladder cells, as well as its effects on S
   saprophyticus-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in bladder
   cells.
   Results: Adherence to glass microscope slides, ureteral stent material,
   and bladder cell monolayers were all significantly increased in the
   presence of sub-MIC levels of CIP. While the S saprophyticus challenge
   of T24 bladder cell monolayers significantly upregulated both
   interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 expression, sub-MIC CIP abrogated these
   effects, returning their secretion to control levels.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that exposure to sub-MIC CIP
   increases S saprophyticus adherence to both abiotic and biotic surfaces
   including urinary device material and cultured bladder cells. In
   addition, low levels of this antimicrobial downregulate S
   saprophyticus-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine secretion in the
   bladder. These changes may make S saprophyticus more effective at
   colonizing the urinary tract and highlights the need for clinicians to
   consider the impact of subinhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials on
   bacteria when designing treatment strategies to manage UTI.}},

   Cross-validated models of the relationships between neck muscle
   electromyography and three-dimensional head kinematics during gaze
   behavior. J Neurophysiol 107: 573-590, 2012. First published October 12,
   2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00315.2011.-The object of this study was to model
   the relationship between neck electromyography (EMG) and
   three-dimensional (3-D) head kinematics during gaze behavior. In two
   monkeys, we recorded 3-D gaze, head orientation, and bilateral EMG
   activity in the sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, complexus,
   biventer cervicis, rectus capitis posterior major, and occipital capitis
   inferior muscles. Head-unrestrained animals fixated and made gaze
   saccades between targets within a 60 degrees x 60 degrees grid. We
   performed a stepwise regression in which polynomial model terms were
   retained/rejected based on their tendency to increase/decrease a
   cross-validation-based measure of model generalizability. This revealed
   several results that could not have been predicted from knowledge of
   musculoskeletal anatomy. During head holding, EMG activity in most
   muscles was related to horizontal head orientation, whereas fewer
   muscles correlated to vertical head orientation and none to small random
   variations in head torsion. A fourth-order polynomial model, with
   horizontal head orientation as the only independent variable,
   generalized nearly as well as higher order models. For head movements,
   we added time-varying linear and nonlinear perturbations in velocity and
   acceleration to the previously derived static (head holding) models. The
   static models still explained most of the EMG variance, but the
   additional motion terms, which included horizontal, vertical, and
   torsional contributions, significantly improved the results. Several
   coordinate systems were used for both static and dynamic analyses, with
   Fick coordinates showing a marginal (nonsignificant) advantage. Thus,
   during gaze fixations, recruitment within the neck muscles from which we
   recorded contributed primarily to position-dependent horizontal
   orientation terms in our data set, with more complex multidimensional
   contributions emerging during the head movements that accompany gaze
   shifts. These are crucial components of the late neuromuscular
   transformations in a complete model of 3-D head-neck system and should
   help constrain the study of premotor signals for head control during
   gaze behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Optically manipulating the local pH of a target solution in a
   microchannel, or reservoir, provides a mechanism for activating and
   controlling a variety of biological and chemical processes on
   Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) devices and micro-total analysis systems (mu-TAS). A
   microscale pH gradient generator that exploits the light-activated
   molecular proton pumps found in the purple membranes (PM) of
   bacteriorhodopsin is described in this paper. The photo-electro-chemical
   transducer is an ultrathin layer (similar to 13 nm) of oriented PM
   patches self-assembled on an Au-coated porous substrate. A biotin
   labeling and streptavidin molecular recognition technique is used to
   ensure that the extracellular side of all PM patches is attached to the
   porous substrate enabling unidirectional and efficient transport of ions
   across the transducer surface. The photo-induced proton pumps generate a
   flow of ions that produce a measurable change in pH between the
   separated solutions. The self-assembly procedure is experimentally
   quantified based on the capacitance characteristics of the bR membranes.
   The investigation confirms that the transducer is covered with the bR
   proton pumps at a mass density of 2.33 ng/cm(2). Experimental tests also
   show that the proposed transducer can repeatedly generate pH gradients
   as high as 0.42 and absolute voltage differences as high as 25 mV when
   illuminated by an 18 mW, 568 nm light source. Furthermore, the Delta pH
   is observed to be nonlinear with respect to light intensity and exposure
   time. The Delta pH of the target solution is sufficient to cause a
   phenolphthalein indicator dye to change color or an ionic hydrogel
   micro-valve to expand.}},

Abstract = {{Continuing development of process analytical technology (PAT) tools is
   needed in the pharmaceutical industry to provide more flexible
   processing and achieve products of consistent quality. For high-shear
   wet granulation, audible acoustic emissions (AAEs) have shown potential

   product quality. This article develops the relationship between AAEs and
   two critical quality attributes, size and density, and investigates the
   potential for monitoring product quality online. Condenser microphones
   were placed inside the air exhaust of a PMA-10 high-shear granulator to
   collect AAEs for a design of experiment (DOE) where particle size and
   density were varied by changing the grade of Avicel in the formulation.
   The results showed increases in particle size and density affect the
   observed decreases in the AAEs at granulation end-point and during over
   wetting. In addition, the changes in size and density could be
   represented by different combinations of 10 Hz frequency groups and the
   trends in the multivariate scores support online monitoring. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{SnO2 nanowires (NWs) have been successfully synthesized on two different
   substrates (stainless steel (SS) and copper) via a facile hydrothermal
   process. SnO2 NWs with varying degrees of crystallinity are obtained on
   different substrates. The growth mechanisms are also deducted by
   observing the morphology revolution at various reaction times.
   Furthermore, the electronic structures and optical properties have been
   investigated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray
   excited optical luminescence (XEOL) measurements. The yellow-green
   luminescence from SnO2 NWs is originated from the intrinsic surface
   states. Compared with SnO2 NWs on copper, a near infrared (NIR)
   luminescence is observed for SnO2 NWs on SS, which resulted from poor
   crystallinity and an abundance of defect/surface states.}},

   is a variable disease with changes in symptoms and airway function over
   many time scales. Airway resistance (Raw) is variable and thought to
   reflect changes in airway smooth muscle activity, but just how variation
   throughout the airway tree and the influence of gas distribution
   abnormalities affect Raw is unclear. We used a multibranch airway lung
   model to evaluate variation in airway diameter size, the role of
   coherent regional variation, and the role of gas distribution
   abnormalities on mean Raw ((R) over bar aw) and variation in Raw as
   described by the SD (SDRaw). We modified an anatomically correct airway
   tree, provided by Merryn Tawhai (The University of Auckland, New
   Zealand), consisting of nearly 4,000 airways, to produce temporal and
   spatial heterogeneity. As expected, we found that increasing the
   diameter variation by twofold, with no change in the mean diameter,
   increased SDRaw more than fourfold. Perhaps surprisingly, (R) over bar
   aw was proportional to SDRaw under several conditions-when either mean
   diameter was fixed, and its SD varied or when mean diameter varied, and
   SD was fixed. Increasing the size of a regional absence in gas
   distribution (ventilation defect) also led to a proportionate increase
   in both R (R) over bar aw and SDRaw. However, introducing regional
   dependence of connected airways strongly increased SDRaw by as much as
   sixfold, with little change in (R) over bar aw. The model was able to
   predict previously reported Raw distributions and correlation of SDRaw
   on Raw in healthy and asthmatic subjects. The ratio of SDRaw to (R) over
   bar aw depended most strongly on interairway coherent variation and only
   had a slight dependence on ventilation defect size. These findings may
   explain the linear correlation between variation and mean values of Raw
   but also suggest that regional alterations in gas distribution and local
   coordination in ventilation amplify any underlying variation in airway
   diameters throughout the airway tree.}},

Abstract = {{Physically crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels prepared
   using a low-temperature thermally cycled process have tunable mechanical
   properties that fall within the range of soft tissues, including
   cardiovascular tissue. An approach to render it hemocompatible is by
   endothelization, but its hydrophilic nature is not conducive to cell
   adhesion and spreading. We investigated the functionalization reaction
   of this class of PVA hydrogel with fibronectin (FN) for adhesion and
   spreading of primary porcine radial artery cells and vascular
   endothelial cells. These are cells relevant to small-diameter vascular
   graft development. FN functionalization was achieved using a multistep
   reaction, but the activation step involving carbonyl diimidazole
   normally required for chemically crosslinked PVA was found to be
   unnecessary. The reaction resulted in an increase in the elastic modulus
   of the PVA hydrogel but is still well within the range of cardiovascular
   tissue. Confocal microscopy confirmed the adhesion and spreading of both
   cell types on the PVAFN surfaces, whereas cells failed to adhere to the
   PVA control. This is a first step toward an alternative for the
   realization of a synthetic replacement small-diameter vascular graft.

Abstract = {{Semantic integration is crucial for successful collaboration between

   approaches rely on the availability of explicit ontologies. However, in
   most application domains, this prerequisite cannot be met. In order to
   address this issue, this paper investigates the theoretical foundation
   of ontologies and extends the traditional ontology concept to an
   ontological view concept. To explicitly and formally specify the
   ontological views, a Frame-based Ontological view Specification Language
   (FOSL) is proposed. This language is based on the frame knowledge
   representation paradigm and uses XML as the encoding. The ontological
   view driven semantic integration can be achieved based on the
   specifications. A proof-of-concept prototype environment has been
   implemented to achieve semantic integration based on ontological views

Title = {{Two methodologies for optical analysis of contaminated engine lubricants}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The performance, efficiency and lifetime of modern combustion engines
   significantly depend on the quality of the engine lubricants. However,
   contaminants, such as gasoline, moisture, coolant and wear particles,
   reduce the life of engine mechanical components and lubricant quality.
   Therefore, direct and indirect measurements of engine lubricant
   properties, such as physical-mechanical, electro-magnetic, chemical and
   optical properties, are intensively utilized in engine condition
   monitoring systems and sensors developed within the last decade. Such
   sensors for the measurement of engine lubricant properties can be used
   to detect a functional limit of the in-use lubricant, increase drain
   interval and reduce the environmental impact. This paper proposes two
   new methodologies for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the
   presence of contaminants in the engine lubricants. The methodologies are
   based on optical analysis of the distortion effect when an object image
   is obtained through a thin random optical medium (e.g. engine
   lubricant). The novelty of the proposed methodologies is in the
   introduction of an object with a known periodic shape behind a thin film
   of the contaminated lubricant. In this case, an acquired image
   represents a combined lubricant-object optical appearance, where an a
   priori known periodic structure of the object is distorted by a
   contaminated lubricant. In the object shape-based optical analysis,
   several parameters of an acquired optical image, such as the gray scale
   intensity of lubricant and object, shape width at object and lubricant
   levels, object relative intensity and width non-uniformity coefficient
   are newly proposed. Variations in the contaminant concentration and use
   of different contaminants lead to the changes of these parameters
   measured on-line. In the statistical optical analysis methodology,
   statistical auto-and cross-characteristics (e. g. auto-and
   cross-correlation functions, auto-and cross-spectrums, transfer
   function, coherence function, etc) are used for the analysis of combined
   object-lubricant images. Both proposed methodologies utilize the
   comparison of measured parameters and calculated object shape-based and
   statistical characteristics for fresh and contaminated lubricants.
   Developed methodologies are verified experimentally showing an ability
   to distinguish lubricant with 0\%, 3\%, 7\% and 10\% water and coolant
   contamination. This proves the potential applicability of the developed
   methodologies for on-line measurement, monitoring and control of the
   engine lubricant condition.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: X-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is widely used for
   vascular imaging. However, the need to subtract a mask image can result
   in motion artifacts and compromised image quality. The current interest
   in energy-resolving photon-counting (EPC) detectors offers the promise
   of eliminating motion artifacts and other advanced applications using a
   single exposure. The authors describe a method of assessing the iodine
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that may be achieved with energy-resolved
   angiography (ERA) to enable a direct comparison with other approaches
   including DSA and dual-energy angiography for the same patient exposure.
   Methods: A linearized noise-propagation approach, combined with linear
   expressions of dual-energy and energy-resolved imaging, is used to
   describe the iodine SNR. The results were validated by a Monte Carlo
   calculation for all three approaches and compared visually for
   dual-energy and DSA imaging using a simple angiographic phantom with a
   CsI-based flat-panel detector.
   Results: The linearized SNR calculations show excellent agreement with
   Monte Carlo results. While dual-energy methods require an increased tube
   heat load of 2 x to 4 x compared to DSA, and photon-counting detectors
   are not yet ready for angiographic imaging, the available iodine SNR for
   both methods as tested is within 10\% of that of conventional DSA for
   the same patient exposure over a wide range of patient thicknesses and
   iodine concentrations.
   Conclusions: While the energy-based methods are not necessarily
   optimized and further improvements are likely, the linearized
   noise-propagation analysis provides the theoretical framework of a level
   playing field for optimization studies and comparison with conventional
   DSA. It is concluded that both dual-energy and photon-counting
   approaches have the potential to provide similar angiographic image
   quality to DSA. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{We propose a novel multi-region segmentation approach through a
   partially-ordered Potts (POP) model to segment myocardial scar tissue
   solely from 3D cardiac delayed-enhancement MR images (DE-MRI). The
   algorithm makes use of prior knowledge of anatomical spatial consistency
   and employs customized label ordering to constrain the segmentation
   without prior knowledge of geometric representation. The proposed method
   eliminates the need for regional constraint segmentations, thus reduces
   processing time and potential sources of error. We solve the proposed
   optimization problem by means of convex relaxation and introduce its
   duality: the hierarchical continuous max-flow (HMF) model, which amounts
   to an efficient numerical solver to the resulting convex optimization
   problem. Experiments are performed over ten DE-MRI data sets. The
   results are compared to a FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) method and
   the inter-and intra-operator variabilities assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of carotid atherosclerosis biomarkers
   are increasingly being investigated for the risk assessment of
   vulnerable plaques. A fast and robust 3D segmentation of the carotid
   adventitia (AB) and lumen-intima (LIB) boundaries can greatly alleviate
   the measurement burden of generating quantitative imaging biomarkers in
   clinical research. In this paper, we propose a novel global
   optimization-based approach to segment the carotid AB and LIB from 3D
   T1-weighted black blood MR images, by simultaneously evolving two
   coupled surfaces with enforcement of anatomical consistency of the AB
   and LIB. We show that the evolution of two surfaces at each discrete
   time-frame can be optimized exactly and globally by means of convex
   relaxation. Our continuous max-flow based algorithm is implemented in
   GPUs to achieve high computational performance. The experiment results
   from 16 carotid MR images show that the algorithm obtained high
   agreement with manual segmentations and achieved high repeatability in
   segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Here we are presenting a unique (bio)technology where the oxygen
   reduction in the electrochemical electricity generation process is
   performed by the respiration of living microbial cells. Therefore, every
   single electron in the electrical circuit ends up inside of a respiring
   microorganism. We named our technology ``BioGenerator{''}.
   The unique features of the BioGenerator include:
   It is the first practical bio-technology for electrical power generation
   in megawatt scale;
   It is possibly the most efficient convertor of hydrogen to electricity;
   It is the only known power generation technology of any kind which
   consumes CO2 from the atmosphere;
   It produces high-quality protein as a co-product;
   It is expected to be commercialized in less than 4 years, producing
   electricity at similar to US\$0.10/kWh.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a quantitative Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced CT (DCE-CT)
   technique for measuring Myocardial Perfusion Reserve (MPR) and Volume
   Reserve (MVR) and studied their relationship with coronary stenosis.
   Twenty-six patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) were recruited.
   Degree of stenosis in each coronary artery was classified from
   catheter-based angiograms as Non-Stenosed (NS, angiographically normal
   or mildly irregular), Moderately Stenosed (MS, 50-80\% reduction in
   luminal diameter), Severely Stenosed (SS, > 80\%) and SS with
   Collaterals (SSC). DCE-CT at rest and after dipyridamole infusion was
   performed using 64-slice CT. Mid-diastolic heart images were corrected
   for beam hardening and analyzed using proprietary software to calculate
   Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF, in mLa (TM) min(-1)a (TM) 100 g(-1)) and
   Blood Volume (MBV, in mLa (TM) 100 g(-1)) parametric maps. MPR and MVR
   in each coronary territory were calculated by dividing MBF and MBV after
   pharmacological stress by their respective baseline values.
   MPR and MVR in MS and SS territories were significantly lower than those
   of NS territories (p < 0.05 for all). Logistic regression analysis
   identified MPRa (TM) MVR as the best predictor of a parts per thousand
   yen50\% coronary lesion than MPR or MVR alone.
   DCE-CT imaging with quantitative CT perfusion analysis could be useful
   for detecting coronary stenoses that are functionally significant.
   aEuro cent A new quantitative CT technique for measuring myocardial
   function has been developed
   aEuro cent This new technique provides data about myocardial perfusion
   and volume reserve
   aEuro cent It demonstrates the important relationship between myocardial
   reserve and coronary stenosis.
