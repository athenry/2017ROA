Title = {{Experimental investigation of the composite action between hollowcore
   slabs with machine-cast finish and concrete topping}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Hollowcore slabs are precast/prestressed concrete elements produced at a
   manufacturing plant before shipping to the job site. Following
   installation, a layer of concrete topping is usually cast to connect the
   slabs and to have a level surface. According to current North American
   design standards, the topping should not be considered to act
   compositely with the slabs except if their surface satisfies a strict
   roughness requirement. This paper evaluates if such restriction is
   justified for hollowcore slabs with machine-cast finish through an
   experimental program that involves pull-off, push-off and full-scale
   tests. The surface roughness was first evaluated. The peel (bond) and
   shear strengths of the interface between the slabs and the topping were
   then assessed using pull-off and push-off tests. Full-scale tests
   examined the overall behavior of the composite slabs. The tested
   composite slabs exhibited higher tensile and shear stresses than the
   limits set by North American design standards. Surface roughness
   threshold for machine-cast hollowcore slabs is estimated. The paper
   presents the initial evidence that hollowcore slabs with machine-cast
   surface can be considered to act compositely with the concrete topping.

Abstract = {{Alumina coatings were deposited on 6061 aluminum alloy substrates using
   plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in an alkaline silicate electrolyte.
   Different electrical parameters, including frequency, duty cycle, and
   current density were applied to obtain PEO coatings. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and microhardness tests were used to investigate the
   coating microstructure and properties. For each sample, the voltage-time
   response of the PEO process was obtained and compared with surface
   morphology, and coating cross sections and thicknesses. Special
   consideration was given to the connection between the electrical
   parameters, different stages of the PEO process, and the morphology and
   microstructure of the coatings. Applying different electrical parameters
   changed the duration and ratio of the PEO stages in the voltage-time
   response curve and affected the growth rate, surface morphology,
   microstructure and microhardness of the coatings. We report the new
   finding of a correlation between the stage of the PEO process and the
   microstructure and morphology of the coating. Crown Copyright (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this study, the growth of graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   on SUS304 stainless steel and on a catalyzing Ni/SUS304 double-layered
   structure was investigated. The results indicated that a thin and
   multilayered graphene film can be continuously grown across the metal
   grain boundaries of the Nil SUS304 stainless steel and significantly
   enhance its corrosion resistance. A 3.5 wt\% saline polarization test
   demonstrated that the corrosion currents in graphene-covered SUS304 were
   improved fivefold relative to the corrosion currents in
   non-graphene-covered SUS304. In addition to enhancing the corrosion
   resistance of stainless steel, a graphene coating also ameliorates
   another shortcoming of stainless steel in a corrosive environment: the
   formation of a passive oxidation layer on the stainless steel surface
   that decreases conductivity. After a corrosion test, the
   graphene-covered stainless steel continued to exhibit not only an
   excellent low interfacial contact resistance (ICR) of 36 m Omega cm(2)
   but also outstanding drainage characteristics. The above results suggest
   that an extremely thin, lightweight protective coating of graphene on
   stainless steel can act as the next-generation bipolar plates of fuel
   cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Functional and structural correlates of memory in patients with mesial
   temporal lobe epilepsy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) often show
   material-specific memory impairment (verbal for left, visuospatial for
   right hemisphere), which can be exacerbated following surgery aimed at
   the epileptogenic regions of medial and anterolateral temporal cortex.
   There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that characterization of
   structural and functional integrity of these regions using MRI can aid
   in prediction of postsurgical risk of further memory decline. We
   investigated the nature of the relationship between structural and
   functional indices of hippocampal integrity with pre-operative memory
   performance in a group of 26 patients with unilateral mTLE. Structural
   integrity was assessed using hippocampal volumes, while functional
   integrity was assessed using hippocampal activation during the encoding
   of novel scenes. We quantified structural and functional integrity in
   terms of asymmetry, calculated as (L - R)/(L + R). Factor scores for
   verbal and visual memory were calculated from a clinical database and an
   asymmetry score (verbal visual) was used to characterize memory
   performance. We found, as expected, a significant difference between
   left and right mTLE (RILE) groups for hippocampal volume asymmetry, with
   each group showing an asymmetry favoring the unaffected temporal lobe.
   Encoding activation asymmetry showed a similar pattern, with left mTLE
   patients showing activation preferential to the right hemisphere and
   RTLE patients showing the reverse. Finally, we demonstrated that
   functional integrity mediated the relationship between structural
   integrity and memory performance for memory asymmetry, suggesting that
   even if structural changes are evident, ultimately it is the functional
   integrity of the tissue that most closely explains behavioral
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{An anode composed of tin-core, graphitic-carbon-shell nanopartides
   distributed on graphene nanosheets, Sn@C-GNs, is studied during the
   lithiation process. Li-7 NMR provides an accurate measure of the
   stepwise reduction of metallic Sn to lithium tin alloys and reduction of
   the graphitic carbon. The metallic nanopartide cores are observed to
   form ordered, crystalline phases at each step of the lithiation process.
   The Li-7 2D experiments presented provide insight into the proximity of
   the various phases, reflecting the mechanism of the electrochemical
   reaction. In particular, a sequential model of nanopartide lithiation,
   rather than a simultaneous process, is suggested. Movement of lithium
   ions between two elements of the nanostructurecl Sn@C-GNs material, the
   metallic core and carbon shell, is also Observed. Conventional C-13
   solid-state NMR, SSNMR, experiments on <5 mg of active material from
   electrochemical cells were found to be impossible, but signal
   enhancements (up to 18-fold) via the use of extended echo trains in
   conjunction with magic-angle spinning enabled NMR characterization of
   the carbon. We demonstrate that the C-13 data is extremely sensitive to
   the added electron density when the graphitic carbon is reduced. We also
   investigate ex situ carbon electrodes from cycled Li-O-2 cells, where we
   find no evidence of charge sharing between the electrochemically active
   species and the graphitic carbon in the C-13 NMR spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The novel designed Jiggle Bed Reactor (JBR) was utilized to investigate
   thermal and catalytic gasification of bio-oils (without excess steam)
   with respect to carbon conversion and syngas (H-2 + CO) yield. Two
   commercial nickel based steam reforming catalysts (X and Y) were used.
   Beside its convenient and economical operation, the JBR was capable to
   be accurately and promisingly responsive to change in operating
   conditions. The catalyst X gave better results in terms of carbon
   conversion of bio-oils and hydrogen yield at 800 degrees C. Catalytic
   experiments showed that increasing the temperature decreased the molar
   H-2/CO ratio because of a lack of steam, while it increased the carbon
   conversion. Therefore, either steam should be added to the gasification
   reactor or a secondary water gas shift reactor should be used downstream
   of the gasification reactor to maximize the H-2/CO ratio. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Polyisobutylene (PIB) and other PIB-based materials are of significant
   interest for a vast array of applications, but chemical modification is
   often required to obtain the desired properties. Described here are two
   new approaches for the preparation of carboxylic acid-functionalized
   PIB. The ring opening of cyclic anhydrides from an allylic alcohol
   derivative of butyl rubber and the atom transfer radical polymerization
   of tert-butyl methacrylate from a rubber derivative both ultimately
   afford carboxylated materials. These materials displayed significantly
   enhanced adhesion to stainless steel, as well as increased ultimate
   tensile strength and Young's modulus in comparison to unmodified
   rubbers. Rheological studies suggested that they exhibit a greater
   degree of cross-linking-type behavior than the parent butyl rubber.
   Combined, these studies suggest that the properties of PIB can be
   readily tuned through synthetic modifications of the backbone, even at
   low mole percent, and that carboxylic acid moieties can impart desirable
   properties for various applications.}},

Abstract = {{High purity phenol crystal was recovered from dilute aqueous solution
   via a novel pervaporationcrystallization coupling (PVCC) system, which
   used a two-stage condenser to collect the permeate. The First stage was
   used as a crystallizer of phenol and the second stage was to collect
   remaining permeate that was not trapped in the first stage. Due to the
   low equilibrium pressure of phenol in the crystallizer operated at low
   temperatures (e.g., -9 degrees C) and excellent membrane permselectivity
   for phenol, a large proportion of phenol vapor leaving from membrane
   surface was condensed as high purity phenol crystals in the first
   condenser (crystallizer). The crystallization mechanism of phenol under
   vacuum condition was discussed. Phenol crystals were obtained when the
   temperature of the crystallizer was maintained in the range of -7 to 19
   degrees C. Phenol crystals at a purity of 99.8\% were recovered in the
   crystallizer cooled at -9 degrees C under a permeate pressure of 280 Pa,
   and the quantity of phenol collected as crystals accounted for
   75.9-96.1\% of the total amount of phenol permeated through the membrane
   for a broad feed concentration range of 220-10,100 ppm at an operating
   temperature of 80 degrees C. Phase equilibrium analysis revealed that
   water vapor would also be precipitated when the temperature was below a
   certain point at a given pressure. Thus, the crystallizer should be
   operated at an appropriate temperature in order to prevent water
   condensation in the phenol crystallizer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Effect of groundwater flow in vertical and horizontal fractures on

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{479-491}},

Abstract = {{Vertical closed loop systems, also known as borehole heat exchangers
   (BHEs), are a popular way of extracting the ground source heat energy.
   Primary factors affecting the performance of BHEs are the thermal and
   hydrogeological properties of the subsurface. Groundwater flow is known
   to potentially influence heat transport and system performance. The
   effect of groundwater movement is more commonly studied under
   homogeneous conditions. However, in heterogeneous fractured rocks, BHEs
   are more common than horizontal or open loops due to lack of sufficient
   soil layers and productive aquifers. The finite-element modelling shows
   that fractures can play an important role in BHE functioning.
   Especially, vertical open fractures (>= 1 mm) near the borehole (<= 10
   m) can have a considerable impact. Although increase in fracture
   aperture continuously affects the subsurface and BHE temperatures, the
   increase in its effect progressively lessens. Depending on the distance
   and aperture, one major fracture influencing the BHE operation
   performance can be identified; yet a larger number of fractures may
   govern heat transport (thermal plume outline) and thermal recovery.
   Individually, horizontal fractures may have less influence than vertical
   fractures. However, as the density of horizontal fractures increases,
   their impact can be major, exceeding that of fracture aperture. In
   particular, we propose that measurements of rock thermal properties be
   combined with fracture mapping, to better analyse the thermal response
   testing results and integrate the configuration of fractures in design
   and layout of the BHE(s). This is particularly valid for (vertical)
   fractures not intersecting with the borehole.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 1-D thermal-hydraulic model, THRUST, is developed to
   simulate and analyze the CANDU supercritical water reactor (SCWR) from
   the thermodynamic point of view without considering the effect of
   neutronic coupling. THRUST, where a characteristic-based finite
   difference scheme is used, is validated against the available numerical
   results. The model is, then, used for the analysis of the CANDU SCWR
   with a primary focus to determine the conditions for potential density
   wave oscillations. Extensive numerical studies are performed to obtain
   the marginal stability boundary in the operating regime of the reactor.
   The effect of various parameters, such as mass flow rate, operating
   pressure, axial heat flux profile, local pressure drop coefficient, and
   friction factor, on the stability thresholds of the reactor have been
   investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A growing literature is demonstrating that platinum (Pt) is transformed
   under surface conditions; yet (bio)geochemical processes at the
   nugget-soil-solution interface are incompletely understood. The
   reactivity of Pt exposed to Earth-surface weathering conditions,
   highlighted by this study, may improve our ability to track its movement
   in natural systems, e.g., focusing on nanoparticles as a strategy for
   searching for new, undiscovered sources of this precious metal. To study
   dissolution/re-precipitation processes of Pt and associated elements,
   grains of Pt-Fe alloy were collected from a soil placer deposit at the
   Fifield Pt-field, Australia. Optical- and electron-microscopy revealed
   morphologies indicative of physical transport as well as chemical
   weathering. Dissolution ``pits,{''} cavities, striations, colloidal
   nano-particles, and aggregates of secondary Pt platelets as well as
   acicular, iron (Fe) hydroxide coatings were observed. FIB-SEM-(EBSD)
   combined with S-mu-XRF of a sectioned grain showed a fine layer of up to
   5 mu m thick composed of refined, aggregates of 0.2 to 2 mu m sized
   crystalline secondary Pt overlying more coarsely crystalline Pt-Fe-alloy
   of primary magmatic origin. These results confirm that Pt is affected by
   geochemical transformations in supergene environments; structural and
   chemical signatures of grains surfaces, rims, and cores are linked to
   the grains' primary and secondary (trans)formational histories; and Pt
   mobility can occur under Earth surface conditions. Intuitively, this
   nanophase-Pt can disperse much further from primary sources of ore than
   previously thought. This considerable mineral reactivity demonstrates
   that the formation and/or release of Pt nanoparticles needs to be
   measured and incorporated into exploration geochemistry programs.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Fast pyrolysis of kraft lignin with partial (air) oxidation was studied
   in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor at reaction temperatures of 773 and
   823 K. The bio-oil vapors were fractionated using a series of three
   condensers maintained at desired temperatures, providing a dry bio-oil
   with less than 1\% water and over 96\% of the total bio-oil energy.
   Oxygen feed was varied to study its effect on yield, composition, and
   energy recovery in the gas, char and oil products. The addition of
   oxygen to the pyrolysis process increased the production of gases such
   as CO and CO2. It also changed the dry bio-oil properties, reducing its
   heating value, increasing its oxygen content, reducing its average
   molecular weight and tar concentration, while increasing its phenolics
   concentration. The lower reaction temperature of 773 K was preferred for
   both dry bio-oil yield and quality.
   Autothermal operation of the pyrolysis process was achieved with an
   oxygen feed of 72 or 54 g per kg of biomass at the reaction temperatures
   of 773 and 823 K, respectively. Autothermal operation reduced both yield
   and total energy content of the dry bio-oil, with relative reductions of
   24 and 20\% for the yield, 28 and 23\% for the energy content, at 773
   and 823 K. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a systematic method for developing a model of a dc
   distribution system, based on the configuration of the system. The dc
   distribution system is assumed to host electric vehicles and
   photovoltaic modules, using dc-dc converters, and to integrate them with
   an ac power grid. The developed model is of the matrix form and,
   therefore, can be readily expanded to represent a dc distribution system
   of any desired number of dc-dc converters. The model captures both the
   steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the system and includes port
   capacitors of the converters, as well as the interconnection cables.
   Thus, it can be used for identifying the condition for existence of a
   steady state, as well as for stability analysis. This paper further
   proposes an alternative set of characteristic equations that are less
   computationally intensive than the original matrix representation, for
   example, for online stability assessment tasks. The adequacy of the
   proposed model has been demonstrated through a number of case studies
   conducted and compared in the PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB software
   environments.}},

Volume = {{141}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Hollow bar micropiles are becoming a popular option for foundation
   retrofitting because of their fast installation and effectiveness as
   both a foundation system and ground improvement at the same time. This
   paper presents a field study and numerical investigation of the lateral
   behavior of single hollow bar micropiles embedded in stiff silty clay
   deposits. Two monotonic and six cyclic lateral load tests were conducted
   on four micropiles, and the results were used to calibrate/verify a
   numerical model that was then used in a numerical investigation. The
   observed load-displacement curves demonstrated that the micropile
   behavior was flexible and was governed by the properties of soil along a
   depth equal to 10 times the pile diameter. The parametric study
   suggested that hollow bar micropiles can carry moderate lateral loads
   with proper reinforcement configurations and pile head fixity condition.
   During cyclic loading, the micropile head stiffness degraded initially
   as the number of load cycles increased. However, the stiffness reached a
   constant value after a specific number of cycles at the same load
   amplitude and at different cyclic load amplitudes. (C) 2015 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Base flow recession analysis is required to estimate the long-term,
   reliable component of the hydrograph and water cycle, and for drought
   management, inflow design and analysis, and contaminant and nutrient
   transport. Operationally, recursive digital filtering (RDF) techniques
   are commonly applied; however, questions have been raised about the
   reliability and parameterization of these methods. A comparison of three
   base flow separation methods, including two popular RDFs and one
   hydrologic model, is performed in two base flow-dominant subbasins of
   the Grand River Basin in southern Ontario, Canada. The Eramosa River and
   Whiteman's Creek subbasins are similar in size (236 and 383km2,
   respectively) and have similar annual runoff distributions yet
   significantly different physiography governing runoff generation.
   Subbasin physiographic characteristics are found to result in
   significant differences in annual base flow distributions, which are
   well captured by the hydrologic model but not by the RDFs. Stable water
   isotopes (SWIs) are applied for verification of base flow separations
   using two-component mixing model separations and show better visual
   agreement with a base flow derived from the hydrologic model over the
   RDF methods. Limitations include insufficient isotope data to quantify a
   statistically significant model fit and results that are tied to
   subbasin physiography and basin-specific processes. Results support the
   application of SWIs for regional hydrograph separation and highlight the
   need for more efficient, yet physically based base flow separation in
   regions with complex physiography.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTo evaluate ultra-short-echo-time (UTE) MRI pulmonary
   signal-intensity measurements and reproducibility in chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD).
   MethodsA two-dimensional sequence (echo-time=0.05 ms;
   acquisition-time=13 s) with interleaved half-pulse excitation and radial
   ramp-sampling was used with compressed-sensing to reconstruct UTE images
   from under-sampled data. Five healthy volunteers and 15 subjects with
   COPD provided written informed consent to imaging and
   pulmonary-function-tests. Healthy volunteers underwent MRI at four lung
   volumes: full-expiration, functional-residual-capacity (FRC), FRC+1L,
   and full-inhalation; COPD patients underwent computed-tomography (CT)
   and MRI at FRC+1L. Three-week reproducibility was evaluated and the
   relative area of the density histogram-950 HU (RA(950)) was compared
   with mean MRI signal-intensity. The 15th percentile of
   signal-intensity-histogram (SI15) was compared with the 15th percentile
   of the CT-density-histogram (HU15).
   ResultsIn healthy subjects, signal-intensity correlated with the inverse
   of lung volume (r=0.99; P=0.007). Contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise
   ratios were significantly improved for 32-channel UTE (P<0.01). The
   coefficient of variation for 3-week repeated measurements was 4\%. There
   were significant correlations for signal-intensity with RA(950)
   (r=-0.71; P=0.005), FEV1/FVC (r=0.59; P=0.02), and for SI15 with HU15
   (r=0.62; P=0.01).
   ConclusionPulmonary signal-intensity is reproducible and related to
   tissue density. In COPD subjects with and without bronchiectasis,
   signal-intensity was also related to pulmonary function and CT
   measurements. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:1465-1474. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: It was hypothesized that perfusion computed
   tomography (CT), blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and vascular
   permeability surface area (PS) product parameters would be predictive of
   therapeutic anticancer agent uptake in pancreatic cancer, facilitating
   image-guided interpretation of human treatments. The hypothesis was
   tested in an orthotopic rabbit model of pancreatic cancer, by
   establishing-the model, imaging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and
   contrast CT, and spatially comparing the perfusion maps to the ex vivo
   uptake values of the injected photosensitizer, verteporfin.
   Materials and Methods: Nine New Zealand white rabbits underwent direct
   pancreas implantation of VX2 tumors, and CT perfusion or EUS was
   performed 10 days postimplantation. Verteporfin was injected during CT
   imaging, and the tissue was removed 1 hour post-injection for frozen
   tissue fluorescence scanning. Region-of-interest-comparisons of CT data
   with ex vivo fluorescence and histopathologic staining were performed.
   Results: Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT showed enhanced BF, BV, and PS in
   the tumor rim and decreased BF, BV, and PS in the tumor core.
   Significant correlations were found between ex vivo verteporfin
   concentration and each of BF, BV, and PS.
   Conclusions: The efficacy of verteporfin delivery in tumors is estimated
   by perfusion CT, providing a noninvasive method of mapping
   photosensitizer dose.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the first 360 sols (L-s 150 degrees to 5 degrees),
   representing just over half a Martian year, of atmospheric monitoring
   movies acquired using the NavCam imager from the Mars Science Laboratory
   (MSL) Rover Curiosity. Such movies reveal faint clouds that are
   difficult to discern in single images. The data set acquired was divided
   into two different classifications depending upon the orientation and
   intent of the observation. Up to sol 360, 73 Zenith movies and 79
   Supra-Horizon movies have been acquired and time-variable features could
   be discerned in 25 of each. The data set from MSL is compared to similar
   observations made by the Surface Stereo Imager (SSI) onboard the Phoenix
   Lander and suggests a much drier environment at Gale Crater (4.6 degrees
   S) during this season than was observed in Green Valley (68.2 degrees N)
   as would be expected based on latitude and the global water cycle. The
   optical depth of the variable component of clouds seen in images with
   features are up to 0.047 +/- 0.009 with a granularity to the features
   observed which averages 3.8 degrees. MCS also observes clouds during the
   same period of comparable optical depth at 30 and 50 km that would
   suggest a cloud spacing of 2.0 to 3.3 km. Multiple motions visible in
   atmospheric movies support the presence of two distinct layers of
   clouds. At Gale Crater, these clouds are likely caused by atmospheric
   waves given the regular spacing of features observed in many Zenith
   movies and decreased spacing towards the horizon in sunset movies
   consistent with clouds forming at a constant elevation. Reanalysis of
   Phoenix data in the light of the NavCam equatorial dataset suggests that
   clouds may have been more frequent in the earlier portion of the Phoenix
   mission than was previously thought. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by

Abstract = {{Objective: The efficacy of catheter-based cardiac ablation procedures
   can be significantly improved if real-time information is available
   concerning contact forces between the catheter tip and cardiac tissue.
   However, the widely used ablation catheters are not equipped for force
   sensing. This paper proposes a technique for estimating the contact
   forces without direct force measurements by studying the changes in the
   shape of the deflectable distal section of a conventional 7-Fr catheter
   (henceforth called the ``deflectable distal shaft,{''} the ``deflectable
   shaft,{''} or the ``shaft{''} of the catheter) in different loading
   situations. Method: First, the shaft curvature when the tip is moving in
   free space is studied and based on that, a kinematic model for the
   deflectable shaft in free space is proposed. In the next step, the shaft
   shape is analyzed in the case where the tip is in contact with the
   environment, and it is shown that the curvature of the deflectable shaft
   provides useful information about the loading status of the catheter and
   can be used to define an index for determining the range of contact
   forces exerted by the ablation tip. Results: Experiments with two
   different steerable ablation catheters show that the defined index can
   detect the range of applied contact forces correctly in more than 80\%
   of the cases. Based on the proposed technique, a framework for obtaining
   contact force information by using the shaft curvature at a limited
   number of points along the deflectable shaft is constructed. Conclusion:
   The proposed kinematic model and the force estimation technique can be
   implemented together to describe the catheter's behavior before contact,
   detect tip/tissue contact, and determine the range of contact forces.
   Significance: This study proves that the flexibility of the catheter's
   distal shaft provides a means of estimating the force exerted on tissue
   by the ablation tip.}},

Abstract = {{Background Inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes predispose
   to different cancer syndromes depending on whether they are mono-allelic
   or bi-allelic. This supports a causal relationship between expression
   level in the germline and phenotype variation. As a model to study this
   relationship, our study aimed to define the pathogenic characteristics
   of a recurrent homozygous coding variant in PMS2 displaying an
   attenuated phenotype identified by clinical genetic testing in seven
   Inuit families from Northern Quebec.
   Methods Pathogenic characteristics of the PMS2 mutation NM\_000535.5:
   c.2002A>G were studied using genotype-phenotype correlation,
   single-molecule expression detection and single genome microsatellite
   instability analysis.
   Results This PMS2 mutation generates a de novo splice site that competes
   with the authentic site. In homozygotes, expression of the full-length
   protein is reduced to a level barely detectable by conventional
   diagnostics. Median age at primary cancer diagnosis is 22 years among 13
   NM\_000535.5: c.2002A>G homozygotes, versus 8 years in individuals
   carrying biallelic truncating mutations. Residual expression of
   full-length PMS2 transcript was detected in normal tissues from
   homozygotes with cancers in their 20s.
   Conclusions Our genotype-phenotype study of c.2002A>G illustrates that
   an extremely low level of PMS2 expression likely delays cancer onset, a
   feature that could be exploited in cancer preventive intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Radial head (RH) implants are manufactured from stiff
   materials, resulting in reduced radio-capitellar contact area that may
   lead to cartilage degeneration. Although the native RH is
   nonaxisymmetric, most implants are axisymmetric, potentially
   contributing to altered contact mechanics. This study compared the joint
   contact area (A(c)) and maximum contact stress (sigma(max)) of
   axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric RH implants to the native
   radiocapitellar joint.
   Methods: The contact mechanics of intact elbows derived from cadaveric
   computed tomography data (n = 15) were compared with axisymmetric (size:
   18, 20, 22 mm) and nonaxisymmetric (size: 16 x 18, 18 x 20, 20 x 22 mm)
   RH hemiarthroplasty reconstructed elbows using Abaqus finite element
   software. Under a 100 N load, Ac and sigma(max) were computed for +/- 90
   degrees pronation-supination and 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and
   135 degrees flexion.
   Results: Compared with native, both hemiarthroplasty models produced
   significantly lower Ac and higher sigma(max) (P < .001). In the best
   orientation, the nonaxisymmetric RH provided significantly larger Ac at
   0 degrees and 135 degrees flexion (P = .03, P = .007) and reduced levels
   of sigma(max) at 45 degrees and 90 degrees flexion (P = .003, P < .001).
   However, there was also a worst orientation that reduced Ac and
   increased sigma(max) for all flexion angles (P < .003 for all). The
   native RH was less sensitive to rotation than the nonaxisymmetric RH in
   terms of sigma(max) (P < .001). The axisymmetric RH was not sensitive to
   rotation.
   Conclusions: Whereas a nonaxisymmetric RH can provide improved contact
   mechanics at certain forearm rotations and flexions, there are also
   orientations where A(c) is reduced and sigma(max) is increased.
   Axisymmetric designs are more consistent throughout forearm rotation and
   therefore may be more forgiving than the nonaxisymmetric RH implant
   design used in this study. (C) 2015 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow

Abstract = {{Recent developments in the area of enterprise risk management,
   especially in the context of high impact events, their uncertainty and
   variability, have highlighted the need for developing a unified approach
   for variability measurement in qualitative and quantitative phenomena.
   In this paper we discuss such an approach, which is based on Gini's
   seminal ideas and applicable for all types of data: nominal, ordinal,
   interval, and ratio. By establishing a general total-variation
   decomposition theorem, we provide a tool for decomposing the total
   variation into within (intra) and between (inter) components, and as a
   consequence introduce several indices of interest. We illustrate our
   general considerations using specially designed artificial data-sets as
   well as real-life examples pertaining to countries, their territorial

Abstract = {{Changes in climatic conditions, together with urban population growth,
   are making the development of tools to help disaster planners and policy
   makers select mitigation and adaptation measures a priority. The Coastal
   Cities at Risk (CCaR) project is a multidisciplinary team project
   involving four large coastal cities: Manila (The Philippines), Bangkok
   (Thailand), Lagos (Nigeria) and Vancouver (Canada). One of the project
   objectives includes development of a system dynamics simulation model to
   assess the resilience of the participating cities to climate change
   caused by sea level rise and riverine flooding. The resilience model is
   designed to integrate physical, economic, health, social and
   organizational impacts of climate change. This paper presents the
   methodology for providing spatial and temporal information on climate
   change health impacts for use in the resilience simulator. Basic
   population data, disease burden and physical conditions are integrated
   in the development of a composite health impact map. The output of this
   mapping exercise provides a more fully integrated view of population
   health to allow for the development of more targeted adaptive and risk
   reduction strategies at a local level for the City of Metro Vancouver.
   This methodology has been applied using data for 3 years, 2001, 2006 and
   2011 in order to give a dynamic simulation of health impacts using the
   resilience simulator. The final maps indicate that the Richmond and
   Delta regions of Metro Vancouver are more vulnerable to climate change
   caused by sea level rise and flooding compared to other municipalities.
   The paper demonstrates how composite health impact maps can be used both
   as an input for resilience modeling, as well as a ``stand-alone{''}
   product for the assessment and development of mitigation and adaptive
   strategies for coastal cities.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer architecture can have a significant effect on the properties and
   potential applications of materials. In this study, arborescent
   polyisobutylene (PIB)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) graft copolymers with
   varying PEO content were synthesized from arborescent
   PIB-co-polyisoprene and compared with linear PIB-PEO graft copolymers.
   By AFM imaging, phase separation was detected in a 48wt\% PEO
   arborescent copolymer. Tensile testing revealed that, in general,
   increasing PEO content led to increased tensile strength and Young's
   modulus but decreased elongation at break. Arborescent analogues
   exhibited lower elongation at break and lower strength compared with
   linear analogues but also less plastic deformation and yielding
   behaviour. Like linear analogues of comparable PEO content, films of the
   arborescent graft copolymers resisted the adsorption of
   rhodamine-labelled fibrinogen, suggesting that they may also exhibit
   non-fouling properties. Finally, the assembly of these amphiphilic
   copolymers in aqueous solution was investigated. Unlike the linear
   analogues, the sizes of the assemblies were not greatly affected by
   their method of preparation. This work demonstrates that it is possible
   to prepare PIB-based materials with a wide range of interesting
   properties by tuning not only the content of PEO but also the
   architectures of the macromolecules. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical

Volume = {{770}},
Pages = {{52-84}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive analysis of the pressure-gradient driven flow in a
   meandering channel has been presented. This geometry is of interest as
   it can be used for the creation of streamwise vortices which magnify the
   transverse transport of scalar quantities, e.g. heat transfer. The
   linear stability theory has been used to determine the meandering
   wavelengths required for the vortex formation. It has been demonstrated
   that reduction of the wavelength results in the onset of flow separation
   which, when combined with the wall geometry, results in an effective
   channel narrowing: the stream `lifts up' above the wall and becomes
   nearly rectilinear, thus eliminating vortex-generating centrifugal
   forces. Increase of the wavelength also leads to a nearly rectilinear
   stream, as the slope of the wall modulations becomes negligible. As
   shear-driven instability may interfere with the formation of vortices,
   the conditions leading to the onset of such instability have also been
   investigated. The attributes of the geometry which lead to the most
   effective vortex generation without any interference from the shear
   instabilities and with the smallest drag penalty have been identified.}},

Title = {{An empirical evaluation of ensemble adjustment methods for analogy-based
   effort estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{36-52}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Context: Effort adjustment is an essential part of analogy-based effort
   estimation, used to tune and adapt nearest analogies in order to produce
   more accurate estimations. Currently, there are plenty of adjustment
   methods proposed in literature, but there is no consensus on which
   method produces more accurate estimates and under which settings.
   Objective: This paper investigates the potential of ensemble learning
   for variants of adjustment methods used in analogy-based effort
   estimation. The number k of analogies to be used is also investigated.
   Method: We perform a large scale comparison study where many ensembles
   constructed from n out of 40 possible valid variants of adjustment
   methods are applied to eight datasets. The performance of each method
   was evaluated based on standardized accuracy and effect size.
   Results: The results have been subjected to statistical significance
   testing, and show reasonable significant improvements on the predictive
   performance where ensemble methods are applied.
   Conclusion: Our conclusions suggest that ensembles of adjustment methods
   can work well and achieve good performance, even though they are not
   always superior to single methods. We also recommend constructing
   ensembles from only linear adjustment methods, as they have shown better
   performance and were frequently ranked higher. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{275}},
Pages = {{39-50}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study reports a computational particle fluid dynamics model for the
   numerical simulation of a sand fluidized bed with 8 wt.\% and 16 wt.\%
   biomass loadings. The proposed CPFD model, based on a Barracuda
   framework, is validated using experimental data obtained in a 15.2 cm
   diameter bed with a 22.5 cm static height. This fluidized bed unit is
   equipped with a pair of fiber optic sensors allowing one to obtain both
   the bubble size and bubble velocity frequency distributions in an ample
   range of experimental conditions. In addition to this, the first-,
   second-, and third-order statistical moments of the bubble size and the
   bubble velocity distributions are calculated for each one of the
   operating conditions studied. On this basis, the present study
   demonstrates that the proposed CPFD model reproduces the asymmetric
   character of both bubble size and bubble velocity distributions. In
   addition, the simulated and experimental bubble size and bubble velocity
   distributions yield close first-, second-, and third-order statistical
   moments. Accordingly, one can ascertain that the proposed CPFD model is
   quite satisfactory for establishing fluid flow patterns in sand-biomass
   fluidized bed gasifiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a systematic mapping study of research on
   personality in software engineering. The goal is to plot the landscape
   of current published empirical and theoretical studies that deal with
   the role of personality in software engineering. We applied the
   systematic review method to search and select published articles, and to
   extract and synthesize data from the selected articles that reported
   studies about personality. Our search retrieved more than 19,000
   articles, from which we selected 90 articles published between 1970 and
   2010. Nearly 72\% of the studies were published after 2002 and 83\% of
   the studies reported empirical research findings. Data extracted from
   the 90 studies showed that education and pair programming were the most
   recurring research topics, and that MBTI was the most used test.
   Research related to pair programming, education, team effectiveness,
   software process allocation, software engineer personality
   characteristics, and individual performance concentrated over 88\% of
   the studies, while team process, behavior and preferences, and
   leadership performance were the topics with the smallest number of
   studies. We conclude that the number of articles has grown in the last
   few years, but contradictory evidence was found that might have been
   caused by differences in context, research method, and versions of the
   tests used in the studies. While this raises a warning for practitioners
   that wish to use personality tests in practice, it shows several
   opportunities for the research community to improve and extend findings
   in this field. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The poor management of human excreta in developing countries is among
   the most prominent global issues due to its negative impact on public
   health. This work demonstrates for the first time that self-sustaining
   smouldering of faeces mixed with sand is a feasible alternative to
   incineration for rapid destruction of waste. Self-sustaining smouldering
   requires minimal energy input and pre-drying of faeces compared to
   incineration. This process ensures the elimination of biological hazards
   via long residence times (>20 min) at high temperatures (>400 degrees
   C). Surrogate faeces which exhibits similar energetic, thermal, and
   mechanical properties to real faeces are used in this study. The
   parameters controlling the combustion process including moisture
   content, airflow rate, and sand-to-faeces ratio are mapped to establish
   the range of conditions where self-sustaining smouldering of faeces can
   be achieved. Experiments were conducted within the ranges 0-75\% for
   moisture content, 7-108 g/min for airflow rate and 2.75-11.9 g/g for
   sand-to-faeces (wet basis) ratio. Preliminary validation of the
   parameter space is done using real dog faeces. In this work, the
   parameter space defining the range of conditions where self-sustaining
   smouldering occurs is mapped. Results show successful self-sustaining
   smouldering of faeces for moisture contents of up to 60\%, airflow
   ranging from 10 to 100 g/min, and wet sand-to-faeces ratio greater than
   3.25. This proof-of-concept for a smouldering reactor to treat human
   solid waste demonstrates that smouldering of faeces could be the basis
   for a new, energy efficient waste treatment approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cross-linking of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is increasingly important
   with recent focus on its top surface stiffness. In this paper, we
   demonstrate that hyperthermal hydrogen projectile bombardment, a surface
   sensitive cross-linking technology, is superior in enhancing the
   mechanical properties of a cured PDMS surface without significantly
   degrading its hydrophobicity. Both water contact angle measurements and
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry are used to investigate
   the variations in surface chemistry and structure upon cross-linking.
   Using nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy, we confirm that the
   thickness of the crosslinked PDMS is controllable by the bombardment
   time, which opens opportunities for tuning cross-linking degree in
   compliance with arising requirements from the practice.}},

Abstract = {{Several experimental results published in the literature showed that
   weak pulsed magnetic fields affected the response of the central nervous
   system. However, the specific biological mechanisms that regulate the
   observed behaviors are still unclear and further scientific
   investigation is required. In this work we performed simulations on a
   neuronal network model exposed to a specific pulsed magnetic field
   signal that seems to be very effective in modulating the brain activity:
   the Complex Neuroelectromagnetic Pulse (CNP). Results show that CNP can
   silence the neurons of a feed-forward network for signal intensities
   that depend on the strength of the bias current, the endogenous noise
   level and the specific waveforms of the pulses. Therefore, it is
   conceivable that a neuronal network model responds to the CNP signal
   with an inhibition of its activity. Further studies on more realistic
   neuronal networks are needed to clarify if such an inhibitory effect on
   neuronal tissue may be the basis of the induced analgesia seen in humans
   and the antinociceptive effects seen in animals when exposed to the CNP.}},

Abstract = {{A data providing service (DPS) in service-oriented architecture is
   tasked only with the retrieval of data that are annotated over a domain
   ontology. One particular motivating application of DPSs is their use
   within collaborative environments. An important characteristic for the
   enterprises of such a collaborative environment is the ability to employ
   data sharing with one another. A major concern in this situation is the
   protection of each enterprise's privacy while still permitting data
   sharing. One potential solution is to provide filtered data through
   access control. This work describes how to implement access control
   through fine-grained filtering of DPS response messages; it is
   accomplished using a filtering ontology and relations between the domain
   ontology of DPS and the proposed filtering ontology. Therefore,
   enterprises can write enterprise-specific access control policies
   referencing a common filtering ontology defined within a collaborative
   environment, enabling access control-based data sharing within the
   environment. This work additionally illustrates the implementation of
   our general solution to data providing web services, interpreted by an
   eXtensible Access Control Markup Language-based access control
   framework. The implementation is further evaluated in a case study of
   real world data, provided by a health research institute in London,

Abstract = {{A non-aqueous approach was developed to synthesize iron phosphate
   cathode materials by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique.
   Deposition of iron phosphate thin films was achieved on nitrogen-doped
   carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) by combining ALD subcycles of Fe2O3
   (ferrocene-ozone) and POx (trimethyl phosphate-water) at 200 -350
   degrees C. The thickness of iron phosphate thin films depends linearly
   on the ALD cycle, indicating their self-limiting growth behavior. The
   growth per cycle of iron phosphate thin films was determined to be
   similar to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.5 angstrom, at 200, 250, 300, and 350
   degrees C, respectively. Characterization by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM
   techniques revealed uniform and conformal coating of amorphous iron
   phosphates on the surface of NCNTs. XANES analysis confirmed Fe-O-P
   bonding in the iron phosphates prepared by ALD. Furthermore,
   electrochemical measurement verified the high electrochemical activity
   of the amorphous iron phosphate as a cathode material in lithium-ion
   batteries. It is expected that the amorphous iron phosphate prepared by
   this facile and cost-effective ALD approach will find applications in
   the next generation of lithium-ion batteries and thin film batteries as
   either cathode materials or surface coating materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Previous studies have revealed hysteretic behavior in subterranean
   estuaries in response to intensified wave conditions caused by offshore
   storm events, showing dependence of submarine groundwater discharge
   (SGD) and subsurface salt distribution on historic wave conditions.
   Although most shorelines worldwide are also exposed to tidal
   fluctuations, it is unclear how tides moderate wave-induced SGD and
   salinity distribution in subterranean estuaries. This study presents
   numerical simulations that explore the combined influence of intensified
   wave conditions and tides on groundwater flow and salt transport in a
   subterranean estuary. The results show that tides weaken the hysteretic
   wave effect on SGD, suggesting that a tidally influenced subterranean
   estuary is less sensitive to intensified wave conditions with respect to
   the water fluxes across the aquifer-sea interface. However, due to
   enhancement of salt-freshwater mixing, tides strengthen the hysteretic
   wave effect on the salt fluxes across the aquifer-sea interface,
   prolonging the recovery of salt distribution in the subterranean estuary
   to the prestorm state. These findings reveal the nonlinear, coupling
   nature of processes driven by oceanic oscillations at different time
   scales in subterranean estuaries.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolism of birds is finely tuned to their activities and
   environments, and thus research on avian systems can play an important
   role in understanding organismal responses to environmental changes. At
   present, however, the physiological monitoring of bird metabolism is
   limited by the inability to take real-time measurements of key
   metabolites during flight. In this study, we present an implantable
   biosensor system that can be used for continuous monitoring of uric acid
   levels of birds during various activities including flight. The system
   consists of a needle-type enzymatic biosensor for the amperometric
   detection of uric acid in interstitial fluids. A lightweight
   two-electrode potentiostat system drives the biosensor, reads the
   corresponding output current and wirelessly transfers the data or
   records to flash memory. We show how the device can be used to monitor,
   in real time, the effects of short-term flight and rest cycles on the
   uric acid levels of pigeons. In addition, we demonstrate that our device
   has the ability to measure uric acid level increase in homing pigeons
   while they fly freely. Successful application of the sensor in migratory
   birds could open up a new way of studying birds in flight which would
   lead to a better understanding of the ecology and biology of avian
   movements.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, kinetic study is performed to construe the kinetics of
   gasification of model biomass compounds in supercritical water (SCW) in
   the presence of catalyst for hydrogen production using the mechanistic
   models developed applying Langmuir-Helshinwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) and
   Eley-Rideal (ER) procedure. Besides, two types of model biomass are used
   to perform simulation of SCWG for producing H-2 using the Aspen Plus.
   Glucose is used for both kinetic study and simulation. As well, further
   simulation is performed using hydroxymethyle furfural and phenol
   mixture. A better justification is obtain between the simulation results
   and data from literature. Higher temperature shows better hydrogen yield
   whereas higher concentration of biomass shows decreased hydrogen
   production. None of the gasification efficiency, product yield and
   carbon conversion efficiency is significantly affected by pressure
   variation. It is found that gasification efficiency is higher than
   100\%, which means SCW actively takes part in the reaction as an
   important reactant. Higher temperature favor carbon conversion
   efficiency (CCE). With the increase in concentration, CCE increases for
   glucose. However, the mixture of phenol and hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF)
   showed a declining trend with an increase in biomass concentration.
   Among the proposed mechanistic models, three models converged. However,
   an ER based model described as the dissociation of adsorbed glucose
   through Retro-Aldol reaction is found to be the rate determining step
   with an average absolute deviation 10.6\%. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{The electrical conductivity and percolation threshold of single and
   hybrid carbon filled composites are experimentally investigated.
   Polystyrene, carbon fiber (CF) and carbon black (CB) at three CF/CB
   ratios of 1.67, 3.33, 6.67 were compounded in a twin screw extruder
   micro-compounder and compression molded into sheets. The through-plane
   and in-plane electrical conductivity of the composites are measured by 2
   and 4 probe techniques. The percolation threshold of the single filler
   and hybrid composites are determined from the experimental results using
   a percolation model. The hybrid composites have a higher value of
   electrical conductivity and lower percolation threshold than the single
   CF filler composite except for the CF/CB ratio of 6.67. The percolation
   threshold for the cases of single filler and hybrid composites are
   modeled. The hard core / soft shell model is used and it is assumed that
   the percolation in a particle filled system depends on the ratio of
   tunneling distance to particle diameter. This ratio is determined by
   modeling single filler composites using the experimental data and kept
   constant in the modeling of the hybrid system. Finite size scaling is
   used to determine the percolation threshold for the infinite size hybrid
   system containing (nanosize) particles and micron size fibers for three
   CF/CB ratios. The simulation results show that the percolations of
   hybrid composites have the same trends observed in the experimental
   results. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015,

Abstract = {{Precast concrete shear walls are used to resist lateral loads in low-to
   medium-rise buildings. This paper introduces an innovated joining
   technique for these precast walls that will reduce the possibility of
   concrete damage and capital loss during earthquake events. The proposed
   technique consists of precast panels joined together and to the base
   using threaded steel anchor bolts, which in turn makes the construction
   process easier and faster. An experimental programme is conducted to
   validate this system and characterise its behaviour under lateral loads.
   Four reduced-scale wall specimens are tested under monotonic in-plane
   horizontal load. The lateral strength, ductility and possible modes of
   failure are used to evaluate the connection performance. The joined
   precast shear wall exhibits a high non-linear deformation without any
   signs of panel damage, which can be attributed to the gap opening and
   steel yielding at the connection plane. This indicates that the steel
   anchor bolts at the connection can be designed to act as structural
   ductile fuses.}},

Abstract = {{The flotation separation is the general method to recover molybdenite
   from a concentration containing molybdenite and bismuthinite, although
   the whole circuit could be long and complicated. In this paper, a novel
   selective electro-oxidation of molybdenite process has been introduced
   and systematically investigated for bismuthinite purification. It was
   found that Mo could be selectively separated by the electro-oxidation
   method under the conditions of pH not less than 9.0 and the applied
   potential at between 3.0 V and 4.0 V, by this circumstance Bi was hard
   to extract. The effects of NaCl concentration, liquid/solid ratio and
   stirring speed on electro-oxidation leaching were investigated. Optimum
   leaching conditions were found as follows: operated at room temperature,
   leaching time = 2.5 h, NaCl concentration = 4 mol/L, pH = 9-10, applied
   potential = 3.4V, liquid/solid ratio = 30 mL/g, stirring speed = 400
   rpm. Under these conditions, Mo extraction yield was obtained at 98.4\%
   and 99.3\% of Bi remained in the residue. The chlorine evolution
   reaction at the anode which was effected by leaching pH was studied by
   linear scan voltammetry. Mechanism of electro-oxidation leaching of Mo
   was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the mass transfer of Mo
   from leachate to organic phase was introduced, and the two phase
   transfer could obtain as high as 99.6\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Comparison of flow development in high density downer and riser reactors
   is experimentally investigated using fluid catalytic cracking particles
   with very high solids circulation rate up to 700 kg/m(2) s for the first
   time. Results show that both axial and radial flow structures are more
   uniform in downers compared to riser reactors even at very high density
   conditions, although the solids distribution becomes less uniform in the
   high density downer. Solids acceleration is much faster in the downer
   compared to the riser reactor indicating a shorter length of flow
   development and residence time, which is beneficial to the chemical
   reactions requiring short contact time and high product selectivity.
   Slip velocity in risers and downers is also first compared at high
   density conditions. The slip velocity in the downer is much smaller than
   in the riser for the same solids holdup indicating less particle
   aggregation and better gas-solids contacting in the downer reactors. (C)

   and the curing of the phenolic resin with a green curing agent
   organosolv lignin (OL) or Kraft lignin (KL). Evidenced by 13 C NMR, the
   curing mechanism involves alkylation reaction between the hydoxyalkyl
   groups of lignin and the ortho- and para-carbon of PHMF phenolic
   hydroxyl group. The curing kinetics was studied using differential
   scanning calorimetry and the kinetic parameters were obtained. The OL/KL
   cured PHMF resins were tested in terms of thermal stability, and

Abstract = {{Background: Recognition of tissue planes during surgery appears to be a
   skill acquired with experience. We conducted a pilot study to test this
   hypothesis using a novel method for evaluating this skill in a simulated
   environment.
   Methods: Twelve surgeons of varying levels of experience were shown 16
   captured images from a mesorectal excision. For each image, they were
   asked to draw the ideal dissection plane with a stylus on a tablet
   computer. We used a novel metric for comparing agreement between lines
   to determine the level of precision observed between junior and senior
   trainees and consultant surgeons and measure the accuracy of junior and
   senior trainees compared with consultant surgeons.
   Results: We observed significant differences in precision for 9 of 16
   images; 7 of these followed the predicted stepwise pattern associated
   with level of experience. Using consultant surgeons as the reference
   standard, we observed significant differences in accuracy between senior
   and junior trainees for 11 images, with senior trainees being more
   accurate in 10 of them. Only 2 images failed to contribute significant
   findings to our analysis.
   Conclusion: The findings of this pilot evaluation of a novel method for
   measuring a surgeon's ability to recognize tissue planes in a simulated
   model show that skill improves with experience. Further evaluation of
   this method will reveal its utility as an assessment tool and possibly
   as a training instrument.}},

   systematic review collates results from 30 studies conducted in 17
   countries, where 13 critical success factors were found to strongly
   impact m-Learning implementation. Using these results within the
   framework of the diffusion of innovation model for innovation adoption
   and the critical success factors together help us see what aspects of

   factor of 3 to 1. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on
   each of the five input variables to identify the threshold where each
   variable causes the benefit-cost test to fail. Variables include the
   estimate of future losses, percent of damage that can be reduced, added

Abstract = {{In recent years, magnetorheological (MR) clutches have been increasingly
   used for realizing compliant actuation. One difficulty in using MR
   clutches is the existence of nonlinear hysteretic behaviors between the
   input current and output torque of an MR clutch. In this paper, a new
   closed-loop, field-programable-gate-array (FPGA)-based control scheme to
   linearize an MR clutch's input-output relationship is presented. The
   feedback signal used in this control scheme is the magnetic field
   acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA board uses
   this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the MR
   clutch using an estimated model of the clutch magnetic field. The local
   use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR clutches
   for torque actuation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
   validated using an experimental platform that includes an MR clutch as
   part of a compliant actuation mechanism. The results clearly demonstrate
   that the use of the proposed FPGA-based closed-loop control scheme can
   effectively eliminate hysteretic behaviors of the MR clutch, allowing to
   have linear actuators with predictable behaviors.}},

Journal = {{IET SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{39-50}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Analogy-based effort estimation (ABE) is one of the efficient methods
   for software effort estimation because of its outstanding performance
   and capability of handling noisy datasets. Conventional ABE models
   usually use the same number of analogies for all projects in the
   datasets in order to make good estimates. The authors' claim is that
   using same number of analogies may produce overall best performance for
   the whole dataset but not necessarily best performance for each
   individual project. Therefore there is a need to better understand the
   dataset characteristics in order to discover the optimum set of
   analogies for each project rather than using a static k nearest

   k-medoids clustering algorithm to come up with the best set of analogies
   for each individual project before making the prediction. With bisecting
   k-medoids it is possible to better understand the dataset
   characteristic, and automatically find best set of analogies for each
   test project. Performance figures of the proposed estimation method are
   promising and better than those of other regular ABE models.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of grooves capable of reducing shear drag in laminar
   channel flow driven by a pressure gradient has been analyzed
   numerically. Only grooves with shapes that are easy to manufacture have
   been considered. Four classes of grooves have been studied: triangular
   grooves, trapezoidal grooves, rectangular grooves, and circularsegment
   grooves. Two types of groove placements have been considered: grooves
   that are cut into the surface (they can be created using material
   removal techniques) and grooves that are deposited on the surface (they
   can be created using material deposition techniques). It has been shown
   that the best performance is achieved when the grooves are aligned with
   the flow direction and are symmetric. For each class of grooves, there
   exists an optimal groove spacing, which results in the largest drag
   reduction. The largest drag reduction results from the use of
   trapezoidal grooves and the smallest results from the use of triangular
   grooves for the range of parameters considered in this work. Placing the
   same grooves on both walls increases the drag reduction by up to four
   times when comparing with grooves on one wall only. The predictions
   remain valid for any Reynolds number as long as the flow remains
   laminar.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Micropiles are used in various applications, including low-capacity
   micropile networks, underpinning, and seismic retrofitting of existing
   foundations and high-capacity foundations for new structures. Hollow-bar
   micropiles have an added advantage, as they provide fast installation
   with a high degree of ground improvement. The current Federal Highway
   Administration (FHWA) design guidelines designate hollow-bar micropiles
   as type B, even though the FHWA construction technique is different than
   the technique used for typical type B, which results in an overly
   conservative design. In addition, the current practice for construction
   of hollow-bar micropiles is limited to a drilling bit / hollow-bar
   diameter ratio of 2.5 or less. In this paper, full-scale load tests were
   conducted to evaluate the suitability of FHWA design guidelines to
   hollow-bar micropiles installed in cohesive soil and to evaluate the
   performance of hollow-bar micropiles constructed with a drilling bit /
   hollow-bar diameter ratio of 3. Eight micropiles were constructed using
   76 mm (3 in.) hollow bars (76 mm outside diameter and 48 mm inside
   diameter) with the air-water flushing technique and advanced to a depth
   of 5.75 m: six micropiles were installed using a 228 mm (9 in.) drill
   bit and two micropiles were installed using a 178 mm (7 in.) drill bit.
   All micropiles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges to
   measure the axial strain at three stations along the micropile shaft.
   The load tests included four axial monotonic and four cyclic axial
   loading tests. The results are presented and discussed in terms of
   load-displacement curves and load transfer mechanism. The load test
   results showed that the grout-ground bond strength values proposed by
   the FHWA (in 2005) for type B micropiles grossly underestimate the bond
   strength for calculating the ultimate capacity. In addition, the toe
   resistance can be significant for micropiles resting on sand due to the
   increased toe diameter. No tangent stiffness degradation was observed in
   the micropile capacity after applying 15 load cycles.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Micelles formed from amphiphilic copolymers are promising for the
   delivery of drug molecules, potentially leading to enhanced properties
   and efficacies. Critical aspects of these systems include the use of
   biocompatible, biodegradable polymer backbones as well as the ability to
   control the incorporation of drugs and their release rates. In this
   work, a poly(ester amide)-poly(ethylene oxide) graft copolymer with
   paclitaxel conjugated via ester linkages was prepared and assembled into
   micelles. For comparison, micelles with physically encapsulated
   paclitaxel were also prepared. The release rates of these two systems
   were studied, and the micelles with covalently conjugated paclitaxel
   exhibited a prolonged release of the drug in comparison to the
   noncovalent system, which rapidly released the payload. In vitro studies
   suggested that the poly(ester amide)-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers
   were nontoxic, whereas the toxicities of the drug-loaded micelles were
   dependent on their release rates. Overall, these systems are promising
   for further development as anticancer drug carriers.}},

Title = {{Detection of temporal lobe epilepsy using support vector machines in

Abstract = {{The detection of MRI abnormalities that can be associated to seizures in
   the study of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging task. In many
   cases, patients with a record of epileptic activity do not present any
   discernible MRI findings. In this domain, we propose a method that
   combines quantitative relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   with support vector machines (SVM) aiming to improve TLE detection. The
   main contribution of this work is two-fold: on one hand, the feature
   selection process, principal component analysis (PCA) transformations of
   the feature space, and SVM parameterization are analyzed as factors
   constituting a classification model and influencing its quality. On the
   other hand, several of these classification models are studied to
   determine the optimal strategy for the identification of TLE patients
   using data collected from multi-parametric quantitative MRI.
   A total of 17 TLE patients and 19 control volunteers were analyzed. Four
   images were considered for each subject (T1 map, T2 map, fractional
   anisotropy, and mean diffusivity) generating 936 regions of interest per
   subject, then 8 different classification models were studied, each one
   comprised by a distinct set of factors. Subjects were correctly
   classified with an accuracy of 88.9\%. Further analysis revealed that
   the heterogeneous nature of the disease impeded an optimal outcome.
   After dividing patients into cohesive groups (9 left-sided seizure
   onset, 8 right-sided seizure onset) perfect classification for the left
   group was achieved (100\% accuracy) whereas the accuracy for the right
   group remained the same (88.9\%).
   We conclude that a linear SVM combined with an ANOVA-based feature
   selection +PCA method is a good alternative in scenarios like ours where
   feature spaces are high dimensional, and the sample size is limited. The
   good accuracy results and the localization of the respective features in
   the temporal lobe suggest that a multi-parametric quantitative MRI,
   ROI-based, SVM classification could be used for the identification of
   TLE patients. This method has the potential to improve the diagnostic
   assessment, especially for patients who do not have any obvious lesions
   in standard radiological examinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel concept of utilizing a photovoltaic (PV)
   solar farm inverter as STATCOM, called PV-STATCOM, for improving stable
   power transfer limits of the interconnected transmission system. The
   entire inverter rating of the PV solar farm, which remains dormant
   during night-time, is utilized with voltage and damping controls to
   enhance stable power transmission limits. During daytime, the inverter
   capacity left after real power production is used to accomplish the
   aforementioned objective. Transient stability studies are conducted on a
   realistic single machine infinite bus power system having a midpoint
   located PV-STATCOM using EMTDC/PSCAD simulation software. The PV-STATCOM
   improves the stable transmission limits substantially in the night and
   in the day even while generating large amounts of real power. Power
   transfer increases are also demonstrated in the same power system for:
   1) two solar farms operating as PV-STATCOMs and 2) a solar farm as
   PV-STATCOM and an inverter-based wind farm with similar STATCOM
   controls. This novel utilization of a PV solar farm asset can thus
   improve power transmission limits which would have otherwise required
   expensive additional equipment, such as series/shunt capacitors or
   separate flexible ac transmission system controllers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a positive-sequence phase-angle estimation method
   based on discrete Fourier transform for the synchronization of
   three-phase power-electronic converters under distorted and
   variable-frequency conditions. The proposed method is designed based on
   a fixed sampling rate and, thus, it can simply be employed for control
   applications. First, analytical analysis is presented to determine the
   errors associated with the phasor estimation using standard discrete
   Fourier transform in a variable-frequency environment. Then, a robust
   phase-angle estimation technique is proposed, which is based on a
   combination of estimated positive and negative sequences, tracked
   frequency, and two proposed compensation coefficients. The proposed
   method has one cycle transient response and is immune to harmonics,
   noises, voltage imbalances, and grid frequency variations. An effective
   approximation technique is proposed to simplify the computation of the
   compensation coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   verified through a comprehensive set of simulations in Matlab software.
   Simulation results show the robust and accurate performance of the
   proposed method in various abnormal operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The Nechalacho project is the most advanced large heavy rare earth
   elements (HREE) project outside of China. Open circuit and locked cycle
   flotation tests along with pilot plant testing of rare earth elements
   (REE) concentration from the host rocks are accomplished with collectors
   of alkyl phosphates and the modifier of citric acid. In this study, the
   function of citric acid in the separation of rare metals against
   silicates is investigated by a combination of micro-flotation tests and
   time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) surface
   chemical analysis. It was observed that there was little effect of
   citric acid on the REE recovery in the micro-flotation tests conditioned
   with de-ionized water (DIW). To evaluate the flotation response with
   excess secondary ions in the pulp, micro-flotation tests were performed
   to look at changes in recovery as a result of adding Al ions and the
   subsequent presence of citric acid. The results from three
   micro-flotation tests (DIW, DIW with the addition of 100 mg/L Al and DIW
   + 100 mg/L Al and 500 g/t citric acid) revealed that the addition of Al
   ions led to a decrease of REE grade, a lower REE minerals recovery
   and/or an unexpected promotion of silicates to the concentrate. Citric
   acid reduced the negative effect generated by the Al ions in the
   flotation, which was shown by an improvement in REE grade. ToF-SIMS
   surface analysis of undifferentiated grains from the tests with and
   without citric acid revealed that grains reporting to the concentrate
   are doing so in response to collector attachment in combination with
   having more secondary Al on their surface. Citric acid may partially
   form aqueous soluble metal-ligand complexes resulting in less Al ions on
   the grains surface, which were rejected to the tailings. Citric acid
   also may form chelation competing for adsorption on gangue minerals,
   resulting in a diminished effectiveness of the activation site. (C) 2015

Title = {{Mixing and operability characteristics of mechanically fluidized
   reactors for the pyrolysis of biomass}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{205-212}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Mixing characteristics of a novel Mechanically Fluidized Reactor (MFR),
   a continuous, cylindrical, mechanically mixed reactor developed for
   biomass pyrolysis in the ICFAR laboratory, have been investigated with
   the specific objective of selecting the optimal stirrer geometry for
   fast pyrolysis of biomass. The MFR does not use any fluidization gas and
   its stirrer provides the required mixing between the injected biomass
   and the bed material while effectively breaking any possible
   agglomerate. In addition, good mixing is crucial to achieve effective
   heat transfer characteristics between the heaters and the bed, and
   between the bed and the biomass particles.
   In conventional fluidized beds, the torque required to mix the bed
   decreases as the superficial velocity of its fluidization gas increases,
   becoming constant above a critical superficial velocity which is a
   function of the stirrer characteristics. For the MFR, a method has been
   developed to monitor the torque and the power required to mechanically
   mix a bed of low density particles with the natural bed aeration
   resulting from the formation of gases and vapors during pyrolysis.
   In this study, three different shaped stirrers were first compared at
   various rotational speeds by artificially aerating the bed with nitrogen
   at different superficial velocities to simulate the generation of vapors
   and gases during pyrolysis. Furthermore, different fluidization gases
   were used in order to simulate the different characteristics of vapors
   produced during pyrolysis and, specifically, to evaluate the effects of
   their density and viscosity. The critical aeration rate at which the
   stirrer torque becomes constant is similar for all the stirrers.
   The second part of this study focused on actual wood pyrolysis tests.
   The reactor was first supplied with nitrogen above the critical aeration
   rate. Then, the nitrogen was shut off and wood pellets were fed into the
   reactor. The formation of pyrolysis gases and vapors greatly decreased
   the power required to mix the bed and this reduction was dependent on
   the type of stirrer.
   The stirrers were ranked in terms of their performance in minimizing the
   pyrolysis time. The vertical blade stirrer resulted in the smallest
   pyrolysis time and power consumption. Additionally no segregation of the
   biomass pellets was observed. Hence, gases and vapors were formed at the
   optimum location for effective aeration. The findings of this project
   have provided a better understanding of the MFR technology when used for
   the pyrolytic processing of biomass materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Birdsong is a complex, learned vocalization that is strongly shaped by
   early developmental conditions. In males, stressful early-life
   conditions are known to have adverse effects on the development of song
   and its supporting neural structures (i.e. the song-control system).
   Conversely, how developmental stress affects female song preferences and
   brain development is understudied. We subjected female European
   starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to an unpredictable food stressor through
   the first few months of life. As adults, we first assessed females' song
   preferences using an operant-conditioning task in a (1) conspecific
   versus heterospecific song comparison and (2) short-versus long-bout
   starling song comparison. Then, we measured the immediate-early gene
   (Zenk) response in auditory forebrain areas when birds were listening to
   either conspecific song or heterospecific song and quantified the
   volumes of song-control brain regions. We observed that females reared
   in control conditions showed a significant behavioural preference for
   conspecific song (over heterospecific song), whereas females reared in
   food-restricted conditions did not. Although individual females showed
   clear preferences for either short-or long-bout starling song, the
   direction of this preference was not consistent between birds. Control
   females had significantly more Zenk induction in auditory forebrain
   areas than food-restricted females when listening to conspecific song.
   Heterospecific song playback resulted in significantly less Zenk
   induction than conspecific song playback, with no difference between
   treatment groups. Across the song-control regions measured, we observed
   no significant differences in volumes between the treatment groups.
   However, we did find that the volume of the song-control region HVC was
   positively related to the strength of preference that females displayed
   in the conspecific versus heterospecific operant preference test. Thus,
   early-life stressors known to affect male song and brain development
   have similar effects on female behaviour and neural response to song
   stimuli. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the degree of neuromuscular transmission
   variability and motor unit (MU) remodelling in patients with diabetic
   polyneuropathy (DPN) using decomposition-based quantitative
   electromyography (DQEMG) and near fibre (NF) motor unit potential (MUP)
   parameters.
   Methods: The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was tested in 12 patients
   with DPN (65 +/- 15 years) and 12 controls (63 +/- 15 years). DQEMG was
   used to analyze electromyographic (EMG) signals collected during
   voluntary contractions. MUP and NF MUP parameters were analyzed. NF MUPs
   were obtained by high-pass filtering MUP template waveforms, which
   isolates contributions of fibres that are close to the needle detection
   surface. NF MUP parameters provided assessment of motor unit size (NF
   area), fibre density (NF fibre count) and contribution dispersion (NF
   dispersion) and neuromuscular transmission instability (NF jiggle).
   Results: DPN patients had larger (+45\% NF area), more complex (+30\% NF
   fibre count), and less stable (+30\% NF jiggle) NF MUPs (p < 0.05). No
   significant relationships were found between NF MUP stability and
   denervation, or strength; however NF MUP complexity was positively
   related to TA denervation in the DPN group (r = 0.63; p < 0.05). NF MUP
   complexity and instability were positively related in DPN patients (r =
   0.46; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: DPN is associated with neuromuscular transmission
   instability and MU remodelling that can be assessed using DQEMG.
   Significance: DQEMG-derived NF MUP parameters may be useful in
   identifying patients in early stages of neuromuscular dysfunction
   related to DPN. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{AimTo obtain concurrent radicular measurements in the mesiobuccal (MB)
   and mesiolingual (ML) canals of mandibular first molars using scanned
   data of micro-computed tomography (CT) with novel software.
   MethodologyThe scanned data from 37 mandibular first molar mesial roots
   were reconstructed and analysed with custom-developed software (Kappa2).
   For each canal, three-dimensional (3D) surface models were re-sliced at
   0.1-mm intervals perpendicular to the central axis. Dentine thicknesses,
   canal widths and 3D curvatures were measured automatically on each
   slice. Measurements were analysed statistically with anova for
   differences at each direction and at different levels of both canals.
   ResultsLateral dentine thicknesses were significantly higher than mesial
   and distal thicknesses, at all the levels of both canals (P<0.001).
   Mesial thicknesses were significantly higher than distal thicknesses in
   the coronal third of both canals (P<0.001). Thinnest dentine thicknesses
   were mainly located on the disto-inside of both canals. Narrowest canal
   widths were 0.240.10 and 0.22 +/- 0.09mm in MB and ML canals,
   respectively. Canal curvatures were greatest in the apical third of both
   canals (P<0.001), and they were greater in the MB canals than in the ML
   canals (P<0.05).
   ConclusionsMicro-computed tomography with novel software provided
   valuable anatomical information for optimizing instrumentation and
   minimizing mishaps in nonsurgical root canal treatment.}},

   rolls with the wavevector parallel to the wavevector of the heating. The
   resulting net heat flow between the walls increases proportionally to
   Ra-p but the growth saturates when Ra-p = O(10(3)). The most effective
   heating pattern corresponds to alpha approximate to 1, as this leads to
   the most intense transverse motion. The primary convection is subject to
   transition to secondary states with the onset conditions depending on
   alpha. The conditions leading to transition between different forms of
   secondary motion have been determined using the linear stability theory.
   Three patterns of secondary motion may occur at small Reynolds numbers
   Re, i.e. longitudinal rolls, transverse rolls and oblique rolls, with
   the critical conditions varying significantly as a function of alpha. An
   increase of alpha leads to the elimination of the longitudinal rolls
   and, eventually, to the elimination of the oblique rolls, with the
   transverse rolls assuming the dominant role. For large ff, the
   transition is driven by the Rayleigh-Benard mechanism; while for alpha =
   O(1), the spatial parametric resonance dominates. The global flow
   characteristics are identical regardless of whether the heating is
   applied at the lower or the upper wall.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this computed tomography-based study was to
   quantify erosions in B2 glenoids. We hypothesized that erosions do not
   occur symmetrically and that they have a predictable orientation.
   Methods: This study evaluated 55 type B2 glenoid cases. Computed
   tomography data were used to create three-dimensional reconstructions,
   and point coordinates were extracted from each reconstruction for
   morphologic analysis of the osteoarthritic glenoid and humerus.
   Results: There was a significant difference between the mean orientation
   angle (28 degrees +/- 11 degrees) of the posterior glenoid line of
   erosion and the superoinferior axis (P < .001), which resulted in the
   average erosion being directed toward the 8-o'clock position. On
   average, the erosion started 1.6 +/- 3.4 mm posterior to the glenoid
   center point. In 35\% of B2 cases, the line of erosion was curved. The
   mean surface area was 763 +/- 296 mm(2) for the neoglenoid and 957 +/-
   276 mm(2) for the paleoglenoid, indicating that the neoglenoid occupied
   44\% +/- 12\% of the total glenoid area. In this cohort, the mean radius
   of the humeral head neoarticulation was 32 +/- 6 mm, the neoglenoid
   radius was 37 +/- 8 mm, and the paleoglenoid radius was 34 +/- 7 mm. The
   radius of the humeral head was significantly less than that of the
   neoglenoid (P < .001) and the paleoglenoid (P = .009). In addition, the
   radius of the neoglenoid was significantly greater than the radius of
   the paleoglenoid (P = .012).
   Discussion: Type B2 glenoids have a predictable wear pattern, which is
   not axisymmetric to the glenoid superoinferior axis. In addition, the
   identified anatomic characteristics of B2 erosions will aid surgeons in
   the operative management of bone loss and may assist manufacturers in
   the design of augmented components. (C) 2015 Journal of Shoulder and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hollowcore slabs are commonly used in different types of structures.
   They usually include a 50-mm concrete topping. Structural engineers can
   use this topping to increase the slab load-carrying capacity. North
   American design standards relate the horizontal shear strength at the
   interface between hollowcore slabs and the concrete topping to the slab
   surface roughness. This paper presents the results of four push-off
   tests on hollowcore slabs supplied by two manufacturers and roughened
   using a conventional steel broom. The tested slabs sustained higher
   horizontal shear stresses than those specified by the design standards.
   Utilizing the data from the push-off tests, an analytical model was
   applied to evaluate the shear and peel stiffnesses, k(s) and k(p), of
   the interface between hollowcore slabs and concrete topping. Structural
   engineers can utilize k(s) and k(p) values to model the composite action
   between hollowcore slabs from the two manufacturers and concrete
   topping. The analytical model was also used to evaluate the actual
   distribution of shear and peel stresses. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Urbanization modifies surface energy and water budgets, and has
   significant impacts on local and regional hydroclimate. In recent
   decades, a number of urban canopy models have been developed and
   implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to
   capture urban land-surface processes. Most of these models are
   inadequate due to the lack of realistic representation of urban
   hydrological processes. Here, we implement physically-based
   parametrizations of urban hydrological processes into the single layer
   urban canopy model in the WRF model. The new single-layer urban canopy
   model features the integration of, (1) anthropogenic latent heat, (2)
   urban irrigation, (3) evaporation from paved surfaces, and (4) the urban
   oasis effect. The new WRF-urban modelling system is evaluated against
   field measurements for four different cities; results show that the
   model performance is substantially improved as compared to the current
   schemes, especially for latent heat flux. In particular, to evaluate the
   performance of green roofs as an urban heat island mitigation strategy,
   we integrate in the urban canopy model a multilayer green roof system,
   enabled by the physical urban hydrological schemes. Simulations show
   that green roofs are capable of reducing surface temperature and
   sensible heat flux as well as enhancing building energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Using wind-speed records from mobile weather stations deployed in
   tropical cyclones making landfall along the United States coastline over
   the period 1998-2008, an analysis was made of the gust factors observed
   in near-neutral conditions by station site and wind direction. The
   dataset used contained a total of 56 individual station
   site/wind-direction combinations representative of a wide variety of
   terrain conditions, ranging from open water to urban exposures.
   Consideration of the peak gust measured along a given axis, together
   with the associated components measured simultaneously along the other
   two axes, showed that peak along-wind gusts are primarily associated
   with vertical velocities in air moving towards the surface, while peak
   downwards and upwards vertical gusts are associated with along-wind
   velocity components that are respectively larger and smaller than the
   mean along-wind velocity. This behaviour is directly related to the
   value of the primary component of the surface shear stress in the
   coordinate system used for the analysis, which involves the product of
   the along-wind and vertical velocity components and which must be
   negative in the surface layer. Grouping the mean gust-factor curves for
   each velocity component into bins based on the turbulence intensity
   showed that the individual curves in a given bin could not all be
   considered to be drawn from the same underlying parent distribution, an
   observation that was confirmed by statistical testing. A quantitative
   exploration of the effects of upstream terrain variations on the
   observed gust factors for a selected number of sites suggested that the
   gust factors and other flow parameters, such as the turbulence
   intensity, are heavily influenced by the upstream terrain at many of the
   station sites considered.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to investigate the flow development

   temperature and/or the decrease of flow rate (i.e. increasing Gr/ Re-2).
   A strong correlation between the hydrodynamic and thermal development in
   the heated section was also observed. The Proper Orthogonal
   Decomposition (POD) was performed on the turbulent velocity fields. The
   results revealed the presence of local convective cells near the heated

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effects of geometry on
   the wind loads acting on photovoltaic panel arrays with modules mounted
   parallel to roof surfaces of low-rise buildings. Specific attention was
   made to determine the effects of varying the spacing between individual
   modules, G, and the mounting height above the roof surface, H. The
   photovoltaic system was modeled as an array of 28 modules on a 1/20
   scale building model with a roof slope of 30 degrees. In addition,
   limited studies were carried out with the array mounted on a flat-roof
   to assess the impact of roof slope. In general, it was found that larger
   gaps between modules, G, and smaller gaps between the panels and the
   roof surface, H, were found to yield lower net wind loads. Minimum loads
   tend to occur for G/H > similar to 1, for the particular panel size
   considered in the study. Pressure equalization between the upper and
   lower surfaces of the modules results in the magnitudes of the net panel
   pressures typically being lower than those for the bare roof surface. A
   pressure equalization factor, Ceq, was used as a measure of how much the
   peak net wind loads on the panels are reduced relative to the peak
   external loads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being used increasingly for
   image-guided targeted biopsy and focal therapy of prostate cancer. In
   this paper, a combined rigid and deformable registration technique is
   proposed to register pre-treatment diagnostic 3 T magnetic resonance
   (MR) images of the prostate, with the identified target tumor(s), to
   intra-treatment 1.5 T MR images. The pre-treatment T2-weighted MR images
   were acquired with patients in a supine position using an endorectal
   coil in a 3 T scanner, while the intra-treatment T2-weighted MR images
   were acquired in a 1.5 T scanner before insertion of the needle with
   patients in the semi-lithotomy position. Both the rigid and deformable
   registration algorithms employ an intensity-based distance metric
   defined based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptors
   (MIND) between images. The optimization routine for estimating the rigid
   transformation parameters is initialized using four pairs of manually
   selected approximate corresponding points on the boundaries of the
   prostate. In this paper, the problem of deformable image registration is
   approached from the perspective of state estimation for dynamical
   systems. The registration algorithm employs a rather generic dynamic
   linear elastic model of the tissue deformation discretized by the finite
   element method (FEM). We use the model in a classical state estimation
   framework to estimate the deformation of the prostate based on the
   distance metric between pre- and intra-treatment images. Our deformable
   registration results using 17 sets of prostate MR images showed that the
   proposed method yielded a target registration error (TRE) of 1.87 +/-
   0.94 mm, 2.03 +/- 0.94 mm, and 1.70 +/- 0.93 mm for the whole gland
   (WG), central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively, using
   76 manually-identified fiducial points. This was an improvement over the
   2.67 +/- 1.31 mm, 2.95 +/- 1.43 mm, and 2.34 +/- 1.11 mm, respectively
   for the WG, CG, and PZ after rigid registration alone. Dice similarity
   coefficients (DSC) in the WG, CG and PZ were 88.2 +/- 5.3, 85.6 +/- 7.6
   and 68.7 +/- 6.9 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the mean absolute
   distances (MAD) between surfaces was 1.26 +/- 0.56 mm and 1.27 +/- 0.55
   mm in the WG and CG, after deformable registration. These results
   indicate that the proposed registration technique has sufficient
   accuracy for localizing prostate tumors in MRI-guided targeted biopsy or
   focal therapy of clinically localized prostate cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Very few selected species of primates are known to be capable of
   entering torpor. This exciting discovery means that the ability to enter
   a natural state of dormancy is an ancestral trait among primates and, in
   phylogenetic terms, is very close to the human lineage. To explore the
   regulatory mechanisms that underlie primate torpor, we analyzed signal
   transduction cascades to discover those involved in coordinating tissue
   responses during torpor. The responses of mitogen-activated protein
   kinase (MAPK) family members to primate torpor were compared in six
   organs of control (aroused) versus torpid gray mouse lemurs, Microcebus
   murinus. The proteins examined include extracellular signal-regulated
   kinases (ERKs), c-jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), MAPK kinase (MEK),
   and p38, in addition to stress-related proteins p53 and heat shock
   protein 27 (HSP27). The activation of specific MAPK signal transduction
   pathways may provide a mechanism to regulate the expression of
   torpor-responsive genes or the regulation of selected downstream
   cellular processes. In response to torpor, each MAPK subfamily responded
   differently during torpor and each showed organ-specific patterns of
   response. For example, skeletal muscle displayed elevated relative
   phosphorylation of ERK1/2 during torpor. Interestingly, adipose tissues
   showed the highest degree of MAPK activation. Brown adipose tissue
   displayed an activation of ERK1/2 and p38, whereas white adipose tissue
   showed activation of ERK1/2, p38, MEK, and JNK during torpor.
   Importantly, both adipose tissues possess specialized functions that are
   critical for torpor, with brown adipose required for non-shivering
   thermogenesis and white adipose utilized as the primary source of lipid
   fuel for torpor. Overall, these data indicate crucial roles of MAPKs in
   the regulation of primate organs during torpor.}},

Abstract = {{Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) from Madagascar present an
   excellent model for studies of torpor regulation in a primate species.
   In the present study, we analyzed the response of the insulin signaling
   pathway as well as controls on carbohydrate sparing in six different
   tissues of torpid versus aroused gray mouse lemurs. We found that the
   relative level of phospho-insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) was
   significantly increased in muscle, whereas the level of phospho-insulin
   receptor (IR) was decreased in white adipose tissue (WAT) of torpid
   animals, both suggesting an inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling during torpor in these tissues. By contrast,
   the level of phospho-IR was increased in the liver. Interestingly,
   muscle, WAT, and liver occupy central roles in whole body homeostasis
   and each displays regulatory controls operating at the plasma membrane.
   Changes in other tissues included an increase in phosphoglycogen
   synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3 alpha) and decrease in phospho-ribosomal
   protein S6 (RPS6) in the heart, and a decrease in phospho-mammalian
   target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the kidney. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
   that gates carbohydrate entry into mitochondria is inhibited via
   phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (e.g., PDK4). In the
   skeletal muscle, the protein expression of PDK4 and phosphorylated PDH
   at Ser 300 was increased, suggesting inhibition during torpor. In
   contrast, there were no changes in levels of PDH expression and
   phosphorylation in other tissues comparing torpid and aroused animals.
   Information gained from these studies highlight the molecular controls
   that help to regulate metabolic rate depression and balance energetics
   during primate torpor.}},

Abstract = {{The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is one of few primate species
   that is able to enter daily torpor or prolonged hibernation in response
   to environmental stresses. With an emerging significance to human health
   research, lemurs present an optimal model for exploring molecular
   adaptations that regulate primate hypometabolism. A fundamental
   challenge is how to effectively regulate energy expensive cellular
   processes (e.g., transcription and translation) during transitions
   to/from torpor without disrupting cellular homeostasis. One such
   regulatory mechanism is reversible posttranslational modification of
   selected protein targets that offers fine cellular control without the
   energetic burden. This study investigates the role of phosphorylation
   and/or acetylation in regulating key factors involved in energy
   homeostasis (AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, signaling pathway),
   mRNA translation (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha or eIF2 alpha,
   eukaryotic initiation factor 4E or eIF4E, and initiation factor 4E
   binding protein or 4EBP), and gene transcription (histone H3) in six
   tissues of torpid and aroused gray mouse lemurs. Our results indicated
   selective tissue-specific changes of these regulatory proteins. The
   relative level of Thr172-phosphorylated AMPK alpha was significantly
   elevated in the heart but reduced in brown adipose tissue during daily
   torpor, as compared to the aroused lemurs, implicating the regulation of
   AMPK activity during daily torpor in these tissues. Interestingly, the
   levels of the phosphorylated eIFs were largely unaltered between aroused
   and torpid animals. Phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 were
   examined as a marker for transcriptional regulation. Compared to the
   aroused lemurs, level of Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 decreased
   significantly in white adipose tissue during torpor, suggesting global
   suppression of gene transcription. However, a significant increase in
   acetyl-histone H3 in the heart of torpid lemurs indicated a possible
   stimulation of transcriptional activity of this tissue. Overall, our
   study demonstrates that AMPK signaling and posttranslational regulation
   of selected proteins may play crucial roles in the control of
   transcription/translation during daily torpor in mouse lemurs.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of mammals employ torpor as an energy-saving strategy in
   environments of marginal or severe stress either on a daily basis during
   their inactive period or on a seasonal basis during prolonged multi-day
   hibernation. Recently, a few Madagascar lemur species have been
   identified as the only primates that exhibit torpor; one of these is the
   gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). To explore the regulatory
   mechanisms that underlie daily torpor in a primate, we analyzed the
   expression of 28 selected genes that represent crucial survival pathways
   known to be involved in squirrel and bat hibernation. Array-based
   real-time PCR was used to compare gene expression in control (aroused)
   versus torpid lemurs in five tissues including the liver, kidney,
   skeletal muscle, heart, and brown adipose tissue. Significant
   differences in gene expression during torpor were revealed among genes
   involved in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, antioxidant defense,
   apoptosis, hypoxia signaling, and protein protection. The results showed
   upregulation of select genes primarily in liver and brown adipose
   tissue. For instance, both tissues showed elevated gene expression of
   peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (ppargc), ferritin
   (fth1), and protein chaperones during torpor. Overall, the data show
   that the expression of only a few genes changed during lemur daily
   torpor, as compared with the broader expression changes reported for
   hibernation in ground squirrels. These results provide an indication
   that the alterations in gene expression required for torpor in lemurs
   are not as extensive as those needed for winter hibernation in squirrel
   models. However, identification of crucial genes with altered expression
   that support lemur torpor provides key targets to be explored and
   manipulated toward a goal of translational applications of inducible
   torpor as a treatment option in human biomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{A natural tolerance of various environmental stresses is typically
   supported by various cytoprotective mechanisms that protect
   macromolecules and promote extended viability. Among these are
   antioxidant defenses that help to limit damage from reactive oxygen
   species and chaperones that help to minimize protein misfolding or
   unfolding under stress conditions. To understand the molecular
   mechanisms that act to protect cells during primate torpor, the present
   study characterizes antioxidant and heat shock protein (HSP) responses
   in various organs of control (aroused) and torpid gray mouse lemurs,
   Microcebus murinus. Protein expression of HSP70 and HSP90 alpha was
   elevated to 1.26 and 1.49 fold, respectively, in brown adipose tissue
   during torpor as compared with control animals, whereas HSP60 in liver
   of torpid animals was 1.15 fold of that in control (P < 0.05). Among
   antioxidant enzymes, protein levels of thioredoxin 1 were elevated to
   2.19 fold in white adipose tissue during torpor, whereas Cu-Zn
   superoxide dismutase 1 levels rose to 1.1 fold in skeletal muscle (P <
   0.05). Additionally, total antioxidant capacity was increased to 1.6
   fold in liver during torpor (P < 0.05), while remaining unchanged in the
   five other tissues. Overall, our data suggest that antioxidant and HSP
   responses are modified in a tissue-specific manner during daily torpor
   in gray mouse lemurs. Furthermore, our data also show that
   cytoprotective strategies employed during primate torpor are distinct
   from the strategies in rodent hibernation as reported in previous
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Core-shell structure of Sn nanowires encapsulated in amorphous carbon
   nanotubes (Sn@CNTs) with controlled thickness of CNT shells was in situ
   prepared via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The thickness of
   CNT shells was accurately controlled from 4 to 99 nm by using different
   growth time, flow rate of hydrocarbon gas (C2H4) and synthesis
   temperature. The microstructure and composition of the coaxial Sn@CNTs
   were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM) techniques. Moreover, the Sn@CNTs were studied as anode
   materials for Li-ion batteries and showed excellent cycle performance.
   The capacity was affected by the thickness of outer CNT shells: thick
   CNT shells contributed to a better retention while thin CNT shells led
   to a higher capacity. The thin CNT shell of 6 nm presented the highest
   capacity around 630 mAh g(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Self-sustaining treatment for active remediation (STAR) is an innovative
   soil remediation approach based on smoldering combustion that has been
   demonstrated to effectively destroy complex hydrocarbon nonaqueous phase
   liquids (NAPLs) with minimal energy input. This is the first study to
   explore the smoldering remediation of sand contaminated by a volatile
   NAPL (trichloroethylene, TCE) and the first to consider utilizing
   vegetable oil as supplemental fuel for STAR. Thirty laboratory-scale
   experiments were conducted to evaluate the relationship between key
   outcomes (TCE destruction, rate of remediation) to initial conditions
   (vegetable oil type, oil: TCE mass ratio, neat versus emulsified oils).
   Several vegetable oils and emulsified vegetable oil formulations were
   shown to support remediation of TCE via self-sustaining smoldering. A
   minimum concentration of 14,000 mg/kg canola oil was found to treat sand
   exhibiting up to 80,000 mg/kg TCE. On average, 75\% of the ICE mass was
   removed due to volatilization. This proof-of-concept study suggests that
   injection and smoldering of vegetable oil may provide a new alternative
   for driving volatile contaminants to traditional vapour extraction
   systems without supplying substantial external energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The adsorption behaviour of unmodified yeast cells of Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae to remove Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions in
   continuous mode was studied. Yeast biomass showed mediocre capacity for
   Cu(II) ions compared to that of Pb(II) ions in the metals concentrations
   range of 10-180 mg/l. Metal-binding capacity of yeast cells reached to a
   maximum of 29.9 mg/g and 72.5 mg/g for Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions,
   respectively, under similar experimental conditions. The rate of
   biosorbent production in the continuous bioreactor, governed by dilution
   rate equal to maximum specific growth rate of the cells, was the
   limiting factor of the biosorption system. At low metal concentration,
   Cu(II) removal by yeast cells was higher than previously studied
   heat-deactivated yeast biomass suggesting involvement of both
   intracellular and surface-based sequestrations. The removal efficiencies
   of the test metals decreased as the initial metal concentrations
   increased. Equilibrium adsorption of the metals by yeast cells was well
   described by the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics data
   fitted to diffusion-based and chemical reaction-based models showed
   intracellular diffusion as the rate controlling step at low metal loads.
   The results obtained suggest that the use of liye yeast cells in a
   self-contained continuous adsorption system is an effective method for
   removal of heavy metals from industrial effluents reducing biomass
   pretreatment and preparation steps as well as achieving on-line
   adsorbent production, biosorption, and effluent treatment. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Co2.85Si0.15O4 solid solution was successfully synthesized using a
   facile hydrothermal method for the first time. The structural and
   morphological features of prepared powders were thoroughly investigated
   by different techniques. The Rietveld refinement assured the formation
   of spinel structured Co2.85Si0.15O4 without any impurity phases. The
   FT-IR and Raman spectrums revealed the presence of SiO2, and carbon with
   the Co2.85Si0.15O4 solid solution. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   inferred that the Co exists in +2 and +3 oxidation state and Si exists
   in multivalence state. Surface morphological analysis demonstrated that
   the formation of cube shape Co2.85Si0.15O4 microparticles are embedded
   in to amorphous SiO2 matrix, which was confirmed using SAED pattern. The
   inactive nature of amorphous SiO2 in Co2.85Si0.15O4 was confirmed by CV
   studies. Consequently, it was electrochemically active while making
   composite with carbon, since it reduces SiO2 into SiOx. The cycling
   stability of Co2.85Si0.15O4@C composite provided superior
   electrochemical performance than the pristine Co2.85Si0.15O4. The
   composite delivers the specific capacity of 444 mAhg(-1) at 75 mAg(-1)
   after 50 cycles with feeble capacity fading. The EIS spectra
   corroborates the composite exhibit the lower charge transfer resistance
   (R-ct) and solid electrolyte interphase resistance (R-SEI) compared to
   pristine Co2.85Si0.15O4. This further confirmed that carbon composite
   enhanced the inherent conductive nature and rate capability of pristine
   Co2.85Si0.15O4 electrode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The inherent properties of channel impulse response (CIR), which are
   considered as location-specific characteristics of the physical link,
   have been exploited for the authentication purpose at the physical layer
   in the wireless communications. Unfortunately, the reliability of
   CIR-based physical layer authentication is challenged by the noise
   present in the CIR estimates, the rapid channel variation induced by the
   mobility of terminals, and the weak authentication decision by
   exploiting single CIR difference under the hypothesis testing. In this
   paper, three CIR-based authentication schemes are proposed to enhance
   the authentication reliability. Specifically, the noise components of
   the CIR estimates are mitigated in order to derive an adaptive threshold
   to form the authentication decision. Additionally, because of the rapid
   variation of the fading channel, channel prediction technique is
   employed to predict future CIR, and which is exploited to derive the CIR
   difference for the authentication analysis. Furthermore, to form the
   final decision in the authentication process, multiple CIR differences
   are observed by the receiver in a long range based on the channel
   predictor. In order to optimize the number of CIR differences, an
   optimization algorithm is developed by minimizing the total error rate
   under a false alarm constraint. Finally, the false alarm rate and the
   probability of detection are theoretically derived for performance
   evaluation, and the performance of proposed schemes is compared with
   that of a traditional channel-based authentication method using computer
   simulation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Decomposition of Motion in Essential and Parkinsonian Tremor}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Background: Treatment options for essential (ET) and Parkinson disease
   (PD) tremor are suboptimal, with significant side effects. Botulinum
   toxin type A (BoNT A) is successfully used in management of various
   focal movement disorders but is not widely used for tremor. Method: This
   study examines complexity of wrist tremor in terms of involvement of its
   three anatomical degrees of freedom (DOF) in two common situations of
   rest and posture. The study examines tremor in 11 ET and 17 PD
   participants by kinematic decomposition of motion in 3-DOF. Results:
   Tremor decomposition showed the motion involved more than one DOF (<70\%
   contribution in one DOF) in most ET (rest: 100\%, posture: 64\%) and PD
   (rest: 77\%, posture: 77\%) patients. Task variation resulted in change
   in both amplitude and composition in ET, but not in PD. Amplitude
   significantly increased from rest to posture in ET. Directional bias was
   observed at the wrist for ET (pronation), and PD (extension, ulnar
   deviation, pronation). Average agreement between clinical visual and
   kinematic selection of muscles was 55\% across all subjects. Conclusion:

Abstract = {{Self-stacked nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and pristine carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) on commercial porous polypropylene substrates have been
   applied as air electrodes for sodium-air batteries (SAB). Both NCNT and
   CNT air electrodes exhibit highly reversible electrochemical activities
   and large capacities under low current densities in SABs, while NCNT
   electrodes show much higher rate performance and extended cycling life
   under high current densities. The superior electrochemical behavior of
   NCNT electrodes is attributed to the robust network of aligned NCNTs,
   which enables rapid oxygen and liquid electrolyte transport while
   accommodating the volume change originating from discharge product
   aggregation during cycling. Moreover, uniform coverage of the discharge
   product has been observed on the NCNT air electrodes, in contrast to the
   random and discrete dispersion of discharge product on the CNT air
   electrodes. The unique morphologies and growth mechanism of discharge
   products on NCNT electrodes are believed to be due to the outstanding
   catalytic activity of the nitrogen-doped sites in the NCNTs, which play
   a critical role in the high cycling stability of NCNT air electrodes for
   SABs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   present in current knowledge is summarized. The most significant areas
   to expand are landfill waste treatments, which in recent years has begun
   to grow but there is an opportunity for much more. Another area to
   explore is the treatment of landfill gas, a very large field to which

Abstract = {{This paper aims to evaluate and improve the usefulness of publicly
   available electricity market prices for real-time optimal dispatching
   (RTOD) of a privately owned energy storage system (ESS) in a competitive
   electricity market. The RTOD algorithm seeks to maximize the revenue by
   exploiting arbitrage opportunities available due to the inter-temporal
   variation of electricity prices in the day-ahead market. The
   pre-dispatch prices, issued by the Ontario independent electricity
   system operator, and the corresponding ex-post hourly Ontario energy
   prices are employed as the forecast and the actual prices. A
   compressed-air ESS is sized and employed for evaluations due to its
   lower capital expenditure and its ability to be positively influenced by
   the availability of waste heat. First, the conventional RTOD algorithm
   is developed by formulating a mixed integer linear programming problem.
   It is demonstrated that the forecast inaccuracy of publicly available
   market prices significantly reduces the ESS revenue. Then, a new
   adaptive algorithm is proposed and evaluated which adapts the objective
   function of the optimization problem online based on historical market
   prices available before real-time. The outcomes reveal that the proposed
   adaptive RTOD can significantly increase the ESS revenue compared to the
   conventional algorithm as well as the back-casting method proposed in
   prior studies.}},

Title = {{Effect of hoof orientation and ballast on acceleration and vibration in

Journal = {{EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{223-229}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Reasons for performing study: We wished to add to the existing baseline
   data on impact loading of the distal limb as a precursor to assessing
   the potential role of impact in injury and joint disease.
   Objectives: To examine the effect of 3 hoof-strike conditions (toe
   first, flat and heel first) and 2 specimen masses (with and without a
   ballast of similar to 2\% body mass) on impact deceleration and
   vibration frequencies and energies at the hoof, first phalanx and third
   metacarpal.
   Study design: Biomechanical experiments in cadaver material.
   Methods: Eight cadaver limbs were subjected to randomised, repeated
   controlled trials, in which the hoof was struck by a pendulum
   impact-testing machine (impact velocity, 3.55 m/s) in the 3 strike and 2
   mass conditions. Data from triaxial accelerometers on the hoof, first
   phalanx and third metacarpal quantified, for all trials, the peak impact
   acceleration, frequencies in the first 6.4 ms following impact, the
   frequency with the most energy, 95\% of the total energy and the
   frequency at 95\% cumulative energy. The effects of the strike and mass
   conditions on each variable were statistically tested using
   repeated-measures ANOVA (alpha = 0.05).
   Results: Signal energy reaching the third metacarpal was 6-31\% of that
   at the hoof. A heel-first strike produced the largest peak accelerations
   and highest frequencies among all strike conditions, and changing the
   mass had no effect regardless of strike condition.
   Conclusions: Large accelerations that occur upon impact of the hoof with
   the ground are attenuated by the distal structures of the equine limb,
   but still carry considerable energy within the signal that could be
   damaging to tissue and are dependent on hoof-strike condition but not
   ballast. Our results suggest that impact loading on the hoof could be a
   factor in contributing to bone injury and joint disease in the distal
   limb.}},

Abstract = {{Pattern classifications have become important tools for fault diagnosis
   in nuclear power plants (NPP). However, it is often difficult to obtain
   training data under fault conditions to train a supervised
   classification model. By contrast, normal plant operating data can be
   easily made available through increased deployment of supervisory,
   control, and data acquisition systems. Such data can also be used to
   train classification models to improve the performance of fault
   diagnosis scheme.
   In this paper, a fault diagnosis scheme based on semisupervised
   classification (SSC) scheme is developed. In this scheme, new
   measurements collected from the plant are integrated with data observed
   under fault conditions to train the SSC models. The trained models are
   subsequently applied to new measurements for fault diagnosis. In
   comparison with supervised classifiers, the proposed scheme requires
   significantly fewer data collected under fault conditions to train the
   classifier.
   The developed scheme has been validated using different fault scenarios
   on a desktop NPP simulator as well as on a physical NPP simulator using
   a graph-based SSC algorithm. All the considered faults have been
   successfully diagnosed.
   The results have demonstrated that SSC is a promising tool for fault
   diagnosis in NPPs. Copyright (C) 2015, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC

   recovery from tobacco leaves}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{80-87}},

Abstract = {{Biomass conversion to obtain bioenergy and fuels will only be cost
   effective when additional, value-added products including chemicals can
   be obtained as part of the process. The objective of this study was to
   increase nicotine recovery from tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum)
   through pyrolysis using new technology, a mechanically fluidized reactor
   (MFR). The MFR is a cylindrical batch reactor, 15 cm in diameter and
   25.4 cm in height. A condenser was connected to the reactor, and the gas
   was then passed through a cotton demister and exhausted. The gases from
   the reactor were condensed using condensers in an ice bath and changed
   manually according to the temperature of the fluidized reactor bed. Two
   variables, tobacco leaf particle size (1, 0.355 and 0.212 mm) and
   reactor heating rate (5, 10 and 15 degrees C/min from ambient to 565
   degrees C), were studied in terms of the effect on bio-oil yield,
   nicotine concentration and nicotine recovery. The bio-oil was collected
   in nine different temperature cuts (ambient-200, 200-250, 250-275,
   275-300, 300-350, 350-400, 400-450, 450-500 and 500-565 degrees C) with
   reactor temperatures held for 30 min at 200, 250, 275 and 500 degrees C.
   The bio-oil and biomass extracts were analyzed for nicotine by gas
   chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Nicotine recovery was
   higher than conventional solvent extraction of biomass when tobacco
   leaves were pyrolyzed by MFR. Biomass particle sizes did not affect
   either total bio-oil yield or nicotine recovery, which ranged from 48 to
   49\% and 104 to 109\%, respectively. The second temperature cut produced
   from I mm biomass has the highest concentration of nicotine (6\%) when
   the nicotine recovery is 45\%. In contrast, the first temperature cut
   produced from 1 mm biomass and dried at 50 degrees C has the highest
   concentration of nicotine (84\%) when the nicotine recovery is 23\%.
   Because of the relatively high boiling point of nicotine (247 degrees
   C), the cuts obtained from batch pyrolysis can be greatly purified by
   evaporating water and other volatiles. This method of nicotine recovery
   and purification through pyrolysis can be applied to recover other
   value-added compounds from other biomasses. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

   residue biomass}},

Abstract = {{Fast pyrolysis is a recognized technology for the thermochemical
   conversion of biomasses into bio-oils that may contain valuable
   chemicals, including solvents, pharmaceuticals and biopesticides. The
   composition of the bio-oils is partly determined by the biomass
   feedstock. Bio-oil produced from the residues of greenhouse tomato
   plants has been investigated as a potential source of bioactive and
   pesticidal compounds. Fast pyrolysis of dried tomato residue biomass was
   performed in a bubbling bed reactor at 300 and 500 degrees C. The
   condensable vapors were collected using a condenser followed by an
   electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Bio-oil collected from the ESP
   exhibited a much greater insecticidal activity based on tests carried
   out using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) Leptinotarsa decemlineata
   leaf disc bioassay. After an extraction with 1:1 water/dichloromethane,
   most of the activity remained in the organic phase. To further
   fractionate the components, amino solid phase extractions (SPE) followed
   by reversed phase LC separation were performed. Six LC fractions were
   collected and analyzed by GC-MS. Neophytadiene, phytol and a number of
   fatty acids were identified in the most active fraction, but only with
   combinations of these compounds was the greatest insecticidal activity
   obtained. Pyrolysis of tomato plant biomass affords a cost-effective
   source of bioactive compounds that can be further developed for
   biopesticide application. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the image-based control problem of vertical
   take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
   Specifically, we propose a control scheme allowing the aircraft to track
   a moving target captured by an onboard camera where the orientation and
   angular velocity of the vehicle are assumed available for feedback. The
   proposed approach relies on appropriate image features, defined based on
   perspective image moments along with a useful projection, and the design
   of a bounded adaptive translational controller without linear velocity
   measurements in the presence of external disturbances. Estimates of the
   target's acceleration and the disturbances as well as some auxiliary
   variables are used to simplify the control design and guarantee the
   stability of the overall closed loop system. Simulation examples are
   provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{224-232}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Extrusion of lignocellulosic biomasses can be an effective physical
   continuous pretreatment method towards bioethanol production. Extrusion
   processes would typically precede enzymatic cellulose saccharification
   in a given pretreatment. The screw configuration determines the
   functionality of the extruder and different screw elements (conveying,
   kneading and reverse) can have different effects on enzymatic
   digestibility. This study investigates the effects of individual
   functional screw elements on enzymatic digestibility after extrusion. It
   was found that extrusion enhanced enzymatic digestibility under all
   tested condition. Reverse and kneading screw elements however resulted
   in lignin redistribution over the cellulose fibres, blocked pores (shown
   via SEM) and resulted in less digestible biomass, compared to conveying
   screw elements. Lignin removal via NaOH reversed this effect and the
   highest digestibility was found for biomass extruded in the presence of
   reverse screw elements (the most severe conditions tested in this
   study), indicating that lignin redistribution can counteract otherwise
   positive effects of extrusion pretreatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In a wireless network, while the signal attenuation due to the
   distance-related path loss is minimum between a node and its nearest
   neighbor, this is not the case for the overall attenuation when the
   fading effect is also taken into account. Hence, the communication best
   neighbor (CBN) of a node is defined as the neighbor of that node with
   which it has the highest channel power gain. Recently, the statistics of
   the physical neighborhood index of the CBN have been derived for a
   general fading environment in which the nodes have two-dimensional
   Poisson distribution. In this paper, the statistics of the distance
   between a node and its CBN as well as the joint CBN distance-index
   statistics are obtained for the same scenario. Then, the analytical
   expressions are specialized for the case where the communication
   channels follow the generalized gamma fading model. Also, the results
   are verified and illustrated by computer simulations and numerical
   results. Further, it is shown how the obtained analytical results can be
   used to identify the CBN more efficiently by limiting the search region
   and the number of neighbors that are examined.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel formulation for robust surgical planning of
   robotics-assisted minimally invasive cardiac surgery based on
   patient-specific preoperative images is proposed. In this context,
   robustness is quantified in terms of the likelihood of intraoperative
   collisions and of joint limit violations. The proposed approach provides
   a more accurate and complete formulation than existing deterministic
   approaches in addressing uncertainty at the task level. Moreover, it is
   demonstrated that the dexterity of robotic arms can be quantified as a
   cross-entropy term. The resulting planning problem is rendered as a
   chance-constrained entropy maximization problem seeking a plan with the
   least susceptibility toward uncertainty at the task level, while
   maximizing the dexterity ( cross-entropy term). By such treatment of
   uncertainty at the task level, spatial uncertainty pertaining to
   mismatches between the patient-specific anatomical model and that of the
   actual intraoperative situation is also indirectly addressed. As a
   solution method, the unscented transform is adopted to efficiently
   transform the resulting chance-constrained entropy maximization problem
   into a constrained nonlinear program without resorting to
   computationally expensive particle-based methods.}},

Abstract = {{Software maintainers use the traces of field failures to understand and
   diagnose faulty functions that cause the system to fail. Despite their
   usefulness, traces from the field can be quite over-whelming, especially
   for software systems with a vast client base. In the execution of
   realistic applications, many of them being millions of lines of code,
   there are just too many traces that are generated. In addition, traces
   are known to be extraordinarily large, which further complicates
   matters. Fortunately, not all field failures are caused by new faults.
   In fact, previous studies showed that 50\% to 90\% of field failures are
   due to previously known faults. In this paper, we propose a machine
   learning approach that automatically detects recurring faulty functions
   in the traces of new field failures. We achieve our goal by training
   decision trees on earlier resolved traces of system failures from the
   current and prior releases of the system. When applied to a large
   industrial system with 20 million lines of code and 200,000 functions,
   our approach was able to detect recurring faulty functions in the traces
   of field failures with an accuracy of 90\%, to even 97\% in some cases.}},

   requirements. Inspired by the operational practices and requisites of
   the real-world microgrid applications, different methods of frequency

   adequate models for the different types of frequency-regulation
   mechanisms in the framework of the microgrid generation scheduling

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the pressure distributions on the external
   and internal surfaces of the outer layer of an air-permeable,
   double-layer roof system placed on a low-rise building in a region of
   separated flow. In particular, the effects of the gaps between panels
   (G), cavity depth between layers (H), and the panel size (L) on the
   pressures and panel loads are examined. Wind tunnel-based experimental
   data from the model of a low-rise building in an open country terrain
   were used. In total, 39 configurations were examined for the range 1/30
   <= G/H <= 30 and 0.53 <= t/G <= 16, where t is the panel thickness. It
   was found that the cavity pressure distributions are significantly
   affected by the geometric parameters. Values of the non-dimensional
   parameter, phi= {[}G/H](2) {[}(f(H) L-c/H)/(2(C-L + f(t) t/G))] >
   similar to 1 are associated with the cavity flow resistance controlling
   the pressure drops, leading to reduced-magnitude peak panel loads. The
   implications of the results for model-scale wind tunnel testing are
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heteronanostructured zinc oxide nanorod (ZnO NR) array are vertically
   grown on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) through a hydrothermal method
   followed by an in situ deposition of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)
   through a photoreduction process. The Ag-ZnO heterostructured nanorods
   on PDMS are measured with an average diameter of 160 nm and an average
   length of 2 mu m. ZnO NRs measured by high-resolution transmission
   electron microscope (HRTEM) shows highly crystalline with a lattice
   fringe of 0.255 nm, which corresponds to the (0002) planes in ZnO
   crystal lattice. The average diameter of the Ag NPs in situ deposited on
   the ZnO NRs is estimated at 22 +/- 2 nm. As compared to the bare ZnO
   NRs, the heterostructured Ag-ZnO nanorod array shows enhanced
   ultraviolet (UV) absorption at 440 nm, and significant emission in the
   visible region (lambda(em) = 542 nm). In addition, the antimicrobial
   efficiency of Ag-ZnO heterostructured nanorod array shows obvious

Abstract = {{In this study, silver nano-particles have been anchored in the surface
   of BiOBr photocatalysts by a citric acid-assisted photoreduction method.
   The citric acid was served as a chelating and reductive agent for the
   preparation of Ag-decorated BiOBr photocatalysts (named as Ag/BiOBr-2).
   The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-Vis
   diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS). The Ag/BiOBr-2 photocatalyst
   exhibited excellent and stable photocatalytic activities on MO and
   phenol degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation. The enhanced
   photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the smaller size, rough
   surface, and the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Ag. Also, the
   Schottky junction, between the surface of the BiOBr and silver
   nanoparticles, accelerated the efficient transfer and separation of
   photoinduced electron-hole pairs and promoted the photocatalytic
   performance. The active species tests indicated that the superoxide
   radical (center dot O-2 (-)) was responsible for the enhanced
   photocatalytic performance of Ag/BiOBr-2. Finally, a possible
   photocatalytic mechanism was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The geometric state of a workpiece is changing dynamically during the
   machining process. Such geometric changes lead to changes of the
   rigidity of workpiece features. Knowing the feature rigidity during the
   machining process is very crucial for the selection of right cutting
   parameters especially for aircraft structural parts with complex
   structures. This issue has rarely been addressed in the literature for
   cutting parameter optimization. In order to address this issue, an
   interim feature concept is introduced and the interim feature is modeled
   by using geometric information of final state and machining process
   information for aircraft structural parts. The interim feature rigidity
   is evaluated by simplifying the structures of interim feature. By
   considering the constraints of the interim feature rigidity, machine
   tool characteristics, and cutting tool performance, the cutting
   parameters are optimized using a genetic algorithm. A prototype system
   is developed based on the proposed approach, and a case study is
   performed. The experiment results show that the machining efficiency can
   be improved by 26 \% after cutting parameter optimization, while the
   same machining quality is maintained.}},

   and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Various implants have been
   designed to stabilize the osteotomy and previous studies have been
   focused on determining primary stability (a global measure) that these
   designs provide. It has been shown that the local mechanical
   environment, characterized by bone strains and segment micromotion, is
   important in understanding healing and these data are not currently
   available. Finite element (FE) modeling was utilized to assess the local
   mechanical environment provided by three different fixation plate
   designs: short plate with spacer, long plate with spacer and long plate
   without spacer. Image-based FE models of the knee were constructed from
   healthy individuals (N = 5) with normal knee alignment. An HTO gap was
   virtually added without changing the knee alignment and HTO implants
   were inserted. Subsequently, the local mechanical environment, defined
   by bone compressive strain and wedge micromotion, was assessed.
   Furthermore, implant stresses were calculated. Values were computed
   under vertical compression in zero-degree knee extension with loads set
   at 1 and 2 times the subject-specific body weight (1 BW, 2 BW). All
   studied HTO implant designs provide an environment for successful
   healing at 1 BW and 2 BW loading. Implant von Mises stresses (99th
   percentile) were below 60 MPa in all experiments, below the material
   yield strength and significantly lower in long spacer plates. Volume
   fraction of high compressive strain (> 3000 microstrain) was below 5\%
   in all experiments and no significant difference between implants was
   detected. Maximum vertical micromotion between bone segments was below
   200 mu m in all experiments and significantly larger in the implant
   without a tooth. Differences between plate designs generally became
   apparent only at 2 BW loading. Results suggest that with compressive
   loading of 2 BW, long spacer plates experience the lowest implant
   stresses, and spacer plates (long or short) result in smaller wedge
   micromotion, potentially beneficial for healing. Values are sensitive to
   subject bone geometry, highlighting the need for subject-specific
   modeling. This study demonstrates the benefits of using image-based FE
   modeling and bone theory to fine-tune HTO implant design.}},

Abstract = {{A high-throughput screening experiment to establish the individual and
   mixture effects of various common inhibitors found in lignocellulosic
   hydrolysates on the growth kinetics and ethanol production of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae was carried out. Fermentations were performed
   utilizing 96-well microtiter plates to allow for carrying out
   fermentations in parallel, around which a central composite design of
   experiments was used to select inhibitor concentrations in each well.
   The individual and interaction effects of six common inhibitors were
   quantified using response surface fits of the growth rate, as determined
   by optical absorbance measurements and final cell density. For growth
   rate, 4-hydroxy-methylbenzaldehyde (phenol aldehyde) was found to be the
   strongest inhibitor of growth rate over the concentration range studied,
   while m-cresol (phenolic) had the least effect on growth rate and the
   largest inhibitory effect on final cell density. Both positive and
   negative interactions between inhibitors were found to affect both
   growth rate and maximum cell density. For example, both furfural and
   guaiacol when combined with m-cresol were found to have a positive
   effect on cell growth (less inhibitory), while guaiacol and m-cresol had
   a negative interaction with 4-hydroxy-methylbenzaldehyde. At all
   conditions studied, S. cerevisiae produced identical or higher ethanol
   yields compared to the inhibitor-free control fermentation which was
   attributed to the effects of physiological stress cause by the some
   inhibitors. These results quantify both the interactions of various
   inhibitors as well as their individual effects in a rapid and
   easy-to-perform experiment which can be easily expanded to include
   further inhibitors. Such a design can also be used for rapid and
   efficient screening of different pretreatments and feedstocks in the
   emerging field of lignocellulosic biofuels.}},

Abstract = {{Flat plates are widely used in reinforced concrete buildings. Their
   design is usually based on the shear forces and bending moments produced
   by the gravity loads. During seismic activities, the lateral building
   deformations induce additional shear forces and bending moments that
   they must withstand. To evaluate the seismic moment capacity of a flat
   plate system, an effective slab width needs to be defined. In this
   paper, grillage analysis is utilized to predict the nonlinear lateral
   behaviour of flat plate buildings. A comprehensive parametric study is
   used to evaluate the effective slab width contributing to the lateral
   strength of residential interior flat plate connections. The studied
   parameters include span length, bay width, column dimensions, and level
   of column axial load. Both gravity load designed frames and moment
   resisting frames are analysed. The effect of the material safety factors
   is assessed by conducting two sets of analyses using nominal material
   properties and factored material properties. Equations to estimate the
   effective slab width are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a single-objective optimal sizing approach for an
   islanded microgrid (IMG). The approach determines the optimal component
   sizes for the IMG, such that the life-cycle cost is minimised while a
   low loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is ensured. As wind speed
   and solar irradiation exhibit both diurnal and seasonal variations, the
   proposed algorithm takes advantages of the typical meteorological
   year-based chronological simulation and enumeration-based iterative
   techniques. The mathematical models presented in this study for the IMG
   components consider the non-linear characteristics as well as the
   reactive power. The LPSP is also formulated based on the supply-demand
   balances of both real and reactive powers, and an economic evaluation
   model is presented. The proposed sizing approach identifies the global
   minimum, and simultaneously provides the optimal component sizes as well
   as the power management strategies. This study also presents a number of

   for Policy and Market Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that the generation resource uncertainty induced by
   significant wind capacity raises concerns about grid security, price
   stability, and revenue adequacy. One of the most promising solutions is
   the use of utility-scale energy storage, although the question of
   general implementation of this strategy remains unanswered. This paper
   uses a simplified model to show that simple rules exist that govern the
   decision to generate or store energy from a hybrid wind-storage system.
   The heuristics developed consider the combination of storage efficiency,
   electricity price, and shortfall penalty and wind forecast
   characteristics to guide the decision of whether to bid energy into the
   electricity market or not. Specifically, this paper develops the optimal
   strategy for use of a simplified system of an energy storage unit with a
   wind generator. The solution is analyzed using a dynamic programming
   formulation in a simplified framework over a multiperiod planning
   horizon. The analysis of the solution under all regimes yields
   insightful structural solutions regarding the conditions under which the
   wind generator should bid into the energy market and when it should not.
   The results also provide insight into the specific implications of
   forecast accuracy and market design on the need for storage. This
   analysis allows additional conclusions to be drawn about the value of
   various storage technologies based on their capacity and efficiency
   characteristics. However, the most important contribution of this work
   is the understanding of the importance of market penalties in
   encouraging participants to either improve forecasting ability or,
   perhaps more realistically, contract storage to mitigate shortfall risk.
   Improving both forecasting accuracy and storage capabilities results in
   value reduction for both.}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The possibility of using a small-scale model to predict the performance
   of a full-size open-channel ultraviolet (UV) wastewater disinfection
   reactor was numerically investigated using a computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model. The CFD model consists of the volume of fluid
   (VOF) method for capturing the water-air interface, realizable k-E model
   for turbulence, discrete ordinate (DO) model for resolving the UV
   intensity field in the reactor, and Lagrangian particle tracking for
   calculating the microbial particle trajectory. To ensure the similarity
   of the hydrodynamics between the full-size and two scaled-down
   open-channel reactors, the Froude and Reynolds numbers were considered.
   Scaling methodology for the UV radiation field was formulated to ensure
   that the same disinfection performance can be achieved between the
   full-size and the scaled-down reactors. The disinfection characteristics
   of the full-size and scaled-down reactors predicted by the CFD model
   were comparable suggesting that the open-channel reactor is scalable and
   the behavior of a large-scale reactor can be predicted from the results
   of a small-scale reactor.}},

Abstract = {{Conflicting views regarding synthetic pesticides include the successful
   use as pest management tools for agriculture and forestry on one hand
   and the threats to components in the environment. Likewise, the residues
   from agriculture and forestry create a waste disposal problem, but are a
   potential bio-resource to be profited from. This abundant biomass can be
   converted into bio-fuel and valuable products (e.g., biopesticides)
   through thermochemical process and provide a potential solution to two
   problems. The objective of this study was to pyrolyze lignin, cellulose,
   and hemicellulose plant biomass individually for the separation and
   identification of pesticide compounds. The biomasses were individually
   pyrolyzed at 450 and 550 A degrees C in a fluidized bed reactor and the
   bio-oil was collected from the condenser and electrostatic precipitator
   (ESP). Lignin ESP bio-oil was the most toxic at both temperatures based
   on bioassays using (1) insects (Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Trichoplusia
   ni, and Acyrthosiphon pisum); (2) fungi (Pythium ultimum, Rhizoctonia
   solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum); and (3) bacteria (Clavibacter
   michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Streptomyces scabies, and
   Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria). The lignin ESP organic phase
   retained the insecticidal activity and fractionation by semi-preparative
   high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) isolated further the
   activity. Analyses of these fractions by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) identified several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) potentially contributing to the pesticidal activity, including
   anthracene, pyrene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, benzoanthracene,
   1-phenylnaphthalene, 1-methylphenanthrene, 2-phenylnaphthalene, and
   4,5-methylenephenanthrene. In light of the present study, it may be
   concluded that lignin is a very promising source of biopesticides when
   the reactor operating conditions are optimized.}},

Title = {{Use of historical best track data to estimate typhoon wind hazard at

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The coastal region in mainland China experiences typhoon wind hazard and
   risk. Since historical surface observations are scarce and of short
   period, the hazard assessment is often carried out using the typhoon
   wind field and track models. For a few major cities in the coastal
   region, there are differences among the return period values of the
   annual maximum typhoon wind speed estimated by different studies and by
   the Chinese design code. The publically availability of the best track
   dataset released from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) provides
   an opportunity to potentially assess and validate some of the results.
   The present study provides probabilistic characterizations of typhoon
   tracks for a circular subregion around each of the nine considered
   cities located in the coastal region of mainland China by using the best
   track data from CMA. It applies the developed probability models for the
   tracks to estimate the typhoon wind hazard for the nine cities using a
   subregion approach. The results show that the estimated wind hazard is
   relatively insensitive to the size of the subregion, but it is strongly
   influenced by the adopted probability distribution model for the central
   pressure difference as the return period increases. The results also
   show that the code recommended return period values for some sites are
   lower than those obtained in this study by up to 8 \% for the return
   period of 50 and 100 years.}},

Title = {{Anther development of maize (Zea mays) and longstamen rice (Oryza

   and pollen arrangement}},
Journal = {{PLANT REPRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{Another development has been extensively examined by various imaging
   tools, including transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and light microscopy, but none is capable of identifying
   liquid water. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy with high-pressure rapid
   freeze fixation is excellent in preserving structures at cellular level
   and differentiating gas- versus liquid-filled space, but rarely used in
   anther study. We applied this technique to examine anther development of
   Poaceae because of its economic importance and unusual peripheral
   arrangement of pollen. Maize and longstamen rice were focused on. Here,
   we report for the first time that anthers of Poaceae lose the locular
   free liquid during late-microspore to early pollen stages; the majority
   of pollen grains arranged in a tight peripheral whorl develops normally
   and reaches maturity in the gas-filled loculus. Occasionally, pollen
   grains are found situated in the locular cavity, but they remain
   immature or become shrunk at anthesis. At pollen stage, microchannels
   and cytoplasmic strands are densely distributed in the entire pollen
   exine and intine, respectively, suggesting that nutrients are
   transported into the pollen from the entire surface. We propose that in
   Poaceae, the specialized peripheral arrangement of pollen grains is
   crucial for pollen maturation in the gas-filled loculus, which enables
   pollen achieving large surface contact area with the tapetum and
   neighboring grains to maintain sufficient nutrient flow. This report
   also shows that the single aperture of pollen in Poaceae usually faces
   the tapetum, but other orientation is also common; pollen grains with
   different aperture orientations show no morphological differences.}},

Title = {{Visualization of solids phase separation in a rectangular CFB riser
   using a novel image calibration method}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{273}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The gas-solid two phase flow under different operating conditions is
   visualized in a 19 mm x 114 mm narrow rectangular riser at the fully
   developed region through a high-speed digital image camera. Based on a
   calibration between image grayscale and solids holdup, the mean solids
   holdups under different operating conditions can be calculated from the
   mean grayscale of the images, the results of which is consistent with
   previous studies. By using different solids holdup as thresholds to
   transform the grayscale images into the binary images, the solids holdup
   distribution under different operating conditions can be clearly
   visualized. To quantify the solids phase separation, the term ``relative
   dense phase area{''} is introduced as a parameter to characterize the
   variation of dense phase. A critical solids holdup value of epsilon(sc)
   = 0.04 is chosen by carefully examining the variation profiles of the
   relative dense phase area with solids holdup thresholds, to demarcate
   the dilute and dense cluster phases. The cluster fraction is then
   obtained and ranges from 1\% to 59\% under the operating conditions of
   the present research. With images divided into three regions along the
   lateral direction, it is found that cluster fraction at the wall region
   is higher than that of the core and the middle regions. The cluster
   fraction is also found to increase with the mean solids holdup value.

Abstract = {{Anaerobic co-digestion (A co-D) performance of Phragmites australis,
   feces and kitchen waste with addition of clinoptilolite (one main kind
   of zeolite) was investigated to evaluate the improvement of
   biogas/methane production and internal mechanism of nitrogen and
   organics control. A better biogas/methane production was observed by
   10\% clinoptilolite (v/v) than bentonite and diatomite, with the
   shortest lag phase of 0.070 d(-1), the max rate of 15.89 L/(kg VS day)
   and ultimate biogas production of 308.2 L/kg VS as the modified Gompertz
   equation predicted. Accordingly, the content of methane in the biogas
   was increased from 44.10\% to 65.30\%. Furthermore, the clinoptilolite
   inhibited the acidification of digestion liquid (optimum pH 7.0-7.5) and
   enhanced the VFAs (acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid)
   destruction. Moreover, 10\% of clinoptilolite optimally enhanced the
   microbial utilization of Ca2+/Mg2+, controlled the C/N ratio, and
   improved the biogas production as well as NH3-N/NO3-N inhibition

Abstract = {{This article presents an overview of 12 existing objective speech
   quality and intelligibility prediction tools. Two classes of algorithms
   are presented-intrusive and nonintrusive-with the former requiring the

   metrics include both those developed for normal hearing (NH) listeners,
   as well as those tailored particularly for hearing impaired (HI)
   listeners who are users of assistive listening devices {[}i.e., hearing
   aids (HAs) and cochlear implants (CIs)]. Representative examples of
   those optimized for HI listeners include the speech-to-reverberation
   modulation energy ratio (SRMR), tailored to HAs (SRMR-HA) and to CIs
   (SRMR-CI); the modulation spectrum area (ModA); the HA speech quality
   (HASQI) and perception indices (HASPI); and the perception-model-based
   quality prediction method for hearing impairments (PEMO-Q-HI). The
   objective metrics are tested on three subjectively rated speech data
   sets covering reverberation-alone, noise-alone, and
   reverberation-plus-noise degradation conditions, as well as degradations
   resultant from nonlinear frequency compression and different speech

Abstract = {{Background: Accurate characterization of regional variations in bone
   density in symmetric and asymmetric (B2) glenoid erosion patterns can
   assist with surgical planning, reaming, and component implantation. The
   purpose of this study was to characterize regional bone density and
   porosity in symmetric and asymmetric (B2) osteoarthritic glenoids.
   Methods: Symmetric (n = 25) and asymmetric (B2) (n = 25) erosion
   patterns were compared by computed tomography-based imaging software. An
   orthogonal coordinate system separated each glenoid into quadrants. In
   addition, a linear best-fit line defined the line-of-erosion between the
   paleoglenoid and neoglenoid in the asymmetric cohort. All glenoids were
   further divided into volumes at depths of 0 to 2.5 mm and 2.5 to 5 mm.
   Average bone density was measured in Hounsfield units. Bone voids or
   cysts were included to quantify regional porosity as the fraction of
   void volume to total glenoid volume.
   Results: For the symmetric cohort, there were no significant differences
   in bone density between quadrants at either depth (P < .089). For the
   asymmetric cohort, bone density was significantly higher in the
   posterior quadrants compared with the anterior quadrants (P < .001),
   especially posteroinferiorly (P < .007) at both depths. In addition, the
   neoglenoid had significantly higher density and lower void fraction
   compared with the paleoglenoid (P < .001). There were also significant
   differences in void fraction between quadrants for both cohorts, at both
   depths (P <= .004).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that osteoarthritic glenoids with
   symmetric erosion have uniform subarticular bone density. However,
   asymmetric (B2) erosion patterns have potentially important regional
   variations in bone density and porosity, with the densest bone with the
   least porosity found posteroinferiorly or in the neoglenoid region. (C)

Abstract = {{Axial flow behaviors are investigated with an optical fiber probe using
   FCC particles at extremely high solids circulation rates up to 700
   kg/m(2)s and superficial gas velocity ranging from 3-7 m/s in a

   particle velocity and solids holdup are significantly affected by the
   operating conditions. Superficial gas velocity is the predominance for
   particle velocity distribution while solids circulation rate plays a key
   role in solids holdup distribution. Development of solids flow can be
   accelerated by increasing superficial gas velocity and/or decreasing
   solids circulation rate. High solids holdup, higher than 0.06, can be
   achieved in the entire downer with relatively uniform axial profiles at
   solids circulation rate of 700 kg/m(2)s indicating a preferential flow
   with reduced backmixing in the downer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we
   aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively compare pulmonary ventilation
   abnormalities derived from Fourier decomposition of free-breathing H-1
   magnetic resonance imaging (FDMRI) to hyperpolarized He-3 MRI in
   subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
   bronchiectasis.
   Materials and Methods: All subjects provided written informed consent to
   a protocol approved by a local research ethics board and Health, Canada,
   and they underwent MRI, computed tomography (CT), spirometry, and
   plethysmography during a single 2-hour visit. Semiautomated segmentation
   was used to generate ventilation defect measurements derived from FDMRI
   and He-3 MRI, and these were compared using analysis of variance and
   Pearson correlations.
   Results: Twenty-six subjects were evaluated including 12 COPD subjects
   (67 +/- 9 years) and 14 bronchiectasis subjects (70 +/- 11 years). For
   COPD subjects, FDMRI and He-3 MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP) was 7
   +/- 6\% and 24 +/- 14\%, respectively (P < .001; bias = -16 +/- 9\%). In
   COPD subjects, FDMRI was significantly correlated with He-3 MRI VDP (r =
   .88; P = .0001), He-3 MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (r = .71; P <
   .05), airways resistance (r = .60; P < .05), and RA(950) (r = .80; P <
   .01). In subjects with bronchiectasis, FDMRI VDP (5 +/- 3\%) and He-3
   MRI VDP (18 +/- 9\%) were significantly different (P < .001) and not
   correlated P>.05). The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for FDMRI and
   He-3 MRI ventilation was 86 +/- 7\% for COPD and 86 +/- 4\% for
   bronchiectasis subjects (P>.05); the DSC for FDMRI ventilation defects
   and CT RA(950) was 19 +/- 20\% in COPD and 2 +/- 3\% in bronchiectasis
   subjects (P < .01).
   Conclusions: FDMRI and He-3 MRI VDP were strongly related in COPD but
   not in bronchiectasis subjects. In COPD only, FDMRI ventilation defects
   were spatially related with He-3 ventilation defects and emphysema.}},

Abstract = {{System dynamics (SD) is an effective approach for helping reveal the
   temporal behavior of complex systems. Although there have been recent
   developments in expanding SD to include systems' spatial dependencies,
   most applications have been restricted to the simulation of diffusion
   processes; this is especially true for models on structural change (e.g.
   LULC modeling). To address this shortcoming, a Python program is
   proposed to tightly couple SD software to a Geographic Information
   System (GIS). The approach provides the required capacities for handling
   bidirectional and synchronized interactions of operations between SD and
   GIS. In order to illustrate the concept and the techniques proposed for
   simulating structural changes, a fictitious environment called
   Daisyworld has been recreated in a spatial system dynamics (SSD)
   environment. The comparison of spatial and non-spatial simulations
   emphasizes the importance of considering spatio-temporal feedbacks.
   Finally, practical applications of structural change models in
   agriculture and disaster management are proposed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Polysaccharides constituting about 10\% by weight of ginseng root are
   known to stimulate the immune system but have recently been shown to

   determine whether American ginseng root polysaccharides (AGRPS)

   suppress response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced proinflammatory
   response. An in vitro mechanistic study was used to identify the
   bioactive fraction(s) responsible for AGRPS immunomodulatory effects.
   The ex vivo and in vivo immunomodulatory effects after oral
   administration of AGRPS extract was studied in adult rats by measuring
   cultured alveolar macrophage production of NO and changes of plasma
   cytokine level, modification of LPS proinflammatory immune response by
   AGRPS extract was also examined. To identify the bioactive fraction(s)
   responsible for AGRPS extract immunomodulatory effects, the
   immunobioactivities of the extract fractions (isolated by ion exchange
   and size exclusion chromatography) was investigated in an in vitro
   mechanistic study.
   Culture of alveolar macrophages obtained from AGRPS extract treated rats
   resulted in an increase of ex vivo production of NO and also reduced
   alveolar macrophage responsiveness to ex vivo LPS challenge. Oral
   treatment with AGRPS extract elevated plasma TNF-alpha concentration in
   vivo. This treatment also suppressed LPS induced elevation of plasma
   TNF-alpha in vivo. AGRPS extract immunostimulatory and immunouppressive
   effects were mediated primarily by acid PS and its species with
   molecular weights a parts per thousand yen100 kDa and 50-100 kDa.

Abstract = {{This study examines how design features, such as building envelope
   openings and compartmentalization, affect the wind pressure in typical
   low-rise buildings with gable and hip roofs. Wind-induced internal and
   external pressures were investigated by using a full-scale wind testing
   facility generically known as Wall of Wind (WOW). The test-building
   model was built with an optimal size of 2.74 m (9 ft) long, 2.13m (7 ft)
   wide, and 2.13 m (7 ft) high. The model consisted of multiple dominant
   openings (doors with secondary openings and windows), roof ventilation
   devices (soffit vents, gooseneck roof vent, and roof turbine
   ventilators), and horizontal and vertical (ceiling and wall) internal
   assembly compartments. These features, together with a high Reynolds
   number (similar to 10(6)) flow test, enabled a realistic assessment of
   internal pressures due to (1) dominant openings' size and location and
   background leakage and (2) compartmentalization. For the study case, the
   hatch opening in the roof increased the coefficient of internal pressure
   from 0.05 to 0.69 for the dominant door-opened case and from 0.08 to
   0.98 for the dominant window-opened case in contrast to the closed-hatch
   case, which indicated the importance of compartmentalization. In
   addition, the peak internal pressure of the gable roof was higher than
   the hip roof by more than 190\%. The worst net pressure coefficient at
   the eaves of the gable roof was found to be significantly higher than
   the hip roof. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a reactive power sharing strategy that employs
   communication and the virtual impedance concept is proposed to enhance
   the accuracy of reactive power sharing in an islanded microgrid.
   Communication is utilized to facilitate the tuning of adaptive virtual
   impedances in order to compensate for the mismatch in voltage drops
   across feeders. Once the virtual impedances are tuned for a given load
   operating point, the strategy will result in accurate reactive power
   sharing even if communication is disrupted. If the load changes while
   communication is unavailable, the sharing accuracy is reduced, but the
   proposed strategy will still outperform the conventional droop control
   method. In addition, the reactive power sharing accuracy based on the
   proposed strategy is immune to the time delay in the communication
   channel. The sensitivity of the tuned controller parameters to changes
   in the system operating point is also explored. The control strategy is
   straightforward to implement and does not require knowledge of the
   feeder impedances. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
   strategy are validated using simulation and experimental results from a
   2-kVA microgrid.}},

Abstract = {{Air-stable primary phosphines were photopolymerized using phosphane-ene
   chemistry, the phosphorus analogue of the thiolene reaction, to
   fabricate a completely new class of polymer networks. It was
   demonstrated that the tunable thermal and physical properties accessible
   using thiol-ene chemistry could also be achieved using an analogous
   phosphane-ene reaction. At the same time, the presence of the P-31
   nucleus that is easily observed using NMR spectroscopy allowed the
   chemical structures of the networks to be directly probed using solid
   state NMR spectroscopy. Following its incorporation into the network,
   phosphorus offers the distinct difference and advantage of being able to
   undergo a diverse array of further derivatization to afford functional
   materials. For example, the networks were demonstrated to serve as
   effective oxygen scavengers and to bind transition metals (e.g., Pd). By
   using the air stable ferrocenyl phosphine (FcCH(2)CH(2))PH2,
   redox-active networks were produced and these materials could be
   pyrolyzed to yield magnetic ceramics. Overall, this demonstrates the
   promise of phosphane-ene chemistry as an alternative to thiol-ene
   systems for providing functional materials for a diverse range of
   applications.}},

Title = {{Face and content validity of a novel, web-based otoscopy simulator for
   medical education}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite the fact that otoscopy is a widely used and taught
   diagnostic tool during medical training, errors in diagnosis are common.
   Physical otoscopy simulators have high fidelity, but they can be
   expensive and only a limited number of students can use them at a given
   time.
   Objectives: 1) To develop a purely web-based otoscopy simulator that can
   easily be distributed to students over the internet. 2) To assess face
   and content validity of the simulator by surveying experts in otoscopy.
   Methods: An otoscopy simulator, OtoTrain (TM), was developed at Western
   University using web-based programming and Unity 3D. Eleven experts from
   academic institutions in North America were recruited to test the
   simulator and respond to an online questionnaire. A 7-point Likert scale
   was used to answer questions related to face validity (realism of the
   simulator), content validity (expert evaluation of subject matter and
   test items), and applicability to medical training.
   Results: The mean responses for the face validity, content validity, and
   applicability to medical training portions of the questionnaire were all
   <= 3, falling between the ``Agree{''}, ``Mostly Agree{''}, and
   ``Strongly Agree{''} categories. The responses suggest good face and
   content validity of the simulator. Open-ended questions revealed that
   the primary drawbacks of the simulator were the lack of a haptic arm for
   force feedback, a need for increased focus on pneumatic otoscopy, and
   few rare disorders shown on otoscopy.
   Conclusion: OtoTrain (TM) is a novel, web-based otoscopy simulator that
   can be easily distributed and used by students on a variety of
   platforms. Initial face and content validity was encouraging, and a
   skills transference study is planned following further modifications and
   improvements to the simulator.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to propose and validate a framework for tumour volume
   auto-segmentation based on ground-truth estimates derived from
   multi-physician input contours to expedite 4D-CT based lung tumour
   volume delineation. 4D-CT datasets of ten non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) patients were manually segmented by 6 physicians. Multi-expert
   ground truth (GT) estimates were constructed using the STAPLE algorithm
   for the gross tumour volume (GTV) on all respiratory phases. Next, using
   a deformable model-based method, multi-expert GT on each individual
   phase of the 4D-CT dataset was propagated to all other phases providing
   auto-segmented GTVs and motion encompassing internal gross target
   volumes (IGTVs) based on GT estimates (STAPLE) from each respiratory
   phase of the 4D-CT dataset. Accuracy assessment of auto-segmentation
   employed graph cuts for 3D-shape reconstruction and point-set
   registration-based analysis yielding volumetric and distance-based
   measures. STAPLE-based auto-segmented GTV accuracy ranged from (81.51
   +/- 1.92) to (97.27 +/- 0.28)\% volumetric overlap of the estimated
   ground truth. IGTV auto-segmentation showed significantly improved
   accuracies with reduced variance for all patients ranging from 90.87 to
   98.57\% volumetric overlap of the ground truth volume. Additional
   metrics supported these observations with statistical significance.
   Accuracy of auto-segmentation was shown to be largely independent of
   selection of the initial propagation phase. IGTV construction based on
   auto-segmented GTVs within the 4D-CT dataset provided accurate and
   reliable target volumes compared to manual segmentation-based GT
   estimates. While inter-/intra-observer effects were largely mitigated,
   the proposed segmentation workflow is more complex than that of current
   clinical practice and requires further development.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by many failure incidents observed worldwide of transmission
   line structures during tornadoes and by the lack of appropriate design
   procedures accounting for loads associated with such events, an
   extensive research program focusing on this subject initiated at The
   University of Western Ontario, Canada, few years ago. The current study
   is a part of this research program, where a numerical model that can
   predict the capacity and the failure mode of a transmission line system
   under tornadoes is developed and validated. In this numerical model, the
   tornado wind field is obtained from previously conducted and validated
   computation fluid dynamics simulations. Two different lattice
   transmission towers are considered for failure analysis under the
   developed numerical model. Due to the localized nature of tornadoes, the
   forces acting on a structure depends on the location of the tornado
   relative to the structure. As such, a parametric study is first
   conducted by moving the tornado in space in order to identify the
   critical tornado locations leading to peak forces in the tower members.
   Failure analysis of each system is conducted under the two most critical
   tornado locations identified from the parametric studies. The analysis
   is conducted incrementally by gradually increasing the tornado velocity
   till reaching the peak F2 tornado velocity. The critical velocity at
   which a full collapse of a tower is determined. The effects of inclusion
   of geometric nonlinearities and of the assumptions made regarding post
   yielding behavior of tension members on the failure capacity are also
   assessed in the study. While both transmission tower systems are shown
   to fail at critical velocities less than the maximum F2 tornado
   velocity, significant difference in those critical velocities is
   observed between the two considered systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{478-489}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Reactor performance of high density circulating fluidized bed (CFB)
   riser and downer is studied with superficial gas velocities of 3-9 m/s
   and solids circulation rates of 100-700 kg/m(2) s using ozone
   decomposition reaction. Results show that the reactant conversion in the
   riser and downer is closely related to the hydrodynamics, with solids
   holdup being the most influential parameter on ozone decomposition. Both
   axial and radial distribution profiles of the ozone concentration and
   the solids holdup in the downer are more uniform than that in the riser.
   Overall ozone conversion increases with the increase of solids
   circulation rate and/or the decrease of superficial gas velocity in both
   reactors. Compared to the riser reactor where the overall conversion is
   even less than the reactant conversion in stirred-tank reactor, overall
   conversion in the downer is less than but very close to that in ideal
   plug flow reactor. Contact efficiency is higher in the downer than in
   the riser indicating that gas-solids contacting in the downer is better
   due to the uniform solids flow structure and the reactant concentration.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{90-98}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cloud-based services have become part of our day-to-day software
   solutions. The identity authentication process is considered to be the
   main gateway to these services. As such, these gates have become
   increasingly susceptible to aggressive attackers, who may use Denial of
   Service (DoS) attacks to close these gates permanently. There are a
   number of authentication protocols that are strong enough to verify
   identities and protect traditional networked applications. However,
   these authentication protocols may themselves introduce DoS risks when
   used in cloud-based applications. This risk introduction is due to the
   utilization of a heavy verification process that may consume the cloud's
   resources and disable the application service. In this work, we propose
   a novel cloud-based authentication protocol suite that not only is aware
   of the internal DoS threats but is also capable of defending against
   external DoS attackers. The proposed solution uses a multilevel adaptive
   technique to dictate the efforts of the protocol participants. This
   technique is capable of identifying a legitimate user's requests and
   placing them at the front of the authentication process queue. The
   authentication process was designed in such a way that the cloud-based
   servers become footprint-free and completely aware of the risks of any
   DoS attack. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Projection-based force-reflection (PBFR) algorithms have been previously
   demonstrated to substantially improve stability characteristics of
   bilateral teleoperators with communication delays; however, the
   transient response of the PBFR algorithms suffers from relatively slow
   force convergence. As a result, the high-frequency component of the
   reflected force is lost during the initial phase of contact with the
   environment, which has a strong negative effect on the haptic perception
   of the environmental stiffness and texture. In this paper, a new type of
   PBFR algorithms are developed which solve the aforementioned problem.
   The new algorithms are based on the idea to separate different frequency
   bands in the force-reflection signal and apply the PBFR principle to the
   low-frequency component, while reflecting the high-frequency component
   directly. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results are
   presented; the results obtained confirm that the new algorithms
   fundamentally improve force convergence without a negative effect on
   stability of the teleoperator system with communication delays.}},

Title = {{The effective dose of different scanning protocols using the Sirona

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the effective dose and CT dose index (CTDI) for
   a range of imaging protocols using the Sirona GALILEOS (R) Comfort CBCT
   scanner (Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany).
   Methods: Calibrated optically stimulated luminescence dosemeters were
   placed at 26 sites in the head and neck of a modified RANDO (R) phantom
   (The Phantom Laboratory, Greenwich, NY). Effective dose was calculated
   for 12 different scanning protocols. CTDI measurements were also
   performed to determine the dose-length product (DLP) and the ratio of
   effective dose to DLP for each scanning protocol.
   Results: The effective dose for a full maxillomandibular scan at 42 mAs
   was 102 +/- 1 mu Sv and remained unchanged with varying contrast and
   resolution settings. This compares with 71 mu Sv for a maxillary scan
   and 76 mSv for a mandibular scan with identical milliampere-seconds
   (mAs) at high contrast and resolution settings.
   Conclusions: Changes to mAs and beam collimation have a significant
   influence on effective dose. Effective dose and DLP vary linearly with
   mAs. A collimated maxillary or mandibular scan decreases effective dose
   by approximately 29\% and 24\%, respectively, as compared with a full
   maxillomandibular scan. Changes to contrast and resolution settings have
   little influence on effective dose. This study provides data for setting
   individualized patient exposure protocols to minimize patient dose from
   ionizing radiation used for diagnostic or treatment planning tasks in
   dentistry.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{765}},
Pages = {{353-395}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{It is known that the drag for flows driven by a pressure gradient in
   heated channels can be reduced below the level found in isothermal
   channels. This reduction occurs for spatially modulated heating and is
   associated with the formation of separation bubbles which isolate the
   main stream from direct contact with the solid wall. It is demonstrated
   that the use of a proper combination of spatially distributed and
   spatially uniform heating components results in an increase in the
   horizontal and vertical temperature gradients which lead to an
   intensification of convection which, in turn, significantly increases
   the drag reduction. An excessive increase of the uniform heating leads
   to breakup of the bubbles and the formation of complex secondary states,
   resulting in a deterioration of the system performance. This performance
   may, under certain conditions, still be better than that achieved using
   only spatially distributed heating. Detailed calculations have been
   carried out for the Prandtl number Pr = 0.71 and demonstrate that this
   technique is effective for flows with a Reynolds number Re < 10; faster
   flows wash away separation bubbles. The question of net gain remains to
   be settled as it depends on the method used to achieve the desired wall
   temperature and on the cost of the required energy. The presented
   results provide a basis for the design of passive flow control
   techniques utilizing heating patterns as controlling agents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings of a laboratory-testing program
   performed on full-scale precast concrete pipes reinforced with dispersed
   steel fibres. Steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) pipes had diameters
   of 450 and 600 mm. Two types of steel fibres having round cross-sections
   and hooked ends were used. Steel fibres had lengths and aspect ratios of
   35 and 60 mm, and 65 and 80, respectively. The steel fibres content
   ranged from 0 to 40 kg/m(3). Plain (PC) and conventionally reinforced
   (RC) precast concrete pipes were also tested for comparison. Tested
   specimens were instrumented with strain gauges mounted on critical
   sections of each pipe. In addition, vertical and horizontal deformations
   of the pipe's cross-section were monitored using LVDTs. Precast pipes
   were tested using both the continuous and cyclic loading procedures as
   per the ASTM C497 and EN 1916 guidelines, respectively. Results showed
   that a fibre dosage of 30 kg/m(3) satisfied the strength requirements of
   ASTM C76 Class V pipe for 450 and 600 mm diameter pipes. In addition,
   the post-peak behaviour of SFRC pipes was comparable or superior to that
   of conventional RC pipes at small deformations. It was also found that
   the behaviour of SFRC pipes could be fully explored using the continuous
   three-edge-bearing test without need of an extra loading cycle as
   specified in the EN 1916 standard. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The communication channel power gain to the nearest neighbor of a node

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1155-1165}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel eavesdropping-resilient OFDM system
   through sorted subcarrier interleaving. The transmitter interleaves
   subcarriers in each OFDM signal according to its dynamic channel state
   information (CSI) to the legitimate receiver. More specifically,
   subcarriers are interleaved according to the sorted order of their
   instantaneous channel gains that are observed at the transmitter. Based
   on channel reciprocity, the legitimate receiver can derive the
   interleaving pattern initiated by the transmitter through its local
   channel estimate, and then de-interleave the received signals. In
   contrast, since spatially separated wireless channels in rich multipath
   environments are independent of each other, an eavesdropper at a third
   location cannot follow the dynamic subcarrier interleaving permutation,
   and thus fails to eavesdrop this transmission. Considering the imperfect
   reciprocity of noisy channel estimates at the legitimate terminals, only
   a subset of subcarriers in each OFDM signal is involved in the
   interleaving. A subcarrier selection algorithm is investigated to
   realize a trade-off between the eavesdropping resilience and
   transmission reliability. Theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo
   simulations have been provided to validate the proposed system. Compared
   with prior security enhancement schemes, the proposed approach requires
   only minor modifications to off-the-shelf systems and avoids additional
   resource consumption.}},

Title = {{Micromechanics Modeling of Bi-Axial Stretching Effects on the Electrical
   Conductivity of CNT-Polymer Composites}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the bi-axial stretching effects on the electrical
   conductivity of carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer composites are studied by
   a mixed micromechanics model with the consideration of the electrical
   conductive mechanisms. The bi-axial stretching effects are characterized
   by volume expansion of composite, re-orientation of CNTs and change of
   conductive networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the bi-axial
   stretching decreases the electrical conductivity of the composites due
   to the dominant role of the stretching-induced change in conductive
   networks, i.e., the increase in the percolation threshold, the
   separation distance among CNTs and the breakdown of the networks. It is
   also found that the bi-axial stretching enhances the decreasing rate of
   the electrical conductivity and increases the distribution randomness of
   the CNTs in the bi-axial stretching plane, as compared to a uni-axial
   stretching case. Furthermore, the dependency of the variation of
   electrical conductivity on the CNT concentration and sizes is also
   investigated. Possible reasons for the variation trends are interpreted.
   The study in this paper is expected to provide an increased
   understanding on the stretching effects upon the electrical conductivity
   of CNT-polymer composites.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo investigate the histopathological correlates of quantitative
   relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to determine their
   efficacy in epileptogenic lesion detection for preoperative evaluation
   of focal epilepsy.
   MethodsWe correlated quantitative relaxometry and DTI with histological
   features of neuronal density and morphology in 55 regions of the
   temporal lobe neocortex, selected from 13 patients who underwent
   epilepsy surgery. We made use of a validated nonrigid image registration
   protocol to obtain accurate correspondences between in vivo magnetic
   resonance imaging and histology images.
   ResultsWe found T1 to be a predictor of neuronal density in the
   neocortical gray matter (GM) using linear mixed effects models with
   random effects for subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was a predictor
   of neuronal density of large-caliber neurons only (pyramidal cells,
   layers 3 and 5). Comparing multivariate to univariate mixed effects
   models with nested variables demonstrated that employing T1 and FA
   together provided a significantly better fit than T1 or FA alone in
   predicting density of large-caliber neurons. Correlations with clinical
   variables revealed significant positive correlations between neuronal
   density and age (r(s)=0.726, p(fwe)=0.021). This study is the first to
   relate in vivo T1 and FA values to the proportion of neurons in GM.
   InterpretationOur results suggest that quantitative T1 mapping and DTI
   may have a role in preoperative evaluation of focal epilepsy and can be
   extended to identify GM pathology in a variety of neurological
   disorders. Ann Neurol 2015;77:237-250}},

Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{92-101}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the presence of limit cycles in the behaviour of
   antagonistically coupled magneto-rheological (MR) actuators is
   investigated. The actuator considered in this paper offers high
   torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios, for inherent safe
   actuation. While the antagonistic arrangement is beneficial in improving
   the actuator performance and eliminating backlash, it may result in
   limit cycles when the actuator operates in a position control loop. The
   occurrence of a limit cycle depends on the parameters of the actuator as
   well as the controller. An in-depth analysis is carried out in this
   paper to establish a connection between the system parameters and the
   limit cycle occurrence. Moreover, sufficient conditions for avoiding
   limit cycles are derived specifically for a proportional-derivative (PD)
   controller. Simulations and experimental results validate the analysis
   and provide insights into conditions under which limit cycles are
   observed in the operation of antagonistic MR actuators. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Purpose To measure the effects of distal radius malalignment on loading
   at the distal ulna.
   Methods. Using an,adjustable mechanism to simulate angulated and
   translated malalignments, clinically relevant distal radius deformities
   were simulated in a cadaveric model. A custom-built load cell was
   inserted just proximal to the native ulna head to measure the resultant
   force and torque in the distal ulna. Loads were measured before and
   after transecting the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).
   Results There was an increase in distal ulna load and torque with
   increasing dorsal translation and angulation. Combined conditions of
   angulation and translation increased force and torque in the distal ulna
   to a greater extent than with either condition in isolation. Transecting
   the TFCC resulted in a reduction in distal ulna load and torque.
   Conclusions A progressive increase in load at the distal ulna was
   observed with increasing severity of malalignment, which may be an
   important contributor to residual ulnar wrist pain and dysfunction.
   However, no clear-cut threshold of malalignment of a dorsally angulated
   and translated distal radius fracture was identified. These observations
   suggest that radius deformities cause articular incongruity, which
   increases TFCC tension and distal radioulnar joint load. Cutting of the
   TFCC decreased distal ulna loading, likely by releasing the articular
   constraining effect of the TFCC on the distal radioulnar joint, allowing
   the radius to rotate more freely with respect to the ulna. (Copyright

Abstract = {{The axial compression performance of large-capacity helical piles is of
   significant interest because they can offer an efficient alternative to
   conventional piling systems in many applications such as in oil
   processing facilities, transmission towers, and industrial buildings.
   This paper presents the results of seven full-scale axial compression
   load tests conducted on 6.0 and 9.0 m large-capacity helical piles and a
   6.0 m driven steel pile. The results are considered essential to qualify
   and quantify the performance characteristics of large-capacity helical
   piles in cohesive soils. The test piles were close-ended steel shafts
   with an outer diameter of 324 mm. The test helical piles were either
   single or double helix, with a helix diameter of 610 mm and interhelix
   spacing that varied between 1.5 and 4.5 times the helix diameter. The
   subsurface soil properties at the test site were determined using field
   and laboratory testing methods. The 6.0 m piles were tested 2 weeks
   after installation, while the 9.0 m piles were tested 9 months after
   installation. The load-settlement curves were presented to better
   understand the behaviour of test piles. An ultimate capacity criterion
   was proposed to estimate the ultimate load of large-capacity helical
   piles. The test helical piles developed ultimate resistances up to
   1.2-1.8 times that of the driven pile. The load-transfer mechanisms of
   large-capacity helical piles were studied, and it was found that soil
   disturbance during pile installation had a significant effect on the
   pile failure mechanism regardless the value of the interhelix spacing to
   helix diameter ratio. The mobilized soil strength parameters were
   back-calculated and compared with the estimated intact soil strength
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A result of below-knee amputations (BKAs) is abnormal motion that occurs
   about the proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ). While it is known that
   joint morphology may play a role in joint kinematics, this is not well
   understood with respect to the PTFJ. Therefore, the purposes of this
   study were: (i) to characterize the anatomy of the PTFJ and
   statistically analyze the relationships within the joint; and (ii) to
   determine the relationships between the PTFJ characteristics and the
   degree of movement of the fibula in BKAs. The PTFJ was characterized in
   40 embalmed specimens disarticulated at the knee, and amputated through
   the mid-tibia and fibula. Four metrics were measured: inclination angle
   (angle at which the fibula articulates with the tibia); tibial and
   fibular articular surface areas; articular surface concavity and shape.
   The specimens were mechanically tested by applying a load through the
   biceps femoris tendon, and the degree of motion about the tibiofibular
   joint was measured. Regression analyses were performed to determine the
   relationships between the different PTFJ characteristics and the
   magnitude of fibular abduction. Finally, Pearson correlation analyses
   were performed on inclination angle and surface area vs. fibular
   kinematics. The inclination angle measured on the fibula was
   significantly greater than that measured on the tibia. This difference
   may be attributed to differences in concavity of the tibial and fibular
   surfaces. Surface area measured on the tibia and fibula was not
   statistically different. The inclination angle was not statistically
   correlated to surface area. However, when correlating fibular kinematics
   in BKAs, inclination angle was positively correlated to the degree of
   fibular abduction, whereas surface area was negatively correlated. The
   characteristics of the PTFJ dictate the amount of fibular movement,
   specifically, fibular abduction in BKAs. Predicting BKA complications
   based on PTFJ characteristics can lead to recommendations in treatment.}},

Abstract = {{An effective and facile route of solvent-transfer assisted
   photolithography (STAP) was explored to successfully fabricate uprightly
   standing high-density (HD) and high-aspect-ratio (HAR) micropillar
   arrays with excellent superhydrophobicity. The collapse problem that
   frequently occurs with the HAR micro or nano-structures was simply
   resolved by the combined optimization of an SU-8 UV photolithographic
   process that aimed to maximize the stiffness of HAR pillars and minimize
   the capillary effect by fully optimizing UV exposure, resist baking and
   the final step of rinse and drying. The SU-8 micropillar array with high
   density close to 29\% and varied aspect ratio up to 13:1 can be
   fabricated in an equivalently effective but less time-consuming and
   simpler way compared to conventional techniques of supercritical point
   drying and freeze drying. As a result, the SU-8 surfaces structured with
   the upright standing HD and HAR micropillars created by the combined
   optimization of the STAP process were demonstrated to be of
   superhydrophobicity with a contact angle up to 162 degrees and those
   pillars array with varied AR above 5:1 assumed a slightly varied level

   therapy and volume-modulated arc therapy optimization and delivery}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{726-734}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the feasibility of unified intensity-modulated arc
   therapy (UIMAT) which combines intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
   and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) optimization and delivery to
   produce superior radiation treatment plans, both in terms of dose
   distribution and efficiency of beam delivery when compared with either
   VMAT or IMRT alone.
   Methods: An inverse planning algorithm for UIMAT was prototyped within
   the PINNACLE treatment planning system (Philips Healthcare). The IMRT
   and VMAT deliveries are unified within the same arc, with IMRT being
   delivered at specific gantry angles within the arc. Optimized gantry
   angles for the IMRT and VMAT phases are assigned automatically by the
   inverse optimization algorithm. Optimization of the IMRT and VMAT phases
   is done simultaneously using a direct aperture optimization algorithm.
   Five treatment plans each for prostate, head and neck, and lung were
   generated using a unified optimization technique and compared with
   clinical IMRT or VMAT plans. Delivery verification was performed with an
   ArcCheck phantom (Sun Nuclear) on a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator
   (Varian Medical Systems).
   Results: In this prototype implementation, the UIMAT plans offered the
   same target dose coverage while reducing mean doses to organs at risk by
   8.4\% for head-and-neck cases, 5.7\% for lung cases, and 3.5\% for
   prostate cases, compared with the VMAT or IMRT plans. In addition, UIMAT
   can be delivered with similar efficiency as VMAT.
   Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept work, a novel radiation therapy
   optimization and delivery technique that interlaces VMAT or IMRT
   delivery within the same arc has been demonstrated. Initial results show
   that unified VMAT/IMRT has the potential to be superior to either
   standard IMRT or VMAT. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Title = {{Rotationally resliced 3D prostate TRUS segmentation using convex
   optimization with shape priors}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{877-891}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Efficient and accurate segmentations of 3D end-firing
   transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images play an important role in planning
   of 3D TRUS guided prostate biopsy. However, poor image quality of the
   input 3D TRUS images, such as strong imaging artifacts and speckles,
   often makes it a challenging task to extract the prostate boundaries
   accurately and efficiently.
   Methods: In this paper, the authors propose a novel convex
   optimization-based approach to delineate the prostate surface from a
   given 3D TRUS image, which reduces the original 3D segmentation problem
   to a sequence of simple 2D segmentation subproblems over the rotational
   reslices of the 3D TRUS volume. Essentially, the authors introduce a
   novel convex relaxation-based contour evolution approach to each 2D
   slicewise image segmentation with the joint optimization of shape
   information, where the learned 2D nonlinear statistical shape prior is
   incorporated to segment the initial slice, its result is propagated as a
   shape constraint to the segmentation of the following slices. In
   practice, the proposed segmentation algorithm is implemented on a GPU to
   achieve the high computational performance.
   Results: Experimental results using 30 patient 3D TRUS images show that
   the proposed method can achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of
   93.4\% +/- 2.2\% in 20 s for one 3D image, outperforming the existing
   local-optimization-based methods, e.g., level-set and active-contour, in
   terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, inter-and intraobserver
   variability experiments show its good reproducibility.
   Conclusions: A semiautomatic segmentation approach is proposed and
   evaluated to extract the prostate boundary from 3D TRUS images acquired
   by a 3D end-firing TRUS guided prostate biopsy system. Experimental

Abstract = {{The Fuel And Sheath modeling Tool (FAST) is a general purpose nuclear
   fuel performance code. FAST includes models for heat generation and
   transport, thermal expansion, elastic strain, densification, fission
   product swelling, cracked pellet, contact, grain growth, fission gas
   release, gas and coolant pressure and sheath creep. The equations are
   solved on a two-dimensional (radial-axial) geometry of a fuel pellet and
   sheath using the Comsol Multiphysics finite-element platform. This paper
   presents the FAST code for normal operating conditions and results of
   the proof-of-concept testing against the ELESIM and ELESTRES-IST fuel
   codes as well as experimental data from seven irradiated fuel elements.
   In these seven cases, all of the codes were found to under-predict the
   measured average sheath strains. However, the FAST code was found to
   under-predict the mid-pellet sheath strains by a smaller margin than the
   other two codes. A larger data set is required to assess relative
   accuracy of the codes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{115-126}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Seismic design codes prescribe general guidelines to select a small
   number of ground motion records to be used to calculate the seismic
   demand for design. In particular, Chinese design codes recommend
   criteria for selecting three record components and for selecting seven
   record components to be used for seismic analysis and design. The
   statistical origin of the criteria as well as the preferred intensity
   measure for the record scaling are unknown; their adequacy for lattice
   domes has not been investigated and elaborated. This study evaluates the
   statistics of seismic responses of the single-layer reticulated dome due
   to limited number of record components, and investigates the effect of
   using the PGA and SA based scaling on the statistics of the responses.
   The time history analysis is carried out using 166 selected record
   components. Statistics of the maximum of seismic load effects on
   structural members, support reaction and base shear are obtained based
   on the analysis results by considering all records, and randomly sampled
   3 and 7 records according to code criteria. The results are used to make
   recommendations on the preferred intensity for scaling the records and
   the number of record components (three or seven) to be used to analyze
   and design such domes under seismic load. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Over Wireless Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of transmit power optimization for
   multimedia applications in continuous high-speed transmission over
   wireless networks. The power optimization process is developed by noting
   that some performance metrics such as throughput, delay and peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for particular systems with hybrid
   automatic repeat request (HARQ) may exhibit a staircase behavior. In
   such scenarios, the corresponding metric remains fixed for a wide range
   of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Consequently, the transmit power can
   be reduced significantly while the relevant metric remains almost
   unchanged. The obtained results reveal that invoking power optimization
   algorithms can achieve a significant power saving of about 80\% for
   particular scenarios. The system considered in this work is a truncated
   HARQ with turbo product codes (TPC) and parallel concatenated
   convolutional codes (PCCC). Chase combining is also used to combine the
   retransmitted packets with the original transmission. An efficient
   semi-analytical model is developed to obtain the system throughput in
   additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. The
   obtained results also show that using the throughput, delay or PSNR as
   performance metrics provides equivalent power saving results.}},

Title = {{The case for energy harvesting on wildlife in flight}},
Journal = {{Smart Materials and Structures}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The confluence of advancements in microelectronic components and
   vibrational energy harvesting has opened the possibility of remote
   sensor units powered solely from the motion of their hosts. There are
   numerous applications of such systems, including the development of
   modern wildlife tracking/data-logging devices. These `bio-logging'
   devices are typically massconstrained because they must be carried by an
   animal. Thus, they have historically traded scientific capability for
   operational longevity due to restrictions on battery size. Recently, the
   precipitous decrease in the power requirements of microelectronics has
   been accompanied by advancements in the area of piezoelectric
   vibrational energy harvesting. These energy harvesting devices are now
   capable of powering the type of microelectronic circuits used in
   bio-logging devices. In this paper we consider the feasibility of
   employing these vibrational energy harvesters on flying vertebrates for
   the purpose of powering a bio-logging device. We show that the excess
   energy available from birds and bats could be harvested without
   adversely affecting their overall energy budget. We then present
   acceleration measurements taken on flying birds in a flight tunnel to
   understand modulation of flapping frequency during steady flight.
   Finally, we use a recently developed method of estimating the maximum
   power output from a piezoelectric energy harvester to determine the
   amount of power that could be practically harvested from a flying bird.
   The results of this analysis show that the average power output of a
   piezoelectric energy harvester mounted to a bird or bat could produce
   more than enough power to run a biologging device. We compare the power
   harvesting capabilities to the energy requirements of an example system
   and conclude that vibrational energy harvesting on flying birds and bats
   is viable and warrants further study, including testing.}},

   predicting the pump performance and for control purposes. In addition,
   the efficiency and optimum geometric configuration are evaluated using
   this model. The numerical results show that a higher voltage leads to
   larger velocity and higher pressure, where the gas velocity is a linear,
   but pressure is a non-linear function of the supplied voltage. It was
   also found that there is an optimum wall angle for which the air
   volumetric flow rate from the outlet of the pump reaches the maximum
   value. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To review and synthesize the biomechanical effects of valgus knee
   bracing for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA). Electronic
   databases were searched from their inception to May 2014. Two reviewers
   independently determined study eligibility, rated study quality and
   extracted data. Where possible, data were combined into meta-analyses
   and pooled estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for
   standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated. Thirty studies were
   included with 478 subjects tested while using a valgus knee brace.
   Various biomechanical methods suggested valgus braces can decrease
   direct measures of medial knee compressive force, indirect measures
   representing the mediolateral distribution of load across the knee,
   quadriceps/hamstring and quadriceps/gastrocnemius co-contraction ratios,
   and increase medial joint space during gait. Meta-analysis from 17
   studies suggested a statistically significant decrease in the external
   knee adduction moment (KAM) during walking, with a moderate-to-high
   effect size (SMD = 0.61; 95\% CI: 0.39, 0.83; P < 0.001).
   Meta-regression identified a near-significant association for the KAM
   effect size and duration of brace use only (beta, -0.01; 95\% CI: -0.03,
   0.0001; P = 0.06); with longer durations of brace use associated with
   smaller treatment effects. Minor complications were commonly reported
   during brace use and included slipping, discomfort and poor fit,
   blisters and skin irritation. Systematic review and meta-analysis
   suggests valgus knee braces can alter knee joint loads through a
   combination of mechanisms, with moderate-to-high effect sizes in
   biomechanical outcomes. (C) 2014 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have studied Eosin Y-sensitized sacrificial hydrogen
   generation with triethanolamine as electron donor in UV, visible, and
   solar light irradiation. Aeroxide TiO2 was loaded with platinum metal
   via solar photo-deposition method to reduce the electron hole
   recombination process. Photocatalytic sacrificial hydrogen generation
   was influenced by several factors such as platinum loading (wt\%) on
   Tio(2), solution pH, Eosin Y to Pt/TiO2 mass ratio, triethanolamine
   concentration, and light (UV, visible and solar) intensities. Detailed
   reaction mechanisms in visible and solar light irradiation were
   established. Oxidation of triethanolamine and formaldehyde formation was
   correlated with hydrogen generation in both visible and solar lights.
   Hydrogen generation kinetics followed a Langmuir-type isotherm with
   reaction rate constant and adsorption constant of 6.77 x 10(-6) mol
   min(-1) and 14.45M(-1), respectively. Sacrificial hydrogen generation
   and charge recombination processes were studied as a function of light
   intensities. Apparent quantum yields (QYs) were compared for UV,
   visible, and solar light at four different light intensities. Highest
   QYs were attained at lower light intensity because of trivial charge
   recombination. At 30 mW cm(-2) we achieved QYs of 10.82\%, 12.23\% and
   11.33\% in UV, visible and solar light respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Conventional drug administration suffers from several drawbacks,
   including a lack of specificity for diseased tissue, the necessity of
   large and frequent doses, and adverse side effects. Great effort is
   currently being devoted to developing nanoparticle-based therapeutics
   capable of prolonging drug administration and providing better control.
   Here we demonstrate the use of flexible microporous MIL-53(Fe) and
   mesoporous MIL-101 and SBA-15 as matrices for the adsorption and in
   vitro drug delivery of acetaminophen, progesterone, and stavudine. A
   drug loading of 20 wt.\% was achieved for each of the nanomaterials
   using an incipient wetness impregnation procedure. BET, DSC, and XRPD
   analyses indicated that the entire loaded amount of each of the model
   drugs had successfully been incorporated within the mesoporous channels
   of both MIL-101 and SBA-15. DSC analysis evidenced that a portion of
   each of the model drugs had deposited onto the outer surface of MIL-53
   (Fe) particles; however, the portion of each drug that had incorporated
   within the microporous channels was slowly delivered in a
   diffusion-controlled process, which occurred over a period of up to six
   days for acetaminophen. These results demonstrate the unique ability of
   MIL-53(Fe) to adapt its porosity and optimize drug matrix interactions.
   Owing to its larger pore diameters and weaker host guest interactions,
   MIL-101 release times were shorter, yet still prolonged, as evidenced by
   the complete release of stavudine after five days. Complete release of
   each of the drugs from SBA-15 occurred very quickly as a result of rapid
   drug dissolution and diffusion out of the mesopores. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{USER-GUIDED SEGMENTATION OF PRETERM NEONATE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM FROM 3-D
   ULTRASOUND IMAGES USING CONVEX OPTIMIZATION}},
Journal = {{ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound (US) system has been developed to
   monitor the intracranial ventricular system of preterm neonates with
   intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and the resultant dilation of the
   ventricles (ventriculomegaly). To measure ventricular volume from 3-D US
   images, a semi-automatic convex optimization-based approach is proposed
   for segmentation of the cerebral ventricular system in preterm neonates
   with IVH from 3-D US images. The proposed semi-automatic segmentation
   method makes use of the convex optimization technique supervised by
   user-initialized information. Experiments using 58 patient 3-D US images
   reveal that our proposed approach yielded a mean Dice similarity
   coefficient of 78.2\% compared with the surfaces that were manually
   contoured, suggesting good agreement between these two segmentations.
   Additional metrics, the mean absolute distance of 0.65 mm and the
   maximum absolute distance of 3.2 mm, indicated small distance errors for
   a voxel spacing of 0.22 x 0.22 x 0.22 mm(3). The Pearson correlation
   coefficient (r = 0.97, p<0.001) indicated a significant correlation of
   algorithm-generated ventricular system volume (VSV) with the manually
   generated VSV. The calculated minimal detectable difference in
   ventricular volume change indicated that the proposed segmentation
   approach with 3-D US images is capable of detecting a VSV difference of
   6.5 cm(3) with 95\% confidence, suggesting that this approach might be
   used for monitoring IVH patients' ventricular changes using 3-D US
   imaging. The mean segmentation times of the graphics processing unit
   (GPU)- and central processing unit-implemented algorithms were 50 +/- 2
   and 205 +/- 5 s for one 3-D US image, respectively, in addition to 120
   +/- 10 s for initialization, less than the approximately 35 min required
   by manual segmentation. In addition, repeatability experiments indicated
   that the intra-observer variability ranges from 6.5\% to 7.5\%, and the
   inter-observer variability is 8.5\% in terms of the coefficient of
   variation of the Dice similarity coefficient. The intra-class
   correlation coefficient for ventricular system volume measurements for
   each independent observer ranged from 0.988 to 0.996 and was 0.945 for
   three different observers. The coefficient of variation and intra-class
   correlation coefficient revealed that the intra- and inter-observer
   variability of the proposed approach introduced by the user
   initialization was small, indicating good reproducibility, independent
   of different users. (E-mail: qiu.wu.ch@gmail.com) (C) 2015 World

Abstract = {{This article describes a geometric Brownian motion process-based model
   to characterise the growth rate of the depth of corrosion defects on
   underground steel pipelines based on inspection data subjected to
   measurement uncertainties. To account for the uncertainties from
   different sources, the hierarchical Bayesian method is used to formulate
   the growth model, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques
   are used to numerically evaluate the probabilistic characteristics of
   the model parameters. The growth model considers the bias and random
   scattering error associated with the in-line inspection (ILI) tool as
   well as the correlations between the random scattering errors associated
   with different ILI tools. The application of the growth model is
   illustrated through an example involving real ILI data collected from an
   in-service pipeline in Canada. The results indicate that the model in
   general can predict the growth of corrosion defects reasonably well. The
   proposed model can be used to facilitate the development and application
   of reliability-based pipeline corrosion management.}},

   spatially periodic in all principal directions. To validate the
   approach, digital samples of spherical-void-phase carbon foam were
   generated and discretized for use in hydraulic and thermal Computational
   Fluid Dynamics simulations. Relevant transport properties were computed
   from the simulation results, and compared to similar data found in the

Abstract = {{Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is a new generation of steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete with superior mechanical and durability
   properties. However, limited data is available on the influence of the
   steel fiber length and dosage on UHPC mechanical and durability
   performance. Therefore, in this study, a number of UHPC mixtures with
   varying steel fiber lengths (8 mm (0.31 in), 12 mm (0.47 in) and 16 mm
   (0.62 in)) and dosages (1\%, 3\% and 6\%) by mixture volume were tested.
   Mechanical properties of UHPC including compressive, splitting tensile
   and flexural strengths were assessed. Moreover, its resistance to
   chloride ions penetration and mechanical degradation under various
   chloride exposures (i.e. 3.5\% and 10\%) were evaluated. Results showed
   an increase in mechanical properties as the fiber dosage increased. UHPC
   mixtures incorporating short steel fibers exhibited enhanced flexural
   properties compared to that of mixtures with similar volume of longer
   steel fibers. At higher fiber dosage, UHPC mixtures exhibited relatively
   improved durability. Moreover, no degradation in UHPC mechanical
   properties was observed after exposure to various chloride ions
   solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are very promising power supply systems for
   a variety of applications, such as electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles, grid energy storage, and microelectronics. However,
   to realize these practical applications, many challenges need to be
   addressed in LIBs, such as power and energy density, cycling lifetime,
   safety, and cost. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is emerging as a
   powerful technique for solving these problems due to its exclusive
   advantages over other film deposition counterparts. In this review, we
   summarize the state-of-the-art progresses of employing ALD to design
   novel nanostructured electrode materials and solid-state electrolytes
   and to tailor electrode/electrolyte interface by surface coatings in
   order to prevent unfavorable side reactions and achieve optimal
   performance of the electrode. Insights into the future research and
   development of the ALD technique for LIB applications are also
   discussed. We expect that this review article will provide resourceful
   information to researchers in both fields of LIBs and ALD and also will
   stimulate more insightful studies of using ALD for the development of
   next-generation LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Since the last decade, nanodispersed drug delivery systems gain
   increasingly more importance for therapeutic research fields. The forced
   transport to the centers of inflammation is supposed to take advantage
   as a novel strategic approach. Thus, the focus of this study was to
   investigate the applicability of ubiquinone nanoformulations against
   oxidative stress. The physiological reduction of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) seems to be a promising treatment to point out the potential
   effects of these sophisticated nano-constructs. Therefore, the yeast
   strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae N34 was used for in vitro studies as a
   representative for eukaryotic organisms. Growth parameters during
   sequential fed batch-cultivation were monitored online using focused
   beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) method. The ability to control
   diverse cellular processes makes this yeast strain to a valuable tool
   for the initial investigation by understanding the fundamental
   mechanisms of nanoparticulate formulations onto eukaryotic cells.
   Furthermore, the characteristic stress response of yeast cell culture
   was examined, so that drug effects could be determined quantitatively.
   As a chemical stressor, diamide was tested in the range of 1-1000 mg
   diamide per g cell dry weight (CDW). The ubiquinone nanoformulation
   demonstrated a total stress reduction of approximately 14\% in the yeast
   culture, confirming the potential applicability of ubiquinone. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Linear-dendron (LD) hybrids are macromolecules comprising a linear
   polymer or oligomer conjugated at one or both termini with branched
   macromolecules called dendrons. Since their introduction approximately 2

   study of their self-assembly, and toward their application in a variety
   of fields. This highlight is focused on aqueous assemblies of LD hybrids
   where function is imparted by the dendron, linear component, or both.
   These functions include the encapsulation and release of drug molecules,
   enhancement of cell uptake and targeting of specific tissues, and the
   stabilization of enzymes for catalysis. In addition, many
   stimuli-responsive LD hybrids that undergo changes in response to light,
   enzymes, pH, temperature, redox potential, or even multiple stimuli have
   been developed. LD hybrids can also be used to form networks via
   cross-linking reactions. Described here are the structure-property

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{This study considers the CO2 sorption-desorption kinetics on a promising
   acid treated fluidizable Li4SiO4 sorbent. To accomplish this both
   carbonation and decarbonation including dynamic the thermodynamic
   equilibrium are considered using Temperature Programmed Carbonation
   (TPC) and Temperature Programmed Decarbonation (TPDC) experiments. The
   proposed phenomenological based kinetics model is established by
   comparing its suitability using correlation coefficients (R-2), lowest
   sum of squares (SSQ) of residuals, parameter spans for the 95\%
   confidence interval and cross-correlation coefficients matrix. It is
   found that a Langmuir Hinshelwood Model (LHM) is the best to describe
   the CO2 adsorption on Li4SiO4, while a Nucleation and Nuclei Growth
   Model (NNGM) with three dimensional growths is required to model the CO2
   desorption process. On this basis, it is speculated that the CO2
   adsorption rate over the acid treated porous fluidizable Li4SiO4 is
   dominated by a surface reaction, while the CO2 desorption rate is ruled
   by the formation and three dimensional growths (as hemisphere) of
   nuclei. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{250-266}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The ever increasing consumption of coal around the world has given rise
   to the by-product coal fly ash that requires an urgent attention and is
   gaining much needed research attention. This paper introduces pioneering
   work on zeolitization of coal fly ash utilizing conventional heating
   methods and reviews the progress made in the conversion of coal fly ash
   to zeolite and its applications while strongly focusing on the
   utilization of microwave and ultrasound energies in achieving this goal.
   An introduction to coal fly ash and zeolitic materials is given and the
   conversion of the formal to the latter is discussed. Zeolites are
   multi-utility crystals that have attracted much attention in the
   research community. Zeolites synthesized from pure chemical precursors
   are inherently different from zeolites produced from coal fly ash
   therefore; published works which have investigated the application of
   zeolites produced from coal fly ash are also discussed. Microwave and
   ultrasound energies have been reported to dramatically decrease reaction
   times due to the influences on the induction periods and nucleation. In
   the last few years these novel energies have blossomed in a useful
   technique for many applications. As novel energies they hold great
   promise in rapid and efficient conversion of coal fly ash to value added
   materials such as zeolites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulation of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) in a zirconia nanocage by
   area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) can significantly enhance
   both the Pt stability and activity. Such encapsulated Pt NPs show 10
   times more stability than commercial Pt/C catalysts and an oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) activity 6.4 times greater than that of Pt/C.

Abstract = {{Background Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specifi
   c all-cause and cause-specifi c mortality is essential for the formation
   of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden
   of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188
   countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether
   there is epidemiological convergence across countries.
   Methods We estimated age-sex-specifi c all-cause mortality using the GBD
   2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an
   updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We
   generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements
   included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72
   countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and
   detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey,
   and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code
   redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the
   240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant
   strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's
   disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of
   prevalence studies. For pathogen-specifi c causes of diarrhoea and lower
   respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed
   two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average
   relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and
   the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad
   findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose
   probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age
   15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age
   75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all
   quantities reported, we computed 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We
   constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year
   group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty
   distributions.
   Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years
   (UI 65.0-65.6) in 1990, to 71.5 years (UI 71.0-71.9) in 2013, while the
   number of deaths increased from 47.5 million (UI 46.8-48.2) to 54.9
   million (UI 53.6-56.3) over the same interval. Global progress masked
   variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute diff erences
   between countries decreased but relative diff erences increased. For
   women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49
   years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative diff erences
   increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed
   the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for
   cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and
   reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections,
   and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life
   expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes
   of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell
   whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have
   increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.
   Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7\%, from 4.3 million deaths
   in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over
   the same period by 21\%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per
   year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and
   2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and
   flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and
   sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections,
   neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death
   in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are
   rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory
   infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of
   life were substantially varied between and within regions.
   Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in
   age-sex specifi c mortality has been associated with a progressive shift
   towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by
   non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological
   convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative
   measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death
   rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the
   potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the
   empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for
   example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.}},

Abstract = {{Radioactive iodide (I-) and cesium (Cs+) ions were first simultaneously
   separated using electrochemically switched ion exchange (ESIX) method
   based on polypyrrole (PPy) and nickle hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) films,
   which were chemically deposited on two porous three-dimensional carbon
   felts (PTCF), respectively. It was found that applied potential
   significantly facilitated the adsorption efficiency and the lower pH
   value was beneficial to the separation process. The maximum adsorption
   capacity of both ions approached above 95.3 mg/g. The adsorption ratios
   of I- ion kept above 88\% at pH value ranged from 1.89 to 936. The
   ultimate I- and Cs+ ion desorption rates were proximately 87\% and 90\%,
   respectively. Such separation was suggested to proceed in two main
   steps: an ESIX step in which electrochemical oxidation of PPy and
   electrochemical reduction of NiHCF occurred rapidly (the fast step), and
   an IX step which was controlled by the gradients of ion concentrations
   between films and bulk solution (the slow step). The separation factors
   (alpha(I)(CI) = 90 and alpha(cs)(Na) = 458.8) showed high selectivity
   for I- (PPI film) and Cs+ (NiHCF film) ions over Cl- and Na+ ions,
   respectively. And five consecutive adsorption-desorption experiments
   indicated that the NiHCF/PTCF and PPy/PTCF electrodes can be effectively
   regenerated and are stable. It is expected that the developed method can
   be taken as a promising technology for actual wastewater treatment. (C)

   algorithm such that a group of Euler-Lagrange systems asymptotically
   synchronize their states to those of a dynamic leader with a
   time-varying trajectory. Then, we propose a modified design that
   achieves the same control objective under the assumption of intermittent
   discretetime communication in the presence of varying communication
   delays and possible packet dropout. It is shown that leaderfollower
   synchronization is achieved under sufficient conditions that can be
   realized uniformly of the interconnection topology between agents for a
   given characteristics of the communication process. Simulation results
   are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) system
   using a parity error checking (PEC) technique with low processing power
   requirements. The proposed technique is applied to extended turbo
   product codes (TPC) where the parity check bits used for extending the
   component codes of TPC, are exploited to replace the conventional cyclic
   redundancy check (CRC) error detection in HARQ systems. Consequently,
   the required processing power can be reduced substantially while the
   throughput is almost unchanged for long TPC codes, or increased for
   short TPC codes. The proposed PEC technique is also compared to the
   state-of-the-art syndrome error checking (SEC) as well as conventional
   CRC. Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that PEC-HARQ can provide
   equivalent throughput to SEC-HARQ and higher throughput than CRC-HARQ
   systems. Moreover, numerical results show that the PEC technique has
   lower computational complexity than both SEC and CRC error detection. In
   particular cases, the complexity of the proposed system is reduced by
   more than 50\% as compared to the state-of-the-art, and by more than
   80\% when compared to the CRC error detection.}},

Abstract = {{Process planning plays an important role for ensuring machining quality,
   reducing production cost, and shortening leading time. Since there are
   many uncertainty factors for manufacturing resources in a changing
   manufacturing environment, especially for small batch manufacturing of
   large scale parts requiring long process planning time, manufacturing
   companies are facing significant challenges on process planning of such
   large scale parts. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes
   an adaptive process planning method based on machining features and
   intelligent agents for the manufacturing of large-scale parts. Machining
   features are used as the carrier of manufacturing knowledge, which
   provides basis for process planning. Intelligent agents are used to
   respond to the changing of manufacturing resources. When the
   manufacturing environment changes, intelligent agents can sense the
   changes and make decisions in real time. The proposed process planning
   method can adapt to the changing manufacturing environment and can also
   shorten process planning time. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation

   smart phone embedded sensors and learning algorithms. The proposed human
   activity detection system recognizes human activities including walking,
   running, and sitting. While walking and running can be recorded as daily
   fitness activities, falling will also be detected as anomalous
   situations and alerting messages can be sent as needed. Embedded sensors
   including a tri-axial accelerometer, tri-axial linear accelerometer,
   gyroscope sensor, and orientation sensors are used for motion data
   collection. A two-stage data analysis approach is used for prediction
   model generation: short period statistical analysis (max, min, mean, and

   learning. The system is implemented in an Android smart phone platform.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, position control of a robot's end effector, by proposing
   an estimation mechanism for the interaction force between robotic tools

   adaptive strategy to provide the estimated force for achieving
   convergence of position and velocity tracking errors to zero. Moreover,
   the global stability of the closed loop system, using a time varying
   Lyapunov function and Barbalat's lemma is investigated. The proposed
   scheme considers a dynamic model for the environment. For this purpose,
   a viscoelastic model is adopted for the environment rather than an
   elastic one. This assumption has a great impact on effectiveness of all
   control strategies that use the force feedback, when working with soft
   tissues. Moreover, simulation results are given to demonstrate the

Abstract = {{Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud
   computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs)
   more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet.
   However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) only has relatively limited
   scalability and elasticity. Using the aggregated MR/Cs from multiple MCs
   is a natural evolution. To address this requirement, we propose an
   integration framework for multiple MCs, so that MCs can collaboratively
   cope with peak user demands for MR/Cs. The key functional modules and
   the business model of the proposed framework are presented to guide
   future integration of multiple MCs. The enabling technologies, such as
   semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service oriented
   architecture, and material handling and logistics technologies are also
   discussed. An application example is given, showing the feasibility and

Abstract = {{Cell sizes of the Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile networks grow
   inexorably smaller because of the massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
   (MIMO) and millimeter wave communication technologies to be used. It is
   therefore challenging to address the mobility management, especially
   vertical handover in 5G networks. In this paper, an intelligent vertical
   handover framework is proposed and discussed to simplify the network
   selection, and to reduce the handover latency and frequency. Integrating
   Media-independent handover (MIH) and Software-defined network (SDN)
   technologies, the core of our design is to ensure the handover happens
   between only two potential networks regardless of the available types of
   technologies. For this purpose, we exploit three types of handover
   information with a new pre-selection scheme to eliminate unqualified
   networks and generate a network ranking. Moreover, with the introduction
   of steady period, we use the feature of SDN to deliver the best two
   candidate networks to the two-dimensional (2D) cost function module for
   the final decision. Simulation results show that our proposed framework
   can accurately select the optimal network in an efficient manner even if
   a number of access technologies exist. Furthermore, our framework
   reduces the vast backhaul traffic during a vertical handover process and
   keeps the backhaul energy consumption low. Eventually, simulation also
   shows superiority when the cell sizes are diverse.}},

Abstract = {{Software Analytics (SA) is a new branch of big data analytics that has
   recently emerged (2011). What distinguishes SA from direct software
   analysis is that it links data mined from many different software
   artifacts to obtain valuable insights. These insights are useful for the
   decision-making process throughout the different phases of the software
   lifecycle. Since SA is currently a hot and promising topic, we have
   conducted a systematic literature review, presented in this paper, to
   identify gaps in knowledge and open research areas in SA. Because many
   researchers are still confused about the true potential of SA, we had to
   filter out available research papers to obtain the most SA-relevant work
   for our review. This filtration yielded 19 studies out of 135. We have
   based our systematic review on four main factors: which software
   practitioners SA targets, which domains are covered by SA, which
   artifacts are extracted by SA, and whether these artifacts are linked or
   not. The results of our review have shown that much of the available SA
   research only serves the needs of developers. Also, much of the
   available research uses only one artifact which, in turn, means fewer
   links between artifacts and fewer insights. This shows that the
   available SA research work is still embryonic leaving plenty of room for
   future research in the SA field.}},

Abstract = {{Guyed and self-supported transmission towers are typically comprised of
   two unique geometries: the vertical tower body and the horizontal
   conductor support cross-arm. Much research has been directed towards the
   evaluation of aerodynamic coefficients of the compact and symmetric
   geometry often used in the vertical portion of towers, however, much
   less information is available for cross-arm or non-symmetric sections.
   Wind tunnel tests carried out on a typical tower cross-arm design
   indicate that the drag loads vary significantly with wind direction, and
   exhibit a relationship which differs from the design procedure in the
   current (3rd Edition) of ASCE Manual of Practice No. 74: Guidelines for
   Electrical Transmission Line Structural Loading (ASCE-74). Two
   additional methods are presented, which show better agreement with the
   experimental data: the IEC equation for yawed wind (which was
   recommended in the 2nd Edition of ASCE-74); and a modified version of
   the yawed wind formula in ASCE-74. These approaches have been proposed
   for the upcoming edition of ASCE-74. The implications of the different
   equations are shown with reference to the wind loading on the structure
   only, as well as the overall tower-line system. The results are also
   compared with those obtained using PLS-TOWER. The paper reviews how
   force coefficients (i.e., drag coefficients) are developed and applied
   in wind load calculations, and describes the implications of the current
   and proposed approaches to yawed wind loads.}},

   candidate selection, optimal relay assignment, and cooperative
   communication. In this paper, we first propose a novel relaying
   candidate selection scheme ( KCN-selection) to choose k-cooperative
   nodes ( KCN) at each hop based on geographic information, while the
   certain number of k is initially determined based on an on-demand
   end-to-end ( ETE) reliability in the presence of unreliable
   communication links. However, the pre-assigned KCN cannot ensure an
   optimal performance due to wireless channel dynamics. To prolong the
   lifetime of wireless sensor network ( WSN), we schedule some part of KCN
   to sleep while the on-demand ETE reliability still can be guaranteed
   with wireless channel variations. A probabilistic ETE reliability model
   is built to compute optimal duty cycle for KCN in an online manner.
   Furthermore, a KCN based optimal relay assignment and cooperative data
   delivery ( KCN-delivery) scheme is presented, which can provide fully
   stateless, energy-efficient sensor-to-sink data delivery at a low
   communication overhead without the help of prior neighborhood knowledge.
   Simulation results show that our scheme significantly outperforms
   existing protocols in wireless sensor networks with highly dynamic

Abstract = {{Predicting energy demand peak is a key factor for reducing energy demand
   and electricity bills for commercial customers. Features influencing
   energy demand are many and complex, such as occupant behaviours and
   temperature. Feature selection can decrease prediction model complexity
   without sacrificing performance. In this paper, features were selected
   based on their multiple linear regression correlation coefficients. This
   paper discusses the capabilities of M5 model trees in energy demand
   prediction for commercial buildings. M5 model trees are similar to
   regression trees; however they are more suitable for continuous
   prediction problems. The M5 model tree prediction was developed based on
   a selected feature set including sensor energy demand readings, day of
   the week, season, humidity, and weather conditions (sunny, rain, etc.).
   The performance of the M5 model tree was evaluated by comparing it to
   the support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANN)
   models. The M5 model tree outperformed the SVR and ANN models with a
   mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.94 compared to 10.02 and 12.04 for the

Abstract = {{The demand for knowledge extraction has been increasing. With the
   growing amount of data being generated by global data sources (e.g.,
   social media and mobile apps) and the popularization of context-specific
   data (e.g., the Internet of Things), companies and researchers need to
   connect all these data and extract valuable information. Machine
   learning has been gaining much attention in data mining, leveraging the
   birth of new solutions. This paper proposes an architecture to create a
   flexible and scalable machine learning as a service. An open source
   solution was implemented and presented. As a case study, a forecast of
   electricity demand was generated using real-world sensor and weather
   data by running different algorithms at the same time.}},

Abstract = {{Migrating to the cloud is becoming a necessity for the majority of
   businesses. Cloud tenants require certain levels of performance in
   aspects like high availability and service rate and deployment options.
   On the other hand, Cloud providers are in constant pursuit of a system
   that satisfies client demands for resources, maximizes availability,
   minimizes power consumption and, in turn, minimizes the cloud providers'
   cost. A main challenge cloud providers face here is ensuring high
   availability (HA). High availability includes the combined reliability
   of components of all categories including network, computational,
   hardware and software components of all layers.
   In this work, we first address the need for a cloud simulator that
   enables HA algorithm testing in cloud environments and observe its
   impact on energy efficiency. We introduce a framework to amend cloud
   simulators with critical HA features. We take GreenCloud, a major
   simulator with a direct focus on green computing, and implement these
   features as an additional measurement layer. We demonstrate these added
   features by simulating their impact on a phased communication
   application (PCA).}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an attractive business model offering cost-efficiency
   and business agility. Recently, the trend is that small and large
   businesses are moving their services to cloud environments. The quality
   of service is always negotiated between the cloud users and the cloud
   providers and documented in the service level agreement (SLA). Yet
   assuring-or even measuring-the quality of the provided service can be
   challenging. This paper proposes a formal approach for quantifying the
   quality of service in the cloud systems as promised in the SLA. The
   proposed approach uses controller synthesis to find a system
   configuration that meets the SLA requirements. The formal approach
   suggested in this paper is based on, but not limited to, Time Petri Nets
   (TPN). As a case study, we focus on service availability as a key
   performance indicator in the SLA and for a sample set of resources
   providing a service, we determine the system configuration satisfying
   the SLA.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity price, consumption, and demand forecasting has been a topic
   of research interest for a long time. The proliferation of smart meters
   has created new opportunities in energy prediction. This paper
   investigates energy cost forecasting in the context of entertainment
   event-organizing venues, which poses significant difficulty due to
   fluctuations in energy demand and wholesale electricity prices. The
   objective is to predict the overall cost of energy consumed during an
   entertainment event. Predictions are carried out separately for each
   event category and feature selection is used to select the most
   effective combination of event attributes for each category. Three
   machine learning approaches are considered: k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
   regression, support vector regression (SVR) and neural networks (NN).
   These approaches are evaluated on a case study involving a large event
   venue in Southern Ontario. In terms of prediction accuracy, KNN
   regression achieved the lowest average error. Error rates varied greatly
   among different event categories.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid can be thought of as a network of interconnected wireless
   networks. In such a network, critical reports generated at the customer
   sites are required to be communicated to a control station through
   several layers of wireless networks. Communication in these sub-networks
   is typically achieved using IEEE 802.11 technology that uses Orthogonal
   Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Conventionally, in an OFDM
   system BPSK, QPSK and QAM mappers are used. In this paper, Continuous
   Phase Modulation (CPM) mapper in an OFDM system is proposed: i) to
   enhance the physical layer reliability through the introduction of
   correlation among the transmitted OFDM symbols; and ii) to reduce the
   Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of transmitted OFDM symbols. The
   objective, over here is to examine the PAPR performance of OFDM systems
   with CPM mappers with and without Selective Mapping (SLM) technique.
   Simulations show that CPM mapper in OFDM systems can provide better PAPR
   performance compared to conventional mappers used in the existing IEEE
   802.11 standards. It is noted that CPM mapper in OFDM is very effective
   in reducing PAPR and can be easily adopted in 802.11 standards for
   wireless network communications in smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{An Intelligent Distributed Channel-Aware Medium Access Control
   (IDCA-MAC) protocol is proposed for Home Area Network (HAN), in general,
   and for Electrical Devices Networks (EDN), in particular, in smart
   grids. In an EDN, electrical devices generate critical packets, and
   these must be communicated to their respective mesh clients. The
   proposed IDCA-MAC protocol employs simultaneous transmission of data
   packets through a single collision domain. Also, the electrical devices
   and the mesh client are assumed to be equipped with Multiple Input
   Multiple Output (MIMO) technology. The proposed protocol is compatible
   with the existing IEEE 802.11 standard, and uses channel-aware Medium
   Access Control (MA-Aware) and the Zig-Zag decoding algorithm.
   Simulations are carried out using the NS-2 network simulator, and the
   performance of IDCA-MAC protocol is evaluated for various smart grid
   scenarios that are of practical significance. It is shown that the

   Electrical Devices (EDs) communicate with a mesh client. This client
   then communicates with the mesh router of the wireless mesh network. EDs
   generate critical information packets, and these must be passed to a
   control station with minimal delay. In this paper, the modelling and
   delay of HANs is considered under several architectures for the
   communication of critical information packets to mesh clients. Bounds on
   achievable delay are derived as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio,
   number of electrical devices, number of channels, and channel

   cloud environments in complex event processing (CEP) systems is a recent
   architectural style that aims to overcome these challenges. Validating
   cloud-based CEP systems at the required Big Data scale, however, is
   often a laborious, error-prone, and expensive task. This article
   presents CEPSim, a new simulator that has been developed to facilitate
   this validation process. CEPSim extends CloudSim, an existing cloud
   simulator, with an application model based on directed acyclic graphs
   that is used to represent continuous CEP queries. Once defined, the
   queries can be simulated in different cloud environments under diverse
   load conditions. Moreover, CEPSim is also customizable with different
   operator placement and scheduling strategies. These features enable
   researchers and system architects to experiment with different
   configurations and strategies and to promote research in this field.
   Experimental results show that CEPSim can successfully simulate existing
   cloud-based CEP systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme
   based on turbo product codes (TPC) error correction and self-detection.
   The TPC inherent error detection is used as an alternative to the
   conventional cyclic redundancy check (CRC) process and is utilized to
   implement partial retransmission. The proposed HARQ system attempts to
   identify the location of errors within the TPC codeword. Consequently,
   only parts of the codeword which are declared erroneous are
   retransmitted. The performance of the proposed TPC-based HARQ is
   evaluated with hard and soft decision decoding in additive white
   Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Packet combining and adaptive channel
   coding are also considered. The obtained results show that the proposed
   HARQ scheme provides higher or equivalent throughput when compared to
   CRC-based HARQ in most test scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic (PV) cells are known for poor efficiency within the range
   of only 6-15\%, depending on the type of cells. As a result, those can
   convert only a small part of the absorbed solar energy into electricity,
   the rest is wasted as heat, which also contributes to rise in cell
   temperature. This heating up is undesirable for PV cells because it
   further decreases the electrical conversion efficiency. One viable
   solution to this problem is the combination of PV cells with integrated
   thermal collectors, known as photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors. This
   combination usually improves the PV module efficiency compared to
   stand-alone PV modules, because the fluid circulating underneath the PV
   cells removes the heat from the cells and cools them. Among the studies
   concerning PVT, Delisle {[}1] provided a good mathematical model, where
   the electrical output was calculated simply by considering a linear
   dependence of PV efficiency with cell temperature. In the current study,
   following the Delisle's approach {[}1], a simple model configuration
   consisting of transpired collector absorber plate of corrugated type
   mounted underneath the PV cells is analyzed. The resulting mathematical
   system is solved numerically using multivariate Newton's method. To
   calculate the model output more accurately, a sophisticated model known
   as two-diode model is incorporated. This model provides current-voltage
   characteristics with maximum power point (MPP) tracker, and considers
   nonlinear temperature effect. The comparison of the model outputs with
   experimental data reveals that two-diode model behaves differently for
   different sets of data at different conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The Polynomial basis (PB) representation offers efficient hardware
   realizations of GF (2(m)) multipliers. Bit-level serial multiplication
   over GF (2(m)) trades-off the computational latency for lower silicon
   area, and hence, is favored in resource constrained applications. In
   such area critical applications, extra clock cycles might take place to
   read the inputs of the multiplication if the data-path has limited
   capacity. In this paper, we present a new bit-level serial PB
   multiplication scheme which generates its output bits in parallel after
   m clock cycles without requiring any preloading of the inputs, for the
   first time in the open literature. The proposed architecture, referred
   to as fully-serial-in-parallel-out (FSIPO), is useful for achieving
   higher throughput in resource constrained environments if the data-path
   for entering inputs has limited capacity, especially, for large
   dimensions of the field GF (2(m)).}},

Abstract = {{When a fault occurs in the field developers usually collect failure
   reports (traces) containing function-call traces. (A function-call trace
   is a sequence of functions executed by a program.) Fault diagnosis in
   failure traces collected from the field is an arduous task due to the
   volume and size of trace contents. Previously, we have conducted several
   research studies to diagnose faulty functions in function-call level
   traces of field failure. During our studies, we have found that
   different faults in closely related functions occur with similar
   function-call traces. We also discovered form our studies and studies
   from other researchers that a classification or clustering algorithm can
   be trained on the function-call traces of a fault in a function and then
   can be used to diagnose different faults in the traces of the same
   function. In this paper, we propose an emerging descriptive theory based
   on the propositions grounded in these empirical findings. There is
   scarcity of theorizing empirical findings in software research and our
   work is a step towards this direction. The emerging theory is stated as:
   a fault in a function can be diagnosed from a function-call trace if the
   traces of the same or a different fault in that function are already
   known to a clustering or classification algorithm. We evaluate this
   theory using the criteria described in the literature. This emerging
   theory can facilitate in reducing the time spent in diagnosing the
   origin of fault in the field traces. However, we understand that more
   studies are needed to ascertain this theory.}},

   using the assumption that the maximum delay spread is less than the

Abstract = {{In this paper, a methodology to identify the source of distortion, its
   compensation and application in a transmitter device identification
   process is proposed using a two-step pilot signal approach. Step one
   involves the estimation of the channel and the step two estimates the
   transmitter device parameters, which are used to compensate distortions
   and identify the device. The device identification process involves the
   comparison of the estimated transmitter device parameters with a
   validated set of parameters. Results from computer simulation show that
   the proposed compensation method has a significantly good performance in
   terms of the bit error rate of the system and successfully identifies
   the transmitter device.}},

Abstract = {{The use of six-phase motors is an attractive option for electric and
   hybrid electric vehicles due to its modularity. Demand for high power
   density and lower costs for electric traction drives has led to the idea
   of integrating the battery charging function into the traction drive.
   When the main battery for dual motor type electric and hybrid electric
   vehicles is being charged, the equivalent power converter system is two
   converters that act as rectifiers and are connected in parallel. Feeding
   these converters from the AC grid with interleaved discontinuous PWM
   schemes can result in the appearance of a significant amount of
   circulating current flowing between the converters. Such circulating
   current increases converter component stresses and reduces
   battery-charging efficiency. In the paper, a PWM scheme based on
   discontinuous PWM methods is proposed to mitigate this circulating
   current. The proposed scheme does not require additional passive
   elements and maintains the benefits of discontinuous PWM. Simulation and
   experimental results are presented to validate the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for indoor localization is
   challenging as the GPS signal is significantly attenuated or completely
   blocked by the building. In achieving indoor localization, a set of
   transmitters from wireless communication networks are often used as
   reference nodes to localize target nodes with unknown locations. The
   accuracy of such localization process is considerably affected by the
   spatial distribution of the reference nodes with respect to the target
   node to be localized. Hence, deploying the reference nodes at best
   locations will notably increase the localization precision. In this
   paper, a novel reference nodes deployment scheme is introduced which
   minimizes the average Mean Square Error (MSE) of the localization over
   the area of interest with certain shape. The proposed scheme is
   evaluated for deploying the reference nodes in the circular, square, and
   hexagonal localization regions. The proposed scheme is validated and
   illustrated by numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment and monitoring of speech quality in assistive hearing devices
   is of great interest to Audiologists, hearing researchers, device
   manufacturers and consumers. While subjective assessment of device
   quality is the ``gold standard{''}, objective speech quality evaluation
   methods that emulate subjective perception are attractive for their
   efficiency and ease of use. This paper focuses on data-driven,
   non-intrusive speech quality metrics for potential application in
   hearing aids (HAs), using a custom database of HA speech recordings
   acquired in different noisy and reverberant environments. A large set of
   speech specific features were extracted from HA recordings, followed by
   a dimensionality reduction procedure to identify the most relevant
   features for quality prediction. The selected features are subsequently
   mapped to predicted quality scores and validated with subjective ratings
   obtained from hearing impaired listeners. Results showed that the
   non-intrusive metrics perform well in HA speech quality prediction.}},

   Incandescence (TiRe-LII) measurements of iron nanoparticles in He, Ne,

   and then aerosolized with a pneumatic atomizer using various carrier
   gases, so the nanoparticle size is the same for each aerosol and the
   TiRe-LII signal only differs due to the different thermal accommodation
   coefficient (TAC). Thermal accommodation coefficients for the Fe-Ar, and

Abstract = {{Central line procedures are interventions in which a needle is placed in
   the jugular vein in the patient's neck inferior to the carotid
   bifurcation. In these procedures, avoiding the puncture of the carotid
   artery is of upmost importance as it can cause severe neurological
   consequences or death. Often, these procedures are performed under
   ultrasound guidance, meaning that a linear ultrasound probe is held to
   the patient's neck in which the interventionalist can visualize both the
   carotid artery and jugular vein. However, due to the geometry of the
   interventional scene, the needle must be placed out-of-plane with the
   ultrasound and the needle cannot be fully visualized, only a
   cross-section thereof. This lack of visualization can lead to issues
   gaging the correct penetration depth. This paper presents preliminary
   results on an augmented reality (AR) needle guidance system in which a
   tracked needle and ultrasound fan are simultaneously visualized in their
   entirety. This AR guidance system is compared against traditional
   ultrasound-only guidance on a neck phantom. The use of the AR system
   significantly reduces the intervention time (average decrease of 3.51
   +/- 1.44 s) and normalized path length (average decrease of 150 +/- 40
   \%) implying that the use of such as system makes the procedure easier
   for the interventionalist (n = 36, p <= 0.05). This AR system has gained
   regulatory approval and is scheduled for clinical trials in humans.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an Iterative Closest Point framework for ultrasound
   calibration based on a hollow-line phantom. The main novelty of our
   approach is the application of a hollow-tube fiducial made from
   hyperechoic material, which allows for highly accurate fiducial
   localization via both manual and automatic segmentation. By reducing
   fiducial localization error, this framework is able to achieve
   sub-millimeter target registration error. The calibration phantom
   introduced can be manufactured inexpensively and precisely. Using a
   Monte Carlo approach, our calibration framework achieved 0.5mm mean
   target registration error, with a standard deviation of 0.24 mm, using
   12 or more tracked ultrasound images. This suggests that our framework
   is approaching the accuracy limit imposed by the tracking device used.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ visualization of ultrasound in robot-assisted surgery requires
   robust, real-time computation of the pose of the intra-corporeal

   Image based, intrinsic methods of computing this relative pose need to
   overcome challenges due to irregular illumination, partial feature
   occlusion and clutter that are unavoidable in practical
   robotic-laparoscopy. In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art
   simultaneous monocular pose and correspondence estimation framework to a
   stereo imaging model. The method is robust to partial feature occlusion
   and clutter, and does not require explicit feature matching. Through
   exhaustive experiments, we demonstrate that in terms of accuracy, the
   proposed method outperforms the conventional stereo pose estimation
   approach and the state-of-the-art monocular camera-based method. Both
   quantitative and qualitative results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{High-dimensional feature representations have recently been widely used
   for image classification, which not only induce large storage
   requirement and high computational complexity, but also tend to be lack
   of discrimination due to redundant and noisy features. In this paper, we
   propose a novel algorithm named supervised locality analysis (SLA) for
   dimensionality reduction. In contrast to conventional dimensionality
   reduction methods, the proposed SLA incorporates supervision into
   locality analysis by fully exploring multi-class distributions, which
   can handle the non-linear data structure while preserving intrinsic
   discriminative information. The obtained compact and highly
   discriminative features by the SLA is enables more accurate and
   efficient classification. Moreover, the SLA can be used for supervised
   dimensionality reduction of both handcrafted and deep learning based
   features. We have conduced experiments to evaluate the proposed SLA on
   three datasets for image classification. The SLA has produced
   state-of-the-art performance and largely outperformed widely-used
   dimensionality reduction methods.}},

Title = {{Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus for preterm neonates from
   early-in-life to term-equivalent age}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{176-193}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure central
   to learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable in preterm-born
   neonates. To date, segmentation of the hippocampus for preterm-born
   neonates has not yet been performed early-in-life (shortly after birth
   when clinically stable). The present study focuses on the development
   and validation of an automatic segmentation protocol that is based on
   the MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically Generated Templates) algorithm
   to delineate the hippocampi of preterm neonates on their brain MRIs
   acquired at not only term-equivalent age but also early-in-life.
   Methods: First, we present a three-step manual segmentation protocol to
   delineate the hippocampus for preterm neonates and apply this protocol
   on 22 early-in-life and 22 term images. These manual segmentations are
   considered the gold standard in assessing the automatic segmentations.
   MAGeT-Brain, automatic hippocampal segmentation pipeline, requires only
   a small number of input atlases and reduces the registration and
   resampling errors by employing an intermediate template library. We
   assess the segmentation accuracy of MAGeT-Brain in three validation
   studies, evaluate the hippocampal growth from early-in-life to
   term-equivalent age, and study the effect of preterm birth on the
   hippocampal volume. The first experiment thoroughly validates
   MAGeT-Brain segmentation in three sets of 10-fold Monte Carlo
   cross-validation (MCCV) analyses with 187 different groups of input
   atlases and templates. The second experiment segments the neonatal
   hippocampi on 168 early-in-life and 154 term images and evaluates the
   hippocampal growth rate of 125 infants from early-in-life to
   term-equivalent age. The third experiment analyzes the effect of
   gestational age (GA) at birth on the average hippocampal volume at
   early-in-life and term-equivalent age using linear regression.
   Results: The final segmentations demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain
   consistently provides accurate segmentations in comparison to manually
   derived gold standards (mean Dice's Kappa > 0.79 and Euclidean distance
   <1.3 mm between centroids). Using this method, we demonstrate that the
   average volume of the hippocampus is significantly different (p <
   0.0001) in early-in-life (621.8 mm(3)) and term-equivalent age (958.8
   mm(3)). Using these differences, we generalize the hippocampal growth
   rate to 38.3 +/- 11.7 mm(3)/week and 40.5 +/- 12.9 mm(3)/week for the
   left and right hippocampi respectively. Not surprisingly, younger
   gestational age at birth is associated with smaller volumes of the
   hippocampi (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: MAGeT-Brain is capable of segmenting hippocampi accurately
   in preterm neonates, even at early-in-life. Hippocampal asymmetry with a
   larger right side is demonstrated on early-in-life images, suggesting
   that this phenomenon has its onset in the 3rd trimester of gestation.
   Hippocampal volume assessed at the time of early-in-life and
   term-equivalent age is linearly associated with GA at birth, whereby
   smaller volumes are associatedwith earlier birth. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{While achieving localization using wireless networks, the positioning
   accuracy of a target device is highly sensitive to the placement of
   reference nodes. As a result, an in-depth analysis on the optimal
   placement of reference nodes is extremely useful in order to improve
   deployment outcome. In this paper, we propose an optimum reference node
   deployment scheme for Time of Arrival (TOA)-based localization by
   minimizing the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) of localization error. In order to
   find the global minima of the CRB which is highly non-linear, a novel
   method is developed to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The
   essence of our method is to express the CRB in complex coordinates, and
   then to minimize the CRB with respect to the angles of reference nodes.
   The mathematical solution provides an interesting result indicating that
   the highest localization accuracy is achieved when the reference nodes
   have uniform angular distribution around the service area where the
   target is expected. We compare several different reference node
   deployment schemes through simulations, and the results show our derived
   optimum deployment provides the best performance.}},

Title = {{Kandovan the next `Capadoccia'? A potential public health issue for
   erionite related mesothelioma risk}},
Journal = {{EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOSTATISTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The Kandovan region in Iran is physically and geologically
   similar to the Cappadocian region in Turkey where fibrous zeolites,
   including erionite, have been found in volcanic tuffs. In some
   Cappodocian villages there is strong evidence that erionite, and
   possibly related minerals, are responsible for the high level of
   mesothelioma found there. So, although mesothelioma clusters have not
   been reported in Kandovan, it is a plausible hypothesis that many cases
   of mesothelioma in Iran may be due to naturally occurring fibrous
   zeolites.
   METHODS: A detailed study of Iranian geology was made to determine
   similarities between the Kandovan region and Cappadocia, `inter-mountain
   zones' in the Western US and Mexico. Areas where mesothelioma cases
   probably attributable to erionite exposure have been found.
   RESULTS: Although there is a long history of asbestos use in Iran many
   cases of mesothelioma do not present with positive asbestos exposure
   histories. Since fibrous zeolites are so widespread, why have not more
   mesotheliomas attributable to them been found throughout Iran? Various
   possible reasons were explored including misdiagnosis, poor
   surveillance, a general lack of awareness that this tumor may be linked
   to mineral fibre exposure. There is also the analytical problem of
   identifying fibrous erionite in lung tissue.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is every reason to believe mesotheliomas due to
   fibrous zeolite including erionite will be found in Iran. The most
   likely places to find them are the villages that look very similar to
   those found in Cappadocia since these are based upon similar geological
   formations.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency is one of the most critical issues in wireless sensor
   networks, since the sensor nodes are usually battery powered. These
   energy-constrained sensor nodes are usually densely distributed in
   indoor environments, which leads to spatially correlated sensor data and
   low network efficiency. Thus, one way to improve energy efficiency is to
   reduce the redundancy caused by the correlated data. In this paper, a
   new sensor scheduling algorithm, based on data correlation, is proposed.
   The sensor nodes are clustered into groups by a new adaptive dual-metric
   K-means (DK-means) algorithm. Within each group, the sensor nodes take
   turns to work as a group representative and transmit data to the sink.
   Thus, the energy consumed by the redundant transmissions of the
   correlated sensor data is saved. Performance evaluation of the proposed
   mechanism is conducted through OPNET simulations. The simulation results
   show that the adaptive DK-means algorithm significantly improves data
   reliability, as compared to the adaptive K-means algorithm. Furthermore,
   this improvement in reliability is achieved with minimal cost in terms
   of complexity. Finally, it is shown that the proposed sensor scheduling
   algorithm achieves energy savings of up to 58\%, as compared to the
   baseline ZigBee protocol.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the performance evaluation of Magneto-Rheological
   Fluid (MRF) based actuation systems when used in haptic interfaces.
   MRF-based actuators exhibit superior characteristics, which can
   significantly contribute to the transparency and stability of haptic
   devices. To validate this statement, a prototype two degrees-of-freedom
   (DoF) haptic interface is constructed. A distributed antagonistic
   configuration is used in order to develop the 2-DoF haptic interface
   based on small-scale MRF-based clutches for a class of medical
   applications. The developed device is compared with three conventional
   haptic interfaces and their stability is compared using the Virtual Wall
   experiment. Next, the prototype interface is incorporated in a
   master-slave teleoperation medical setup. Preliminary studies on the
   performance of the haptic interface show great potential of MRF-based
   actuators for integration in haptic devices for medical interventions
   that require safe, accurate, and stable force representation.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of dexterous control over the position of a catheter's distal tip
   and not having any feedback from the quality of tip - tissue contact are
   among the factors that make the conventional catheter-based method of
   performing cardiac ablation very challenging. To resolve these issues,
   in this paper, we present a robotic catheter manipulation system that
   accommodates a conventional ablation catheter, places the ablation tip
   at the desired target and reports the forces that the tip exerts on the
   environment in real-time. In this system, the manual proximal handle is
   replaced with a mechanism that is capable of measuring the tension force
   along the pull-wire while actuating it to flex the distal shaft of the
   catheter. The placement of force/pressure sensors at the distal end of
   the catheter is avoided by developing a model-based force estimation
   technique using the measured tension force and information on the
   position and orientation of the distal tip. The developed system is
   further enhanced with an interface to assist the user in placing the
   catheter tip at the desired location while providing him/her with a
   real-time measure of the contact force. Extensive experiments show that
   using the proposed robotic system, the catheter tip is positioned within
   +/- 1 mm of the designated target and contact forces are reported in
   real-time with an accuracy of 3 gf.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new passivity-based technique is proposed to analyze
   and guarantee the stability of haptics-enabled telerobotic
   rehabilitation systems where there is a possibility of having more
   sources of non-passivity than communication delays. In practice, the
   difficulty of therapeutic exercises should be tuned taking into account
   the stage of physical disability. However, tuning the difficulty and
   intensity should not violate the stability of patient-robot interaction.
   This usually puts conservative prefixed limits on the allowable exercise
   intensity. In this paper, patient-robot interaction safety is studied in
   the context of Strong Passivity Theory (SPT). Our goal is to ultimately
   relax the limitation on the allowable robotic therapies while preserving
   system stability. The proposed stabilizing scheme does not try to make
   the entire non-passive component passive. This allows the therapist to
   have freedom in injecting energy into the system for assistive therapies
   while ensuring safe patient-robot interaction. In this paper, the case
   of telerobotic rehabilitation is considered. Experimental implementation
   and evaluation are presented to support the proposed theory.}},

Abstract = {{Disguised jamming can be used to disrupt adversary wireless transmission
   without being noticed. In this paper, a novel nonlinear
   amplify-and-forward (NAF) jamming scheme is proposed to perform
   disguised jamming on wireless OFDM transmission, by exploiting the
   vulnerability of OFDM systems to nonlinear distortion. In the proposed
   design, the jammer nonlinearly amplifies captured signals and then
   forwards them to the receiver of the target communication system.
   Consequently, constellation rotation of the target communication
   signals, coupled with inter-carrier interference and additional noise,
   is imposed to the receiver. The OFDM transmission is thus disrupted. As
   the jamming signals are just a distorted version of the communication
   signals, which can also be induced by hardware imperfection of the
   communication system itself, the jamming attack is difficult to detect.
   Moreover, the proposed jamming scheme requires no information about the
   communication system and no synchronization to target signals. In
   addition, it can be easily implemented by analog circuits without any
   digital signal processing. Simulation results are provided to validate
   the proposed NAF jamming scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In our previous work {[}1], the potential benefits of
   Magneto-Rheological Fluid based actuators to the field of haptics were
   studied. Our results showed that the superior mechanical attributes of
   such actuators contribute to improvement of stability and transparency
   in haptic devices. To this end, a novel design of a small-scale
   MRF-based clutch, was proposed in {[}1]. This paper reports on the
   development and validation of the proposed MRF-based clutch. In
   addition, a closed-loop torque control strategy is presented. The
   feedback signal used in this control scheme comes from the magnetic
   field measurement and is used to compensate for the nonlinear behavior
   using an estimated model, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
   Such a control strategy eliminates the need for torque sensors for
   providing feedback signals. The performance of the developed design and
   the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control techniques are
   experimentally validated. The results clearly demonstrate that the
   clutch shows great potential for use in a multiple degrees-of-freedom
   (DOF) haptic interface for a class of medical applications.}},

   tracking system that may be used as an inexpensive alternative to

   instruments. The system is based on the fusion of inertial, magnetic and
   distance sensing to generate real-time, 6-DOF pose data. Orientation is
   estimated using a Kalman-filtered attitude-heading reference system
   (AHRS) and restricted motion at the trocar provides a datum from which
   position information can be recovered. The IRES tracker was validated
   within a surgical training box. The results show that the IRES tracker
   achieves similar performance to an EM tracker with position error as low
   as 1.25 mm RMS and orientation error <0.58 degrees RMS along each axis.
   It also displayed greater precision and superior magnetic interference
   rejection capabilities. At a fraction of the cost of current
   laparoscopic tracking methods, the IRES tracking system is a suitable
   alternative for use in surgical training and skills assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor localization in traditional lung resection surgery requires manual
   palpation of the deflated lung through a thoracotomy. It is a painful
   procedure that is not suitable for many patients. Therefore, a
   multisensory mechatronic device was designed to localize tumors using a
   minimally invasive approach. The device is sensorized with tactile,
   ultrasound and position sensors in order to obtain multimodal data of
   soft tissue in real time. This paper presents the validation of the
   efficiency and efficacy of this device via an ex vivo experimental
   study. Tumor pathology was simulated by embedding iodine-agar phantom
   tumors of varying shapes and sizes into porcine liver tissue. The device
   was then used to palpate the tissue to localize and visualize the
   simulated tumors. Markers were then placed on the location of the tumors
   and fluoroscopic imaging was performed on the tissue in order to
   determine the localization accuracy of the device. Our results show that
   the device localized 87.5\% of the tumors with an average deviation from
   the tumor center of 3.42 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless charging of electric vehicles require a significant air gap
   between the primary and secondary winding of an inductive power transfer
   (IPT) system. Due to the existence of the air gap, power flow regulation
   to keep the output voltage constant becomes a non-trivial task. Hence,
   the bandwidth, phase margin, and gain margin of the voltage control
   loops should be appropriately designed, in order to guarantee a robust
   system. In this paper, a generalized small-signal modelling of
   series-series compensated (SS topology) IPT system using extended
   describing function concept has been presented. Using this small-signal
   model, a controller has been designed for fixed frequency and variable
   duty cycle, to control the output voltage. Since an asymmetrical clamped
   mode control (ACM) requires a lower switching frequency compared to the
   popular fixed frequency control strategies, viz. symmetrical clamed mode
   control (SCM) and asymmetrical duty cycle control (ADC), it has been
   used to control the output voltage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with output synchronization problem in nonlinear
   multi-agent systems. The main contribution of the paper is to guarantee
   output synchronization in the network while the dynamics of agents
   exhibit non-minimum phase behavior. To achieve this goal, a control
   signal is presented for each agent consisting of two terms. The first
   term is a linear function of each agent states employed in order to
   overcome the non-minimum phase dynamics of the multi-agent system,
   whereas the second term is a function of the output of neighboring
   agents which provides coupling among agents and guarantees output
   synchronization in the network. A numerical example is presented to
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the efficient modeling of waveguide
   dual-mode bandpass filters over wide frequency range. Analysis of the
   characteristics of the general scattering matrix (GSM) of each junction
   of a typical filter structure shows that it is possible to preserve and
   extract only necessary information without sacrificing model accuracy.
   The complexity of the electromagnetic (EM) data can therefore be
   significantly reduced in the construction of the filter model, while
   maintaining required simulation accuracy. The efficiency of the method
   is demonstrated using a Ku band dual-mode pseudo elliptic filter.
   Responses obtained using the proposed simplified model agree well with
   full EM simulations and measurement results over 2 GHz frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{With continual thinning of crystalline silicon solar cells the carrier
   lifetime of the device becomes progressively more dependent on the
   quality of the surface passivation of the device. Thermal oxide growth
   can degrade crystalline silicon bulk properties through defect migration
   and can induce thermal stresses particularly in the context of
   ultra-thin silicon. This has motivated research into a range of
   passivation techniques that can be implemented at low temperatures. Here
   we report on the use of low temperature ozone ambient grown native oxide
   and PECVD grown silicon nitride bilayer structure to passivate
   crystalline silicon. The effective minority carrier lifetime is examined
   as a function of the thicknesses of the bilayers. Inferred interfacial
   defect and fixed charge densities are investigated vis-a-vis the native
   oxide and nitride layer thicknesses. Hydrogen content at the interface
   is determined by elastic recoil detection and Rutherford backscattering.
   Our results indicate that thicker silicon nitride enhances lifetime
   through reduced interfacial defect density albeit the trapped charge
   density decreases marginally with thickness. Preliminary ion
   spectroscopy results show a link to an increase in the hydrogen content
   beyond the oxide interface. Also, increasing oxide thickness grown at
   room temperature enhances the surface passivation.}},

Abstract = {{Since wireless sensor networks are usually used for long-term monitoring
   in harsh environments, sensor nodes are vulnerable to faults. Function
   fault can lead to immediate node breakdown, while data fault makes the
   node generate erroneous sensor data. Faulty data results in incorrect
   estimation of the environment and causes unnecessary consumption of the
   network resources. Therefore, it is necessary to detect faulty data in
   real time. In this paper, a new distributed fault detection algorithm is
   proposed, which is based on the temporal and spatial correlation of the
   sensor data. With the proposed algorithm, faulty data is detected and
   discarded locally, so that the network resource consumption is minimized
   and the processing burden of the terminal is reduced. Simulation results
   show that the proposed algorithm improves detection accuracy, as
   compared to the baseline distributed fault detection algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, achieving world-wide multimedia wireless services has
   received wide-spread attention and is the most desired objective of
   service providers of telecommunication networks. Thus, a significant
   amount of research efforts is devoted to broaden the wireless services
   over the globe. In this context, satellite component plays a pivotal
   role in extending and enhancing the existing Universal Mobile
   Telecommunication System (UMTS). In this paper, integration of satellite
   communication systems with UMTS is addressed. Several integration
   scenarios are considered and their simulation results using Network
   Simulator (NS) are given. In particular, performance of integration
   scenarios is evaluated in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput of
   the system as a function of satellite orbits and UMTS configuration for
   a variety traffic applications (UDP/TCP) and traffic data rates. It is
   observed that Satellite-UMTS (S-UMTS) telecommunication networks provide
   acceptable delay and throughput performance. Also, due to the synergy
   that exists between satellite and UMTS networks, S-UMTS is a sound
   approach for delivering multimedia services globally.}},

   dynamics under the assumption of intermittent communication between
   agents in the presence of time-varying communication delays. More
   precisely, we consider the containment control problem with multiple

   present distributed control algorithms, in the full and partial state
   feedback cases, where the communication between agents is performed only
   at some discrete instants of time in the presence of irregular
   communication delays and packet dropouts. It is shown that the proposed
   approach leads to our control objectives under sufficient conditions

Abstract = {{Thermal energy storages are becoming important due to their significance
   in energy conservation as well as for the uninterrupted supply of
   thermal energy from renewable energy sources. The latent heat-based
   thermal energy storage systems utilizing phase change material (PCM) are
   gaining much attention due to some inherent advantages compared to
   sensible heat-based storage systems. However, the heat transfer process
   associated with the phase change in a PCM is complex and not well
   understood. In the present study, the melting process in a PCM-based
   thermal storage is experimentally studied. Two different configurations
   of the heat source were considered; horizontal and U-tube heat sources.
   The results show that the heat source shape has a significant influence
   on the solid to liquid phase change process (melting). The results also
   show that for the horizontal heat source configuration, the solid-liquid
   interface has a wavy profile, which is attributed to the convective
   cells in the melted domain of the PCM. These convective cells also
   influence the heat transfer coefficient, which decreased with an
   increase in the melted fraction. In U-tube configuration, the heat is
   non-uniformly transferred to the PCM domain.}},

Abstract = {{Bubble breakers have been shown to reduce the bubble size and hence
   increasing the bubble surface-to-volume ratio facilitating higher mass
   transfer. We report on an experimental study investigating the effect of
   mesh-type bubble breaker on two-phase co-flow in a vertical column. A
   range of gas-liquid flow rates ratios (GLR) has been considered that
   covers the two-phase regimes from bubbly flow to slug flow. A vertical
   glass tube was used as the experimental apparatus which provides full
   optical access. A high speed imaging system was used to capture the flow
   dynamics for bubble characterization. The results show that the bubble
   size generated by the mesh bubble breaker is greatly affected by the
   pore size. For a bubbly flow regime, the initial bubble size was reduced
   by approximately 60\%-70\% for a pore size of 1mm and by about 45\%-50\%
   for a pore size of 4mm. It is found that the transition from bubbly flow
   to slug flow can be affected by the mesh bubble breaker. The results
   show that in general, the mesh bubble breaker increases the GLR limit
   for the transition from bubbly to slug flow.}},

   geometrically similar but have more than an order of magnitude scale
   difference. Qualitative and quantitative results showed that both
   facilities can physically simulate tornado-like vortex. The results also
   show that the radial and tangential turbulent velocities have strong
   dependency on the swirl ratio when a transition from laminar to
   turbulent takes place in the vortex core. Further investigations are
   underway to study the scaling effects in terms of physical simulation of
   the tornado-like vortex flow in the two facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Existing scheduling and decision solutions to container terminal
   logistics systems (CTLS) are falling short of peoples' wishes both in
   theory and in practice. This paper proposes a container terminal gang
   scheduling computational paradigm (GSCP) for planning and control at
   container terminals based on computational thinking. GSCP is built on
   the computing perspective and architecture of multi-processor
   system-on-chip. GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to
   evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the
   fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load
   balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and
   scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance
   of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and
   containers, task latency and load leveling as well. GSCP is demonstrated
   and validated by a typical container hub logistics service case with
   intensive computational experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The success/failure of implants largely depends on their
   osseointegration with the surrounding bone, which in turn a strong
   function of their biocompatibility and surface roughness. Therefore,
   nanoparticles of metal oxides are recently being extensively used into
   composites in order to enhance their topographical and biological
   properties. Hence, the objective of this study is to develop
   biocompatible polymeric powder coatings enriched with nano-SiO2 by using
   ultrafine powder coating technology and to grow HEPM cell on them. The
   coating technique involves a pre-processing of the powder mixture with
   the nanoparticles that ensures the homogeneous dispersion of
   nanoparticles into the coating ingredients. As a consequence, the
   presence of SiO2 nanoparticles into the polymeric materials facilitates
   fabrication of nano topographies onto the coated surfaces. An
   experimental set up was designed and executed to evaluate the
   adhesion/bond strength of the coating and to measure the load bearing
   capacity that the coatings can withstand before being detached from the
   substrate. Coating's topographical features and cells' morphology were
   analyzed by using SEM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract = {{ZnFe2O4, a type of mixed transition metal oxide, is considered as one of

   electrochemical process are still two main issues for ZnFe2O4. In this
   study, we first designed conductive PANI layer coated hollow ZnFe2O4
   nanospheres by micro emulsion polymerization. Two strategies of hollow
   structure and PANI coating were attempted to relieve expansion and
   increase conductivity. The results show that the as-designed hollow

Title = {{MRBrainS Challenge: Online Evaluation Framework for Brain Image
   Segmentation in 3T MRI Scans}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Many methods have been proposed for tissue segmentation in brain MRI
   scans. The multitude of methods proposed complicates the choice of one
   method above others. We have therefore established the MRBrainS online
   evaluation framework for evaluating (semi) automatic algorithms that
   segment gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid
   (CSF) on 3T brain MRI scans of elderly subjects (65-80 y). Participants
   apply their algorithms to the provided data, after which their results
   are evaluated and ranked. Full manual segmentations of GM, WM, and CSF
   are available for all scans and used as the reference standard. Five
   datasets are provided for training and fifteen for testing. The
   evaluated methods are ranked based on their overall performance to
   segment GM, WM, and CSF and evaluated using three evaluation metrics
   (Dice, H95, and AVD) and the results are published on the MRBrainS13
   website. We present the results of eleven segmentation algorithms that
   participated in the MRBrainS13 challenge workshop at MICCAI, where the
   framework was launched, and three commonly used freeware packages:
   FreeSurfer, FSL, and SPM. The MRBrainS evaluation framework provides an
   objective and direct comparison of all evaluated algorithms and can aid
   in selecting the best performing method for the segmentation goal at
   hand.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received increasing attention for
   applications in large-scale energy storage systems due to their low
   cost, high energy density, and high abundance of the sodium element.
   Nanosizing electrode materials becomes a key strategy to overcome the
   problems resulting from the sluggish kinetics of large sodium ions,
   thereby achieving good performance in SIBs. Herein, we developed an
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach for atomically precise
   fabrication of sodium titanate anode materials. This ALD process shows
   excellent controllability over the growth rate, film thickness,
   composition of sodium titanates, and high flexibility of coating uniform
   sodium titanate films onto various dimensions of substrates. Moreover,
   the amorphous sodium titanate deposited on carbon nanotubes exhibits
   high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra-long
   cycling life (similar to 100 mA h g(-1) after 3500 cycles). It is
   expected that the ALD approach developed herein can be extended to
   well-defined fabrication of other sodium-containing electrode materials
   for SIBs.}},

   investigate the reaction and capacity fade mechanism of
   LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 electrode with high cutoff voltage 3.0-4.5 V and
   high working temperature 55 degrees C. It was found that the phase
   transformation and the Li-Ni site exchange in lattice at high voltage
   (>4.3 V) acted on charge transfer process were the main reasons of
   capacity fading with the cutoff voltage of 3.5-4.5 V. The degradation of
   LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode with high-temperature was mainly associated
   with the strong catalytic activity of Ni4+ which can cause the side
   reaction between electrode and electrolyte to form unstable SEI film as
   well as the acceleration of phase transformation on the surface of
   electrode with high electrode polarization potential. Furthermore, it
   was found that improving the performance of SEI film should be one of
   the most important methods for improving the cycling performance of

Abstract = {{Pre-term neonates born with a low birth weight (< 1500g) are at
   increased risk for developing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). 3D
   ultrasound (US) imaging has been used to quantitatively monitor the
   ventricular volume in IVH neonates, instead of typical 2D US used
   clinically, which relies on linear measurements from a single slice and
   visually estimates to determine ventricular dilation. To translate 3D US
   imaging into clinical setting, an accurate segmentation algorithm would
   be desirable to automatically extract the ventricular system from 3D US
   images. In this paper, we propose an automatic multi-region segmentation
   approach for delineating lateral ventricles of pre-term neonates from 3D
   US images, which makes use of multi-phase geodesic level-sets (MP-GLS)
   segmentation technique via a variational region competition principle
   and a spatial shape prior derived from pre-segmented atlases.
   Experimental results using 15 IVH patient images show that the proposed
   GPU-implemented approach is accurate in terms of the Dice similarity
   coefficient (DSC), the mean absolute surface distance (MAD), and maximum
   absolute surface distance (MAXD). To the best of our knowledge, this
   paper reports the first study on automatic segmentation of ventricular
   system of premature neonatal brains from 3D US images.}},

Abstract = {{Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of brain injury in
   preterm neonates and leads to dilatation of the ventricles. Measuring
   ventricular volume quantitatively is an important step in monitoring
   patients and evaluating treatment options. 3D ultrasound (US) has been
   developed to monitor ventricle volume as a biomarker for ventricular
   dilatation and deformation. Ventricle volume as a global indicator,
   however, does not allow for the precise analysis of local ventricular
   changes. In this work, we propose a 3D+t spatial-temporal nonlinear
   registration approach, which is used to analyze the detailed local
   changes of the ventricles of preterm IVH neonates from 3D US images. In
   particular, a novel sequential convex/dual optimization is introduced to
   extract the optimal 3D+t spatial-temporal deformable registration. The
   experiments with five patients with 4 time-point images for each patient
   showed that the proposed registration approach accurately and
   efficiently recovered the longitudinal deformation of the ventricles
   from 3D US images. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the
   first study on the longitudinal analysis of the ventriclar system of
   pre-term newborn brains from 3D US images.}},

Abstract = {{The charge on a liquid droplet is a critical parameter that needs to be
   determined to accurately predict the behaviour of the droplet in many
   electrostatic applications, for example, electrostatic painting and
   ink-jet printing. The charge depends on many factors, such as the liquid
   conductivity, droplet and ligament radii, ligament length, droplet
   shape, electric field intensity, space charge, the presence of adjacent
   ligaments and previously formed droplets. In this paper, a 2D
   axisymmetric model is presented which can be used to predict the
   electric charge on a conductive spherical droplet ejected from a single
   ligament directly supplied with high voltage. It was found that the
   droplet charging levels for the case of isolated electrified ligaments
   are as much as 60 times higher than that in the case of ligaments
   connected to a planar high voltage electrode. It is suggested that
   practical atomization systems lie somewhere between these two extremes
   and that a better model was achieved by developing a 3D approximation of
   a linear array of ligaments connected to an electrode having variable
   width. The effect on droplet charge and its radius was estimated for
   several cases of different boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) has been considered as a potential candidate for
   addressing the spectrum scarcity problem of future wireless networks.
   Since its conception, several researchers, academic institutions,
   industries, and regulatory and standardization bodies have put their
   significant efforts toward the realization of CR technology. However, as
   this technology adapts its transmission based on the surrounding radio
   environment, several practical issues may need to be considered. In
   practice, several imperfections, such as noise uncertainty,
   channel/interference uncertainty, transceiver hardware imperfections,
   signal uncertainty, and synchronization issues, may severely deteriorate
   the performance of a CR system. To this end, the investigation of
   realistic solutions toward combating various practical imperfections is
   very important for the successful implementation of cognitive
   technology. In this direction, first, this survey paper provides an
   overview of the enabling techniques for CR communications. Subsequently,
   it discusses the main imperfections that may occur in the most widely
   used CR paradigms and then reviews the existing approaches toward
   addressing these imperfections. Finally, it provides some interesting
   open research issues.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-assemblies prepared from glycosylated macromolecules are promising
   systems for modulating or mimicking the interactions between natural

   dendrons bearing focal point alkynes and peripheral C-linked

   poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) to afford synthetic
   linear-dendritic glycopolypeptides. Both the dendrimer generation and

   amphiphiles with hydrophilic mass fractions ranging from 0.07 to 0.54.
   The self-assembly of the copolymers in water using a solvent exchange
   method was optimized and studied in detail. While the linear-dendritic
   copolymers composed of lower generation dendrons tended to aggregate, a
   copolymer composed of a 4th generation galactose-functionalized dendron
   and PBLG with a degree of polymerization of 28 formed micellar

Abstract = {{We solve an open problem, stated in 2008, about the feasibility of
   designing efficient algorithmic self-assembling systems which produce
   2-dimensional colored patterns. More precisely, we show that the problem
   of finding the smallest tile assembly system which will self-assemble an
   input pattern with 2 colors (i.e., 2-Pats) is NP-hard. One crucial lemma
   makes use of a computer-assisted proof, which is a relatively novel but
   increasingly utilized paradigm for deriving proofs for complex
   mathematical problems. This tool is especially powerful for attacking
   combinatorial problems, as exemplified by the proof for the four color
   theorem and the recent important advance on the Erdos discrepancy
   problem using computer programs. In this paper, these techniques will be
   brought to a new order of magnitude, computational tasks corresponding
   to one CPU-year. We massively parallelize our program, and provide a
   full proof of its correctness. Its source code is freely available

   polylactic acid/cellulose nanofiber composites}},
Journal = {{RSC Advances}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{111}},
Pages = {{91544-91557}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous polylactic acid (PLA)/cellulose nanofiber (CNF) composites
   were prepared using the solution casting method. We investigated the
   effects of the CNFs on the PLA's rheological and thermal properties and
   on its foaming behavior. The rheological measurements showed that the
   incorporated CNFs substantially increased the PLA's viscosity in a low
   frequency range. This was attributed to both the interaction between the
   PLA molecular chains and the CNFs and the entanglement of CNFs. A batch
   foaming visualization system showed that the CNFs were effective
   cell-nucleating agents, and that they suppressed cell coalescence during
   the foaming process. In solid-state batch foaming processes, the
   addition of CNFs led to higher cell densities and decreased cell sizes
   in the composite foams. As the CNF content was increased, the
   cell-nucleating power and the resultant cell density increased. The cell
   sizes became more uniform. The improved foam morphology was also
   attributed to the CO2- and the CNF-induced crystallization during the
   gas-saturation and foaming processes. Thermal and wide angle X-ray
   diffraction (WAXD) analyses showed that the presence of CNFs and CO2
   enhanced the PLA's crystallization kinetics. An amorphous grade of PLA
   with a 12\% D-content developed a high crystallinity of 21\% after CO2
   gas saturation. The formed crystals, especially those around the CNFs,
   promoted cell nucleation by local stress variations that were generated
   in the surrounding area. The crystals and CNFs also increased the PLA's
   viscosity, which restricted cell growth and reduced cell coalescence. On
   the other hand, due to increased stiffness, an excessive CNF content
   suppressed foaming.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of the smartphone market and its increasing revenue has
   motivated developers to target multiple platforms. Market leaders, such
   as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, develop their smartphone applications
   complying with their platform specifications. The specification of each
   platform makes a platform-dedicated application incompatible with other
   platforms due to the diversity of operating systems, programming
   languages, and design patterns. Conventional development methodologies
   are applied to smartphone applications, yet they perform less well.
   Smartphone applications have unique hardware and software requirements.
   All previous factors push smartphone developers to build less
   sophisticated and low-quality products when targeting multiple
   smartphone platforms. Model-driven development have been considered to
   generate smartphone applications from abstract models to alleviate
   smartphones platform fragmentation. Reusing these abstract models for
   other platforms was not considered because they do not fit new platforms
   requirements. It is possible that defining smartphone applications using
   a portability-driven modeling notation would facilitate smartphone
   developers to understand better their applications to be ported to other
   platforms. We call for a portability-driven modeling notation to be used
   within a smartphone development process. Our in-process research work
   will be manifested through the application of a domain-specific language
   complying with the three software portability principles and three
   design factors. This paper aims to highlight our research work,
   methodology and current statue.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) have emerged as promising electrode
   material for electrochemical sensing applications because of their high
   conductivity, large surface-to-volume ratio, biocompatibility, and low
   cost. However, GNP are not soluble in water. We dispersed GNP in water
   with the assistance of a tri-azo dye, Direct Blue 71 (DB). Thin films
   prepared with GNP/DB dispersions were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectroscopy, which
   indicated the binding of DB with GNP films. A GNP/DB film coated glassy
   carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited high electrocatalytic activity to
   oxidation of bisphenol A (BPA) and reduction of hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2). The GNP/DB film greatly enhanced the BPA oxidation peak current
   at +524 mV, and the H2O2 reduction peak current at -400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl
   in pH 7.0 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The oxidation peak
   current was proportional to the BPA concentration from 10 nM to 100 nM
   and 100 nM to 25 mu M, with a limit of detection of 1.23 nM. The
   GNP/DB-modified GCE also showed a remarkable decrease of over-potential
   for the reduction of H2O2 with a fast amperometric response of less than
   2 s, a good linear range of 10 mu M to 1.9 mM, and a high sensitivity of
   57.6 mu A mM(-1). The fabricated sensor shows good reproducibility and
   stability with limited interference. Furthermore, the sensor was
   successfully applied to determine BPA in spiked commercial milk and

Abstract = {{In order to prevent the metal-sulfide film from falling off a substrate
   during in situ preparation, a solvent-free element-direct reaction was
   developed. To exploit this new strategy, lead sulfide (PbS) film was
   selected to grow on Indium-Tin-Oxide-coated glass (ITO/glass) at 150
   degrees C. The prepared PbS film exhibited outstanding adhesion on the
   substrate according to the tape test results. The analyses of X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the PbS film possessed good
   crystallinity and nearly balanced stoichiometry. In addition, the
   prepared PbS film exhibited intensive blue-shifted interband absorption.
   Moreover, photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements illustrated that it
   possessed great photosensitivity and n-type conductivity. Other
   important properties such as crystal structure, film thickness,
   current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, surface roughness and topography
   were studied in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete walls are commonly used to resist lateral loads. Their
   relatively high stiffness limits the inter-story drifts and minimizes
   damage to other structural and nonstructural elements. However,
   significant structural damage to the walls is expected during seismic
   events. This study investigates numerically the effectiveness of using
   Superelastic (SE) Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) bars to improve the seismic
   performance of moderate and squat concrete walls. The used analytical
   model was validated using experimental results by others. It was then
   utilized to investigate the cyclic load-displacement response of
   one-intermediate and two-squat walls while incorporating SMA bars.
   Results of this study led to identifying the location of SMA bars that
   result in best seismic performance.}},

Abstract = {{The necessity to rehabilitate a Reinforced Concrete (RC) structure
   emerges from several reasons such as new safety requirements, change of
   structure occupancy, incorrect design calculations and/or degradation of
   materials with time. One of the most commonly used mitigation practices
   to strengthen and repair RC beams is the application of RC jackets at
   either one side or three sides of the beams. The use of these jackets to
   improve the flexural performance of RC beams is investigated in this
   study. An iterative incremental algorithm that takes into account the
   influence of slip along the interface between the old and new concrete
   layers is developed. In addition, the distribution of interfacial strain
   gradient, slip and shear stresses along the interface are predicted. A
   very good agreement is shown between the current proposed analytical
   model and the published experimental data on RC jacketed beams. Based on
   an extensive parametric study, effective flexural modification factors
   of these beams are developed and verified.}},

   MID at collapse, evaluates the effect of vertical seismic component and
   identifies the critical floors. A ten storey SMRF was considered as a
   case study. Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was conducted using five
   different ground motions considering both the horizontal and vertical
   components. It was observed that the storey experiencing the MID is not
   always the severely damaged storey. The vertical seismic component
   significantly increased the column axial forces and the vertical
   deformations of the beams, and, thus increased the state of seismic
   damage in the frame. The effect of the vertical seismic component on the

Abstract = {{Basin classification rests on a plate tectonic foundation, highlighting
   lithospheric substrate, proximity to plate margin and relative motion of
   the nearest plate boundary. Major mechanisms for regional subsidence and
   uplift are subdivided into isostatic, flexural and dynamic groups.
   Basin-forming mechanisms and basin types do not exhibit simple
   cause-and-effect relationships, but rather reflect a matrix-type
   relationship. Different basin types have different spans of existence,
   with generally shorter life spans related to more tectonically active
   settings. Many `polyhistory' basins, composed of two or more
   megasequences, reflect a long evolution dominated by different
   basin-forming and basin-modifying mechanisms. The supercontinent cycle
   is marked by distinct sets of basin types, developed during successive
   phases of the cycle. Major classification schemes are reviewed briefly,
   before surveying the range of basin types represented in the Proterozoic
   of several key cratonic areas. Basins examined encompass almost the
   entire Neoarchaean-Neoproterozoic period. All of these basins have a
   relatively long history of preservation, which can be tied to the
   essentially continental character of their basement rocks and
   concomitant enhanced `survivability'. Their preservation thus underlines
   the longevity and inherent stability of the continental lithosphere. The
   distinction between basin occurrence over geological time and
   preferential preservation is important when viewing the geological
   record.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of wind tunnel and climatological data for estimating design
   wind effects: A copula based approach}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{8-17}},
Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of design wind effects on tall buildings is critical
   to ensure adequate margin of safety against lateral wind loads with a
   reasonable cost. Design wind effects on tall buildings are estimated by
   combining aerodynamic data obtained from wind tunnel tests with the
   climatological or wind speed data of the construction site. Though it is
   widely agreed that the aerodynamic data obtained from wind tunnel tests
   is fairly reliable, the various approaches used to synthesize
   aerodynamic and climatological data are often argued to have
   shortcomings. For instance, the uncertainty in modeling the correlation
   effect between sectorial responses has always been a challenge in the
   sector-by-sector synthesis approach. This paper presents a new copula
   based approach for modeling this correlation effect between sectorial
   responses. In addition, the proposed approach is used to assess the
   uncertainties in assuming sectorial responses to be perfectly dependent
   or independent while using the sector-by-sector approach. Results of the
   study showed that a copula based approach can be used for accurate
   modeling of the correlation effect between sectorial responses. It was
   also noted that assuming sectorial responses to be perfectly dependent
   or independent could result in underestimation or overestimation of
   design wind effects respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new form of computation is being evolved to include massive number of
   diverse set of conventional computing systems, sensors, devices,
   equipments, software and information services and apps. This new form of
   computing environment is known as the ``Internet-of-Things{''} (IoT).
   The adoption of IoT is fast and the ``things{''} are becoming integral
   part of people day-to-day life as well as essential elements in the
   businesses everyday activities and processes. Open characteristics of
   IoT environments raises privacy concern as ``things{''} are autonomous
   with some degree of authority to sharing their capabilities and
   knowledge to fulfil their individual or collective tasks. As such
   privacy becomes central and an inherit computational aspect of the
   ``things{''}. The work presented here is based on modelling IoT as
   Cooperative Distributed Systems (CDS). It proposes a novel approach of
   analysing and modelling privacy concepts and concerns. Privacy
   protection is captured as a form of ``sensitive information{''}
   management at the interaction level. A privacy protection management
   framework for CDS at the interaction level is proposed. The application
   of the framework has been demonstrated by extending Contract Net
   Protocol (CNP) to support privacy protection for CDS. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{Synthesizing polyacrylamide (PAM) inorganic nanocomposites with stable
   tethering and controlled polymer length has been elusive. Herein, we
   report on the synthesis of trithiocarbonates with several catechol end R
   groups (as anchors) that differ in their carbonyl alpha-substituents.
   These so-called adhesive RAFT agents were subsequently examined in batch
   RAFT polymerization of the acrylamide (AM) monomer to study their living
   characteristics. The catechol-end trithocarbonates (Dopa-CTAs) and
   catechol-end PAM structures (<= 46 kDa) were confirmed via 1D (H-1 and
   C-13) and 2D (gHSQC, gHMBC) NMR. Subsequent anchoring of the
   end-functionalized PAM (grafting to) via catechol induced linkage to
   gamma-alumina nanoparticles was successful, giving good correlation
   based on ATR-FTIR, DLS and TGA analyses. This unique methodology enables
   PAM-inorganic nanocomposites to be synthesized with stable tethering
   without significant rate retardation.}},

Abstract = {{Global fresh water resources are under increasing pressure from rapidly
   growing demands and changing climatic conditions. Wastewater reclamation
   is becoming an important alternative for sustainable water resources
   management and building climate change resiliency in many regions around
   the world. Public acceptance and trust of consumers in the quality of
   reclaimed water is considered by many to be the most important factor
   determining the outcomes of water reclamation projects. Knowledge of the
   urban water cycle and water reuse perceptions of student, faculty and
   staff at Western University were investigated. Results showed that
   members of the university community are more likely to accept reclaimed
   wastewater for applications that do not involve drinking or close
   personal contact. Knowledge of the urban water cycle and water resources
   in Canada is modest among the university community with a moderate (G =
   0.303, p< 0.05) positive relationship between `water knowledge' and
   `close contact acceptability'. The majority of the university community
   (75.8\%) thinks that reclaiming water to provide an alternate source of
   water in southwestern Ontario is a good idea, but there are still
   concerns about the presence of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals from
   reclaimed water and the long-term effects on human health from exposure
   to these contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 was adopted
   to enhance the cyclic stability of layered P2-type

   batteries (SIBs). Discharge capacities of approximately 120, 123, 113,
   and 105 mAhg(-1) were obtained for the pristine electrode and electrodes
   coated with 2, 5, and 10 ALD cycles, respectively. All electrodes were
   cycled at the 1C discharge current rate for voltages between 2 and 4.5 V
   in 1m NaClO4 electrolyte. Among the electrodes tested, the Al2O3 coating
   from 2 ALD cycles (MNC-2) exhibited the best electrochemical stability
   and rate capability, whereas the electrode coated by 10 ALD cycles
   MNC-10) displayed the highest columbic efficiency (CE), which exceeded
   97\% after 100 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical stability observed
   for ALD-coated electrodes could be a result of the protection effects
   and high band-gap energy (E-g= 9.00 eV) of the Al2O3 coating layer.
   Additionally, the metal-oxide coating provides structural stability
   against mechanical stresses occurring during the cycling process. The
   capacity, cyclic stability, and rate performance achieved for the MNC
   electrode coated with 2 ALD cycles of Al2O3 reveal the best results for
   SIBs. This study provides a promising route toward increasing the
   stability and CE of electrode materials for SIB application.}},

Journal = {{DALTON TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{15664-15670}},
Abstract = {{Air-sensitive and air-stable primary phosphines (RPH2) were compared for
   their ability to undergo photo-initiated phosphane-ene chemistry with
   1-hexene. Despite their increased air-stability, the primary phosphines
   displayed equal to or greater reactivity when compared to air-sensitive
   alkyl or aryl analogues. The phosphane-ene reaction was also performed
   in the presence of 1-octanethiol to determine whether thiol-ene and
   phosphane-ene chemistries could proceed simultaneously. It was
   determined that the phosphane-ene process takes precedence over
   thiol-ene as P-H bond conversion was independent of thiol concentration.
   Tertiary phosphine (R3P) and some secondary phosphine (R2PH) products
   were found to react with thiols under experimental conditions to create
   phosphine-sulfides (P-S), but this chemistry only proceeded at low P-H
   bond concentrations. These results suggests that hydrogen transfer
   reactions take precedence over P-S formation and demonstrate the unique
   relationship between phosphane-ene and thiol-ene chemistry.}},

Title = {{Unified voxel- and tensor-based morphometry (UVTBM) using registration

Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tensor-based morphometry (TBM) both
   rely on spatial normalization to a template and yet have different
   requirements for the level of registration accuracy. VBM requires only
   global alignment of brain structures, with limited degrees of freedom in
   transformation, whereas TBM performs best when the registration is
   highly deformable and can achieve higher registration accuracy. In
   addition, the registration accuracy varies over the whole brain, with
   higher accuracy typically observed in subcortical areas and lower
   accuracy seen in cortical areas. Hence, even the determinant of Jacobian
   of registration maps is spatially varying in their accuracy, and
   combining these with VBM by direct multiplication introduces errors in
   VBM maps where the registration is inaccurate. We propose a unified
   approach to combining these 2 morphometry methods that is motivated by
   these differing requirements for registration and our interest in
   harnessing the advantages of both. Our novel method uses local estimates
   of registration confidence to determine how to weight the influence of
   VBM-and TBM-like approaches. Results are shown on healthy and mild
   Alzheimer's subjects (N = 150) investigating age and group differences,
   and potential of differential diagnosis is shown on a set of Alzheimer's
   disease (N = 34) and frontotemporal dementia (N = 30) patients compared
   against controls (N = 14). These show that the group differences
   detected by our proposed approach are more descriptive than those
   detected from VBM, Jacobian-modulated VBM, and TBM separately, hence
   leveraging the advantages of both approaches in a unified framework. (C)

Abstract = {{Clinical symptoms of diabetic retinopathy are not detectable until
   damage to the retina reaches an irreversible stage, at least by today's
   treatment standards. As a result, there is a push to develop new,
   ``sub-clinical{''} methods of predicting the onset of diabetic
   retinopathy before the onset of irreversible damage. With diabetic
   retinopathy being associated with the accumulation of long-term mild
   damage to the retinal vasculature, retinal blood vessel permeability has
   been proposed as a key parameter for detecting preclinical stages of
   retinopathy. In this study, a kinetic modeling approach used to quantify
   vascular permeability in dynamic contrast-enhanced medical imaging was
   evaluated in noise simulations and then applied to retinal
   videoangiography data in a diabetic rat for the first time to determine
   the potential for this approach to be employed clinically as an early
   indicator of diabetic retinopathy. Experimental levels of noise were
   found to introduce errors of less than 15\% in estimates of blood flow
   and extraction fraction (a marker of vascular permeability), and fitting
   of rat retinal fluorescein angiography data provided stable maps of both
   parameters.}},

Title = {{Supercritical CO2 synthesized TiO2 nanowires covalently linked with
   core-shell CdS-ZnS quantum dots: enhanced photocatalysis and stability}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) sensitized onto nano TiO2 as
   heterogeneous photocatalysts have drawn considerable interest over the
   past few years. However, stability of the QDs attached to TiO2 and
   consistent photocatalysis are still major challenges of this approach.
   We describe herein, a facile process to fabricate nanocomposites from
   porous TiO2 nanowires and bare CdS and core-shell CdS-ZnS QDs, where the
   QD particles are linked covalently to the titania surface through a
   bifunctional organic linker, mercapto propionic acid (MPA). A thin layer
   of ZnS was grown on 6 nm CdS QDs to restrain the photocorrosion and
   passivate the trap states, enhancing the photoluminescence and quantum
   yield. The bifunctional linking molecule, MPA, was found to effectively
   disperse and stabilize the QD nanoparticles. The photocatalytic
   activities of the prepared catalysts were evaluated under ultraviolet
   and visible light solar irradiation for the photodegradation of
   methylene blue (MB), an organic dye. The decomposition rate of MB was
   enhanced as follows: CdSZnS-MPA-TiO2 > CdS-MPA-TiO2 > CdSZnS-TiO2 >
   CdS-TiO2 > TiO2 > P25. A maximum photodegradation efficiency of MB dye
   (similar to 88\%) was obtained by core-shell CdS-ZnS QDs linked with
   nano TiO2. After 3 cycling tests of degradation, the loss of
   photoactivity was significantly minimized (from 68\% to 10\%) by
   CdSZnS-MPA-TiO2 compared to CdSZnS-TiO2 (by direct deposition).}},

Abstract = {{Flexoelectricity is referred as an instantaneous polarization of
   dielectrics in response to non-uniform strains or strain gradients. Due
   to the fact that strain gradients are inversely proportional to the
   feature size of structures, the flexoelectricity is believed to be
   significant at the nano-scale. Based on the extended linear
   piezoelectricity theory, this work attempts to investigate the
   flexoelectric effect upon the electromechanical coupling of a
   piezoelectric nanoplate by developing a modified Kirchhoff plate model.
   Simulation results on the electroelastic fields indicate that the
   flexoelectric effect is size-dependent, which is more prominent for
   thinner plates with smaller thickness. It is also observed that the
   effect of the flexoelectricity upon the electromechanical coupling of
   the piezoelectric nanoplate is sensitive to the applied electric
   voltage. This study aims to establish a further understanding of the
   flexoelectric effect on the electromechanical coupling of piezoelectric
   nanomaterials, thus provide guidance for the design and applications of
   piezoelectric nanostructures.}},

Title = {{Reliability analysis of concrete deck overlays}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{30-38}},
Abstract = {{Bridge decks are subjected to deterioration due to chloride ingress or
   other factors. Concrete overlays are used to replace the unsound
   concrete or to extend the life span of new concrete bridge decks.
   Overlay shrinkage is restrained by the substrate beneath leading to
   premature ingress of chlorides, corroding the steel reinforcement and
   producing delamination or spall of the concrete. This investigation
   quantifies the probability of the overlay cracking using mechanical
   strains as the main random variable. The analytical prediction of the
   time-dependent mechanical strains considers shrinkage strains from
   diffusion theory, tensile creep strains and the principle of
   superposition. Different overlay thicknesses, two types of substrates
   (concrete slabs and composite steel beams), and the impact of either not
   having or applying a water-proofing membrane are considered. Statistical
   parameters are computed from testing by others and testing conducted at
   Western University in Canada. Latin Hypercube sampling and Monte Carlo
   simulation is used to compute the probability of cracking. Analysis is
   performed for a fifty year lifetime of the overlay. Probability curves
   in time are presented and some recommendations about inspections are
   provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The ZnO and CaF2 show independent emission. The ZnO bandgap emission at

   alginate concentration on the nanoparticle characteristics of particle
   diameter, zeta potential, and particle size distribution. The
   encapsulation and controlled release of BSA from chitosan nanoparticles
   was also evaluated. The encapsulation of BSA was used as a model system
   for the controlled drug delivery from composite nanoparticles. The
   release profile indicated an initial burst in the first few hours of the
   trial, followed by a slower steady release over time. According to

Abstract = {{The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of an x-ray detector, expressed
   as a function of spatial frequency, describes the ability to produce
   high-quality images relative to an ideal detector. While the DQE
   normally decreases substantially with increasing frequency, we describe
   an approach that can be used to improve the DQE response by increasing
   the DQE at high spatial frequencies. The approach makes use of an
   apodized-aperture pixel (AAP) design that requires use of a
   high-resolution x-ray converter such as selenium coupled to a sensor
   array with very small physical sensor elements, such as CMOS sensors.
   While sensors with elements of 10 - 25 mu m are too small for most
   practical applications in medical radiography, we describe how larger
   image pixels of a practical size can be synthesized to provide a better
   DQE than simple binning or using physical pixels of the same size. A
   theoretical cascaded-systems analysis shows the DQE at the image
   sampling cut-off frequency can be improved by up to a factor of 2.5x.
   The AAP approach was validated experimentally using a CMOS/CsI-based
   detector having 0.05-mm sensor elements. Using AAP images with 0.2-mm
   pixels, the high-frequency DQE value was increased from 0.2 to 0.4
   compared to simple 4x4 binning. It is concluded that
   ultra-high-resolution sensors can be used to optimize the high-frequency
   performance of x-ray detectors and make substantial improvements in
   image quality for visualization of small stuctures and fine image detail
   in comparison to current imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel sandwich-style single-shot (single-kV)
   detector by stacking two indirect-conversion flat-panel detectors for
   preclinical mouse imaging. In the sandwich detector structure, extra
   noise due to the direct x-ray absorption in photodiode arrays is
   inevitable. We develop a simple cascaded linear-systems model to
   describe signal and noise propagation in the flat-panel sandwich
   detector considering direct x-ray interactions. The noise-power spectrum
   (NPS) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) obtained from the front and
   rear detectors are analyzed by using the cascaded-systems model. The NPS
   induced by the absorption of direct x-ray photons that are unattenuated
   within the photodiode layers is white in the spatial-frequency domain
   like the additive readout noise characteristic; hence that is harmful to
   the DQE at higher spatial frequencies at which the number of secondary
   quanta lessens. The model developed in this study will be useful for
   determining the optimal imaging techniques with sandwich detectors and
   their optimal design.}},

Abstract = {{Fault-tolerant controllers (Fits) have recently gained considerable
   attention due to their important role in maintaining the safety of
   modern technological systems via configured redundancy. The basis of a
   FTC through an analysis of the requirements of safety-critical systems
   is introduced in this paper. The development of passive FTC approaches,
   including their advantages and disadvantages, is discussed based on
   safety requirements. Closely associated with the safety-relevant issues,
   recent progress in active FTC design methodologies is reviewed in the
   sequence of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), reconfigurable
   controls, and integration of FDD and reconfiguration. In summary, it is
   the view of this paper that addressing safety issues is the key to
   further development of FTCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A combined spectral-amplitude-perturbation approach for systematic mode
   selection in thermal convection}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{782-802}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The post-critical convective state for Rayleigh-Benard (RB)
   convection is studied using a nonlinear spectral-amplitude-perturbation
   approach in a fluid layer heated from below. The paper aims to discuss
   these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the spectral method the flow and
   temperature fields are expanded periodically along the layer and
   orthonormal shape functions are used in the transverse direction. A
   combined amplitude-perturbation approach is developed to solve the
   nonlinear spectral system in the post-critical range, even far from the
   linear stability threshold. Also, to leading order, the Lorenz model is
   recovered.
   Findings - It is found that very small Prandtl numbers (Pro0.1) can
   change the Nusselt number, when terms to O(epsilon(5/2)) and higher are
   considered. However, to lower orders the Prandtl number does not affect
   the results. Variation of the Nusselt number to different orders is
   found to be highly consistent. Comparison with experimental results is
   made and a very good qualitative agreement is observed, even far from
   the linear threshold.
   Originality/value - Unlike existing nonlinear formulations for RB
   thermal convection, the present combined spectral-perturbation approach
   provides a systematic method for mode selection. The number and type of
   modes to be included are directly related to the post-critical Rayleigh
   number. The method is not limited to the weakly nonlinear range.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Durability is one of the key remaining challenges to widespread adoption
   of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The durability and
   continued high performance of a PEMFC using carbon supported catalysts
   is highly dependent on the stability of the carbon support. Presently,
   there are a multitude of accelerated stress test (AST) protocols using
   rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry to study the corrosion of
   carbon catalyst support materials, though it remains unclear whether all
   of these tests provide meaningful reproduction of in-situ membrane
   electrode assembly (MEA) test results. We evaluate two carbon corrosion
   ASTs and compare results to MEA data for three well known carbon
   supported catalysts. Physical characterization of each carbon type by
   gas sorption, XRD, and Raman, is used to elucidate the observed trends
   in corrosion resistance and the effects of testing temperature, scan
   rate, and upper potential limit are examined. We find that AST results
   are highly dependent on temperature and total testing time, concluding
   that the first protocol is only valid at 60 degrees C, while the second
   accurately represents MEA data. This study highlights the importance of
   different RDE AST parameters when developing ASTs that correlate with
   in-situ MBA testing. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{Rationale: Fourier-decomposition of free-breathing pulmonary magnetic
   resonance imaging (FDMRI) was recently piloted as a way to provide rapid
   quantitative pulmonary maps of ventilation and perfusion without the use
   of exogenous contrast agents. This method exploits fast pulmonary MRI
   acquisition of free-breathing proton (H-1) pulmonary images and
   non-rigid registration to compensate for changes in position and shape
   of the thorax associated with breathing. In this way, ventilation
   imaging using conventional MRI systems can be undertaken but there has
   been no systematic evaluation of fundamental image quality measurements
   based on linear systems theory.
   Objectives: We investigated the performance of free-breathing pulmonary
   ventilation imaging using a Fourier-based linear system description of
   each operation required to generate FDMRI ventilation maps.
   Methods: Twelve subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) or bronchiectasis underwent pulmonary function tests and MRI.
   Non-rigid registration was used to co-register the temporal series of
   pulmonary images. Pulmonary voxel intensities were aligned along a time
   axis and discrete Fourier transforms were performed on the periodic
   signal intensity pattern to generate frequency spectra. We determined
   the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the FDMRI ventilation maps using a
   conventional approach (SNRC) and using the Fourier-based description
   (SNRF).
   Results: Mean SNR was 4.7 +/- 1.3 for subjects with bronchiectasis and
   3.4 +/- 1.8, for COPD subjects (p>.05). SNRF was significantly different
   than SNRC (p<.01).
   Conclusion: SNRF was approximately 50\% of SNRC suggesting that the
   linear system model well-estimates the current approach.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop and evaluate an automated registration and
   segmentation pipeline for regional lobar pulmonary structure-function
   measurements, using volume-matched thoracic CT and MRI in order to guide
   therapy.
   Methods: Ten subjects underwent pulmonary function tests and
   volume-matched H-1 and He-3 MRI and thoracic CT during a single 2 hr
   visit. CT was registered to H-1 MRI using an affine method that
   incorporated block-matching and this was followed by a deformable step
   using free-form deformation. The resultant deformation field was used to
   deform the associated CT lobe mask that was generated using commercial
   software. He-3-H-1 image registration used the same two-step
   registration method and He-3 ventilation was segmented using
   hierarchical k-means clustering. Whole lung and lobar He-3 ventilation
   and ventilation defect percent (VDP) were generated by mapping
   ventilation defects to CT-defined whole lung and lobe volumes. Target
   CT-He-3 registration accuracy was evaluated using region, surface
   distance-and volume-based metrics. Automated whole lung and lobar VDP
   was compared with semi-automated and manual results using paired
   t-tests.
   Results: The proposed pipeline yielded regional spatial agreement of
   88.0+/-0.9\% and surface distance error of 3.9+/-0.5 mm. Automated and
   manual whole lung and lobar ventilation and VDP were not significantly
   different and they were significantly correlated (r = 0.77, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The proposed automated pipeline can be used to generate
   regional pulmonary structural-functional maps with high accuracy and
   robustness, providing an important tool for image-guided pulmonary
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{It is clinically vital to devise a technique to evaluate regional
   functionality of the myocardium in order to determine the extent and
   intensity of local damage to the cardiac tissue caused by ischemic
   injuries. Such a technique can potentially enable cardiologists to
   discriminate between reversible and irreversible ischemic injuries and
   to devise appropriate revascularization therapy in case of reversible
   lesions. The technique is founded on the premise that sufficient
   contraction force generated by the cardiac tissue can be regarded as a
   direct and reliable criterion for regional analysis of tissue healthy
   functionality. To this end, a number of imaging techniques have been
   developed and, to our knowledge, none of them assess regional cardiac
   functionality based on a straightforward mechanical measure such as
   local cardiac contraction forces.. As such, a novel imaging technique is
   being developed on the basis of quantification and visualisation of
   local myocardial contraction forces. In this technique, cardiac
   contraction force distribution is attained through solving an inverse
   problem within an optimization framework which uses iterative forward
   mechanical modelling of the myocardium. Hence, a forward mechanical
   model of the myocardium which is computationally efficient, robust, and
   adaptable to diverse pathophysiological conditions is necessary for this
   development. As such, this paper is geared towards developing a novel
   mechanical model of the healthy and pathological myocardium which
   considers all aspects of the myocardial mechanics including
   hyperelasticity, anisotropy, and active contraction force. In this
   investigation, two major parts, including background tissue and
   reinforcement bars (fibers) have been considered for modelling the
   myocardium. The model was implemented using finite element (FE) approach
   and demonstrated very good performance in simulating normal and
   infarcted left ventricle (LV) contractile function.}},

Abstract = {{The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle which separates the thorax from the
   abdomen and it acts as the most important muscle of the respiratory
   system. As such, an accurate segmentation of the diaphragm, not only
   provides key information for functional analysis of the respiratory
   system, but also can be used for locating other abdominal organs such as
   the liver. However, diaphragm segmentation is extremely challenging in
   non-contrast CT images due to the diaphragm's similar appearance to
   other abdominal organs. In this paper, we present a fully automatic
   algorithm for diaphragm segmentation in non-contrast CT images. The
   method is mainly based on a priori knowledge about the human diaphragm
   anatomy. The diaphragm domes are in contact with the lungs and the heart
   while its circumference runs along the lumbar vertebrae of the spine as
   well as the inferior border of the ribs and sternum. As such, the
   diaphragm can be delineated by segmentation of these organs followed by
   connecting relevant parts of their outline properly. More specifically,
   the bottom surface of the lungs and heart, the spine borders and the
   ribs are delineated, leading to a set of scattered points which
   represent the diaphragm's geometry. Next, a B-spline filter is used to
   find the smoothest surface which pass through these points. This
   algorithm was tested on a non-contrast CT image of a lung cancer
   patient. The results indicate that there is an average Hausdorff
   distance of 2.96 mm between the automatic and manually segmented
   diaphragms which implies a favourable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Pulmonary x-ray computed tomography (CT) may be used to
   characterize emphysema and airways disease in patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). One analysis approach - parametric
   response mapping (PMR) utilizes registered inspiratory and expiratory CT
   image volumes and CT-density-histogram thresholds, but there is no
   consensus regarding the threshold values used, or their clinical
   meaning. Principal-component-analysis (PCA) of the CT density histogram
   can be exploited to quantify emphysema using data-driven
   CT-density-histogram thresholds. Thus, the objective of this
   proof-of-concept demonstration was to develop a PRM approach using
   PCA-derived thresholds in COPD patients and ex-smokers without airflow
   limitation.
   Methods: Fifteen COPD ex-smokers and 5 normal ex-smokers were evaluated.
   Thoracic CT images were also acquired at full inspiration and full
   expiration and these images were non-rigidly co-registered. PCA was
   performed for the CT density histograms, from which the components with
   the highest eigenvalues greater than one were summed. Since the values
   of the principal component curve correlate directly with the variability
   in the sample, the maximum and minimum points on the curve were used as
   threshold values for the PCA-adjusted PRM technique.
   Results: A significant correlation was determined between conventional
   and PCA-adjusted PRM with He-3 MRI apparent diffusion coefficient
   (p<0.001), with CT RA(950) (p<0.0001), as well as with He-3 MRI
   ventilation defect percent, a measurement of both small airways disease
   (p=0.049 and p=0.06, respectively) and emphysema (p=0.02).
   Conclusions: PRM generated using PCA thresholds of the CT density
   histogram showed significant correlations with CT and He-3 MRI
   measurements of emphysema, but not airways disease.}},

Abstract = {{A non-rigid registration method is presented for the alignment of
   pre-procedural magnetic resonance (MR) images with delineated suspicious
   regions to intra-procedural 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images in
   TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. In the first step, 3D MR and TRUS images
   are aligned rigidly using six pairs of manually identified approximate
   matching points on the boundary of the prostate. Then, two image volumes
   are non-rigidly registered using a finite element method (FEM)-based
   linear elastic deformation model. A vector of observation prediction
   errors at some points of interest within the prostate volume is computed
   using an intensity-based similarity metric called the modality
   independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND). The error vector is employed
   in a classical state estimation framework to estimate prostate
   deformation between MR and TRUS images. The points of interests are
   identified using speeded-up robust features (SURF) that are scale and
   rotation-invariant descriptors in MR images. The proposed registration
   method on 10 sets of prostate MR and TRUS images yielded a target
   registration error of 1.99 +/- 0.83 mm, and 1.97 +/- 0.87 mm in the
   peripheral zone (PZ) and whole gland (WG), respectively, using 68
   manually-identified fiducial points. The Dice similarity coefficient
   (DSC) was 87.9 +/- 2.9, 82.3 +/- 4.8, 93.0 +/- 1.7, and 84.2 +/- 6.2
   percent for the WG, apex, mid-gland and base of the prostate,
   respectively. Moreover, the mean absolute distances (MAD) between the WG
   surfaces in the TRUS and registered MR images was 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm.
   Registration results indicate effectiveness of the proposed method in
   improving the targeting accuracy in the TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.}},

Abstract = {{Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or bleed within the brain is a common
   condition among pre-term infants that occurs in very low birth weight
   preterm neonates. The prognosis is further worsened by the development
   of progressive ventricular dilatation, i.e., post-hemorrhagic ventricle
   dilation (PHVD), which occurs in 10-30\% of IVH patients. In practice,
   predicting PHVD accurately and determining if that specific patient with
   ventricular dilatation requires the ability to measure accurately
   ventricular volume. While monitoring of PHVD in infants is typically
   done by repeated US and not MRI, once the patient has been treated, the
   follow-up over the lifetime of the patient is done by MRI. While manual
   segmentation is still seen as a gold standard, it is extremely time
   consuming, and therefore not feasible in a clinical context, and it also
   has a large inter-and intra-observer variability. This paper proposes an
   segmentation algorithm to extract the cerebral ventricles from 3D
   T1-weighted MR images of pre-term infants with PHVD. The proposed
   segmentation algorithm makes use of the convex optimization technique
   combined with the learned priors of image intensities and label
   probabilistic map, which is built from a multi-atlas registration
   scheme. The leave-one-out cross validation using 7 PHVD patient T1
   weighted MR images showed that the proposed method yielded a mean DSC of
   89.7\% +/- 4.2\%, a MAD of 2.6 +/- 1.1 mm, a MAXD of 17.8 +/- 6.2 mm,
   and a VD of 11.6\% +/- 5.9\%, suggesting a good agreement with manual
   segmentations.}},

Abstract = {{Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of brain injury in
   preterm neonates. Quantitative measurement of ventricular dilation or
   shrinkage is important for monitoring patients and in evaluation of
   treatment options. 3D ultrasound (US) has been used to monitor the
   ventricle volume as a biomarker for ventricular dilation. However,
   volumetric quantification does not provide information as to where
   dilation occurs. The location where dilation occurs may be related to
   specific neurological problems later in life. For example, posterior
   horn enlargement, with thinning of the corpus callosum and parietal
   white matter fibres, could be linked to poor visuo-spatial abilities
   seen in hydrocephalic children. In this work, we report on the
   development and application of a method used to analyze local surface
   change of the ventricles of preterm neonates with IVH from 3D US images.
   The technique is evaluated using manual segmentations from 3D US images
   acquired in two imaging sessions. The surfaces from baseline and
   follow-up were registered and then matched on a point-by-point basis.
   The distance between each pair of corresponding points served as an
   estimate of local surface change of the brain ventricle at each vertex.
   The measurements of local surface change were then superimposed on the
   ventricle surface to produce the 3D local surface change map that
   provide information on the spatio-temporal dilation pattern of brain
   ventricles following IVH. This tool can be used to monitor responses to
   different treatment options, and may provide important information for
   elucidating the deficiencies a patient will have later in life.}},

   The sizes of the particles, as characterized by dynamic light scattering

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy and thermal ablation are relatively new approaches in
   robot-assisted minimally invasive interventions for treating malignant
   tumors. Ultrasound remains the most favored choice for imaging feedback,
   the benefits being cost effectiveness, radiation free, and easy access
   in an OR. However it does not generally provide high contrast, noise
   free images. Distortion occurs when the sound waves pass through a
   medium that contains air and/or when the target organ is deep within the
   body. The distorted images make it quite difficult to recognize and
   localize tumors and surgical tools. Often tools, such as a bevel-tipped
   needle, deflect from its path during insertion, making it difficult to
   detect the needle tip using a single perspective view. The shifting of
   the target due to cardiac and/or respiratory motion can add further
   errors in reaching the target. This paper describes a comprehensive
   system that uses robot dexterity to capture 2D ultrasound images in
   various pre-determined modes for generating 3D ultrasound images and
   assists in maneuvering a surgical tool. An interactive 3D virtual
   reality environment is developed that visualizes various artifacts
   present in the surgical site in real-time. The system helps to avoid
   image distortion by grabbing images from multiple positions and
   orientation to provide a 3D view. Using the methods developed for this
   application, an accuracy of 1 3 mm was achieved in target attainment in
   an in-vivo experiment subjected to tissue motion. An accuracy of 1.36 mm
   and 0.93 mm respectively was achieved for the ex-vivo experiments with
   and without external induced motion. An ablation monitor widget that
   visualizes the changes during the complete ablation process and enables
   evaluation of the process in its entirety is integrated.}},

Abstract = {{Lung Cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.
   Among various treatment methods currently being used in the clinic,
   External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) is used widely not only as the
   primary treatment method, but also in combination with chemotherapy and
   surgery. However, this method may lack desirable dosimetric accuracy
   because of respiration induced tumor motion. Recently, biomechanical
   modeling of the respiratory system has become a popular approach for
   tumor motion prediction and compensation. This approach requires
   reasonably accurate data pertaining to thoracic pressure variation,
   diaphragm position and biomechanical properties of the lung tissue in
   order to predict the lung tissue deformation and tumor motion. In this
   paper, we present preliminary results of an in vivo study obtained from
   a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the lung developed to predict tumor
   motion during respiration.}},

   often difficult to interpret as the tool will cause shadowing artifacts
   that occlude tissue near the target site. Here, we integrate ultrasound
   imaging directly into the NeoChord device. This provides an unobstructed
   imaging plane that can visualize the valve leaflets as they are engaged
   by the device and can aid in achieving both a proper bite and spacing
   between the neochordae implants. A proof of concept user study in a

Abstract = {{Cardiac valvular stenosis, prolapse and regurgitation are increasingly
   common conditions, particularly in an elderly population with limited
   potential for on-pump cardiac surgery. NeoChord (c), MitraClip (c) and
   numerous stent-based transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
   devices provide an alternative to intrusive cardiac operations;
   performed while the heart is beating, these procedures require surgeons
   and cardiologists to learn new imageguidance based techniques.
   Developing these visual aids and protocols is a challenging task that
   benefits from sophisticated simulators. Existing models lack features
   needed to simulate off-pump valvular procedures: functional, dynamic
   valves, apical and vascular access, and user flexibility for different
   activation patterns such as variable heart rates and rapid pacing. We
   present a left ventricle phantom with these characteristics. The phantom
   can be used to simulate valvular repair and replacement procedures with
   magnetic tracking, augmented reality, fluoroscopy and ultrasound
   guidance. This tool serves as a platform to develop image-guidance and
   image processing techniques required for a range of minimally invasive
   cardiac interventions. The phantom mimics in vivo mitral and aortic
   valve motion, permitting realistic ultrasound images of these components
   to be acquired. It also has a physiological realistic left ventricular
   ejection fraction of 50\%. Given its realistic imaging properties and
   non-biodegradable composition silicone for tissue, water for blood-the
   system promises to reduce the number of animal trials required to
   develop image guidance applications for valvular repair and replacement.
   The phantom has been used in validation studies for both TAVi
   image-guidance techniques', and image-based mitral valve tracking
   algorithms'.}},

Abstract = {{To further obtain high catalytic activity and durability of Pt catalysts
   for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we synthesized a robust Pt-on-ZrC
   nanocomposite catalyst by taking advantage of atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) to improve the strong metal-support interactions at the atomic
   level. X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) results show that
   ALD-Pt/ZrC catalysts show noticeable change in the electronic structure
   of Pt due to strong interactions with the ZrC support. Using
   electrochemical cycling to test durability, we found the ALD-Pt/ZrC
   nanocomposites to be roughly 5-fold and 3-fold more stable than
   commercial Pt/C and CW-Pt/ZrC (synthesized by a conventional chemical
   reduction method), respectively. The ALD-Pt/ZrC nanocomposite showed a
   mass activity of 0.122 A mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9 V (vs. RHE); much higher than
   those for Pt/C and CW-Pt/ZrC catalysts (0.074 and 0.041 A mg(Pt)(-1),
   respectively). After durability test, our novel catalyst also exhibited
   ORR activity 9 times greater than Pt/C. This approach, using ALD to grow
   the Pt catalyst directly, resulting in strong interactions, will aid the
   design of new active and stable catalysts for ORR or other chemical
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Surface and interface modifications of synthetic silicone hydrogels used
   for wearable and implantable medical devices, e.g. catheters and contact
   lenses, are critical to overcome their poor mechanical properties and
   biofouling. In this paper, silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) were
   incorporated within silicone hydrogels through photo-polymerization. As
   compared to the silicone hydrogel, the nanocomposited silicone hydrogel
   shows highly textured microstructures, increased swelling behaviour and
   improved stiffness. Meanwhile, a hydrophilic surface of silicone
   hydrogel is important to minimize protein fouling which forms a
   conditioning layer for the growth of bacterial biofilm. Here, we applied
   matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) with a pulsed Nd:YAG
   laser at 532 nm to deposit polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface of
   the nanocomposited silicone hydrogels. The PEG deposited on the
   nanocomposited silicone hydrogels forms islands at the submicron-scale,
   which increase with increasing irradiation time (t). The protein
   adsorption on nanocomposited silicone hydrogel with PEG deposition
   decreases over 40 +/- 2\% when t = 2 h. Compared to the commercial
   silicone catheters, the nanocomposited silicone hydrogel with PEG
   deposition can reduce the growth of bacteria from 1.20 x 10(6) CFU
   cm(-2) to 3.69 x 10(5) CFU cm(-2). In addition, the relative cell
   viabilities of NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells treated using the
   nanocomposited silicone hydrogels coated with/without PEG were studied.
   No toxic effect is imposed on the cells. Consequently, the MAPLE process
   is a controllable, contamination-free technique to modify the surface of
   silicone hydrogels. We expect that the nanocomposited silicone hydrogels
   with appropriate surface treatment can be applied in various wearable
   and implantable medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{The initial trial of methylthymol blue (MTB) as a chelator for ferric
   iron in Fricke gel dosimeters, used for three-dimensional (3D) dosimetry
   in cancer radiotherapy, is reported. MTB is a structural analogue of the
   conventionally used xylenol orange (XO); however, the absorbance
   spectrum of the ferric-MTB complex is shifted to higher wavelengths,
   which should allow for lower amount of light scattering during gel
   scanning. In this study, two gelatin substrates, two sources of XO and
   one source of MTB have been compared. The MTB-containing gels exhibited
   similar dose response and diffusion coefficient to the XO-containing
   gels at their wavelengths of maximum absorption (620 and 585 nm,
   respectively). In addition, the MTB gels gave an excellent dose response
   at 633 nm, which is an important wavelength that is already used with
   other 3D dosimeters.}},

Abstract = {{Rechargeable batteries can effectively store electrical energy as
   chemical energy, and release it when needed, providing a good choice for
   applications in electric vehicles (EVs). Naturally, safety concerns are
   the key issue for the application of battery technology in EVs. Olivine
   LiFePO4 is considered to be the most promising cathode material for
   lithium-ion batteries due to its environmental friendliness, high
   cycling performance and safety characteristics. Some important
   breakthroughs in recent years have allowed its successful
   commercialization. However, in spite of its success, the commercial
   application of LiFePO4 batteries in EVs is still hindered by some
   technological obstacles. Herein, we provide an update on our previous
   review, and overview the most significant advances in the remaining
   challenges for this promising battery material. New research directions
   and future trends have also been discussed.}},

Pages = {{2983-2992}},
Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs), as a recent transduction
   technology, harvest electrical energy by scavenging mechanical energy
   from diverse sources. Their performance is affected by various material
   properties and failure modes of the dielectric elastomers. This work
   presents a theoretical analysis on the performance of a dielectric
   elastomer membrane generator under equi-biaxial loading conditions. By
   comparing our simulation results with the experimental observations
   existing in the literature, this work considers the fatigue life of
   DE-based devices under cyclic loading for the first time. From the
   simulation results, it is concluded that the efficiency of the DEG can
   be improved by raising the deforming rate and the prescribed maximum
   stretch ratio, and applying an appropriate bias voltage. However, the
   fatigue life expectancy compromises the efficiency improvement of the
   DEG. With the consideration of the fatigue life, applying an appropriate
   bias voltage appears to be a more desirable way to improve the DEG
   performance. The general framework developed in this work is expected to
   provide an increased understanding on the energy harvesting mechanisms
   of the DEGs and benefit their optimal design.}},

Abstract = {{International events, economic changes, and the impacts of climate
   change will test the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin over the next
   five decades. The region's ability to effectively meet these challenges
   will require foresight, investment, and cooperation. As a contribution
   to this special issue, this paper presents one plausible 50-year
   scenario of the emergence of these challenges and the region's response
   to them. In it early signs of economic, environmental, and governmental
   vulnerability are not adequately addressed. Investments aren't made to
   provide needed funding for monitoring and evaluation. The region's
   intellectual and environmental capital isn't leveraged, limiting the
   region's ability to address its economic and environmental challenges
   and compete with the rest of the world. The pursuit of local
   self-interest and short-term survival outweighs cooperation across
   jurisdictions and long-term planning. The vision of the future presented
   here is one in which the region's economy is dependent on stagnant
   extractive industries, its ecosystems are compromised, and its global
   standing is greatly reduced. In response to all of these developments,
   by 2063 hopelessness and violent tension is spreading throughout the
   region's population. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{Envisioning possible futures is challenging due to the interactive and
   interdependent nature of myriad anthropogenic pressures on the Great
   Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. To overcome this challenge, we used the
   intuitive logistics method of scenario analysis and identified two
   independent forces of high impact and high uncertainty by engaging a
   broad spectrum of basin stakeholders from academia, government,
   non-governmental organizations, and industry organizations. A workshop
   was held to debate and identify the two key forces among many drivers of
   change for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. From the workshop
   activities, two key forces emerged. The first axis, ``Human Capacity for
   Change,{''} was characterized on its positive end by an adaptive system
   where shared values, collectivism, inclusivity, and a respect for
   obligations by all segments of society are a reality, and on its
   negative end by an individualistic, overly hierarchical, short sighted,
   reactionary, oppressive, and gridlocked governance system. The second
   axis, ``Environment and Economic Balance,{''} was characterized on its
   positive end by a thriving synergy between economy and environment, and
   on its negative end by an environment, economy, or both that were in
   poor shape. The intersection of these axes framed four alternative
   50-year projections, characterized by combinations of their positive
   and/or negative axis end points. These four alternate futures portrayed
   a basin that was: living on the edge (-/+); thriving and prosperous
   (+/+); trying hard to adapt (+/-); and out of control (-/-), and reveal
   policy and strategic research needs and policy recommendations to reach
   a thriving future. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{In this future, citizens of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin
   recognize their dependence upon and became united around a common vision
   for a thriving Great Lakes basin. However, in 2063 the environment and
   economy are out of balance; citizens are constantly forced to make
   difficult trade-offs. Climate warming, geopolitical pressures such as
   environmental refugees, an aging population, and a sluggish economy have
   overwhelmed the region's efforts to find a balance that would have
   ensured human prosperity without diminishing the integrity of the Great
   Lakes basin. This narrative illustrates the time period 2013 to 2063,
   depicting how the collision of multiple drivers of change cause
   declining social and environmental conditions, and force a gradual
   transformation in societal values. While society was initially
   complacent, the groundwork for social transformation was laid over three
   decades. Impacts of education programs, opposition to environmentally
   degrading natural resource extraction, and widespread effects of both
   failing social services and physical infrastructure galvanize grassroots
   mobilization of communities around ``iceless hockey rink{''} meetings.
   These meetings act as a catalyst, translating this social movement into
   governance that works towards a common vision based on shared values.
   However, despite innovative technologies and cohesive efforts, it
   becomes obvious that attempts to oppose the complex and interrelated
   forces driving changes in the Great Lakes region are limited. These
   efforts come at huge economic costs, and the harsh reality forces people
   in the region to make difficult decisions that threaten some facets of
   economic, social and environmental well-being while protecting others.

Abstract = {{In 2063, the Great Lakes-St Lawrence River basin is Living on the Edge
   of system resilience, characterized by poor governance yet good
   environmental/economic balance. The Great Lakes region benefits from and
   depends upon human choices and natural forces outside the region pushing
   and pulling it toward that balance. Choices within the basin are
   insufficient to maintain system resilience, and there is minimal
   government involvement in Great Lakes governance. The Great Lakes region
   perseveres like a pampered but powerless slave, contributing value but
   lacking liberty. The predominant drivers of change that have brought the
   basin to this perpetual knife's-edge existence of dependency are the
   global economy, societal values, and technological innovation. Climate
   change, energy, and demographics in turn drive those drivers on a global
   scale, but the region itself has evaded the most extreme climate-change
   impacts, which proved highly variable through space and time. Global
   changes in energy demand resulted in the most massive investment in
   green energy technology in planetary history, dramatically shifting the
   global demand for wind, solar, wave, and nuclear power. Coupled with
   aggressive pro-business North American policies and endemic
   private-sector intellectual capital, the Great Lakes region reemerged as
   an economic engine to serve the demand. This shift occurred despite the
   death of cooperative federalism and after decades of ideological
   politics gutted science-based, citizen-participatory regulatory
   structures. Governance at local scales remains highly variable, so the
   Great Lakes region rides on the coattails of past policies. This
   scenario represents one of four described in the Great Lakes Futures
   Project. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{Scenario analysis can be a useful tool to explore paths to a desirable
   future. This paper is a `future history' describing the how stakeholders
   in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin of North America rallied to
   confront regional challenges 50 years into the future (2013-2063). This
   future scenario was developed by considering how nine drivers of change
   (aquatic invasive species; biological and chemical contaminants; climate
   change; demographics and societal values; economy; energy; governance
   and geopolitics; water quantity; and technology) might impact the
   region. This ``thriving and prosperous{''} scenario envisions that in
   the beginning, Great Lakes residents, scientists, and policymakers saw
   ``the writing on the wall,{''} recognizing that past approaches to
   environmental policy failed to provide long-term environmental, social,
   and economic prosperity. In response, policymakers in the Great Lakes
   region began formulating and implementing new policies, but actions were
   scattered across the region and uncoordinated across geopolitical
   boundaries. Recognizing the need to coordinate their efforts, Great
   Lakes stakeholders began ``marching in step{''} by agreeing on a common
   set of guiding principles for future policy actions. Building on this
   momentum, Great Lakes policymakers implemented a suite of regulations
   and initiatives that recognized the Great Lakes region as a complex
   social-ecological system. Between 2053 and 2063, the region began to
   reap the benefits of coordinated policy action. By 2063, the Great Lakes
   region showed how a long-term commitment to improving the environment
   can sustain a thriving and prosperous ecosystem and economy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Despite the existence of agreements, legislation, and institutions at
   the international, national, and subnational levels within both Canada
   and the United States, significant policy implementation and reform
   challenges exist for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. The Great
   Lakes Futures Project (GLFP) fostered collaboration among individuals
   from academia, government, industry, nongovernment organizations, and
   others to understand the past, present, and potential futures of the
   Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin, explore in what direction current
   policies are taking us, and assessing how potential changes in policies
   and approaches can move us toward the more desirable future.
   Participants within the GLFP emphasized the importance of stakeholder
   engagement within the policy recommendations and implementation
   strategies for reaching a ``thriving and prosperous{''} future for the
   Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. Here, we propose an implementation
   strategy founded on stakeholder engagement that I) identifies clear
   basin-wide, cross sector, binational, and inclusive priorities, goals,
   objectives and tactics and 2) increases the roles and responsibilities
   of local actors and non-governmental sectors to provide a better balance
   between topdown and bottom-up efforts, all nested within a framework of
   strong stakeholder engagement. In taking such an approach, the GLFP
   presents an opportunity to implement mechanisms for fostering change to
   lead to a more sustainable future for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River
   basin. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{A Web service is defined as an autonomous unit of application logic that
   provides either some business functionality or information to other
   applications through an Internet connection. Web services are based on a
   set of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) standards such as Universal
   Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI), Web Services Description
   Language (WSDL), and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Nowadays Web
   services are becoming more and more popular for supporting different
   social applications, thus there are also increasing demands and
   discussions about Web services privacy protection in information. In
   general, privacy policies describe an organization's data practices on
   what information they collect from individuals (e.g., consumers) and
   what (e.g., purposes) they do with it. To enable privacy protection for
   Web service consumers across multiple domains and services, the World
   Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published a document called ``Web Services
   Architecture (WSA) Requirements{''} that defines some specific privacy
   requirements for Web services as a future research topic. This paper
   presents a mathematical model to construct the privacy policies in SOAP
   Message Exchange Patterns (MEP) for social services. Further, this paper
   also presents the privacy policies in security tokens with SOAP

   Li-O-2 batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2559-2563}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanocrystals represent a family of
   emerging nanomaterials with many proposed applications; however, the
   interlayer re-stacking between sheets greatly decreases the performance
   during practical operation. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to
   solve this challenging problem by rational assembly of 2D nanocrystals
   into three-dimensional (3D) aerogels, which paves the way for harvesting
   excellent structural properties of both nanostructures and
   macrostructures. The resultant 3D MnO2 aerogel shows significantly
   increased discharge capacity in Li-air batteries in comparison to its
   powder-like counterpart (4581.4 vs. 3902.6 mA h g(-1)), which
   outperforms many MnO2 and other transition metal-based electrocatalysts.
   Meanwhile, the as-fabricated Li-air cell demonstrates good rate
   capability and cycle life. Further mechanism study reveals that the
   improved performance is associated with ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets which
   allow highly exposed catalytic centres, as well as its excellent aerogel
   structure with rich porosity and a 3D continuous network that maximizes
   the utilization of MnO2 species for catalytic reactions. This study may
   open up new opportunities for making full use of 2D nanocrystals for a
   number of energy storage/conversion techniques.}},

Title = {{Improved time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography monitoring of

   arrays}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has long-standing potential to
   improve characterization of sites contaminated with dense non-aqueous
   phase liquids (DNAPLs). However, ERT is rarely used at DNAPL sites due
   to the complexity of the DNAPL target coupled with the inherent
   limitations of traditional (surface and cross-hole) ERT configurations.
   Horizontal boreholes are being increasingly used in remedial strategies
   at contaminated field sites. This paper presents a novel
   surface-to-horizontal borehole (S2HB) ERT configuration for DNAPL site
   investigations. This array configuration is combined with
   four-dimensional (4D) inversion methods (applied on two-dimensional (2D)
   time-lapse monitoring datasets) to explore the potential benefit of S2HB
   ERT for mapping the spatial and temporal evolution of DNAPL mass during
   remediation. A field scale DNAPL remediation scenario was first
   simulated by a coupled DNAPL-ERT model. This demonstrated that S2HB ERT
   may provide significant improvements over surface ERT, particularly for
   delineating DNAPL mass removal at depth. A laboratory experiment was
   then performed to validate the S2HB ERT approach in a physical system.
   The experiment confirmed that 4D S2HB ERT provides improved time-lapse
   monitoring of NAPL changes. Confidence in the ERT responses obtained
   from the experiment was increased by direct comparison to-the actual
   distribution of NAPL mapped by excavation. Independent simulation of the
   experiment with the DNAPL-ERT model demonstrated that the model is
   reliable for simulating real systems. This initial study demonstrates
   significantly improved resistivity imaging with surface-to-horizontal
   borehole ERT and its potential as a non-destructive site
   characterization tool for mapping DNAPL mass changes during remediation.

Abstract = {{Poor electrocatalytic activity and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning of the
   anode in Pt-based catalysts are still two major challenges facing direct
   methanol fuel cells. Herein, we demonstrate a highly active and stable
   Pt nanoparticle/Mo2C nanotube catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation.
   Pt nanoparticles were deposited on Mo2C nanotubes using a controllable
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. This catalyst showed much
   higher catalytic activity for methanol oxidation and superior CO
   tolerance, when compared with those of the conventional Pt/C and PtRu/C
   catalysts. The experimental evidence from X-ray absorption near-edge
   structure spectroscopy and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy
   clearly support a strong chemical interaction between the Pt
   nanoparticles and Mo2C nanotubes. Our studies show that the existence of
   Mo2C not only minimizes the required Pt usage but also significantly
   enhances CO tolerance and thus improves their durability. These results
   provide a promising strategy for the design of highly active
   next-generation catalysts.}},

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{34-46}},
Abstract = {{The use of ultraviolet light for inactivation of pathogens is an
   engrained, low-cost, eco-friendly method for disinfection of nearly
   transparent (UVT254 > 30\%/cm) contaminated fluids for which a
   standard-collimated beam apparatus is typically used for measurement of
   intrinsic inactivation kinetics. However, such a device cannot be used
   for low ultraviolet transmittance (UVT254 < 30\%/cm) and nearly opaque
   (UVT254 < 10\%/cm) fluids because of the lack of sufficient mixing and
   intrinsic inactivation kinetics controlled by dose distribution and
   mass-transfer effects. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) model was used to determine the validity regime for accurate
   ultraviolet inactivation kinetics studies in low transmittance and
   nearly opaque fluids when a new Taylor-Couette collimated beam
   apparatus, which exploits flow instability through the formation of
   toroidal counter-rotating vortices, is used for irradiations. A Taylor
   number of similar to 46,500 was sufficient to overcome the very short UV
   light penetration at UVT254 similar to 0.001\%/cm as long as the log(10)
   reduction value was used as controlling parameter. Specifically, it was
   identified that, in case of first-order inactivation kinetics, the
   applied average dose (AD) should not be higher than three times the dose
   required for one log(10) inactivation (also known as D-10) in order to
   generate data for accurate kinetic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Microscopic distributions of elastic and plastic strains have been
   studied at three intervals during an electrochemically accelerated
   corrosion test of a flat, polished surface of a mill-annealed and
   unstrained sample of Alloy 600 (UNS N06600) in 10\% sodium hydroxide
   (NaOH) at 315 degrees C. Laue microdiffraction was used with a
   micron-sized polychromatic (white) x-ray beam to map strain changes in
   the sample as a function of corrosion time. After two 12 h corrosion
   periods, tensile elastic strains were detected along a grain boundary.
   After a third 24 h corrosion period, this particular boundary was found
   to have cracked to a depth of several microns; other adjacent boundaries
   exhibited tensile elastic strain, but no cracking. No significant
   changes to plastic strain distributions in the same area could be
   detected as a function of corrosion exposure.}},

Title = {{Margin selection to compensate for loss of target dose coverage due to

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to provide guidelines for the selection of
   external-beam radiation therapy target margins to compensate for target
   motion in the lung during treatment planning. A convolution model was
   employed to predict the effect of target motion on the delivered dose
   distribution. The accuracy of the model was confirmed with radiochromic
   film measurements in both static and dynamic phantom modes. 502 unique
   patient breathing traces were recorded and used to simulate the effect
   of target motion on a dose distribution. A 1D probability density
   function (PDF) representing the position of the target throughout the
   breathing cycle was generated from each breathing trace obtained during
   4D CT. Changes in the target D95 (the minimum dose received by 95\% of
   the treatment target) due to target motion were analyzed and shown to
   correlate with the standard deviation of the PDF. Furthermore, the
   amount of target D95 recovered per millimeter of increased field width
   was also shown to correlate with the standard deviation of the PDF. The
   sensitivity of changes in dose coverage with respect to target size was
   also determined. Margin selection recommendations that can be used to
   compensate for loss of target D95 were generated based on the simulation
   results. These results are discussed in the context of clinical plans.
   We conclude that, for PDF standard deviations less than 0.4 cm with
   target sizes greater than 5 cm, little or no additional margins are
   required. Targets which are smaller than 5 cm with PDF standard
   deviations larger than 0.4 cm are most susceptible to loss of coverage.
   The largest additional required margin in this study was determined to
   be 8 mm.}},

Title = {{Turbulence characterization of downbursts using LES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{44-61}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Loads associated with downbursts represent a significant vulnerability
   on various structures. Designing the structures to withstand such loads
   requires the knowledge about the turbulent characteristics of
   downbursts, which are the focus of the current study. To this effect,
   large eddy simulations (LES) of downbursts impinging over four different
   exposures namely open, countryside, suburban and urban, are performed.
   Ground surface roughness is simulated using fractal surfaces generated
   by random Fourier modes (RFM) and scaled to match a targeted aerodynamic
   roughness z(0). Simulated wind velocities are averaged spatially and
   temporally to extract the mean and turbulent components. Properties of
   both the mean and the turbulent components are discussed: Turbulence
   length scales, which govern the wide band correlations of the
   turbulence, are determined in the circumferential, the vertical and the
   longitudinal directions. It is found that the length scales in the
   circumferential direction are larger than those in the vertical
   direction by at least an order of magnitude, indicating that downburst
   turbulence is more correlated in the circumferential direction. This has
   a particular importance for long horizontal structures such as
   transmission lines and long span bridges. Narrow band correlations and
   the turbulent spectra, which have a particular importance for flexible
   structures, are also discussed. Applicability of using the resulting
   turbulent characteristics to estimate the peak forces on structures,
   e.g. transmission lines, is deduced by employing the gust factor
   approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research and development on theoretical calculation and
   synthetic methods over the past few years have made doped graphene one
   of the most promising candidates for metal-free oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) catalysts. However, from the performance point of view,
   there is still a long way to go for these doped graphene-based catalysts
   to meet the requirements needed for commercial applications. What is the
   key to further improve the catalytic activity of doped graphene toward
   ORR to make them commercially viable? In this review, we will try to
   answer this question by fundamentally giving a detailed analysis based
   on the theoretical calculations to reveal the origin of ORR activity of
   doped graphene and the structure-performance relationship of such
   materials. Thereafter, we will provide an overview on the recent
   advances in the catalytic activity improvement of doped graphene,
   including major works using approaches of increasing the number of
   active sites, controlling the doping types (particularly for nitrogen
   doped graphene), developing co-doped graphene, and extending the surface
   area of doped graphene. Finally, in this perspective, we discuss some

Title = {{Detective quantum efficiency of photon-counting x-ray detectors}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{491-509}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Single-photon-counting (SPC) x-ray imaging has the potential to
   improve image quality and enable novel energy-dependent imaging methods.
   Similar to conventional detectors, optimizing image SPC quality will
   require systems that produce the highest possible detective quantum
   efficiency (DQE). This paper builds on the cascaded-systems analysis
   (CSA) framework to develop a comprehensive description of the DQE of SPC
   detectors that implement adaptive binning.
   Methods: The DQE of SPC systems can be described using the CSA approach
   by propagating the probability density function (PDF) of the number of
   image-forming quanta through simple quantum processes. New relationships
   are developed to describe PDF transfer through serial and parallel
   cascades to accommodate scatter reabsorption. Results are applied to
   hypothetical silicon and selenium-based flat-panel SPC detectors
   including the effects of reabsorption of characteristic/scatter photons
   from photoelectric and Compton interactions, stochastic conversion of
   x-ray energy to secondary quanta, depth-dependent charge collection, and
   electronic noise. Results are compared with a Monte Carlo study.
   Results: Depth-dependent collection efficiency can result in substantial
   broadening of photopeaks that in turn may result in reduced DQE at lower
   x-ray energies (20-45 keV). Double-counting interaction events caused by
   reabsorption of characteristic/scatter photons may result in falsely
   inflated image signal-to-noise ratio and potential overestimation of the
   DQE.
   Conclusions: The CSA approach is extended to describe signal and noise
   propagation through photoelectric and Compton interactions in SPC
   detectors, including the effects of escape and reabsorption of
   emission/scatter photons. High-performance SPC systems can be achieved
   but only for certain combinations of secondary conversion gain,
   depth-dependent collection efficiency, electronic noise, and
   reabsorption characteristics. (C) 2015 American Association of

Volume = {{85}},

Pages = {{26-32}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the fracture resistance of six commonly used
   self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants by comparing their respective
   fracture torques during insertion.
   Materials and Methods: Ninety self-drilling mini-implants from six
   manufacturers (Aarhus, Dual-Top, OrthoEasy, Tomas-pin, Unitek, and
   VectorTAS), with diameters ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 mm, were inserted
   into acrylic blocks using a custom-made insertion device. Insertion
   torques were measured using a 6-degree-of-freedom load cell fixed to the
   base of the acrylic blocks, and peak torques experienced at the time of
   fracture for each of the mini-implants were recorded. One-way analysis
   of variance (alpha = .05) was used to compare the fracture torques among
   the six different groups.
   Results: Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (P < .05)
   in the peak fracture torques among mini-implant groups. Mean fracture
   torques ranked as follows: Unitek (72 Ncm) > Tomas-pin (36 Ncm) >
   Dual-Top (32 Ncm) approximate to VectorTAS (31 Ncm) > OrthoEasy (28 Ncm)
   > Aarhus (25 Ncm), with significant differences found between all
   manufacturers, except for Dual-Top and VectorTAS.
   Conclusions: Mini-implants tested showed a wide range of torque at
   fracture depending on the manufacturer, with only a weak correlation
   between mini-implant diameter and fracture resistance. This torque
   should be considered at the time of mini-implant insertion to minimize
   the risk of implant fracture, especially in areas of high-density bone
   without predrilling.}},

Title = {{On-demand scheduling for concurrent multipath transfer using the stream
   control transmission protocol}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{11-22}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Disparate path characteristics and a constrained receive buffer can
   frustrate the promised performance gains of concurrent multipath
   transfer (CMT). Known as the receive buffer blocking problem,
   out-of-order arrivals disrupt the sender's ability to transmit new
   packets while buffering delays ensue at the multihomed receiver. To
   mitigate this effect, earlier work used scheduling algorithms that
   assigned new packets to the receiver's destination address with the
   lowest delay. Unfortunately, this approach is not always successful; and
   in some cases, even a simpler method will achieve better results.
   Our research suggests that congestion and flow control standard elements
   of the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) counteract the
   scheduling process. Since congestion and flow control dictate when
   packets are actually transmitted to a destination address, making a
   scheduling decision prior to a transmission opportunity can be
   ineffective. In this paper, we propose an on-demand scheduler (ODS); a
   scheduling approach for CMT that waits for a transmission opportunity
   before assigning a packet to one of the receiver's destination
   addresses.
   In some circumstances, however, ODS will enable one destination address
   to monopolize shared resources, such as the receive buffer (RBUF). To
   circumvent this issue we have also developed a new congestion window
   update policy for CMT. When compared to previous scheduling algorithms,
   ODS and our new update policy can significantly improve throughput for
   CMT under delay and bandwidth-based disparity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{36-46}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An innovative reliability analysis approach known as ``Subset Simulation
   based on Importance Sampling{''} is developed for the efficient
   estimation of the small functional failure probability of a passive
   safety system. This approach is based on the idea that a small failure
   probability can be expressed as a product of larger conditional failure
   probabilities by introducing a proper choice of intermediate failure
   events. Importance sampling simulation is carried out to generate
   conditional samples for each intermediate failure region. This
   application is illustrated for the functional reliability analysis of a
   passive residual heat removal system due to epistemic uncertainty
   parameters. The numerical results demonstrate the high level of
   computational efficiency and excellent computational accuracy by
   comparison with direct Monte Carlo simulation, Importance Sampling
   simulation and Subset Simulation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The
   sensitivity, defined as the partial derivative of the failure
   probability with respect to the distribution parameter is also
   discussed, which can help to identify the contribution of each parameter
   and guide the optimization model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{54-65}},
Abstract = {{Post disaster investigations indicate that the roof damage often occur
   during strong wind events. Human or construction error could be one of
   the contributing factors for the observed damage. In this study, a
   survey was carried out at the IRLBH (The Insurance Research Lab for
   Better Homes) facility (at the University of Western Ontario) to inspect
   the quality of construction, especially the fasteners used to fasten the
   plywood roof panels to the roof trusses. Statistics of missing nails
   which are required for the fastening are obtained. It was suggested that
   the occurrence of the missing nail could be modeled using binomial
   process with the occurrence rate of 1.5\%. The effect of the missing
   nail on the statistics of the panel uplift capacity to wind pressure,
   which are evaluated using the nonlinear finite element techniques by
   considering the uncertainty in nail withdrawal behavior, is assessed and
   compared to those without missing nails. Also, the influence of the
   missing nail on the reliability of roof panel under wind load is
   investigated. The implication of the results on the codified design is

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-45}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Initial applications of micropiles have involved retrofitting
   foundations of existing buildings. In these applications, the overall
   performance of the micropiles-raft (MPR) foundation system is similar to
   a piled raft foundation where the load is transmitted through both the
   raft and micropiles. However, there is no guidance available regarding
   the performance of MPR foundations. In this study, geotechnical
   centrifuge testing was conducted to investigate the behavior of MPR
   foundations in sand and evaluate their performance characteristics. The
   study investigated the effect of raft flexibility on a number of
   important design parameters, including raft total and differential
   settlements, raft contact pressure, raft bending moment, and load
   sharing between the raft and micropiles. In addition, the use of
   micropiles as settlement reducers was investigated. The results showed
   that the micropiles carried 42\%-59\% of the applied load for the MPR
   configuration considered, which resulted in redistribution of the raft
   contact pressure. It was found that the Poulos-Davis-Randolph (PDR)
   method can be used to evaluate the performance of MPR systems with
   relatively stiff rafts; however, it is not applicable for MPR with
   flexible raft. A correction factor was proposed to account for the raft
   flexibility in the PDR method.}},

Abstract = {{The development of stimuli-responsive materials is of significant
   interest for many applications including drug delivery, medical imaging,
   sensors, and microfluidic devices. Among the available stimuli, light is
   particularly attractive as it can be applied with high spatial and
   temporal resolution. We describe here the synthesis of amphiphilic
   triblock copolymers composed of poly(ethylene glycol) and a hydrophobic
   block containing o-nitrobenzyl esters throughout the backbone using
   copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. These materials
   were designed to have a high weight fraction of the hydrophobic block to
   favour nonmicellar aggregates. The self-assembly in water was studied
   using nanoprecipitation and the resulting assemblies were characterized
   by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Under
   optimized conditions, it was possible to prepare polymer vesicles,
   commonly referred to as polymersomes, with diameters of approximately
   100 nm. The degradation of these materials in response to UV light was
   studied by spectroscopy, light scattering, and electron microscopy,
   demonstrating that the vesicles were broken down. These results suggest
   the potential of these materials for applications such as encapsulation
   and release.}},

Abstract = {{Cocrystal forming ability of antiviral drug acyclovir (ACV) with

   and solvent evaporation. The cocrystals were characterized by powder
   X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and
   thermogravimetric analysis. The crystal structure of the cocrystal with
   fumaric acid as conformer was determined by single crystal X-ray
   diffraction. Formation of supramolecular synthon was observed in the
   cocrystal. Stability with respect to relative humidity for the three
   cocrystals was evaluated. The aqueous solubility of the ACV-cocrystal
   materials was significantly improved with a maximum of malonic acid
   cocrystal, which was about six times more soluble at 35 degrees C
   compared with that of parent ACV. The dissolution profile indicates that
   at any particular dissolution time, the concentration of cocrystals in
   the solution was higher than that of the parent ACV, and malonic acid
   cocrystals had a maximum release of about twice than the hydrated ACV.

Pages = {{187-202}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a reference examination for cardiac
   morphology and function in humans, allows to image the cardiac right
   ventricle (RV) with high spatial resolution. The segmentation of the RV
   is a difficult task due to the variable shape of the RV and its
   ill-defined borders in these images. The aim of this paper is to
   evaluate several RV segmentation algorithms on common data. More
   precisely, we report here the results of the Right Ventricle
   Segmentation Challenge (RVSC), concretized during the MICCAI'12
   Conference with an on-site competition. Seven automated and
   semi-automated methods have been considered, along them three
   atlas-based methods, two prior based methods, and two prior-free,
   image-driven methods that make use of cardiac motion. The obtained
   contours were compared against a manual tracing by an expert cardiac
   radiologist, taken as a reference, using Dice metric and Hausdorff
   distance. We herein describe the cardiac data composed of 48 patients,
   the evaluation protocol and the results. Best results show that an
   average 80\% Dice accuracy and a 1 cm Hausdorff distance can be expected
   from semi-automated algorithms for this challenging task on the
   datasets, and that an automated algorithm can reach similar performance,
   at the expense of a high computational burden. Data are now publicly
   available and the website remains open for new submissions

Abstract = {{The influence of lead nitrate on rare earth flotation in the presence of
   hydroxamates as collectors has been investigated by a combination of
   micro-flotation tests and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (ToF-SIMS) surface chemical analysis. Micro-flotation tests identified a
   link between lead nitrate dose and an improved grade of REE minerals for
   concentrates. The testing also identified differences in the flotation
   behaviour of light rare earth (LREEs, La or Ce bearing minerals) and Y
   and Zr bearing minerals. TOF-SIMS analyses evaluated the variability in
   surface components on undifferentiated REE grains from the concentrates
   and tails samples in response to the varied lead nitrate dosing in
   micro-flotation tests. The surface analyses showed that both the REE
   grains and gangue phases reporting to the concentrate have higher
   relative surface proportions of both Pb and collectors as compared to
   those reporting to the tails. It is noted that the lead does not appear
   to be associated with an increase in collector adsorption, so the grade
   of REE can go up is not by selective adsorption of collectors. The
   significantly higher intensity of Pb species identified on the surface
   of the concentrate would suggest that lead addition can actually reverse
   the surface charge making it efficient for collectors to adsorb onto
   surfaces that they could not easily close to. It is also possible PbOH+
   potentially acting as a point activator. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the economic viability and profitability of a newly
   emerging storage technology, i.e., cryogenic energy storage (CES), is
   investigated. A real-time optimal dispatching algorithm is proposed and
   developed to optimally dispatch a privately owned CES unit to generate
   revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities in the
   day-ahead/week-ahead electricity market. Due to its special
   characteristics, CES can provide significantly more financial and
   technical benefits in a weekly scheduling compared with common daily
   scheduling. The electricity price modulation is proposed as a new
   approach to competitively offer subsidy by the utility regulator to CES
   owners to fill the gap between current and a stable expected rate of
   return. Using real-world price data from the Ontario wholesale
   electricity market, the method is validated. The results reveal
   significant benefits of weekly usage as compared to daily usage of CES.
   The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed approach to subsidize CES
   owners are validated through simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{As studies uncover the breadth of microbes associated with human life,
   opportunities will emerge to manipulate and augment their functions in
   ways that improve health and longevity. From involvement in the
   complexities of reproduction and fetal/infant development, to delaying
   the onset of disease, and indeed countering many maladies, microbes
   offer hope for human well-being. Evidence is emerging to suggest that
   microbes may play a beneficial role in body sites traditionally viewed
   as being sterile. Although further evidence is required, we propose that
   much of medical dogma is about to change significantly through
   recognition and understanding of these hitherto unrecognized
   microbe-host interactions. A meeting of the International Scientific
   Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics held in Aberdeen, Scotland
   (June 2014), presented new views and challenged established concepts on
   the role of microbes in reproduction and health of the mother and
   infant. This article summarizes some of the main aspects of these

   The corroded surfaces were characterised by SEM/EDS, Raman spectroscopy

   conditions an initially formed Cu2S film is rapidly converted to a

   deposition of an outer layer of atacamite. In the presence of bentonite
   corrosion proceeds slowly under O-2 transport control. No atacamite is
   observed and the Cu surface appears slightly pitted. (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{We report here a study of self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays both in
   the amorphous and anatase phases with superior electrochemical
   performance upon lithiation and delithiation. X-ray absorption fine
   structure (XAFS) study at the Ti K and L, O K and Li K edges has been
   conducted to track the behavior. Characteristic features for amorphous
   and anatase TiO2 are identified. After lithiation, it is found that
   although no obvious variation of chemical states is apparent at the Ti K
   and L edges, charge transfer from Ti 3d to O 2p and also partial
   amorphization of anatase TiO2 are evident from spectral intensities. The
   Li and O K edge XAFS show the successful intercalation of lithium and
   reveal the existence of a nearly linear ``O-Li-O{''} arrangement in the
   lithiated TiO2 nanotube. This study helps in understanding of the
   lithiation process in nanostructured TiO2 anodes from a spectroscopic

Abstract = {{An artificial/reconstituted clay was prepared by mixing kaolin (K) and
   silt (S) in the proportion of 50\% kaolin and 50\% silt by weight
   employing a slurry deposition technique. The K-S clay has been used
   extensively to simulate natural clays for geotechnical centrifuge
   testing, often involving dynamic loading. It is necessary to accurately
   measure the soil shear wave velocity (Vs) or the low-strain shear
   modulus (G(max)) for the analysis of geotechnical problems involving
   dynamic loading. In this study, V-s and G(max) of K-S clay were measured
   using a novel device, utilizing piezoelectric transducer ring actuators,
   incorporated in an oedometer. The new device eliminates some of the
   shortcomings of the bender element test. For example, the piezoelectric
   transducer ring actuators do not penetrate the soil and hence do not
   cause any sample disturbance.
   The value of V-s of the K-S clay was measured at different effective
   vertical pressure increments ranging between 25 and 500 kPa. The
   obtained values of V-s and G(max) were independently compared with the
   values predicted using empirical correlations available in the
   literature for clay soil. An excellent agreement was found between the
   measured and the predicted values. The results of the present study are
   presented as V-s -sigma(m)' and G(max) - sigma(m)' models. The proposed
   models will be helpful in designing a K-S clay testbed with a targeted
   stiffness for dynamic centrifuge applications.}},

   Newborn Piglets: An Experimental and Numerical Study}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE-JTEHM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{We investigate thermal effects of pulmonary cooling which was induced by
   cold air through an endotracheal tube via a ventilator on newborn
   piglets. A mathematical model was initially employed to compare the
   thermal impact of two different gas mixtures, O-2-medical air (1: 2) and
   O-2-Xe (1: 2), across the respiratory tract and within the brain.
   Following mathematical simulations, we examined the theoretical
   predictions with O-2-medical air condition on nine anesthetized piglets
   which were randomized to two treatment groups: 1) control group (n = 4)
   and 2) pulmonary cooling group (n = 5). Numerical and experimental
   results using O-2-medical air mixture show that brain temperature fell
   from 38.5 degrees C and 38.3 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C to 35.7 degrees
   C +/- 0.9 degrees C and 36.5 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C during 3 h
   cooling which corresponded to a mean cooling rate of 0.9 degrees C/h +/-
   0.2 degrees C/h and 0.6 degrees C/h +/- 0.1 degrees C/h, respectively.
   According to the numerical results, decreasing the metabolic rate and
   increasing air velocity are helpful to maximize the cooling effect. We
   demonstrated that pulmonary cooling by cooling of inhalation gases
   immediately before they enter the trachea can slowly reduce brain and
   core body temperature of newborn piglets. Numerical simulations show no
   significant differences between two different inhaled conditions, i.e.,
   O-2-medical air (1: 2) and O-2-Xe (1: 2) with respect to cooling rate.}},

Abstract = {{Deterioration due to corrosion has a significant effect on the safety
   and reliability of many types of civil structures and infrastructures.
   Pitting corrosion is a localized accelerated dissolution of metal that
   occurs as a result of a breakdown of the otherwise protective passive
   film on the metal surface. Pitting corrosion of metals and alloys, which
   is critical to structural reliability, is difficult to deal with due to
   its complex nature. Although great efforts have been made to understand
   the basic physical and chemical mechanisms of pitting corrosion, the
   mechanistic models have been still limited by large-scale randomness of
   pitting phenomena. In this paper, a gamma process-based hierarchical
   Bayesian model for characterizing pitting corrosion under inspection
   uncertainty is presented. The localized pitting corrosion was assumed to
   initiate at random times and the time-dependent depth growth was modeled
   by a gamma-process. The inspection uncertainty arising from imprecise
   measurement and imperfect detectability was also taken into account in
   this model. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was employed to
   estimate and update the uncertain model parameters. In a case study, the
   effectiveness of the proposed model was illustrated by estimating the
   actual number of pits and multiple pits depths within a corrosion
   system.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH AND REPORTS IN BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{73-88}},
Abstract = {{With the classification first proposed by the Bornstein group in 1995,
   matricellular proteins represent a diverse and expanding class of
   molecules that contribute to cell phenotype and regulate interactions
   with the extracellular matrix. Based on initial analysis, matricellular
   protein expression was thought to be limited to development, but in the
   intervening 20 years it has become apparent that it plays a pivotal role
   during healing in several different tissue types. Furthermore, while
   considered to modulate cell behavior, it is now apparent that
   matricellular proteins also function in the organization and
   crosslinking of the extracellular matrix during healing. The focus of
   this review is to discuss matricellular proteins in the context of skin
   healing, which in healthy individuals occurs through four overlapping
   temporal phases. We will also discuss matricellular proteins as
   potential therapeutics for the treatment of impaired skin healing.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical formulation capable of simulating fluid flow and
   non-equilibrium heat and mass transfer in three-dimensional conjugate
   fluid/solid/porous domains is presented. The governing transport
   equations are presented for the fluid, solid, and porous regions, with
   special consideration given towards the manner in which moisture is
   accounted for in the air-water vapour mixture. Mathematical conditions
   are also presented to ensure that heat and mass transfer occurs smoothly
   across fluid-porous, fluid-solid and porous-solid interfaces. The
   developed formulation is validated by simulating direct and indirect
   evaporative cooling problems. The results demonstrate that the
   formulation is capable of simulating evaporative cooling in conjugate
   three-dimensional domains, with and without the addition of sensible
   heat. Moreover, different simulated cases show that the results are
   accurate compared to available experimental results, and are physically
   realistic throughout the domain and at interfaces between conjugate
   regions. The unsteady problem of drying of an initially saturated porous
   material is also simulated to demonstrate the non-equilibrium mass
   transfer feature of the developed formulation. The results show the
   correct trends in drying time with respect to the flow Reynolds number
   and the relative humidity of the inlet air-water vapour mixture. (C)

   enumerates that the lattice parameter and the cell volume decreases upon

   Si4+ in NiTiO3 structure was also confirmed using FTIR analysis, which
   showed the stretching vibrations of Si-O at similar to 1008 cm(-1). The

   The electrical studies infers an enhancement in the conductivity from

Title = {{Effects of fluorine on the solubilities of Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf minerals in
   highly fluxed water-saturated haplogranitic melts}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fluorine on the solubilities of Mn-columbite (MnNb2O6),
   Mn-tantalite (MnTa2O6), zircon (ZrSiO4) and hafnon (HfSiO4) were
   determined in highly fluxed, water-saturated haplogranitic melts at 800
   to 1000 degrees C and 2 kbar. The melt composition corresponds to the
   intersection of the granite minimum with the albite-orthoclase tieline
   (Ab(72)Or(28)) in the quartz-albite-orthoclase system (Q-Ab-Or), which
   is representative of a highly fluxed melt, from which high field
   strength element minerals may crystallize. The melt contains 1.7 wt.\%
   P2O5, 1.05 wt.\% Li2O and 1.83 wt.\% B2O3. The main purpose of this
   study is to examine the effect of F on columbite, tantalite, zircon and
   hafnon solubility for a melt with this composition. Up to 6 wt.\%
   fluorine was added as AgF in order to keep the aluminum saturation index
   (ASI, molar Al/{[}Na + K]) of the melt constant In an additional
   experiment F was added as AlF3 to make a glass peraluminous. The nominal
   ASI of the melts are close to 1 for the minimum composition and
   approximately 1.32 in peraluminous glasses, but if Li is considered as
   an alkali, the molar ratio Al/{[}Na + K + Li] of the melts are alkaline
   (0.87) and subaluminous (1.09), respectively.
   The molar solubility products {[}MnO] ({*}) {[}Nb2O5] and {[}MnO] ({*})
   {[}Ta2O5] are nearly independent of the F content of the melt, at
   approximately 18.19 +/- 1.2 and 43.65 +/- 2.5 x 10(-4) (mol(2)/kg(2)),
   respectively for the minimum composition. By contrast, there is a
   positive dependence of zircon and hafnon solubilities on the fluorine
   content in the minimum composition, which increases from 2.03 +/- 0.03 x
   10(-4) (mol/kg) ZrO2 and 4.04 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4) (mol/kg) HfO2 for melts
   with 0 wt.\% F to 3.81 +/- 03 x 10(-4) (mol/kg) ZrO2 and 6.18 +/- 0.04 x
   10(-4) (mol/kg) HfO2 for melts with 8 wt.\% F. Comparison of the data
   from this work and previous studies indicates that ASI of the melt seems
   to have a stronger effect than the contents of fluxing elements in the
   melt and the overall conclusion is that fluorine is less important
   (relative to melt compositions) than previously thought for the control
   on the behavior of high field strength elements in highly evolved
   granitic melts. Moreover, this study confirms that although Nb, Ta, Zr
   and Hf are all high field strength elements, Nb-Ta and Zr-Hf are
   complexed differently in the melt. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The redox Fe3+/H-2 flow fuel cell electrolytes are based on thin
   polymeric membranes that conduct protons (H+ ions). This paper reports
   the study of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based polyelectrolyte membranes
   (PEM) for application in redox flow fuel cells. The PVA polyelectrolyte
   membranes (PVA-PEMs) were supported on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE),
   and cross-linked in situ using glutaraldehyde (GA) in the presence of
   acidic catalyst, forming a membrane-anode assembly. Multiple coating
   layers of PVA/GA were applied on the GDE for obtaining different
   membrane thicknesses. The swelling study indicated that the water uptake
   of the membranes decreased linearly with the increase in the GA content
   due to the increase in the cross-link density. The GA content of 11
   wt.\% showed a maximum gel content of 98.4\% and optimum water uptake of
   40\%. The overall ionic (iron ions and acid) crossover flux through
   PVA-PEMs was lower than that in the Nafion 112 ionomer membrane. The
   two-layer of PVA-PEMs on Nafion postcoated GDE exhibited the maximum
   power density of 170 mW cm(-2) at current density of 472 mA cm(-2). In
   the case of the commercial Selemion HSF ion exchange membrane, the
   maximum power density was found to be 166 mW cm(-2) at current density
   of 472 mA cm(-2). The continuous operation of the redox flow cells with
   PVA-PEMs exhibited stability with 92\% retention in cell voltage after
   480 h. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{674-681}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Concrete exposed to sulfates in hot and arid regions can severely suffer
   from salt weathering. The resulting damage is typically localized at the
   above ground portion of concrete members. This process highly depends on
   the pore structure of the concrete surface through which salty water
   rises by capillary action. When water evaporates, salt crystals grow in
   the concrete surface pores leading to concrete damage. Thus, protecting
   the concrete surface can potentially enhance its durability to salt
   weathering. However, the vast variety of surface treatment compounds
   available makes the selection of an adequate material challenging. This
   is particularly true for concrete exposed to physical sulfate attack due
   to the lack of pertinent data in the open literature. Therefore, this
   study focuses primarily on assessing the effectiveness of different
   commercially available surface treatment materials in mitigating
   physical sulfate attack on concrete. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a significant anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emitted from biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes. This study
   tries to get a deeper insight into N2O emissions from denitrifying
   fluidized bed bioreactors (DFBBRs) and its relationship to the biofilm
   thickness, diffusivity, and reaction rates. The DFBBR was operated at
   two different organic and nitrogen loading rates of 5.9-7 kg COD/(m(3)
   d) and 1.2-2 kg N/(m(3) d), respectively. Results showed that the N2O
   conversion rate from the DFBBR at a biofilm thickness of 680 mu m was
   0.53\% of the total influent nitrogen loading while at the limited COD
   and a biofilm thickness of 230 mu m, the N2O conversion rate increased
   by 196-1.57\% of the influent nitrogen loading concomitant with a
   sevenfold increase in liquid nitrite concentration. Comparing the N2O
   emissions at different biofilm thickness showed that the N2O emission
   decreased exponentially with biofilm thickness due to the retention of
   slow growth denitrifiers and the limited diffusivity of N2O. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been shown as a powerful technique to
   build three-dimensional (3D) all-solid-state microbattery, because of
   its unique advantages in fabricating uniform and pinhole-free thin films
   in 3D structures. The development of solid-state electrolyte by ALD is a
   crucial step to achieve the fabrication of 3D all-solid-state
   microbattery by ALD. In this work, lithium phosphate solid-state
   electrolytes were grown by ALD at four different temperatures (250, 275,
   300, and 325 degrees C) using two precursors (lithium tert-butoxide and
   trimethylphosphate). A linear dependence of film thickness on ALD cycle
   number was observed and uniform growth was achieved at all four
   temperatures. The growth rate was 0.57, 0.66, 0.69, and 0.72
   angstrom/cycle at deposition temperatures of 250, 275, 300, and 325
   degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   confirmed the compositions and chemical structures of lithium phosphates
   deposited by ALD. Moreover, the lithium phosphate thin films deposited
   at 300 degrees C presented the highest ionic conductivity of 1.73 x
   10(-8) S cm(-1) at 323 K with similar to 0.51 eV activation energy based
   on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ionic conductivity
   was calculated to be 3.3 x 10(-8) S cm(-1) at 26 degrees C (299 K).}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of dry-cast steel fibre-reinforced concrete
   (DCSFRC) were investigated in the present study. Four commercially
   available steel fibres were added at rates of 0, 20, 40 and 60 kg/m(3).
   Full-scale 300 mm diameter precast pipes were fabricated using the
   tested DCSFRC mixtures to examine its potential for such application. In
   addition, plain (PC) and conventionally reinforced concrete (RC) precast
   pipes were fabricated and tested for comparison. As expected, results
   showed that the mechanical properties of DCSFRC were enhanced as the
   fibre dosage increased. Generally, hooked-end fibres with the highest
   aspect ratio led to highest tensile and flexural strengths. Furthermore,
   DCSFRC precast pipes achieved ultimate loads greater than the required
   strength for Class V pipes according to the ASTM C76 standard. The
   post-peak behaviour of DCSFRC pipes was comparable or superior to that
   of conventional RC pipes. Findings of this research indicate that
   discrete steel fibres could be an adequate alternative to the labour
   intensive and time-consuming steel cages normally used for reinforcing
   precast concrete pipes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Acidity measurements by NH3-TPD, on the other hand,
   exhibit weak and strong acid sites, with both their ratio and total
   acidity being reduced with increasing SiO2/Al2O3. Experiments in the
   Berty reactor allow analyzing the changes of dimethyl ether (DME)
   conversion, light olefin selectivity and catalyst stability with
   SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Moreover, these studies show that from the three
   HZSM-5 catalysts considered, the one with the SiO2/Al2O3 = 280 gives the
   highest light olefin selectivity. A maximum performance of 59\% DME
   conversion at 1.16\% coke load, and 50\% light olefins selectivity (5\%
   ethylene, 21\% propylene, 24\% butane) are observed at 450 degrees C. In
   addition, this thermal level leads not only to find a promising catalyst
   performance for the SiO2/Al2O3 = 280 ZSM5 catalyst but to establish also
   its unchanged activity with time-on-stream. On the basis of the
   experimental data obtained it is postulated that an ``in series''
   reaction network is adequate to describe the chemical changes with
   formed olefins undergoing eventually further transformation to paraffins
   and heavier aromatic hydrocarbons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the synergistic effects of
   co-fermentation of glucose, starch, and cellulose using anaerobic
   digester sludge (ADS) on the biohydrogen (H-2) production and the
   associated microbial communities. Yields of H-2 were 1.22, 1.00, and
   0.15 mol H-2/mol hexose-added in fermentation reactions containing
   glucose, starch, and cellulose as mono-substrates. The H-2 yields were
   greater by an average of 27 +/- 4\% than expected in all the different
   co-substrate conditions, which affirmed that co-fermentation of
   different substrates improved the H-2 potential. Glucose addition to
   starch and/or cellulose favored acetate synthesis, while cellulose
   degradation was associated with the propionate synthesis pathway.
   Illumina sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses revealed
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Phyla Bacteroides,
   Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistes, and
   Thermotogae were common in mono- and co-substrate batches. However, OTUs
   in the Phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetesee were

Abstract = {{This study employs a semibatch, swirl-flow, monolithic type
   photocatalytic reactor to determine intrinsic kinetic parameters for the
   photocatalytic degradation of a common anti-inflammatory drug,
   diclofenac (DCF), in an immobilized system under both UV and visible
   radiation. The goal of this work was (a) to find a better reactor
   configuration that provides improved residence time distribution of
   fluid, (b) to obtain a suitable support system (such as fiberglass
   sheet) for the immobilization of various photocatalysts (Degussa P25
   TiO2 and modified TiO2 (doped and dye-sensitized), (c) to compare
   degradation rates with Degussa P25 when doped and dye-sensitized
   photocatalysts is used particularly under visible radiation, and finally
   (d) to determine true kinetic parameters after correcting for external
   mass transfer resistance that exists when catalysts is immobilized as a
   function of various operating parameters such as flow rate, catalyst
   loading, pH, light intensity, initial concentration, and photocatalyst
   type. The objective of this study lies in obtaining true kinetic data
   independent of reactor types and, therefore, can be used for process
   scale-up and high-rate water treatment. It was observed experimentally
   that a better degradation rate can be achieved with dye-sensitized
   catalysts activated under visible light.}},

Title = {{Energy-Efficient Novel Heterogeneous Gaseous T-Junction Microreactor
   Design Utilizing Inlet Flow Pulsation}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of inlet flow
   pulsation on the mixing and reaction performance of a heterogeneous
   gaseous T-junction microreactor numerically. The idea is to have a novel
   modular microreactor design comprised of two microreactors (A and B),
   arranged in parallel, and a valve to control the flow direction. Flow
   pulsation can then be implemented to alternately supply reactant to
   microreactor A and microreactor B. Hence, by feeding the same amount of
   reactant and thus same pumping power/parasitic loads, the new design is
   able to run two microreactors and could achieve almost the same level of
   performance as that of a steady flow microreactor with an expense of one
   microreactor. The study was carried out for a case of mixing and
   heterogeneous catalytic reaction of methane (gaseous fuel) oxidation at
   the microreactor surface coated with a platinum catalyst. A detailed
   parametric study was performed to include the effect of frequency,
   amplitude, phase difference, and different waveforms on the conversion
   rate of gaseous fuel and pressure drop across the microreactor. The
   results suggest that the flow pulsation marginally affects the reaction
   performance, in which, the whole novel modular system produces almost
   double yields and energy (temperature) than that of conventional steady
   flow single microreactor design under the same amount of inlet
   reactants. This highlights the potential of this novel design in saving
   energy, enhancing reactants utilization, and increasing yield production
   for several applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, graphene-based titanium dioxide and zinc oxide composites
   (TiO2-G, ZnO-G) were synthesized using a hydrothermal process. Materials
   were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Photocatalytic
   activity of the composite materials under simulated solar light was
   studied using phenol as a model compound. A ca. 30\% improvement on the
   degradation performance by the TiO2-G composite (and ZnO-G) was observed
   when reaction rate constants were compared with TiO2 (and ZnO) only.
   This demonstrates the positive effect of graphene on suppressing charge
   recombination and extending the light absorption range. Further
   improvement on the photocatalytic degradation rate of phenol was
   obtained by coupling the two composites, ZnO-G and TiO2-G. This is
   attributed to more efficient charge separation and longer lifetime of
   the charge carriers, which eventually enhances the photocatalytic
   activity. The optimum stoichiometric amount of each component was
   obtained experimentally. Systematic parametric studies were also
   performed to study the effect of catalyst loading, initial phenol
   concentration, solution pH, and solar light intensity. Complete solar
   degradation of 40 ppm phenol was achieved within 60 min while using the
   coupled ZnO-G/TiO2-G photocatalysts at the optimum conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient implementation of the spectrally-accurate immersed boundary
   conditions method based on the over-determined formulation is presented.
   The linear system resulting from the discretization is solved using a
   special solver that takes advantage of the structure of the coefficient
   matrix. Part of the system corresponding to the field equation is solved
   exactly while the part corresponding to the boundary relations is solved
   in the least squares sense. This process permits use of a larger number
   of constraints to enforce the boundary conditions along the complex flow
   boundaries. A significant expansion of the range of geometries that can
   be handled accurately using the new implementation has been documented.
   Furthermore, a significant acceleration of computations as well as a
   significant reduction of memory requirements have been demonstrated. (C)

Abstract = {{Vagal nerve stimulation in cardiac therapy involves delivering

Abstract = {{In this paper, a power management strategy for PV/battery hybrid systems
   in islanded microgrids is proposed. The control strategy enables the
   photovoltaic (PV)/battery unit to operate as a voltage source that
   employs an adaptive droop control to share the load with other sources
   while charging the battery. Also, the PV/battery unit can track and
   supply the maximum PV power to the microgrid as long as there is
   sufficient load. Otherwise, the hybrid unit will autonomously follow the
   changing load while storing the excess energy in the battery. The
   control strategy is designed to modify the PV operating point to match
   the load autonomously whenever the available PV power is higher than the
   load and the battery is fully charged. In addition, the battery can
   provide the operational functions that a separate storage unit may
   provide in an islanded microgrid, such as regulating voltage and
   frequency, and supplying deficit power in the microgrid. This is
   achieved by utilizing multi-loop control and multi-segment adaptive
   droop control without relying on communications or a state machine.
   Small-signal models of the proposed control loops are developed to
   investigate system stability. The system performance is validated using
   experimental results from a 3-KVA prototype microgrid.}},

Abstract = {{A high-resolution simulation of a downburst-producing thunderstorm has
   been conducted using a three-dimensional cloud model. The highly
   asymmetric near-ground outflow within the downburst has been analyzed
   within an axi-symmetric framework, by undertaking circumferential
   spatial averaging of the wind speed components, in order to explore
   whether the salient features of the outflow can be represented using the
   simpler models employed in wind engineering. The results indicate that
   this approach yields, at a given time during the event, outflow profiles
   that preserve the regions of the highest wind speed but do not preserve
   any flow structure. It is suggested that the peak radial wind speed
   around any circumference may be computed from the spatially-averaged
   mean multiplied by a consistent peak factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effect of multiple roughness changes close to a building site was
   examined through three dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations conducted in a virtual boundary layer wind tunnel (V-BLWT).
   The results obtained were compared with existing wind speed models,
   namely ESDU-82026 and Wang and Stathopoulos (WS) model. The latter was
   verified by wind tunnel tests of sixty nine cases of multiple roughness
   patches, and also with a simplified 2D numerical model. This work
   extends that numerical study to three dimensions and also models
   roughness elements explicitly. The current numerical study shows better
   agreement with the WS model, that has shown better agreements with BLWT
   tests, than the ESDU model. This is in contrast to previous results of
   Wang and Stathopoulos, who concluded that CFD shows better agreement
   with the ESDU model. Many cases were simulated in a V-BLWT that has same
   dimensions as BLWT used in the original experiment and also in a reduced
   symmetrical version (S-BLWT) that takes advantage of regular arrangement
   of roughness blocks. The S-BLWT gives results almost identical to V-BLWT
   simulations, while achieving significant reduction on computational time

Abstract = {{Past high speed wind events have exposed the vulnerability of the roof

   investigates the behaviour of light-framed wood structures under the

   numerical prediction and experimental results in terms of the deflected
   shape at the roof-to-wall connections is presented to gain confidence in
   the numerical model. The model is then used to analyze the behaviour of
   the truss system under realistic and equivalent uniform pressure
   distributions and to perform an assessment of the use of the tributary
   area method to calculate the withdrawal force acting on the roof-to-wall

Abstract = {{This paper describes a dual-arm teleoperation (master-slave) system
   which has been developed to explore the effect of haptics in
   robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). This setup is
   capable of measuring forces in 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) and fully
   reflecting them to the operator through two 7-DOF haptic interfaces. An
   application of the test bed is in enabling the evaluation of the effect
   of replacing haptic feedback by other sensory cues such as visual
   representation of haptic information (sensory substitution). This paper
   discusses the design rationale, kinematic analysis and dynamic modeling
   of the robot manipulators, and the control system developed for the
   setup. Using the accurate model developed in this paper, a highly
   transparent haptics-enabled system can be achieved and used in
   robot-assisted telesurgery. Validation results obtained through
   experiments are presented and demonstrate the correctness and
   effectiveness of the developed models. The application of the setup for
   two RAMIS surgical tasks, a suture manipulation task and a tumor

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of an analytical model to simulate
   time-varying pressure distributions (Cp-i) in the cavity of
   air-permeable layer, double-layer systems, given pressure data on the
   external surface (Cp-e). The model was derived considering the pressure
   drops associated with the flow through the gaps between panels, which is
   like an orifice flow, and the cavity flow between parallel plates. Thus,
   the model uses two primary equations: the unsteady discharge equation
   and the equation for unsteady flow between two parallel plates. The
   model accounts for several geometric parameters including the gap (G)
   between the panels, the height (H) of the panel above the airtight layer
   and the length (L) of the panels, as well as the loss coefficients for
   the orifice and cavity flows. The proposed model is able to capture the
   fluctuations of Cp-i and a good agreement is found between the numerical
   and experimental results for the mean, RMS and peak coefficients, to a
   great extent, when spanwise-averaged external pressure coefficients are
   used as input. For large gap-to-height ratios (i.e., G/H = 12.5), the
   model accuracy decreases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The strong advent of computer-assisted technologies experienced by the
   modern orthopedic surgery prompts for the expansion of computationally
   efficient techniques to be built on the broad base of computer-aided
   engineering tools that are readily available. However, one of the common
   challenges faced during the current developmental phase continues to
   remain the lack of reliable frameworks to allow a fast and precise
   conversion of the anatomical information acquired through computer
   tomography to a format that is acceptable to computer-aided engineering
   software. To address this, this study proposes an integrated and
   automatic framework capable to extract and then postprocess the original
   imaging data to a common planar and closed B-Spline representation. The
   core of the developed platform relies on the approximation of the
   discrete computer tomography data by means of an original two-step
   B-Spline fitting technique based on successive deformations of the
   control polygon. In addition to its rapidity and robustness, the
   developed fitting technique was validated to produce accurate
   representations that do not deviate by more than 0.2mm with respect to
   alternate representations of the bone geometry that were obtained
   through differentcontact-baseddata acquisition or data processing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{For optimizing both the activity and stability of Pt-based catalysts for
   methanol oxidation reaction ( MOR), several carbon
   nanotubes(CNTs)-supported catalysts such as Pt-on-Au/CNTs,
   Pd-on-Au/CNTs, Pt-on-Pd-on-Au/CNTs, Pt-on-Pd/CNTs, and Pd-on-Pt/CNTs
   catalysts are synthesized mainly through electrodeposition method. The
   activity and stability comparisons show that Pt-on-Au/CNTs has a higher
   MOR activity but a lower stability than Pd-on-Au/CNTs. To utilize the
   merits of the Pt and Pd components, Pt-on-Pd-on-Au/CNTs and
   Pt-on-Pd/CNTs catalysts are synthesized. The Pt-on-Pd-on-Au/CNTs and
   Pt-on-Pd/CNTs catalysts shows higher MOR activity than Pd-on-Au/CNTs and
   Pd/CNTs catalysts and higher stability than Pt-on-Au/CNTs, suggesting a
   synergistic interaction between Pt and Pd in catalyzing methanol
   oxidation reaction. Calculation shows that the total mass activity of
   Pt-on-Pd/CNTs with quite low Pt amount is on a similar level as that of
   Pt/CNTs for MOR oxidation, indicating the Pt-on-Pd catalyst could have
   promising potential as a low-Pt catalyst for MOR in alkaline media. (C)

Abstract = {{We describe a multi-layer ({''}sandwich{''}) configuration detector
   consisting of two x-ray imaging flat-panel detectors for single-shot
   (single-kV) dual-energy imaging. An intermediate copper filter is used
   to increase spectral separation between the two detectors to improve
   contrast at the expense of image noise. Monte Carlo and cascaded-systems
   analyses of the signal and noise performance are described that quantify
   performance characteristics. Image quality of dual-energy images
   obtained from a prototype sandwich-detector system is evaluated using a
   figure of merit (FOM), defined as the squared contrast-to-noise ratio
   normalized by x-ray exposure for a mouse phantom for preclinical
   imaging. Demonstration dual-energy bone and soft-tissues images of a
   postmortem mouse are obtained using the prototype system. While the FOM
   with the single-shot detector is lower than that achieved using a
   conventional dual-shot (dual-kV) method, the single-shot approach may be
   preferable when imaging speed or insensitivity to motion artifacts is a
   primary concern. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Numerous methods for motor unit number estimation (MUNE)
   have been developed. The objective of this article is to summarize and
   compare the major methods and the available data regarding their
   reproducibility, validity, application, refinement, and utility.
   Methods: Using specified search criteria, a systematic review of the
   literature was performed. Reproducibility, normative data, application
   to specific diseases and conditions, technical refinements, and
   practicality were compiled into a comprehensive database and analyzed.
   Results: The most commonly reported MUNE methods are the incremental,
   multiple-point stimulation, spike-triggered averaging, and statistical
   methods. All have established normative data sets and high
   reproducibility. MUNE provides quantitative assessments of motor neuron
   loss and has been applied successfully to the study of many clinical
   conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and normal aging.
   Conclusions: MUNE is an important research technique in human subjects,
   providing important data regarding motor unit populations and motor unit
   loss over time. Muscle Nerve50: 884-893, 2014}},

   hydrolysis. Total reducing sugar yields were 365 and 385 g kg(-1) raw

   resulted in overall ABE yields of 146 and 150 g kg(-1) (per kg dry plant
   material), with a theoretical maximum of 189 and 208 g kg(-1),
   respectively. Though similar overall solvent yields were obtained from
   both crops, the largest carbon loss in the case of switchgrass occurred
   during pretreatment, while the largest loss in the case of phragmites
   occurred to enzymatic hydrolysis. These findings suggest that higher
   overall yields are achievable and that both crops are suitable

Abstract = {{In this study, a newly developed image calibration method is compared
   with an optical fibre probe in the measurement of the solids holdup of
   FCC particles in a 7.6m narrow rectangular circulating fluidized bed
   (CFB) riser. The image calibration method is based on experimentally
   correlating solids holdup of FCC particles in the CFB and the grayscale
   of the corresponding images obtained by a high speed video camera. Using
   this method, solids holdups along 15 lateral positions are calculated
   under different operating conditions with U-g and G(s) in the range of
   3.0-12.0m/s and 50-150kg/m(2)s. The solids holdup lateral distribution
   profiles obtained from the two methods in this study under identical
   operating conditions coincide with each other fairly well, reflecting
   the reliability of the image calibration method. Further comparison of
   the results of image calibration method from the current study with the
   measurement results of optical fibre probe from other researchers also
   show good agreement under the same operating condition. These
   comparisons clearly confirm the feasibility and accuracy of the image
   calibration method.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic manufacturing environments require a flexible process planning
   and control system in response to changing manufacturing resource
   availability, production uncertainty, and dynamic machining conditions.
   To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel integrated process
   planning and control method based on intelligent software agents and
   multi-dimension manufacturing features. An integration framework with
   three modules including generic process planning, shop floor process
   planning, and online process control is developed. An intelligent
   agent-based approach is adopted for achieving intelligence and autonomy
   of individual software modules and components. An ontology-based
   multi-dimension manufacturing feature model is proposed to facilitate
   the communication and collaboration between process planning and
   control, as well as to speed up the decision-making of intelligent
   agents. The feasibility and flexibility of the proposed method are
   validated through a proof-of-concept implementation.}},

Title = {{A Refined Technique to Calculate Finite Helical Axes From Rigid Body
   Trackers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Finite helical axes (FHAs) are a potentially effective tool for joint
   kinematic analysis. Unfortunately, no straightforward guidelines exist
   for calculating accurate FHAs using prepackaged six degree-of-freedom
   (6DOF) rigid body trackers. Thus, this study aimed to: (1) describe a
   protocol for calculating FHA parameters from 6DOF rigid body trackers
   using the screw matrix and (2) to maximize the number of accurate FHAs
   generated from a given data set using a moving window analysis. Four
   OPTOTRAK (R) Smart Markers were used as the rigid body trackers, two
   moving and two fixed, at different distances from the hinge joint of a
   custom-machined jig. 6DOF pose information was generated from 51 static
   positions of the jig rotated and fixed in 0.5 deg increments up to 25
   deg. Output metrics included the FHA direction cosines, the rotation
   about the FHA, the translation along the axis, and the intercept of the
   FHA with the plane normal to the jig's hinge joint. FHA metrics were
   calculated using the relative tracker rotation from the starting
   position, and using a moving window analysis to define a minimum
   acceptable rotational displacement between the moving tracker data
   points. Data analysis found all FHA rotations calculated from the
   starting position were within 0.15 deg of the prescribed jig rotation.
   FHA intercepts were most stable when determined using trackers closest
   to the hinge axis. Increasing the moving window size improved the FHA
   direction cosines and center of rotation accuracy. Window sizes larger
   than 2 deg had an intercept deviation of less than 1 mm. Furthermore,
   compared to the 0 deg window size, the 2 deg window had a 90\%
   improvement in FHA intercept precision while generating almost an
   equivalent number of FHA axes. This work identified a solution to
   improve FHA calculations for biomechanical researchers looking to
   describe changes in 3D joint motion.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current practices for determining the peak (yield) and
   postliquefaction (critical) undrained shear strength of liquefiable
   cohesionless soils for grounds subject to static shear stress (e.g.,
   sloping grounds or grounds beneath foundations) require either a suite
   of costly laboratory shear tests on undisturbed field samples or
   empirical correlations with in situ penetration tests, which do not
   account for the effect of the shearing mode on soil behavior. Improved
   correlations are developed in this study for estimating the undrained
   triggering and postliquefaction shear strengths of cohesionless soils,
   which are based on the most reliable field-liquefaction data from past
   cases of liquefaction flow failures and soil shearing behavior observed
   in a large database of 600 laboratory shear tests for different modes of
   shear. The proposed method accounts for the variations in the mode of
   shear when providing estimates of the undrained triggering and
   postliquefaction strengths mobilized in static liquefaction flow
   failures.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, visible light-driven heterogeneous photocatalysts for
   hydrogen production are comparatively assessed based on technical,
   environmental, and cost criteria. The photocatalysis systems are
   compared with respect to their (i) rate of hydrogen generation per gram;
   (ii) rate of hydrogen generation per m(2) of the specific surface area;
   and (iii) the band gap energy. The photocatalysis systems are also
   compared and discussed in terms of flammability, reactivity, and their
   impact on living systems' health. Furthermore, the costs of the required
   components of the photocatalysis systems are ranked. In addition to
   individual photocatalyst comparison, seven photocatalyst groups are
   ranked and compared. The results show that TiO2-C-362 and
   Ag0.03Mn0.40Cd0.60S show the highest in terms of mu mol/h-g(cat) and mu
   mol/h-m(cat)(2), respectively, and TiO2-C-362 has the highest overall
   rankings. The Zn/In/S-based photocatalyst groups show the highest
   hydrogen production rate in terms of mu mol/h-gcat and mu
   mol/h-m(cat)(2). Overall, Cd/S/Zn has the highest rankings when cost and
   health and environmental impact criteria are taken into account.

Abstract = {{For building functional vasculature, controlled delivery of fibroblast
   growth factor-9 (FGF9) from electrospun fibers is an appealing strategy
   to overcome challenges associated with its short half-life. FGF9
   sustained delivery could potentially drive muscularization of angiogenic
   sprouts and help regenerate stable functional neovasculature in ischemic
   vascular disease patients.
   Electrospinning parameters of FGF9-loaded poly(ester amide) (PEA) fibers
   have been optimized, using blend and emulsion electrospinning
   techniques. In vitro PEA matrix degradation, biocompatibility, FGF9
   release kinetics, and bioactivity of the released FGF9 were evaluated.
   qPCR was employed to evaluate platelet-derived growth factor
   receptor-beta (PDGFR beta) gene expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts,
   10T1/2 cells, and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells cultured on
   PEA fibers at different FGF9 concentrations.
   Loaded PEA fibers exhibited controlled release of FGF9 over 28 days with
   limited burst effect while preserving FGF9 bioactivity. FGF9-loaded and
   unloaded electrospun fibers were found to support the proliferation of
   fibroblasts for five days even in serum-depleted conditions. Cells
   cultured on FGF9-supplemented PEA mats resulted in upregulation of PDGFR
   beta in concentration and cell type-dependent manner.
   This study supports the premise of controlled delivery of FGF9 from PEA
   electrospun fibers for potential therapeutic angiogenesis applications.}},

Title = {{Anaerobic digestibility of estrogens in wastewater sludge: Effect of
   ultrasonic pretreatment}},

Abstract = {{Background: Estrogenic compounds have been detected in the secondary
   effluents and in the biosolids from conventional wastewater treatment
   plants, which are not designed for their removal. Furthermore, existing
   limited studies on anaerobic digestibility of estrogens report
   conflicting results. The objective of the present work was to determine
   the fate and anaerobic digestibility of estrogenic compounds in various
   types of sludge including primary sludge (PS), waste activated sludge
   (WAS), and anaerobically digested sludge (seed).
   Methods: Estrone (E1) and 17-beta estradiol (E2) were chosen as the
   model estrogenic compounds. Initially batch adsorption was conducted to
   determine the extent of adsorption and isotherm of E1 on various sludge.
   Thereafter, batch anaerobic digestion of E1 and E2 was conducted in
   various sludge using So/X ratio of 4 gCOD/gVSS in 250 ml bottles. The
   effect of earlier optimized ultrasonication dosage on the anaerobic
   digestion of E1 and E2 was also characterized. Estrogenicity of the
   digested samples was determined by the YES assay.
   Results: Most of E1 and E2 was adsorbed on the biosolids and the
   Freundlich isotherm fitted the experimental data well. No anaerobic
   digestion of E1 and E2 was found in any of the sludge tested, and the
   estrogenicity of the sludge measured by YES assay increased during
   digestion due to the formation of E2 from E1 in a reduced environment.
   Ultrasonication decreased the initial mass of E1 and E2 by 20\% in the
   sonicated digester as compared to control digester, however, there was
   no further decrease in El and E2 during digestion.
   Conclusions: Most of the estrogenic compounds partitioned onto the
   solids and remained there during digestion. Ultrasonication pretreatment
   reduced the estrogen burden for the digester due to advance oxidation,
   but no further removal of the estrogens occurred in the digester. (C)

Abstract = {{Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has shown potential as a
   regenerative scaffold for plastic and reconstructive surgery to augment
   or replace damaged or missing adipose tissue (e.g. following lumpectomy
   or mastectomy). The mechanical properties of soft tissue substitutes are
   of paramount importance in restoring the natural shape and appearance of
   the affected tissues, and mechanical mismatching can lead to
   unpredictable scar tissue formation and poor implant integration. The
   goal of this work was to assess the linear elastic and hyperelastic
   properties of decellularized human adipose tissue and compare them to
   those of normal breast adipose tissue. To assess the influence of the
   adipose depot source on the mechanical properties of the resultant
   decellularized scaffolds, we performed indentation tests on DAT samples
   sourced from adipose tissue isolated from the breast, subcutaneous
   abdominal region, omentum, pericardial depot and thymic remnant, and
   their corresponding force-displacement data were acquired. Elastic and
   hyperelastic parameters were estimated using inverse finite element
   algorithms. Subsequently, a simulation was conducted in which the
   estimated hyperelastic parameters were tested in a real human breast
   model under gravity loading in order to assess the suitability of the
   scaffolds for implantation. Results of these tests showed that in the
   human breast, the DAT would show similar deformability to that of native
   normal tissue. Using the measured hyperelastic parameters, we were able
   to assess whether DAT derived from different depots exhibited different
   intrinsic nonlinearities. Results showed that DAT sourced from varying
   regions of the body exhibited little intrinsic nonlinearity, with no
   statistically significant differences between the groups. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Size exclusion chromatography has been demonstrated as an effective
   method for refolding a variety of proteins. However, to date process
   development mainly relies on laboratory experimentation of individual
   factors. A robust model is essential for high-throughput process
   screening and optimization of systems to provide higher productivity and
   refolding yield. In this work, a detailed kinetic scheme of oxidative
   refolding of a model protein (lysozyme) has been investigated to predict
   the refolding results in SEC. Non-reactive native, quenched and
   equilibrium studies were conducted to obtain the model parameters for
   the species formed during refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme. The
   model was tested in various operating conditions, such as protein
   loading concentration, injection volume, flow rate and composition of
   refolding buffer with and without the use of L-arginine additive. An
   apparent two-state mechanism was found adequate to describe refolding of
   lysozyme on SEC for the operating condition tested in this work.
   Furthermore, using low concentration of L-arginine combined with urea as
   common aggregation suppressor additives showed insignificant change in
   kinetics of refolding of lysozyme on SEC. However, addition of
   L-arginine changed mass transfer properties of some of the species
   formed in refolding reaction which was considered in the model to
   accurately predict the result of refolding on SEC. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nanofiltration (NF) membrane configuration for fluoride and arsenic
   removal from groundwater has a key role in controlling operation
   performances and membrane fouling. Some bench-scale contrast experiments
   using commercial NF membranes were done to obtain the optimum
   arrangement performances. The NF membrane arrays included one-stage,
   two-stage, and three-stage systems. The NF membrane surface was
   negatively charged above its isoelectric point (approximately at pH
   5.9-6.4). Accordingly, the raw groundwater was initially adjusted to a
   neutral or alkaline pH to enhance the effect of electrical charge
   repulsion and improve the ion removal efficiencies by NF. The
   encouraging results indicated that a membrane in a parallel-linear
   arrangement with staging 2:1 was the preferable arrangement to remove
   fluoride and arsenic from low-salinity groundwater in rural areas of
   China. With this optimal arrangement, the NF system obtained fluoride
   and arsenic removal efficiencies of 70 similar to 73\% and 92 similar to
   94\% respectively, a preferable permeate flux of 73.37 L h(-1) m(2) and
   acceptable water flux recovery rate of 65\% at 16 degrees C. This
   optimal arrangement can further limit the potential membrane fouling by
   lowering the interstage Reynolds number. Moreover, the water product
   cost was lowest by the NF system with this optimal arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{Parametric response map (PRM) analysis is a voxel-wise technique for
   predicting overall treatment outcome, which shows promise as a tool for
   guiding personalized locally adaptive radiotherapy (RT). However, image
   registration error (IRE) introduces uncertainty into this analysis which
   may limit its use for guiding RT. Here we extend the PRM method to
   include an IRE-related PRM analysis confidence interval and also
   incorporate multiple graded classification thresholds to facilitate
   visualization. A Gaussian IRE model was used to compute an expected
   value and confidence interval for PRM analysis. The augmented PRM
   (A-PRM) was evaluated using CT-perfusion functional image data from
   patients treated with RT for glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Known
   rigid IREs were simulated by applying one thousand different rigid
   transformations to each image set. PRM and A-PRM analyses of the
   transformed images were then compared to analyses of the original images
   (ground truth) in order to investigate the two methods in the presence
   of controlled IRE. The A-PRM was shown to help visualize and quantify
   IRE-related analysis uncertainty. The use of multiple graded
   classification thresholds also provided additional contextual
   information which could be useful for visually identifying adaptive RT
   targets (e. g. sub-volume boosts). The A-PRM should facilitate reliable
   PRM guided adaptive RT by allowing the user to identify if a patient's
   unique IRE-related PRM analysis uncertainty has the potential to
   influence target delineation.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an asynchronous bi-directional amplify-and-forward relay
   network, where two single-antenna transceivers communicate with the help
   of several single-antenna relay nodes using a single-carrier
   communication scheme. The propagation delay of each relaying path,
   (which originates from one transceiver, goes through a certain relay,
   and ends at the other transceiver) is assumed to be different from those
   of the other relaying paths. This assumption turns the end-to-end link
   into a frequency selective channel which can have multiple taps. As
   such, intersymbol interference (ISI) is inevitable at the two
   transceivers. Assuming a block transmission/reception scheme, ISI
   results in interblock interference (IBI) between successive transmitted
   blocks. To combat IBI, cyclic prefix insertion and deletion as well as
   block postchannel equalization are used at the two transceivers.
   Assuming a limited total transmit power budget, we minimize the total
   mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated received signals at both
   transceivers by optimally obtaining the transceivers' transmit powers
   and the relay beamforming weight vector as well as the block
   post-channel equalizers at the two transceivers. We prove that this
   optimization problem leads to a relay selection scheme, where only the
   relays contributing to one tap of the end-to-end channel impulse
   response are turned on and the remaining relays are switched off.
   Moreover, we present a semi-closed-form solution for the optimal relay
   weight vector. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm
   significantly outperforms an equal power allocation scheme, where all
   nodes receive the same level of transmit power.}},

Abstract = {{La2O3 promoted Ni/gamma-Al2O3 fluidizable catalysts are studied for the
   steam gasification of a cellulose surrogate (glucose) and a lignin
   surrogate (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) in a CREC Riser Simulator. Two
   gamma-Al2O3 are considered as the support for an active and stable Ni
   catalyst. La2O3 modified supports and catalysts are characterized using
   BET specific surface area, XRD, TPR, TPO, and H-2-pulse chemisorption.
   Pyridine FTIR, NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD are employed to establish the effect
   of La2O3 on the aciditiy-basicity of the alumina used. It is shown that
   increasing the La2O3 up to 5 wt\% improves the BET surface area and the
   CO2 adsorption capacity, as well as reduces support acidity. XRD results
   revealed the formation of undesirable LaAlO3 on the Ni catalyst
   containing 10 wt\% La2O3. The 10 wt\% La2O3 also favors the formation of
   larger Ni crystallites which are susceptible to coking. In agreement
   with this, the catalyst containing 10 wt\% La2O3 gives lower dry gas
   yields and carbon conversions, as well as yields higher coking than the
   catalyst supported on alumina with 5 wt\% La2O3. On the other hand,
   catalysts supported on Sasol gamma-Al2O3 display higher surface area, Ni
   reducibility and dispersion, and CO2 adsorption capacity than the Alcan
   gamma-Al2O3 supported catalysts. The addition of 5 wt\% La2O3 further
   enhances both the structural properties and the reactivity of Ni/Sasol
   gamma-Al2O3 catalyst. In particular, catalytic gasification using 20\%
   Ni on a 5\% La2O3-Sasol gamma-Al2O3 catalyst shows promising glucose and
   2-methoxy-4-methylphenol conversions to a high-quality synthesis gas at
   only 650 degrees C. This catalyst yields a 95\% carbon conversion of
   glucose to permanent gases with no tar formation and negligible coke
   deposition; whereas a 81\% carbon conversion with only 10.5 wt\% tars is
   achieved from 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol gasification. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study focuses on a mathematical description of elution of aromatic
   species in a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 mu m BPX5 capillary column.
   Experimental studies involve the detection of chemical species at the
   capillary column outlet. Using the recorded peaks, statistical moments
   of different orders are calculated for both toluene and naphthalene.
   Modeling studies involve a laminar flow model with an equilibrium
   coefficient (K-s) and a solute diffusion coefficient in the stationary
   phase (D-s). Model validation is developed by performing experiments at
   different carrier gas velocities and GC oven temperatures. Under the
   conditions, neither the first statistical moment (M-1) nor the second
   statistical moment (M-2) is affected by the carrier gas velocity. Thus,
   the interface equilibrium coefficients (K-s) and the diffusion
   coefficients (D-s) solely depend on the solute and the capillary column
   polymer coating properties. Furthermore, the statistical moments of
   different orders show that the proposed interface equilibrium based
   model in the ``narrow bore{''} 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 mu m BPX5 capillary
   column is adequate for aromatic species such as toluene and naphthalene.}},

   multiple scalar fields}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Multiscale renormalization group (RG) methods are reviewed and applied
   to the analysis of the effective potential for radiative symmetry
   breaking with multiple scalar fields, allowing an extension of the
   Gildener and Weinberg method beyond the weak coupling limit. A model
   containing two interacting real scalar fields is used to illustrate
   multiscale RG methods and the multiscale RG functions of this model are
   calculated to one-loop order for the beta function and two-loop order
   for the anomalous mass dimension. The introduction of an extra
   renormalization scale allows the mapping of the effective potential in
   this model onto a RG-equivalent form with an O(2) symmetric structure
   along a particular trajectory in the multiple renormalization-scale
   space, leading to a simplified form of the effective potential. It is
   demonstrated that the physical content of the effective potential in the
   original model, referenced to a single conventional renormalization
   scale, can be extracted from a particular RG trajectory that connects to
   this multiscale O(2)-symmetric form of the effective potential.
   Extensions of these multiscale methods for effective potentials in
   models containing multiple scalars with O(M) x O(N) symmetry are also
   discussed.}},

   changes its sign while passing through a node. It is revealed that the

Abstract = {{Destabilization of lead corrosion scales present in plumbing materials
   used in water distribution systems results in eleveated lead
   concentrations in drinking water. Soluble lead release caused by changes
   in water chemistry has been linked to dissolution of lead carbonate
   and/or lead oxide solid phases. Although prior studies have examined the
   effects of varying water chemistry on the dissolution of plattnerite
   (beta-PbO2), beta-PbO2 dissolution under depleting chlorine conditions
   is poorly understood. This paper reports results obtained for long-term
   batch dissolution experiments for solid phase beta-PbO2 under depleting
   chlorine conditions. Results indicate that the initial availability of
   free chlorine effectively depresses dissolved lead concentrations
   released from beta-PbO2. However, the dissolved lead levels remained low
   (similar to 4 mu g/L) even after free chlorine was depleted. Detailed
   spectroscopic characterization of solid samples collected during the
   beta-PbO2 experiments indicates that changes in the electronic structure
   of PbO2 occurred during the dissolution. This further points out the
   Pb2+ defects present in crystalline beta-PbO2 play a dominant role in
   the dissolution of this solid phase.}},

Abstract = {{Disruption of calmodulin (CaM)-based protein interactions has been
   touted as a potential means for modulating several disease pathways.
   Among these is SOX9, which is a DNA binding protein that is involved in
   chrondrocyte differentiation and regulation of the hormones that control
   sexual development. In this work, we employed a magnetic fishing/mass
   spectrometry assay in conjunction with intrinsic fluorescence to examine
   the interaction of CaM with the CaM-binding domain of SOX9 (SOX-CAL),
   and to assess the modulation of this interaction by known anti-CaM
   compounds. Our data show that there is a high affinity interaction
   between CaM and SOX-CAL (27 +/- 9 nM), and that SOX-CAL bound to the
   same location as the well-known CaM antagonist melittin; unexpectedly,
   we also found that addition of CaM-binding small molecules initially
   produced increased SOX-CAL binding, indicative of binding to both the
   well-known high-affinity CaM binding site and a second, lower-affinity
   binding site.}},

Title = {{Bioactivity and Biocompatibility of a Novel Wollastonite Glass-Ceramic

Abstract = {{Using wet chemistry, a novel wollastonite glass-ceramic (WGC) was
   previously synthesized for one-piece dental implant applications. It
   exhibited high strength, and excellent chemical durability and
   machinability. Objectives of the present study were to evaluate the
   bioactivity and biocompatibility of this WGC and to compare its
   properties to those of In-Ceram yttria partially stabilized zirconia
   (YZ). Bioactivity of WGC and YZ was assessed by soaking specimens in
   simulated body fluid (SBF). Scanning electron microscopy, energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to monitor
   the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the specimen surfaces. WGC
   induced the formation of bone-like carbonated HA when soaked in SBF; in
   contrast, YZ specimens did not exhibit bioactivity, even after being
   soaked in SBF for 4 weeks. In vitro biocompatibility was studied by
   seeding MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells and calvarial osteoblasts on the
   specimens. Cell attachment, focal adhesion formation, cell
   proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were evaluated.
   Both WGC and YZ supported osteoblast attachment and proliferation. Cell
   spreading, focal adhesion formation and ALP activity were comparable on
   both materials indicating excellent biocompatibility of WGC. We conclude
   that WGC is a promising material for non-metallic dental implant
   applications due to its bioactivity and biocompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{The success of engineered tissues has been limited, in part, by the
   inability to deliver sufficient oxygen to the growing constructs due to
   the low solubility of oxygen in culture media. In this work we have
   utilized cyclodextrin inclusion complexes (CD: ICs) with
   perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene (PFP) as oxygen carriers to enhance oxygen
   delivery to cells seeded on 3D scaffolds. The CD:ICs were successfully
   embedded in both biostable and biodegradable scaffolds, poly(carbonate
   urethane) (PCU) and polycaprolactone (PCL), respectively, demonstrating
   the versatility of the approach and its potential to be applied to
   different materials. Electrospinning was used as the scaffold
   fabrication technique, and it was possible to optimize the solution
   concentration and electrospinning conditions in order to fabricate 3D
   fibrous mats with appropriate morphology and average fiber diameters
   within the acceptable range for tissue engineering applications.
   Dissolved oxygen increased significantly in the presence of PFP and
   CD:IC when compared to a PBS control at concentrations as low as 1\%,
   demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, dissolved
   oxygen in scaffolds modified by CD:IC was significantly higher than
   control scaffolds after incubation periods of 5 days for PCU and 3 days
   for PCL. The dissolved oxygen concentration remained significantly
   higher over the remainder of the 14 day incubation period. Taken
   together, our data suggests that CD:ICs prepared with perfluorocarbons
   could be used as oxygen carriers to enhance oxygen delivery to tissue
   engineered constructs.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun core shell fibers have gained increasing popularity in
   biomedical applications ranging from tissue regeneration to wound

   are critical for controlled delivery of bioactive molecules for these

   type I as the shell and a model protein, bovine serum albumin, as the
   core were prepared using coaxial electrospinning in both the horizontal
   and vertical configurations. High speed photography was used to observe
   the formation of the Taylor cone and fiber whipping motion during the
   fiber spinning process. Morphological considerations and core shell
   structure of the fibers indicated that the vertical configuration is
   preferred for core shell fiber preparation. The electrospun core shell
   collagen fibers prepared using optimized experimental setup and
   parameters and crosslinked using genipin also demonstrated good cell
   compatibility properties.}},

Title = {{In vitro assessment of the contact mechanics of reverse-engineered
   distal humeral hemiarthroplasty prostheses}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{990-996}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Distal humeral hemiarthroplasty alters cartilage contact
   mechanics, which may predispose to ostearthritis. Current prostheses do
   not replicate the native anatomy, and therefore contribute to these
   changes. We hypothesized that prostheses reverse-engineered from the
   native bone shape would provide similar contact patterns as the native
   articulation.
   Methods: Reverse-engineered hemiarthroplasty prostheses were
   manufactured for five cadaveric elbows based on CT images of the distal
   humerus. Passive flexion trials with constant muscle forces were
   performed with the native articulation intact while bone motions were
   recorded using a motion tracking system. Motion trials were then
   repeated after the distal humerus was replaced with a corresponding
   reverse-engineered prosthesis. Contact areas and patterns were
   reconstructed using computer models created from CT scan images combined
   with the motion tracker data. The total contact areas, as well as the
   contact area within smaller sub-regions of the ulna and radius, were
   analyzed for changes resulting from hemiarthroplasty using
   repeated-measures ANOVAs.
   Findings: Contact area at the ulna and radius decreased on average 42\%
   (SD 19\%, P=.008) and 41\% (SD 42\%, P=.096), respectively. Contact area
   decreases were not uniform throughout the different sub-regions,
   suggesting that contact patterns were also altered.
   Interpretation: Reverse-engineered prostheses did not reproduce the same
   contact pattern as the native joints, possibly because the thickness of
   the distal humerus cartilage layer was neglected when generating the
   prosthesis shapes or as a consequence of the increased stiffness of the
   metallic implants. Alternative design strategies and materials for
   hemiarthroplasty should be considered in future work. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Steel corrosion induces distress in concrete structures, resulting in
   the cracking and spalling of the concrete cover, which accelerates
   further damage. Chloride ions (cl(-)) and carbonation are the primary
   causes of steel corrosion in concrete. This study investigates the
   effects of Cl- in precast concrete tunnel lining (PCTL) segments through
   conducting various tests on cylindrical cores extracted from
   conventional reinforced concrete (RC) and steel fiber-reinforced
   concrete (SFRC) segments. The full-scale PCTL segments were fabricated
   and cured at an industrial precast plant. Experimental results show that
   the external specimens (extrados and intrados faces) of both the RC and
   SFRC PCTL segments exhibited lower Cl- penetration due to surface
   treatment using a cement slurry. The Cl- diffusion coefficient was a
   function of the exposure period and concentration of the salt solution
   for both the RC and SFRC segments. SFRC PCTL segments better resisted
   the ingress of Cl- than control RC segments due to a barrier effect
   induced by steel fibers (SF), which helped inhibiting the penetration of
   into the hardened concrete. This study demonstrates the potential of
   SFRC as a more durable alternative for precast segmental tunnel linings
   compared to conventional RC.}},

   MethodsWe measured lower extremity muscle fat, morphological changes in
   descending spinal cord pathways with advanced MRI applications and
   maximal activation of the plantar flexors.
   ResultsLarger magnitudes of lower extremity muscle fat corresponded to
   altered spinal cord anatomy and reductions in the ability to maximally

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Azobenzene was introduced as a new multiresponsive end-cap for
   self-immolative polymers Using small-molecule model compounds, it was
   demonstrated that reducing agents including hydrazine and dithiothreitol
   could reduce the azobenzene to the corresponding hydrazobenzene,
   resulting in a 1,6-elimination reaction with the potential to initiate
   the depolymerization of self-immolative polycarbaniates. An activated
   azobenzene derivative was then prepared, allowing for its incorporation
   as an end cap for Polycarbamates based on alternating
   N,N'-climethylethylene diamine and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. Upon
   treatment with hydrazine, depolymenzation proceeded. To demonstrate the
   versatility of this end cap, the chemistry was also applied to
   polycarbamates based on 4-anunobenzyl alcohol In addition to allowing
   triggered depolymerization, the azobenzene end cap also provides a
   visual signal upon triggering owing to the strong visible absorption of
   the azobenzene, which shifts to the UV range upon reduction.
   Furthermore, azobenzene is capable of undergoing trans-cis isomerization
   in response to UV light, providing multiple functions in a single end
   cap.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The influence of mechanical stimulation on the formation of
   torus mandibularis (TM) is still poorly understood. We sought to
   understand the etiology of TMs by investigating the role of
   parafunctional activity and mandibular morphology on the formation of
   TMs.
   Materials and Methods: We designed a case-control study for patients
   attending the dental clinic of the present study (University of Sao
   Paulo School of Dentistry, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil). Patients presenting
   with TMs were defined as cases, and those without TMs were defined as
   controls. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used in 3-dimensional
   mandibular models to examine the stress distribution in the mandibles
   with and without TMs. In addition, the associations of mandibular arch
   shape, mandibular cortical index, and parafunctional activity with the
   presence of T were assessed using odds ratio analysis.
   Results: A total of 10 patients with TMs and 37 without TMs were
   selected (22 men and 25 women, mean age 54.3 +/- 8.4 years). FEA showed
   a stress concentration in the region in which TMs form during simulation
   of parafunctional activity. The radiographic assessment showed that
   those with TMs were more likely to have a square-shaped mandible with
   sharp angles (P = .001) and a normal mandibular cortex (P = .03). The
   subjects without TMs had a round-shaped mandible with obtuse angles and
   an eroded mandibular cortex.
   Conclusions: Parafunctional activity could be causing the formation of
   TMs by concentrating mechanical stress in the region in which TMs
   usually form. Thus, mandibular geometries that favor stress
   concentration, such as square-shaped mandibles, will be associated with
   a greater prevalence of TMs. (C) 2014 American Association of Oral and

Abstract = {{Micafish porphyroclasts are common and excellent shear-sense indicators
   in mylonites. Although their geometries are well characterized by recent
   studies, they are still poorly understood. Here we simulate the behavior
   in mylonites of micafish by regarding them as anisotropic power-law
   ellipsoidal inhomogeneities embedded in a power-law viscous material
   subjected to general plane-straining non-coaxial flows. We apply the
   Eshelby's solutions extended for general non-Newtonian power-law
   materials. The anisotropy of mica is defined by two different shear
   viscosities: a weak shear viscosity associated with slip on cleavage and
   a strong shear viscosity without activating the cleavage slip. Our
   modeling reproduces naturally observed geometries of micafish. Natural
   micafish geometries require that the weak shear viscosity of mica must
   be lower and the strong shear viscosity must be greater than the matrix
   viscosity. We demonstrate that regardless of the initial condition of
   micafish, the shape long axis and the cleavage trace observed on the
   vorticity-normal section will most commonly end up at a small antithetic
   angle relative to the shear plane or parallel to it. Our modeling
   results are consistent with the mica rheological properties determined
   by rock deformation experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation
   in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Three-dimensional (3D) prostate image segmentation is useful
   for cancer diagnosis and therapy guidance, but can be time-consuming to
   perform manually and involves varying levels of difficulty and
   interoperator variability within the prostatic base, midgland (MG), and
   apex. In this study, the authors measured accuracy and interobserver
   variability in the segmentation of the prostate on T2-weighted
   endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within the whole gland (WG),
   and separately within the apex, midgland, and base regions.
   Methods: The authors collected MR images from 42 prostate cancer
   patients. Prostate border delineation was performed manually by one
   observer on all images and by two other observers on a subset of ten
   images. The authors used complementary boundary-, region-, and
   volume-based metrics {[}mean absolute distance (MAD), Dice similarity
   coefficient (DSC), recall rate, precision rate, and volume difference
   (Delta V)] to elucidate the different types of segmentation errors that
   they observed. Evaluation for expert manual and semiautomatic
   segmentation approaches was carried out. Compared to manual
   segmentation, the authors' semiautomatic approach reduces the necessary
   user interaction by only requiring an indication of the anteroposterior
   orientation of the prostate and the selection of prostate center points
   on the apex, base, and midgland slices. Based on these inputs, the
   algorithm identifies candidate prostate boundary points using learned
   boundary appearance characteristics and performs regularization based on
   learned prostate shape information.
   Results: The semiautomated algorithm required an average of 30 s of user
   interaction time (measured for nine operators) for each 3D prostate
   segmentation. The authors compared the segmentations from this method to
   manual segmentations in a single-operator (mean whole gland MAD=2.0 mm,
   DSC=82\%, recall=77\%, precision = 88\%, and Delta V = -4.6 cm(3)) and
   multioperator study (mean whole gland MAD=2.2 mm, DSC = 77\%, recall =
   72\%, precision = 86\%, and Delta V = -4.0 cm(3)). These results
   compared favorably with observed differences between manual
   segmentations and a simultaneous truth and performance level estimation
   reference for this data set (whole gland differences as high as MAD =
   3.1 mm, DSC = 78\%, recall = 66\%, precision = 77\%, and Delta V = 15.5
   cm(3)). The authors found that overall, midgland segmentation was more
   accurate and repeatable than the segmentation of the apex and base, with
   the base posing the greatest challenge.
   Conclusions: The main conclusions of this study were that (1) the
   semiautomated approach reduced interobserver segmentation variability;
   (2) the segmentation accuracy of the semiautomated approach, as well as
   the accuracies of recently published methods from other groups, were
   within the range of observed expert variability in manual prostate
   segmentation; and (3) further efforts in the development of
   computer-assisted segmentation would be most productive if focused on
   improvement of segmentation accuracy and reduction of variability within
   the prostatic apex and base. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{The ancient silk road of China passed through Xinjiang and facilitated
   gene exchanges from the East and the West which impacted on the genetic
   variation and structure of the nomadic Kazakh population residing there.
   In order to understand the nature of this genetic variation, 151
   Xinjiang Kazakh samples were obtained from four main Kazakh groups and
   were analyzed using mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers. The Xinjiang Kazakh
   population is heterogeneous, showing the coexistence of matrilineal
   lineages with different origins. No genetic differentiation of mtDNA is
   observed among the four different regional Xinjiang Kazakh populations
   in Xinjiang by AMOVA and Networks. The genetic diversity of Y-STR loci
   is higher in Xinjiang Kazakhs (0.968 +/- 0.014) than the Kazakhs from
   Kazakhstan (0.629 +/- 0.071) and Russia (0.835 +/- 0.020). East
   Eurasians make a more than 50\% contribution to the maternal and
   paternal lineages of Xinjiang Kazakhs. There is more gene flow from West
   Eurasian into the maternal lineages of Xinjiang Kazakh than to the
   Kazakhs from Russia and Kazakhstan. Moreover, mtDNA and Y-STR displayed
   high polymorphism in Xinjiang Kazakhs (the haplotype diversity and power
   of discrimination were 0.990 +/- 0.003, 0.9137 for mtDNA HVS and 0.968
   +/- 0.014, 0.9489 for Y-STR system, respectively) suggesting they would
   be very useful and important markers for forensic analysis and
   population genetic studies.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of an Emergency Department Lean Process Improvement Program

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: In recent years, lean principles have been applied to
   improve wait times in the emergency department (ED). In 2009, an ED
   process improvement program based on lean methods was introduced in
   Ontario as part of a broad strategy to reduce ED length of stay and
   improve patient flow. This study seeks to determine the effect of this
   program on ED wait times and quality of care.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all ED visits at
   program and control sites during 3 program waves from April 1, 2007, to
   June 30, 2011, in Ontario, Canada. Time series analyses of outcomes
   before and after the program and difference-in-differences analyses
   comparing changes in program sites with control sites were conducted.
   Results: In before-after models among program sites alone, 90th
   percentile ED length of stay did not change in wave 1 (-14 minutes
   {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\} -47 to 20]) but decreased after wave
   2 (-87 {[}95\% CI -108 to -66]) and wave 3 (-33 {[}95\% CI -50 to -17]);
   median ED length of stay decreased after wave 1 (-18 {[}95\% CI -24 to
   -12]), wave 2 (-23 {[}95\% CI -27 to -19]), and wave 3 (-15 {[}95\% CI
   -18 to -12]). In all waves, decreases were observed in time to physician
   assessment, left-without-being-seen rates, and 72-hour ED revisit rates.
   In the difference-in-difference models, in which changes in program
   sites were compared with controls, the program was associated with no
   change in 90th percentile ED length of stay in wave 2 (17 {[}95\% CI
   -0.2 to 33]) and increases in wave 1 (23 {[}95\% CI 0.9 to 45]) and wave
   3 (31 {[}95\% CI 10 to 51]), modest reductions in median ED length of
   stay in waves 2 and 3 alone, and a decrease in time to physician
   assessment in wave 3 alone.
   Conclusion: Although the program reduced ED waiting times, it appeared
   that its benefits were diminished or disappeared when compared with that
   of control sites, which were exposed to system-wide initiatives such as
   public reporting and pay for performance. This study suggests that
   further evaluation of the effectiveness of lean methods in the ED is
   warranted before widespread implementation.}},

Abstract = {{3D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using an unsteady
   solver with steady inlet conditions are carried out to investigate the
   wind load and flow field around a ground mounted stand-alone
   photovoltaic (PV) system with 25 degrees panel tilt angle immersed in
   the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) using the shear stress transport
   (SST) k-omega turbulence closure. Wind directions of the incoming flow
   are varied from 0 degrees to 180 degrees at 45 degrees intervals. Mean
   pressure coefficients on the surfaces of the PV panel are compared with
   the wind tunnel measurement by Abiola-Ogedengbe (2013) and an agreement
   within 46\% is found. Coefficients of drag, lift and overturning moment
   for the PV system are computed from the numerical simulations. In terms
   of maximum uplift, 180 degrees is found to be the critical wind
   direction whereas in terms of overturning moments, 45 degrees and 135
   degrees are the critical wind directions. The wind velocity and
   vorticity fields around the panel are correlated and analyzed with
   respect to the pressure distribution on the panel surfaces. (C) 2014

Title = {{Influence of tides and waves on the fate of nutrients in a nearshore
   aquifer: Numerical simulations}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{203-213}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A numerical investigation is presented that demonstrates the influence
   of tides and waves on the transport and transformation of nutrients
   (NO3-; NH4+; PO43-) in a homogeneous unconfined nearshore aquifer and
   subsequent fluxes to the sea. Simulations of an aquifer subject to
   semi-diurnal tides and constant waves acting on a sloping beach face
   were conducted using SEAWAT-2005 combined with PHT3D v2.10. Tidal
   amplitude (A) and wave height (H-rms) varying from 0.25 to 0.75 m and 1
   to 2 m, respectively, were examined. Results show that tides and waves
   modify the subsurface discharge pathway of land-derived nutrients by
   changing the nearshore groundwater flow dynamics. More importantly, the
   oceanic forcing impacts nutrient cycling as it causes significant
   seawater exchange (along with dissolved O-2 and organic matter) across
   the aquifer-ocean interface. Although steady wave forcing caused higher
   seawater influx, tides led to greater seawater-freshwater mixing in the
   nearshore aquifer and subsequently greater transformation of
   land-derived nutrients. Nutrient processing was strongly controlled by
   the availability and reactivity of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   as its degradation consumed O-2, released inorganic N and P, and altered
   redox conditions in the salt-freshwater mixing zones. For the conditions
   and reaction network simulated, nutrient regeneration by marine DOM
   degradation was independent of the seawater-freshwater mixing intensity,
   and therefore was greatest for the wave case due to the high seawater
   influx. For simulations without marine DOM considered, NO3- discharge to
   the sea increased by 32\% for the tidal case (A = 0.5 m) compared to
   only 13\% and 8\% for the wave (H-rms = 1 m) and no oceanic forcing
   cases. With labile marine DOM considered, the NO3- discharge decreased
   by 90\% relative to the land-derived flux for the tidal case (A = 0.5
   m). For all simulations PO43- removal was high due to its adsorption to
   Fe oxide minerals. The model enables evaluation of the complex coupled
   physical-biogeochemical processes controlling nutrient loading to the
   sea via submarine groundwater discharge in dynamic coastal environments.

Abstract = {{Rechargeable metal-air batteries are widely considered as the next
   generation high energy density electrochemical storage devices. The
   performance and rechargeability of these metal-air cells are highly
   dependent on the positive electrode material, where oxygen reduction and
   evolution reactions take place. Here, for the first time, we provide a
   detailed account of the kinetics and rechargeability of sodium-air
   batteries through a series of carefully designed tests on a treated
   commercial carbon material. Surface area and porous structure of the
   positive electrode material were controlled in order to gain detailed
   information about the reaction kinetics of sodium-air batteries. The
   results indicate that discharge capacity is linearly correlated with
   surface area while morphology of the solid discharge product is strongly
   dependent on specific surface area and pore size. Furthermore, it was
   found that the chemical composition of discharge products as well as
   charging overpotential is affected by discharge reaction rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we construct novel RNA nanoclusters, RNA nanotubes made
   of several nanorings up to the size of 20 nm, utilizing the molecular
   dynamics simulation, and study their structural properties {[}i.e., the
   root mean square deviation, the radius of gyration and the radial
   distribution function (RDF)] in physiological solutions that can be used
   for drug delivery into the human body. The patterns of energy and
   temperature variations of the systems are also discussed. Furthermore,
   we study the concentration of ions around the tube as a function of time
   at a particular temperature. We have found that when the temperature
   increases, the number of ions increases within a certain distance of the
   tube. We report that the number of ions within this distance around the
   tubes decreases in quenched runs. This indicates that some ions

Abstract = {{This paper presents new theoretical results on the passivity and
   passification of a class of memristor-based recurrent neural networks
   (MRNNs) with time-varying delays. The casual assumptions on the
   boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of neuronal activation functions
   are relaxed. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals
   and using the characteristic function technique, passivity conditions
   are cast in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be
   checked numerically using an LMI toolbox. Based on these conditions, two
   procedures for designing passification controllers are proposed, which
   guarantee that MRNNs with time-varying delays are passive. Finally, two
   illustrative examples are presented to show the characteristics of the
   main results in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The plastic geometry factors, i.e. the eta(pl) and gamma(pl) factors,
   are needed to calculate the J-integral from the load vs. crack mouth
   opening displacement (CMOD) or load-line displacement (LLD) curve in the
   J-R curve test. In this study, we carry out a systematic investigation
   of the no factor for plane-sided and sidegrooved SE(B) specimens with a
   wide range of crack depths (alW ranging from 0.3 to 0.7) and
   thicknessto-width ratios (B/W equal to 0.5, 1 and 2) based on
   three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses (FEA). To examine the
   accuracy of the eta(pl) factors suggested in ASTM E1820, the
   corresponding estimated] value are compared with the J value obtained
   from the 3D FEA based on both the large-strain and small-strain
   formulations. The LLD- and CMOD-based plastic eta(pl) factors
   corresponding to both the average J value over the crack front and the
   local J value at the mid-thickness of the crack front are evaluated. The
   main finding of this study is that besides the crack depth, both the
   thickness and side grooves of the specimens have observable impacts on
   the eta(pl) factor. Based on the results of the 3D large-strain FEA, a
   set of expressions for the eta(pl) and gamma(pl) factors are proposed.
   The results of this study can improve the accuracy of the experimentally
   determined J R curve and facilitate the use of non-standard
   medium-cracked (0.3 <= a/W < 0.45) SE(B) specimens for the J-R curves

Abstract = {{(1) To evaluate the effect of staged bilateral medial opening wedge high
   tibial osteotomy (HTO) on established biomechanical risk factors for
   disease progression and on validated measures of pain and function and
   (2) To compare outcomes in patients having the second surgery staged
   within or beyond 12 months of the first surgery.
   Thirty-seven patients with bilateral varus alignment and medial
   compartment osteoarthritis underwent staged bilateral medial opening
   wedge HTO (21 within and 16 beyond 12 months). Patients underwent
   full-limb standing anteroposterior radiographs to determine frontal
   plane alignment (mechanical axis angle) and three-dimensional gait
   analysis to estimate the distribution of load across the tibiofemoral
   compartments (external knee adduction moment). Patients also completed
   the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS), the Lower
   Extremity Functional Scale, the Short Form Health Survey and the
   six-minute walk test (6MWT). Patients (both limbs) were evaluated before
   and approximately 6, 12 and 24 months after each surgery.
   There were statistically and clinically significant changes in both
   limbs that were of similar magnitudes and that remained relatively
   stable over time postoperatively. Mean (95 \% CI) improvements in
   outcomes were as follows. Mechanical axis angle: 9.4A degrees (8.4A
   degrees, 10.4A degrees) (i.e. average change of both limbs), peak knee
   adduction moment: -1.7 \%BW{*}Ht (-2.1, -1.4 \%BW{*}Ht) (i.e. average
   change of both limbs), 6MWT: 36.7 m (19.4, 54.0 m), SF-12 Physical
   Component Summary: 12.0 (8.5, 15.5) and KOOS Pain: 25.4 (19.6, 31.2).
   Other than the shorter time period to reach maximum benefit of both
   surgeries, there were no remarkable differences at final assessment
   between patients having surgeries staged within or beyond 12 months.
   The present findings demonstrate that patients with bilateral varus
   gonarthrosis experience marked improvements in established biomechanical
   risk factors for disease progression bilaterally (mechanical axis angles
   and external knee adduction moments), as well as clinically important
   improvements in patient-important outcomes, after staged medial opening
   wedge HTO. Current findings suggest no difference in outcomes for
   patients who have the second surgery staged within or beyond 12 months
   of the first surgery.

Abstract = {{Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) were fabricated for the first time
   using a semiconductor copolymer of diketopyrrolopyrrole-quarterthiophene
   (DPP-QT) and unsorted single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Three
   different SWCNTs having different tube diameters, length, and shape were
   used to investigate the effects of carbon nanotubes' properties on
   dispersion of the SWCNTs in DPP-QT polymer, as well as the mobility and
   current on/off ratio of the OTFTs. The DPP-QT polymer was able to
   selectively disperse two types of SWCNTs. An optimal SWCNT loading was
   found to be 1.5-2.5 wt\% for these SWCNTs, before the on/off ratio fell
   below 10(5) due to increased metallic tube content of the film. At this
   optimal loading, the field effect mobility was improved by a factor of
   two, with the maximum mobility reaching 1.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), when the
   SWCNTs with a short length and small tube diameter were used. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to investigate fluid temperature
   fields inside a flat-plate solar collector tube. The results show the
   highest fluid temperature at the upper end of the tube which decreased
   gradually to the lowest value at the bottom end of the tube, whereas,
   the temperature field in the horizontal plane is symmetric about the
   centerline. The vertical temperature gradients vary with the axial
   distance. The local fluid temperature increased nonlinearly along the
   collector length and its magnitude decreased with an increase in the
   Reynolds number. The local Rayleigh number increased with the axial
   distance and at a given location, its magnitude increased with a
   decrease in the Reynolds number, whereas, the local Nusselt number
   trends in flat-plate collector tube are in general similar to that in
   the conventional laminar channel flows. The local fluid temperature
   increased with an increase in the incident heat flux at a given
   collector orientation but decreased for the inclined collectors. The
   results show that over the given Reynolds number range, the fluid in a
   flat-plate collector tube is stably stratified over most of the fluid
   cross-sectional domain and the convective currents are suppressed and
   restricted to a thin layer adjacent to the lower tube wall. The results
   from the present study provide the physical explanation for the heat
   transfer enhancement by insert devices. That is, the insert devices
   disrupt the stably stratified layer and induce mixing which enhances the
   heat transfer.}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics-based shape optimization process is
   employed to determine a pore-level geometry for high-conductivity
   graphitic foams which is optimal with respect to the criterion of
   entropy generation minimization, under operating conditions relevant to
   the implementation of such a foam in an enhanced heat transfer device.
   The optimization procedure is applied to a single pore, subject to
   operating conditions which reflect a typical pore in the bulk of the
   foam, far removed from the influences of the macroscopic boundaries of
   the porous region. Constraints are imposed upon the geometry to ensure
   the pore structure arrived at may be manufactured by a reasonable
   process, and to ensure the validity of the analysis. The optimal,
   ellipsoidal pore geometry obtained is found to achieve a significant
   reduction in the resistance to convective thermal exchange between
   constituents, at the cost of an increased resistance to fluid flow. (C)

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) previously revealed the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of
   ventilation defects in asthmatics, but these findings have not been used
   in treatment studies or to guide personalized therapy. Our objective was
   to exploit the temporal and spatial information inherent to He-3 MRI and
   develop image processing methods to generate pulmonary ventilation
   temporal-spatial maps that could be used to measure, optimize, and guide
   asthma therapy.
   Materials and Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, seven asthmatics
   provided written informed consent to an approved protocol and underwent
   spirometry and He-3 MRI on three occasions, each 5 +/- 2 days apart. A
   registration and segmentation pipeline was developed to generate
   three-dimensional, temporalspatial, pulmonary function maps. Briefly,
   He-3 ventilation images were segmented to generate ventilation masks
   that were coregistered and voxels classified according to their temporal
   behavior. This enabled the regional mapping of temporally persistent and
   intermittent ventilation defects that were normalized to the H-1 MRI
   thoracic cavity volume to generate persistent ventilation defect percent
   (VDPP) and intermittent ventilation defect percent (VDPI).
   Results: He-3 temporalspatial pulmonary function maps identified
   temporally persistent and intermittent ventilation defects. VDPI was
   significantly greater in the posterior (P = .04) and inferior (P = .04)
   lung as compared to the anterior and superior lung. Persistent and
   intermittent ventilation defect percent were strongly correlated with
   forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (VDPP: r =
   -0.87, P = .01; VDPI: r = -0.96, P = .0008).
   Conclusions: Temporal-spatial pulmonary maps generated from He-3 MRI can
   be used to quantify temporally persistent and intermittent ventilation
   defects as asthma intermediate end points and targets for therapy.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, formic acid (FA) was employed as an in-situ hydrogen
   donor for the reductive de-polymerization of kraft lignin (KL). Under
   the optimum operating conditions, i.e., 300 degrees C, 1 h, 18.6 wt.\%
   substrate concentration, 50/50 (v/v) water-ethanol medium with FA at a
   FA-to-lignin mass ratio of 0.7, KL (M-w similar to 10,000 g/mol) was
   effectively de-polymerized, producing de-polymerized lignin (DL, M-w
   1270 g/mol) at a yield of similar to 90 wt.\% and <1 wt.\% yield of
   solid residue (SR). The M-W of the DL products decreased with increasing
   reaction temperature, time and FA-to-lignin mass ratio. The sulfur
   contents of all DL products were remarkably lower than that in the
   original KL. It was also demonstrated that FA is a more reactive
   hydrogen source than external hydrogen for reductive de-polymerization

Abstract = {{Concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) using the stream control
   transmission protocol (SCTP) can exploit multihomed devices to enhance
   data communications. While SCTP is a new transport layer protocol
   supporting multihomed end-points, CMT provides a framework so that
   transport layer resources are used efficiently and effectively when
   sending to the same destination with multiple IP addresses. In this
   paper, we present two techniques for modelling the expected throughput
   of a CMT session; while one is based on renewal theory, the other uses a
   Markov chain. As far as we know, ours is the first paper to model CMT
   whilst considering practical transport layer resources like a shared
   receive buffer (RBUF). A comparison of the models showed the Markov
   chain to be more accurate, but suffered from scalability issues.
   Alternatively, the renewal model was more cost effective, but also less
   accurate. We also applied our models to a new problem called congestion
   window management, where the size of each congestion window is
   reconfigured for optimal performance. Again, we compared two approaches:
   a dynamic method that makes decisions based on instantaneous throughput,
   and a static method that uses an integer linear program (ILP) to
   generate a global solution. Results showed the static method
   outperforming the dynamic approach by as much as 12 percent.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a new fluidizable Ni catalyst supported on La2O3
   modified gamma-Al2O3. The 20\% Ni/5\% La2O3-gamma Al2O3 catalyst is
   prepared using a specially designed multistep incipient wetness
   technique and direct reduction of metal nitrate precursors. Steam
   gasification of glucose (a biomass surrogate), is developed in a CREC
   Riser Simulator using the new fluidizable catalyst. Experiments are
   performed at different steam/biomass ratios, temperatures and reaction
   times. Catalytic gasification runs confirm the high performance of the
   Ni/La2O3-gamma Al2O3 in terms of reforming activity, and reduced coke
   formation. Furthermore, observed gasification products (Hz, CO, CO2, and
   CH4) are in agreement with thermodynamics, with product yields
   approaching chemical equilibrium as the reaction time is increased.
   Furthermore, the value of the Ni/La2O3-gamma Al2O3 catalyst is
   demonstrated while comparing its improved performance with respect to
   the one of other prepared catalysts: (i) an unpromoted NihiAl(2)O(3) and
   (ii) a Ni/La2O3-gamma Al2O3 prepared via metal precursor calcination.
   Prepared catalysts are also characterized using BET surface area
   analysis, TPR, TPO, Hz-pulse chemisorption, pyridine FTIR, CO2 and NH3
   TPD. It is shown that the addition of lanthanum oxides reduces surface
   area losses, increasing the thermal stability of gamma-Al2O3. La2O3 also
   improves reducibility and dispersion of the active phase by decreasing
   nickel-aluminate formation. Pyridine FTIR confirms the absence of
   Brensted acid sites in gamma-Al2O3, with La2O3 reducing Lewis acidity.
   Multiple TPO and TPR experiments also show that the prepared catalyst
   remains stable under repeated oxidation and reduction cycles. As a
   result, it is proven that the enhanced gasification activity of the
   Ni/La2O3-gamma Al2O3 fluidizable catalyst of the present study is in
   line with their various and favorable structural properties (available
   Ni surface area and basicity/acidity ratio) modifications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this work was to investigate and compare the
   treatability of very high suspended solids with different biodegradable
   particulate fractions and COD fractionation, thin stillage (a by-product
   from the corn ethanol industry) as well as primary sludge from municipal
   wastewater treatment, using an anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor
   (AnFBR) employing US Mesh 30 x 40 zeolite with a diameter of (d(m)) in
   the range of 425-610 mu m and specific surface area (SSA) of 26.5 m(2)/g
   as the carrier media. Each experimental run lasted over a six-month
   period. Due to the long-term impact of accumulation of inert suspended
   solids in the AnFBR and potential active biomass washout leading to
   failure, treatability of high suspended-solid streams can be very
   challenging. Despite the very high strength of thin stillage and primary
   sludge with chemical oxygen demand of 130,000 mg TCOD/L and 42,000 mg
   TCOD/L respectively and suspended solids of 47,000 mg TSS/L and 34,000
   mg TSS/L, the AnFBR showed, up to 88\% and 82\% TCOD and 78\% and 82\%
   TSS removal efficiencies from thin stillage and primary sludge
   respectively at very high organic and solids loading rates (OLR and SLR)
   of 29 kg COD/m(3) d and 9.5 kg COD/m(3) d and 10.5 kg TSS/m(3) d and
   10.3 kg TSS/m(3) d respectively at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.5
   and 4 days. Maximum methane production yields of up to 0.31 L-CH4/g(COD)
   and 0.25 L-CH4/g(COD) were achieved for thin stillage and primary sludge
   respectively corresponding to biogas production rate per reactor volume
   of 15.8 L-gas/L-reactor d and 1.22 L-CH4/L-reactor d. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A sol-gel method was employed to synthesize LiMn2O4 cathode for lithium
   ion batteries. Calcination treatment with citric acid results in the
   reduction of external active materials of the cathode, finally a novel
   layer coating of MnO was proposed on the surface of LiMn2O4. The
   structures and morphologies of the as-prepared samples were
   characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM and HRTEM techniques. It was found that
   the reaction between LiMn2O4 and citric acid derived carbon occurred
   during coating process, and the resultant layer was verified to be MnO
   uniformly coated onto the cathode. Electrochemical performances show
   that the amount of coating exhibits a significant effect on LiMn2O4
   performance, and the optimized MnO coating could exhibit improved
   battery performance of the LiMn2O4 cathode. The obtained improvement is
   attributed to decreased Mn dissolution into electrolyte upon cycling
   resulting from the MnO coating. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Modal synthesis representation of a neutronic kinetic model for a CANDU
   reactor core has been utilized in the analysis and synthesis for reactor
   control systems. Among all the mode shapes, the fundamental mode of the
   power distribution, which also coincides with the desired reactor power
   distribution during operation, is used in the control system design. The
   nonlinear modal models are linearized around desired operating points.
   Based on the linearized model, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control
   approach is used to synthesize a state feedback controller. The
   performance of this controller has been evaluated by using the original
   nonlinear models under load-following conditions. It has been
   demonstrated that the proposed reactor control system can produce more
   uniform power distribution than the traditional reactor regulation
   systems (RRS); in particular, it is more effective in compensating the
   Xenon induced transients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) into the
   subsurface has recently received significant attention as a potentially
   effective method for remediation of source zones of chlorinated solvents
   present as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPL). One of the challenges
   in the deployment of nZVI is to achieve good subsurface nZVI mobility to
   permit delivery of the nZVI to the target treatment zone. Stabilization
   of nZVI with various polymers has shown promise for enhancing nZVI
   subsurface mobility, but the impact of subsurface conditions on nZVI
   mobility has not been fully explored. In this study, the effect of humic
   acid and kaolinite on the transport of polymer-stabilized nZVI
   (carboxylmethyl cellulose-surface modified nZVI, CMC90K-RNIP) in sand
   was investigated using column experiments. In addition, effects of
   electrolytes on the stability of CMC90K-RNIP in the presence of humic
   acid, and the stability of humic add-coated reactive nanoscale iron
   particles (HA-RNIP) at various humic add concentrations were
   investigated. Humic acid enhanced the mobility of bare RNIP, whereas the
   transport of CMC90K-RNIP was not significantly affected by humic acid
   injected as a background solution, except at the highest concentration
   of 500 mg/L. At lower pore water velocity, the effect of humic acid on
   the transport of CMC90K-RNIP was greater than that at high water
   velocity. Adding kaolinite up to 2\% by weight to the sand column
   reduced the retention of CMC90K-RNIP, but further increases in kaolinite
   content (to 5\%) did not significantly affect nZVI retention. The impact
   of kaolinite on nZVI retention was more pronounced at lower pore water
   velocities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of graphene-polymer nanocomposites is of current interest due
   to their exceptionally physical and chemical properties. However, the
   ability to produce conductive inks/coatings retaining the properties of
   the graphene is still a major challenge. In this study, functionalized
   polydopamine-coated reduced graphene oxide (PDA/RGO) was reacted with a
   RAFT agent, 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid
   (DDMAT), to form macro-RAFT agents via an esterification reaction. The
   chemistry and kinetics of RAFT living/controlled polymerization of
   styrene was examined from the surface of these macro-RAFT agents to form
   polystyrene-grafted PDA/RGO (PS-g-PDA/RGO). By examination of the
   kinetics and GPC traces of the free and grafted polymer,
   living/controlled polymerization was confirmed. To examine the utility
   of this approach, the synthesized PS-g-PDA/RGO samples containing
   different amounts of grafted PS were employed in the preparation of
   graphene-PS nanocomposites by mixing them with commercial PS. Graphene
   was found to be well distributed in the PS matrix by this approach,
   increasing the decomposition temperature range. This research provides
   an efficient route towards the design and development of value-added
   functional graphene-PS composites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Calcium phosphate-based nanocomposites offer a unique solution toward
   producing scaffolds for orthopedic and dental implants. However, despite
   attractive bioactivity and biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite (HAp) has
   been limited in heavy load-bearing applications due to its intrinsically
   low mechanical strength. In this work, to improve the mechanical
   properties of HAp, we grew HAp nanoplates from the surface of
   one-dimensional titania nanorod structures by combining a
   coprecipitation and sol-gel methodology using supercritical fluid
   processing with carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). The effects of metal alkoxide
   concentration (1.1-1.5 mol/L), reaction temperature (60-80 degrees C),
   and pressure (6000-8000 psi) on the morphology, crystallinity, and
   surface area of the resulting nanostructured composites were examined
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
   Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method. Chemical composition of the products
   was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near-edge
   structure (XANES) analyses. HAp nanoplates and HAp-TiO2 nanocomposites
   were homogeneously mixed within poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) to
   develop scaffolds with enhanced physical and mechanical properties for
   bone regeneration. Mechanical behavior analysis demonstrated that the
   Young's and flexural moduli of the PCL/HAp-TiO2 composites were
   substantially higher than the PCL/HAp composites. Therefore, this new
   synthesis methodology in scCO(2) holds promise for bone tissue
   engineering with improved mechanical properties.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study is carried out to investigate the effects of
   uniaxial stretching on the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube
   (CNT)-polymer composites using a mixed micromechanics model, which
   incorporates two conductivity mechanisms: electron hopping and
   conductive networks. The uniaxial stretching induces volume expansion of
   the composites, re- orientation of CNTs and a change in conductive
   networks, which are characterized by the variation of the CNT
   concentration, the CNT orientation distribution function and the
   percolation threshold, respectively. Modelling results demonstrate that
   stretching decreases the electrical conductivity of the composite in
   both the longitudinal and transverse directions. It is also observed
   that stretching has more significant effects on the electrical
   conductivity of the composites with a lower CNT volume fraction.
   Furthermore, the effects of Poisson's ratio on the electrical
   conductivity are also investigated. Possible reasons for the observed
   phenomena are interpreted. This work can be claimed to provide a
   theoretical prediction on the trend of the stretching effects on the
   electrical properties of CNT- polymer composites.}},

   piezoelectric nanoplate due to surface effects and flexoelectricity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Due to large surface to volume ratio and manifest strain gradients
   typically present in nanostructures, it is essential to incorporate both
   surface effects and flexoelectricity in studying the size-dependent
   electromechanical coupling behaviors of piezoelectric materials at the
   nano-scale. In the current work, a modified Kirchhoff plate model with
   the consideration of residual surface stress, surface elasticity,
   surface piezoelectricity, and flexoelectricity is developed to
   investigate the electroelastic responses and vibrational behaviors of a
   bending piezoelectric nanoplate (PNP). The governing equations and the
   corresponding boundary conditions accounting for both the surface
   effects and the flexoelectricity are derived by the variational
   principle. Ritz approximate solutions of the static bending and the free
   vibration indicate that these nano-scale features are more prominent for
   thinner plates with smaller thickness. The simulation results also
   reveal that the influence of the flexoelectricity and the surface
   effects upon the bending behaviors of the PNP depends on the applied
   electrical loading and the plate dimensions. Moreover, it is also
   observed that the frequency tuning of PNP-based nanoresonators by
   adjusting applied electrical load can be modified by both the
   flexoelectricity and the surface effects. The current work is expected
   to provide increased understanding on the theoretical basis for the
   design and applications of PNP-based nanodevices. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Nanoclusters are prime objects of study in modern nanotechnology and
   offer a variety of applications promoted by their properties tunable by
   size, shape, and composition. DFT calculations are employed to analyze
   structure, stability, and selected electronic properties of a core-shell

   low-symmetry aluminum cluster is predicted to undergo a considerable
   reshaping and acquire a striking D-4h tetrakis-hexahedral geometry, with
   proportions controlled by a near-degenerate spin state or charge. The
   system also becomes more stable to dissociation. Surprisingly, other
   properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity do not change
   significantly, although still exhibit some interesting features
   including opposite variations for vertical and adiabatic values. The
   stability and property evolutions are analyzed in terms of contributions
   from reshaping of the shell and its further interaction with the core.
   The system thus has potential applications as a symmetric building unit

Abstract = {{The benefits of using kaolin as a source of aluminosilicate in zeolite
   synthesis to obtain lower-cost catalysts, adsorbents, or ion exchangers
   are widely known. Previous attempts to produce zeolite from natural
   Iranian kaolin resulted in the formation of zeolites A, X, and HS.
   Zeolite Y plays an important role in the petrochemical industry due to
   its application in the area of fluidized catalytic cracking; 40\% of
   gasoline production is obtained using this process.
   In the present study, different methods were used to prepare pure
   zeolite NaY from the Iranian kaolin available. The effects of different
   parameters such as aging time, crystallization time, kaolin calcination
   and crystallization temperature, and starting-material composition were
   investigated in order to obtain improved properties and maximize phase
   purity. In all cases, the crystal structure and microstructure were
   studied using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Among
   different synthesis approaohes, the `guide-agent method' resulted in the
   formation of zeolite NaY. The synthesis was generally sensitive to
   changes in kaolin calcination temperature and in hydrothermal synthesis
   parameters. The optimum parameters to prepare pure zeolite NaY were:
   kaolin calcination temperature = 680 degrees C, aging time of guide
   agent = 48 h without an overall gel aging step, and crystallization at
   90 degrees C for 36 h.}},

Abstract = {{Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol has shown
   environmental, economic and energetic advantages in comparison to
   bioethanol produced from sugar or starch. However, the pretreatment
   process for increasing the enzymatic accessibility and improving the
   digestibility of cellulose is hindered by many physical-chemical,
   structural and compositional factors, which make these materials
   difficult to be used as feedstocks for ethanol production. A wide range
   of pretreatment methods has been developed to alter or remove structural
   and compositional impediments to (enzymatic) hydrolysis over the last
   few decades; however, only a few of them can be used at commercial scale
   due to economic feasibility. This paper will give an overview of
   extrusion pretreatment for bioethanol production with a special focus on
   twin-screw extruders. An economic assessment of this pretreatment is
   also discussed to determine its feasibility for future industrial

Abstract = {{Probability plotting positions are popular and used as the basis for
   distribution fitting and for inspecting the quality of the fit because
   of its simplicity. The plotting positions that lead to excellent
   approximation to the mean of the order statistics should be used if the
   objective of the fitting is to estimate quantiles. Since the mean
   depends on the sample size and is not amenable for simple to use closed
   form solution, many plotting positions have been presented in the
   literature, including a new plotting position that is derived based on
   the weighted least-squares method. In this study, the accuracy of using
   the new plotting position to fit the Gumbel distribution for estimating
   quantiles is assessed. Also, plotting positions derived by fitting the
   mean of the order statistics for all ranks is proposed, and an
   approximation to the covariance of the order statistics for the Gumbel (
   and Weibull) variate is given. Relative bias and root-mean-square-error
   of the estimated quantiles by using the proposed plotting position are
   shown. The use of the proposed plotting position to estimate the
   quantiles of annual maximum wind speed is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{Truncated conical vessels are commonly used as liquid containers in
   elevated tanks. Despite the widespread use of this type of structure
   worldwide, no direct code provisions are currently available covering
   its seismic analysis and design. The purpose of the current study is to
   assess the importance of considering the vertical component of ground
   accelerations when analyzing and designing this type of water-storage
   structure. The study is conducted using an equivalent mechanical model
   that estimates the normal forces that develop in the tank walls when
   subjected to vertical excitation. In addition, a three-dimensional
   finite element model has been developed by modeling the walls of the
   tank using shell elements. The finite element model has been employed to
   predict maximum membrane and overall meridional stresses due to both
   hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressure distributions. Comparisons have
   been conducted to assess the significance of considering vertical
   excitation and to identify the magnification in meridional stresses due
   to bending effects associated with support conditions and large
   deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of the coherency of ground-motion records in two horizontal
   orthogonal directions at single or multiple stations is carried out
   using records from SMART-1 array for several seismic events in Taiwan.
   Empirical coherency function is suggested for the components of records

   multiple-recording stations. It was also found that the coherency for
   the records along the major and minor principal axes at a recording
   station is similar to that for two randomly oriented orthogonal
   directions. The spatial coherency and the spatial correlation of the
   records are used to establish a procedure for simulating bidirectional
   horizontal ground motions at multiple stations, considering that the
   stochastic point-source method or the stochastic finite-fault method can
   be used to define the reference Fourier amplitude spectra for scenario
   events. Use of the proposed procedure to simulate records is illustrated
   for a scenario seismic event; the adequacy of the simulated records in
   approximating the target spatial correlation and coherency is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The travelling wave instability in a channel with small-amplitude

   disturbance velocity field is always three-dimensional with disturbances

   destabilizes the flow if the groove wavenumber beta is larger than

   beta. It has been found that beta(tran) does not depend on the groove
   amplitude. The dependence of the critical Reynolds number on the groove
   amplitude and wavenumber has been determined Special attention has been
   paid to the drag-reducing long-wavelength grooves, including the optimal
   grooves. It has been demonstrated that such grooves slightly increase
   the critical Reynolds number, i.e. such grooves do not cause an early
   breakdown into turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of longitudinal grooves on the flow resistance in a channel
   where the flow is driven by movement of one of the walls and modified by
   a streamwise pressure gradient have been studied. The reducedorder
   geometrymodel has been used to extract geometric features that are
   hydraulically relevant. Three distinct zones leading to the reduced
   resistance have been identified, depending on the flow pressure gradient
   and the groove wave number. Two of these zones correspond to grooves
   with long wavelengths and one to grooves with short wavelengths.
   Optimization has been used to determine shapes that provide the largest
   flow rate. In the case of the long-wavelength grooves, the optimal
   shapes depend on the constraints. These shapes are well approximated by
   a certain universal trapezoid for grooves that have the same height and
   depth. There exists an optimum depth which, combined with the
   corresponding shape, defines the optimal geometry in the case of the
   unequal-depth grooves; this shape is well approximated by a Gaussian
   function. No optimal shape exists for the short-wavelength grooves if
   the groove amplitude is sufficiently small; the shortest admissible
   wavelength dominates system performance under such conditions. The most
   effective groove wave number does exist for higher grooves, but the
   optimal shape cannot be determined due to numerical limitations.}},

Title = {{Distribution of wind-driven rain deposition on low-rise buildings:

Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{Wind-driven rain (WDR) effects on various components of a building
   facade are dependent on the total volume of rainwater deposition. The
   total volume of WDR deposition at a specific location on the building
   facade has contributions from both directly impinging raindrops and
   accumulated surface runoff. The distribution of WDR deposition over the
   building surface is dependent on the nature of the storm and on the
   aerodynamic shape of the building. This paper presents an experimental
   study conducted to investigate the distribution of WDR deposition on the
   external facade of low-rise buildings. Two parameters that quantify the
   distribution of direct impinging raindrops and surface runoff rainwater
   over the building surface rain admittance factor (RAF) and surface
   runoff coefficient (SRC), respectively were measured separately under
   simulated WDR conditions. Test-based RAF and SRC datasets were developed
   for three types of building models (gable, flat, and hip-roof buildings)
   tested for various wind directions. Test results indicated a higher
   concentration of direct impinging raindrop deposition on windward
   vertical surfaces of the building when compared to the horizontal roof
   components. The test results also demonstrated that the leading edge!
   corner regions of the buildings received less volume surface runoff
   rainwater, and the rainwater accumulation increases toward the leeward
   surfaces. The test-based RAF and SRC data developed in this work may be
   used for estimation of WDR deposition on facades of low-rise buildings
   as well as Water intrusion through building envelope breaches, openings,
   and defects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the storm duration effects on

   piecewise-linear load-displacement curves for the
   roof-to-wall-connections. The model was validated against experimental
   data for a system of interconnected roof-to-wall-connections subjected
   to fluctuating wind loads. The validated model, subjected to fluctuating
   wind loads obtained from design storms of different durations along with
   the stochastically sampled connection parameters established from
   experiments, was used to estimate the probability of roof failures of a
   gable roof building. It was found that for ``design-level{''} storms
   with high winds over durations of 1-5 h, the probability of failure was
   increased by 15\% for the longer storm, even though the peak pressures
   were held constant for these storms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The wind loading of tall buildings in an urban environment is often
   greatly affected by aerodynamic interference resulting from the
   interaction of approaching wind with upstream and adjacent structures.
   Interference effects are not currently considered in wind loading codes,
   primarily due to the complexity of involved variables. Advice on
   building configurations which have the potential to generate problematic
   interference effects would be useful for structural engineers and urban
   planners. Wind tunnel tests were carried out to assess the interference
   effects associated with a single upstream building having identical
   height and geometry to the building of interest. The data are presented
   as interference factors (IFs) relating the loading and response under
   interference to that of an isolated building, and the underlying
   aerodynamic mechanisms are discussed. Contour plots are presented and
   discussed for IFs corresponding to: (i) the aerodynamic wind loading
   and; (ii) the peak response. The interference factors associated with
   the peak responses are useful for the identification of potential
   interference issues in the preliminary design or siting phase of a
   project. The results indicate that, depending on combinations of
   exposure and dynamic properties, the peak response IF may approach the
   same order as the partial wind load factor in some codes. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The flow over a low rise building has been investigated through
   synchronized pressure and velocity measurements. Peak suctions on the
   upper surface were investigated utilizing ensemble averages, conditioned
   on the peaks. Near the leading edge, it was found that the reattachment
   length scales with the size of the roof surface area over which the
   pressures are integrated, with small areas being associated with
   reattachment lengths that are significantly smaller than the mean.
   However, within the separation bubble, but further downstream, the
   dependence of the reattachment length with the size of the surface area
   is not significant. Peak suctions are associated with locally
   accelerated flow near the leading edge of the building, which scale with
   the size and location of the roof surface area over which the pressures
   are integrated. Quasi-steady theory under-predicts the peak suctions
   that would result from these locally accelerated flows. The scale of
   these accelerated flows is consistent with Melbourne's (1979) small
   scale turbulence parameter. As the instant of the peak suction on a
   small area near the leading edge is approached, the position of the
   separation bubble decreases in both length and height as suctions near
   the lead edge increase. Higher speed flow also emerges along the
   separated shear layer above the leading edge. After the peak suction the
   separation bubble grows and large suctions both decrease in magnitude
   and span a larger area, while high speed flows decrease in magnitude and
   become dispersed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{siRNA can downregulate the expression of specific genes. However,
   delivery to specific cells and tissues in vivo presents significant
   challenges. Modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been shown to protect
   siRNA and facilitate its entry into cells. However, simple and efficient
   methods to functionalize CNTs are needed. Here, noncovalent
   functionalization of CNTs is performed and shown to effectively deliver
   siRNA to target cells. Specifically, single-walled CNTs were
   functionalized by noncovalent association with a lipopolymer. The
   lipopolymer (DSPE-PEG) was composed of a phospholipid
   1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) and poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG). Three different ratios of polyethylenimine (PEI) to
   DSPE-PEG were synthesized and characterized and the products were used
   to disperse CNTs. The resulting materials were used for siRNA delivery
   in vitro and in vivo. The structural, biophysical, and biological
   properties of DGI/C and their complexes formed with siRNA were
   investigated. Cytotoxicity of the materials was low, and effective gene
   silencing in B16-F10 cells was demonstrated in vitro. In addition,
   significant uptake of siRNA as well as gene silencing in the liver was
   found following intravenous injection. This approach provides a new
   strategy for siRNA delivery and could provide insight for the
   development of noncovalently functionalized CNTs for siRNA therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow-bar micropile construction, also known as self-drilled, is
   becoming a popular option because it allows faster installation
   processes and ground improvement at the same time. This paper presents a
   field study and numerical investigation on the behaviour of single
   hollow-bar micropiles embedded in a stiff silty clay deposit. Four
   hollow-bar micropiles were installed using an air-flushing technique
   employing large drilling carbide bits. Five axial tests were conducted
   on the four micropiles, comprising three compression and two tension
   monotonic axial tests. The results of the field tests are presented and
   analyzed in terms of load-displacement curves. A two-dimensional
   axisymmetric finite element model (FEM) was created and calibrated using
   the field test results. The calibrated FEM was utilized to select an
   appropriate failure criterion for hollow-bar micropiles depending on the
   load-transfer mechanism of the micropiles. In addition, the model was
   employed to carry out a parametric study to investigate the effect of
   the installation methodology, hollow-bar micropile geometry, and shear
   strength of the surrounding soils on the micropile capacity. Based on
   the outcomes of the parametric study, an equation is proposed to
   estimate the axial capacity of hollow-bar micropiles in cohesive soils.}},

Abstract = {{The use of hollow-core bars in micropiles has greatly increased over the
   past 10 years. In this study, the group behaviour of hollow-bar
   micropiles is investigated. The research methodology encompasses a
   full-scale field study on single hollow-bar micropiles and pairs of
   micropiles installed in cohesive soils and numerical investigations
   using three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis. Four hollow-bar
   micropiles were installed in stiff silty clay deposit using large
   drilling carbide bits. Four axial monotonic tests on pairs of hollow-bar
   micropiles were conducted as part of the field study. The field test
   results were utilized to calibrate-verify a 3D finite element model
   (FEM). A parametric study was performed using the verified FEM to
   characterize capacity and performance of hollow-bar micropile groups.
   Group efficiency factors and interaction factors were established to
   evaluate the capacity and response of hollow-bar micropile groups under
   vertical loading. The results from the field tests and numerical
   investigations revealed that for hollow-bar micropiles, group efficiency
   factor, G(E), can be taken equal to 1. A method for calculating the
   group settlement utilizing the interaction factors approach is proposed
   and a family of interaction factor diagrams is established to evaluate
   the group settlement.}},

Title = {{AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy:
   Report of Task Group 192}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the last decade, there have been significant developments into
   integration of robots and automation tools with brachytherapy delivery
   systems. These systems aim to improve the current paradigm by executing
   higher precision and accuracy in seed placement, improving calculation
   of optimal seed locations, minimizing surgical trauma, and reducing
   radiation exposure to medical staff. Most of the applications of this
   technology have been in the implantation of seeds in patients with
   early-stage prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the techniques apply to any
   clinical site where interstitial brachytherapy is appropriate. In
   consideration of the rapid developments in this area, the American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) commissioned Task Group 192
   to review the state-of-the-art in the field of robotic interstitial
   brachytherapy. This is a joint Task Group with the Groupe Europeen de
   Curietherapie-European Society for Radiotherapy \& Oncology (GEC-ESTRO).
   All developed and reported robotic brachytherapy systems were reviewed.
   Commissioning and quality assurance procedures for the safe and
   consistent use of these systems are also provided. Manual seed placement
   techniques with a rigid template have an estimated in vivo accuracy of
   3-6 mm. In addition to the placement accuracy, factors such as tissue
   deformation, needle deviation, and edema may result in a delivered dose
   distribution that differs from the preimplant or intraoperative plan.
   However, real-time needle tracking and seed identification for dynamic
   updating of dosimetry may improve the quality of seed implantation. The
   AAPM and GEC-ESTRO recommend that robotic systems should demonstrate a
   spatial accuracy of seed placement <= 1.0 mm in a phantom. This
   recommendation is based on the current performance of existing robotic
   brachytherapy systems and propagation of uncertainties. During clinical
   commissioning, tests should be conducted to ensure that this level of
   accuracy is achieved. These tests should mimic the real operating
   procedure as closely as possible. Additional recommendations on robotic
   brachytherapy systems include display of the operational state;
   capability of manual override; documented policies for independent check
   and data verification; intuitive interface displaying the implantation
   plan and visualization of needle positions and seed locations relative
   to the target anatomy; needle insertion in a sequential order;
   robot-clinician and robot-patient interactions robustness, reliability,
   and safety while delivering the correct dose at the correct site for the
   correct patient; avoidance of excessive force on radioactive sources;
   delivery confirmation of the required number or position of seeds;
   incorporation of a collision avoidance system; system cleaning,
   decontamination, and sterilization procedures. These recommendations are
   applicable to end users and manufacturers of robotic brachytherapy
   systems. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new directional comparison-based internal/external
   fault detection and discrimination technique for the protection of all
   commonly used phase-shifting transformer (PST) types. Similar to
   traditional differential protection, the proposed solution offers
   features, such as speed and selectivity. However, unlike PST
   differential techniques, the proposed technique offers great
   reliability. It provides secure operation during conditions, such as
   current-transformer (CT) saturation, magnetizing inrush current, core
   saturation, any mismatch between CTs and zero-sequence current, etc.
   Moreover, unlike the differential solutions, the proposed technique
   solves the problem of nonstandard varying phase shift without tracking
   the tap-changer position. Performance evaluation of the proposed
   technique shows that it provides the best overall protection solution
   for commonly used single/two-core symmetrical/asymmetrical PSTs. This
   paper also addresses and solves various challenges that can influence
   the overall performance of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Although spindle-and kinetochore-associated protein 1 (Ska1) has
   previously been identified as essential for proper chromosome
   segregation, it is unknown whether it plays a role in tumour
   development. Here, we report that Ska1 over-expression promotes prostate
   tumourigenesis. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis
   revealed that Ska1 was over-expressed in human prostatic
   intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN), the most likely prostate cancer
   precursor, and adenocarcinomas. Up-regulation of Ska1 protein was also
   found to be tumour-specific in breast, lung and other common human
   cancers. Importantly, prostate-specific up-regulation of Ska1 in a
   transgenic mouse model resulted in spontaneous tumourigenesis.
   Furthermore, in addition to its abundance in spindle microtubules and
   the outer kinetochore interface during mitosis, Ska1 was enriched at
   centrosomes in cultured cells. Depletion of Ska1 caused a failure of
   centrosome duplication, whilst Ska1 over-expression led to centrosome
   amplification in human prostate epithelial cells via the induction of
   centriole over-duplication. These epithelial cells harbouring extra
   centrosomes switched from a non-tumourigenic to a tumourigenic state in
   nude mice. Taken together, these data indicate that Ska1 over-expression
   promotes tumourigenesis. Copyright (c) 2014 Pathological Society of

Abstract = {{In this study, a central composite design and response surface
   methodology were used to study the effect of various enzymatic
   hydrolysis variables (temperature, pH, substrate concentration and
   enzyme loading) on the enzymatic hydrolysis of Jerusalem
   artichoke-derived inulin. It was found that a quadratic model was able
   to predict inulin conversion as a function of all four investigated
   factors. The model was confirmed through additional experiments and via
   analysis of variance (ANOVA). Subsequently, numerical optimization was
   used to maximize the inulin conversion (94.5\%) of Jerusalem artichoke
   powder within the experimental range (temperature of 48 degrees C, pH of
   4.8, substrate concentration of 60 g l(-1), and enzyme loading of 10
   units a g(substrate)(-1) for 24 h). The enzymatic hydrolyzate of
   Jerusalem artichoke was fermented via solventogenic clostridia to
   acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE). An ABE yield of 0.33 g(Solvent)
   g(sugar)(-1) and an overall fermentation productivity of 0.25 g l(-1)
   h(-1) were obtained indicating the suitability of this feedstock for
   fermentative ABE production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, delays in data acquisition, conversion, and transmission
   of measurements in Foundation Fieldbus channels are analyzed in detail.
   The bounds for these delays are established. For measurements used in
   open-loop applications (e.g. monitoring), proper time calibration of the
   received signals should be made to consider the delays. However, if the
   measurements are intended for feedback control purposes, appropriate
   compensation schemes have to be used to reduce the effects of the
   delays. Thus, for feedback control, sources of delay for a Foundation
   Fieldbus (FF) H1 network and DeltaV Distributed Control System (DCS) are
   identified and analyzed. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme is
   developed to compensate the delays. The effectiveness of the proposed
   scheme is demonstrated on a test bench consisting of industrial grade FF
   H1 devices and a controller under different network parameter
   configuration (hence, different delays). It is demonstrated that the MPC
   is a viable solution to compensate network induced delays in industrial
   control systems.}},
